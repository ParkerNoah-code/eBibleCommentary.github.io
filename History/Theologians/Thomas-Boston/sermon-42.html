          Deuteronomy 5:29, "O that there were such an heart in them, that they
          would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be
          well with them and with their children forever."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THAT dreadful appearance which God made on mount Sinai, in the giving
          of the law, and that effect it had upon the Israelites, Moses here
          puts them in mind of. When the Lord spoke with a great and terrible
          voice out of the darkness and fire, the people were affrighted, and
          they see their absolute need of a mediator, and therefore desire Moses
          would mediate between God and them; and in this event they promise all
          obedience. The Lord gives his verdict concerning this, which consists
          of two parts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That the words were very good. If words could have proved them
          saints, they would have been among the foremost. If promises could
          have passed for performances, they had wanted neither faith nor good
          works; verse 28, "They have well said all that they have spoken." They
          have said two things;
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) They had desired a mediator, verse 27, "Go you near," said they
          to Moses, "and hear all that the Lord our God shall say; and speak you
          unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto you, and we will
          hear it and do it." They saw so much of the majesty of God, and of
          their own sinfulness, that they beg of God he would not deal with them
          immediately, but by a mediator; and this was the great end in giving
          the law on mount Sinai, and that with so much terror, Deuteronomy
          18:15–18.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) They promised obedience, that they would take the law out of
          Moses' mouth, and perform it; that they would no less highly esteem it
          as coming by his hand, than if God should thunder it with the greatest
          terror into their ears. What could look liker faith and obedience,
          according to the Old Testament dispensation? What could look liker
          accepting of the great Mediator in all his offices, according to that
          dispensation of the covenant, wherein types and figures of him who was
          to come did so much abound? How ready seem they to sit down at the
          feet of a prophet and learn? So that upon this the Lord promised
          Christ under that very notion, Deuteronomy 18:18. How plainly do they
          take with guilt, and stand as criminals who have nothing to say on
          their own defense, acknowledge their need, and profess their desire of
          an intercessor, being unable to stand before the Lord without a
          shelter, or on their own legs. How readily do they subject themselves
          to the laws of their King, and stoop to take on his yoke without any
          exception whatever? But all is not gold that glitters, the heart of
          man seldom holds foot with the tongue.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The other part of the verdict follows in the text; "O that there
          were such an heart in them!" By which he discovers their hypocrisy,
          and precipitancy, their tongues running before their hearts in their
          engaging themselves to the Lord. The Lord speaks thus after the manner
          of men, so that they who would hence conclude, that man's will by
          nature is such, as that it is of himself flexible, either to spiritual
          good or evil, while the Lord stands by as an idle spectator, and puts
          to no hand of power, may as well conclude, that God has eyes and hands
          of flesh, and that he who is not the son of Man that he should repent,
          and with whom there is no variableness, may even with propriety repent
          as to what he has done. Inefficacious wishing, properly understood,
          argues imperfection. (Hebrew, who will give their heart to be such in
          them?) Now, it is certain, God can give such a heart; Ezekiel 36:26,
          "A new heart also will I give you." And if he will do it, who can
          hinder him? Job 11:10.—This declaration therefore imports,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) That such an heart was not in them, for all their fair words and
          high pretenses; that though they looked well outwardly, yet within
          they were naught. They had learned to speak better than they were
          accustomed; but though they had got the new tongue, they had but the
          old heart still; Deuteronomy 29:4, "Yet the Lord has not given you a
          heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day."
          When they were in Egypt, they were sunk into stupidity, the
          instructions of the patriarchs had worn out of their minds, they had
          almost forgotten their fall in Adam, and what sin was; and though God
          had made the promise to Abraham, yet they were now grown proud and
          secure. And though sin, and also death, were reigning over them, yet
          being without the law, to evidence sin and death to their consciences,
          they would not charge themselves with it, and so found no need of a
          Mediator, Romans 5:13–20. But now the law being proclaimed with so
          great terror, laid their peacock-feathers a little; but though they
          had more knowledge of their sin and misery than before, yet they had
          still the old heart. This declaration imports,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) That such an heart should have been in them, it was their duty to
          have it, God required it of them: "Make to yourselves a new heart."
          God requires the conformity of the heart, as well as of the
          conversation, to his will. It imports,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) That the want of such an heart was a dead fly in all their
          engagements, which made all the ointment to stink; "O that there were
          such an heart in them!" The chief thing is wanting still, they have
          not yet brought up their heart to their work. It imports,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) The great excellency and worth of such an heart. The Lord speaks
          honorably of it, as that which would bear weight in the balance of the
          sanctuary. It is pleasing to the Lord, it is God's delight; they want
          only this to make them happy. For illustrating this subject, we shall
          propose and consider the following doctrines.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. That men often make what ought to be the most solemn
          transactions with the Lord about their souls' concerns, but solemn
          trifling with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. That a heart sincerely and suitably corresponding with
          the profession of a covenanting people, is a most valuable and
          excellent thing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE III. That the work of covenanting with the Lord is slight
          work, when it is not heart work. Or, in other words, solemn
          covenanting with the Lord is but solemn trifling with him, when the
          work of covenanting is not heart work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">We begin with</p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. That men often make what ought to be the most solemn
          transactions with the Lord about their souls' concerns, but solemn
          trifling with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Never was there a more solemn transaction which men had with God than
          what was here. Their ears were filled with the noise of the thunder,
          the lightnings flashed in their eyes, they heard God himself speak,
          they were most express in covenanting with God; all this time their
          hearts were not right with him, nor sound in his statutes. In
          discoursing from this doctrine, we propose,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show how far a man may go in transacting with, and engaging
          himself to the Lord, and yet after all he may be but trifling.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Show wherein this trifling and slight work in such a weighty
          business does appear.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Point out how people come to turn such solemn work into mere
          trifling.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Apply the subject.</p>
        <p align="justify">We are, then,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show how far a man may go in transacting with, and engaging
          himself to the Lord, and yet after all he may be but trifling. Upon
          this head we observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That a person may formally and expressly covenant with God, to be
          the Lord's, and yet after all be but trifling with God. So did this
          people, verse 27, (quoted above). A person may make a covenant with
          God, both by word and writ, when there is no such heart in him, and
          the heart goes not along either with tongue or pen. It is an easy
          thing to say unto the Lord, that he shall be our God, but not easy to
          say it with the heart. The tongue is not always a faithful interpreter
          of the heart, especially in these things.—We observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That a person may make a very full covenant with the Lord, and yet
          after all be but trifling. What exception was there in this, verse 27,
          "All that the Lord our God shall speak unto you, we will hear it and
          do it." How large a promise was this, Matthew 8:19, "Master, I will
          follow you wherever you go." No doubt, had their hearts kept pace with
          their words, they had engaged to purpose. Had there been as few secret
          as there were open reserves, they had dealt honestly.—We observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That persons may even be morally serious in all this, thinking and
          resolving in the time to do as they say. It was not a season for gross
          dissimulation, nor to make a jest of transacting with the Lord anent
          soul-concerns, when the Lord was speaking out of the darkness and fire
          to them. Persons in this case are like those who trifle with
          merchants, in offering to bargain for their wares, out of mere
          simplicity and ignorance as to the worth of these wares, who, if they
          had matters set in their due light, would never once propose again so
          to bid for them. The foolish virgins saw not their lamps out until it
          was past time.—We observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. That persons may do all this from a sense of their need of a
          Mediator. Thus did they in the text. What was it that brought this
          people to this? Why, they had formerly engaged with a whole heart to
          be the Lord's: Exodus 19:8, "And all the people answered together, and
          said, All that the Lord has spoken, we will do." But now they fall
          more solemnly and seriously to work. God sets the mountain on fire for
          a tribunal of justice; there is a trumpet whose voice waxes louder and
          louder; by all which God does, as it were, summon them to appear
          before him. There are dreadful thunderclaps to carry the sentence of
          death to their hearts; there are lightnings, by the glancings of which
          they read the wrath of God against sinners. Yet they must not touch
          the mountain, lest they be consumed, to teach them how sin had laid
          the bar as to access to God. This fills them with terror and fear of
          death, and now they feel the necessity of a mediator; Exodus 20:19,
          "And they said unto Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear; but
          let not God speak with us, lest we die." And yet, after all, "O that
          there were such an heart in them!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">We are now,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show wherein this trifling and slight work in such a weighty
          business does appear.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) It appears in persons engaging themselves to the Lord, without
          being at pains to prepare themselves, and bring up their hearts to the
          duty. O what a light thing do most people make of covenanting with
          God! It is but the saying of a word in prayer; and this is soon said.
          It is but taking the sacrament; and this is soon done. In the
          meantime, the heart, like Abraham's donkey, is left at the foot of the
          hill; Genesis 22:5, Matthew 15:8, "This people draws near unto me with
          their month, and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far
          from me." They are strangers to God who are strangers to heart-work.
          They who find no difficulty in bringing their hearts to duties, do not
          bring them to them at all. The true Christian finds much difficulty in
          this. "I find," says Paul, "a law that when I would do good, evil is
          present with me." It is but trifling to give the hand to the Lord,
          while the heart is far from any due concern about the business, and
          from that solemn seriousness requisite to get it rightly managed. This
          appears,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) When people engage themselves to the service of the Lord, but do
          not give their hearts to him. Many engage with the Lord, as a married
          servant with a master; the master is to get his service, but another
          has his heart; Jeremiah 12:2, "You are near in their mouth, and far
          from their reins." The heart may remain glued to lusts, while the soul
          pretends to be engaging itself to the Lord; and if it were not so,
          there would not be such a sad account of many who covenant with God.
          This is but to trifle with God, who requires the heart, or nothing;
          Proverbs 23:26, "My son, give me your heart." Jeremiah 30:21, "For who
          is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? says the Lord." It
          is an ill-made second marriage, when there is neither the death of,
          nor a divorce from the first husband. There is no right engaging with
          the Lord, but where the soul forsakes all others for him, and the
          heart takes up its eternal rest in Christ. This trifling appears,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) When people have any secret reserves in their closing with
          Christ, as is the case when the heart is not well content to take
          Christ with whatever may follow this choice: Luke 14:26, "If any man
          come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and
          children, and brethren, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he
          cannot be my disciple." There is none make right work here, but those
          who, weighing all things, are content to put a blank in Christ's hand,
          saying, "Lord, what would you have me to do?" Acts 9:6. They do but
          trifle who have their right hand sins which they wish not cut off, for
          they will in this case mar the bargain; and also those who cannot
          digest that tribulation which is in the way to the kingdom. No cross,
          no crown. That heart which is not reconciled to the cross, is not such
          an heart as is required. This trifling appears,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) When people overlook the Mediator in their covenant of peace with
          God, but transact with God for peace and pardon without respect to the
          sin-atoning blood of Christ. It is natural to all men to come
          immediately to God without a Mediator; Exodus 19:8, "And all the
          people answered together, and said, All that the Lord has spoken, we
          will do." They are thus for coming without a Mediator, until the
          terror of God correct their rashness, and they see what a consuming
          fire God is, and that, if they would be safe, they must come to him
          under the covert of Christ's wings. If a soul sincerely desires to
          come to God, the first person to which they must go, is to Christ, the
          secretary of Heaven. For "by him we have access into that grace
          wherein we stand," Romans 5:2. And he is "the Mediator of the new
          covenant," Hebrews 12:24. God out of Christ is a consuming fire. But
          there are beasts that will touch the mountain, though they be thrust
          through with a dart. Would you transact with God a covenant of
          reconciliation? then go to him on the mercy-seat? not the seat of
          mercy merely for mercy's sake, such a mercy-seat has no being in
          Heaven, but only in the vain imaginations of men on earth; but to the
          mercy-seat for Christ's sake, where mercy is abundantly distributed
          with the cordial consent of justice: 2 Corinthians 5:19. "To wit, that
          God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing
          their trespasses unto them." It is to God as veiled with flesh, that
          the guilty can only approach; otherwise it is but trifling. For Jesus
          is "the way, and no man comes to the Father but by him," John 14:6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) This is turned into solemn trifling with God, by people's not
          taking Christ for all, but only for making up that of which they may
          come short; thus endeavoring to patch up a garment of their own
          righteousness and of his together. Thus many think to please God by
          doing what they can to fulfill the law, and looking to Christ to make
          up that of which they come short. It was forbidden, under the law, to
          wear a garment of divers sorts of woollen and liuen together. And they
          will find themselves befooled, who will adventure their salvation on
          this party-colored garment: Galatians 3:12, "And the law is not of
          faith; but the man that does them shall live in them." A garment
          pieced up of sundry sorts of righteousness, is not meet for the court
          of Heaven. That heart which would share the glory between Christ and
          the man himself, is not right with God, and will be left to its own
          weight.—This trifling appears,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (6.) By persons making a covenant of works with Christ; the tenor
          thereof is, that if Christ will save their souls, they shall serve him
          as long as they live. If Christ will give them wages, they will give
          him work. If he will pay their debt, they shall be his servants, while
          they have breath in them. And upon this, men may take the sacrament to
          bind them the faster. And thus, I fear, many make sad work at
          sacraments and other ordinances. That this is but solemn trifling with
          God, appears, if you consider, that this is a covenant which has no
          warrant in the Word of God, and therefore Christ will never set his
          seal to it, though we should seal it with our blood. It is quite
          opposite to the covenant of grace; the design of which is to draw the
          sinner into the debt of free grace, and to set the crown only on
          Christ's head, Romans 4:14–16, and 11:6. The covenant of grace, is an
          everlasting covenant; once in, never out: Isaiah 55:3, "I will make an
          everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David." But
          this is a tottering covenant, broken every day. This is a servile
          covenant, to give Christ service for salvation. The other is a filial
          covenant, where the soul takes Christ and salvation freely offered,
          and so is a son: "For to as many as believed on him, to them gave he
          power to become the sons of God, John, 1:11. Therefore, they do not
          serve, that they may get the inheritance; but because the inheritance
          is theirs, therefore they serve, Galatians 4:24. and downwards. To
          take hold of God's covenant, is for a poor empty-handed sinner to come
          and live freely on Christ; this is to come and buy from him. In order
          to bring this charge home, I shall mention some evidences of the above
          practice.—Such as,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Persons looking upon, and making use of the sacrament only as
          seals of their vows, and not as seals of God's promises. I do not say
          but the sacrament is a seal, to seal our engagement to be the Lord's;
          but this is but the one half, and even the least half as I take it, 1
          Corinthians 10:16. Why then do people so overlook this, but because,
          not being shaken out of themselves, they look more to the confirming
          of their resolutions, than their faith and communion with Christ in
          his fullness?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) A second evidence is, persons coming to the Lord in this
          ordinance, rather to engage themselves to duties, than to get strength
          for the performance of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) A third evidence is, persons drawing their peace and comfort
          rather from their duties, and the performance of that to which they
          have engaged, than what Christ makes over to sinners in the covenant
          of grace. It was not so with David, for the covenant itself was all
          his salvation, and all his desire, 2 Samuel 23:5. But when the other
          works, he expects his wages; when he fails, he has no hope, as one who
          has broken covenant with Christ. But, when the true covenanter fails
          in his duty, yet all that his soul depended upon still remains a
          covenanted righteousness; all that he trusted to for his duties also
          remains, to wit, covenanted strength, Romans 7:24, 25, and 8:1. And so
          there is new application for covenant-benefits; whereas when many fail
          in their covenant, all is gone, and it must be made over again, before
          he can have any new footing. This trifling appears, when,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Persons lay hold on Christ with a faith of which the mighty power
          of God was not at the forming, Ephesians 1:19; but is merely the
          product of a person's natural faculties. Most men's faith is like wild
          oats, that grow up without the labor of the gardener. They come too
          easily to it to make any sure work by it. The evil heart of unbelief
          is not so easily shaken off as men imagine. Those who find no
          difficulty, do but trifle and beat the air; if the work were heartily
          plied, it would not be so easy. We now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To inquire how people come to turn such solemn work into
          trifling. They do so,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because they have no due consideration of the worth and
          preciousness of their souls, they do not suitably value the great
          salvation; Matthew 22:5, "But they made light of it, and went their
          ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise." Men will not
          trifle in matters which appear to them of great concern. But men who
          do not duly value their souls will venture them on they know not what.
          But who considers eternity, and the weight which lies on the soul's
          transacting with God? If men had eternity in their eye, and were
          transacting as for eternity, communicating for eternity, they would
          act in another manner, and not thus trifle in so important a business.
          They do so,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because they know not what a God they have to do with, they think
          that he is altogether such a one as themselves, Psalm 50:21. Men
          transact in their duties with they know not whom, and therefore they
          know not what; Joshua 24:19, "And Joshua said unto the people, You
          cannot serve the Lord; for he is a holy God, he is a jealous God, he
          will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins." When people have
          mean thoughts of God, they are ready to think any little thing may
          serve him. They thus trifle,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because they know not their own hearts, and their deceits; Jeremiah
          17:9, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
          wicked; who can know it? There are many secret biases there, to which
          they do not advert. Men may be hypocrites, and not know themselves to
          be such. The heart has a depth of deceit, which is not easy to fathom,
          which will make men say, with Saul, I have performed the commandment
          of the Lord, while, after all, the bleating of the sheep will discover
          the deceit. They thus trifle,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because sin has never been made bitter enough to them. It is hard
          to wean us from the love of lusts, if the breasts of them be not laid
          over with gall and wormwood. We must dig deep, and build upon the
          rock. Where the fallow ground is not plowed up, there will be a sowing
          among thorns, Jeremiah 4:3. The consent of many to take Christ, such
          as it is, is too lightly win to be solid.—They thus trifle,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Because they are hasty and indeliberate in their engaging. They
          fall a-building before they count the cost, Matthew 14:25; what is
          rashly done, is but slightly done in this matter. He that would make
          sure work, must lay his account beforehand with what he may meet with
          in the Lord's way. Then, meet with what they will, they will not be
          offended.—They thus trifle,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Because they have never got a sufficient discovery of their own
          utter weakness and insufficiency. They think they have a stock, and
          therefore may trade with it, and are very ready to undertake, though
          their heart will certainly misgive in the performance. This is
          building on the old foundation of nature; whereas, there will never be
          sure work, until this foundation be razed. If any man will come after
          Jesus, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow him. It
          only remains that,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. We make some application. This doctrine may help us to see the
          reason why so many return with the dog to his vomit. There is an error
          in the first concoction. That you may beware of this, we would exhort
          you, to make sure work in your transacting with the Lord. O do not
          trifle in so important a concern! To guard you effectually against
          this, consider the following things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Consider, this is to put, so far as you can, a solemn cheat on the
          great God: Galatians 6:7, "Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for
          whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap." It is a dangerous thing
          to mock God. His all-seeing eye knows how you deal with him, and can
          penetrate through all your pretenses. Consider.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is to put a solemn cheat on your own souls; you thus deceive
          your own souls. If you trifle with God, you will find at length a sad
          disappointment; Isaiah 50:11, "Behold, all you that kindle a fire,
          that compass yourselves about with sparks; walk in the light of your
          fire, and in the sparks that you have kindled. This shall you have of
          mine hand; you shall lie down in sorrow." As you sow, you will reap.
          Sow the wind of hypocrisy, and you will reap the whirlwind of wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Consider the weight of the matter; the salvation or damnation of
          the soul is no small business; if you manage it right, you may get
          your salvation sealed; if not, see Luke 14:24, "For I say unto you,
          that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my supper."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Consider, if you thus trifle with God in this matter, you will be
          discovered. The man without the wedding-garment was soon found out.
          You will not hold right to the end; you will return to the vomit; your
          latter end will be worse than your beginning. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. That you have a deceitful heart; it is necessary to be sure with
          it; it will soon give you the slip, and break the bonds, if they be
          slightly put on. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, If you make sure work, you will find the eternal advantage of
          it. All the blessings of the covenant will be your portion. You may
          get a feast; "To this man will I look, says the Lord, who is of an
          humble and contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall close with the following short DIRECTIONS—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Set about the work of self-examination. Inquire particularly at your
          hearts, whether they be willing to take Christ, and renounce all other
          lovers, and to take him wholly, only, and everlastingly. Pray that God
          may examine you, and discover yourselves to yourselves; lay yourselves
          open to self-searching. Lastly, Put your hearts into the Lord's hand,
          as sensible that in yours they will miscarry. "Commit your way unto
          the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass."
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
        <p align="justify">
          YOU have been this day avouching the Lord to be your God. You have all
          had an offer of Christ, and there was none heard tell of protesting
          against him; nay, did not your hearts say within you, Even so I take
          him? Many of you have, before angels and men, sealed a covenant with
          him this day, and we may report to the Lord, that you have said you
          are content to be his. O that there were such an heart in you, all
          would be well!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Having, in the preceding discourse, offered all that we intend from
          the first doctrine, we now proceed to
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. That a heart sincerely and suitably corresponding with
          the profession of a covenanting people, is a most valuable and
          excellent thing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Here I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. Show what a heart such a heart is.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Make it appear, that such a heart is a most valuable thing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. We are to show what a heart such a heart is; and on this head, the
          particulars shall be mostly taken out of the context. We observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That such an heart is a heart that has got a view of the majesty
          and glorious perfections of that God with whom we have to do:
          Deuteronomy 5:24, "And he said, Behold the Lord our God has showed us
          his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the
          midst of the fire; we have seen this day that God does talk with man,
          and he lives." The eye saw this; all would have been right, if the
          glory of the Lord had thus shined in their hearts. An unenlightened
          heart in the knowledge of the Lord looks so like Hell, and unlike
          Heaven, that it cannot be such a heart. A dark heart will make a dark
          confused conversation. There is no right worshiping of an unknown God.
          This view of the Lord's glory is necessary. Moses desired it, Exodus
          33; and all get it in a greater or less degree: 2 Corinthians 3:18,
          "But we all beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed
          into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
          Lord." If you have seen the King in his glory, and his train filling
          the temple, it is a token of good. But, alas! many see the chair of
          state, who behold not the King sitting in it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a heart filled with the fear of God. "O that there were such
          a heart in them, that they would fear me." Indeed they professed it,
          and they had a tolerably sufficient measure of it, had it been but of
          the right stamp, and had it got leave to have soaked kindly into their
          hearts. But, alas! it was only like a shower of rain, violent in the
          time, but wetting only the surface of the ground, and soon dried up.
          But O for such a heart as would fear always! not with-a slavish
          distrustful fear, but a filial reverential fear, a fear of
          circumspection. Such a heart as would keep the eye upon the majesty of
          the Lord, would promise to keep right: Hebrews 12:28, "Wherefore, we
          receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby
          we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear." A heart
          wanting this, will be like an unruly horse without a bridle; Proverbs
          25:28, "He who has no rule over his own spirit, is like a city that is
          broken down, and without walls."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is a humble heart. O how humble did they seem to be now under
          the sense of their own sinfulness, and the holiness of that God with
          whom they had to do! A heart humbled indeed is a valuable blessing.
          When Christ lances the swelling of the heart, and lets out the filthy
          stuff of pride and self-conceit, makes the man low in his own eyes, he
          is even preparing a house for himself on earth; for the Lord "dwells
          with him who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the heart
          of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones," Isaiah
          57:15. They dared not go near the mountain to touch it, they looked as
          they would rather have rolled themselves among the dust of the Lord's
          feet. "O that there were such an heart in them!" The honest heart is
          shaken out of self-confidence, for a right sight of the Lord in his
          glory, and of our own vileness, go always together; Isaiah 6:5, "Then
          said I, Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean
          lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine
          eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It is a heart filled with wonder at the goodness of God, his
          condescension and patience towards sinners, verses 24 and 26. That
          soul will wonder that God should ever have come in speaking-terms with
          vile man; that ever anything should have proceeded out of his mouth,
          but arrows dipped in the vinegar of the curse, to have slain the
          traitors outright. And will God thus indeed deal with man? It will be
          the wonder of that soul, that God has not consumed it, mingled its
          blood with its sacrifices, struck it dead at the communion-table. O
          how wonderful that they should have spoke with the Lord, and are yet
          alive!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. It is a heart convinced of the need of a Mediator, and resolved to
          employ him in all causes between God and them, verse 27. It is not
          every one that sees their need of Christ, and their need of an
          Advocate to go between God and them. But he who has such a heart will
          look on himself, in himself, as dry stubble, as he looks on God as a
          consuming fire; and all his own duties and attainments as a wall of
          dry boards which will not keep the fire from him, but increase it, and
          desire to have Christ between them and a holy God, as a crystal wall,
          which may let through the light, but not the flames of that fire. His
          very name will be precious to that heart, for it is "as ointment
          poured forth," Song 1:3. How sweet is the name of a Redeemer to a
          captive, and to a humbled sinner, one who may lay his hands on both!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. It is a heart taking the Lord only for their God. They professed
          they would have no more to do with idols, though it was not long
          before their hearts turned to their old bias: Exodus 32:8, "They have
          turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them, they have
          made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed
          thereunto, and said, These be your gods, O Israel, which have brought
          you up out of the land of Egypt." But such a heart renounces all other
          lovers, gives Christ's rivals their leave, and halts no more between
          two opinions. If you would be perfect, sell all, that is, part with
          all but Christ. When a man gets such a heart, there is an
          extraordinary uproar made in the soul; when it enters the man's
          breast, Satan cries as these, "They that turn the world up-side down,
          are come hither also." There is a strange overturning of thrones
          there. As when Christ and the gospel came into the world, the world,
          which before was wholly given to idolatry, then made great
          reformation; oracles were struck dumb, idols were cast to the moles
          and to the bats; so when the man gets such a heart, down goes the
          clay-God, the world, and Christ mounts the throne; neither back nor
          belly must be gods longer to the man, king self loses his crown, which
          is put upon the head of Christ, and free grace. The heart, which was
          divided among many lusts before, enters now on Jesus, the beauty of
          the Upper house.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. It is a heart for the Lord's work, verse 27. It is a heart which
          inclines the man who has taken Christ's enlisting money to fight his
          battles; which willingly stoops to the yoke of Christ's commandments,
          and is set to walk in the way of obedience. It is a heart reconciled
          to the law of God; the soul being married to Christ, may not be
          barren, but must bring forth fruit unto God. When the Lord charges the
          heart, the bullock is tamed, and accustomed to the yoke. To be more
          particular here, we observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) That it is a heart for universal obedience, verse 27. It wishes
          to neglect none of God's commands, but to have respect to them all,
          Psalm 119:6. When the heart is straight, it makes the conversation
          uniform. The Lord's stamp on every duty recommends it to the care of
          such a heart. The heart naturally is like some servants who promise to
          do all at the bargain-making, but fail in the accomplishment, like the
          sluggard who will not plow because of the cold. But such a heart puts
          a blank in the Lord's hand, and makes no exceptions. Some sins lie
          nearer the heart than others, some a right eye, some but a left toe.
          The right eye must be plucked out; you must put to your own hand to
          this hard work, it must be with your own consent. Amen, says such a
          heart; let bosom-lusts yield to Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) It is a heart for constant obedience. They limit no time. Compare
          the text with John 8:31, "Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed
          on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed."
          We have a sad account of Rehoboam, 2 Chronicles 12:1, "When he was
          established in the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook
          the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him." He was like many men,
          who make use of religion like a net, who, when they have caught their
          prey, fold up and lay by their net. But see the fountain of his
          apostasy, verse 14, "And he did evil, because he prepared not his
          heart to seek the Lord;" prepared or fixed, or established not his
          heart. But such an heart is for following the Lamb wherever he goes,
          in foul and fair weather, and will abide with Christ in a storm when
          the summer vermin is not to be seen: Psalm 19:9, "The fear of the Lord
          is clean, enduring forever." Trees planted in God's vineyard, watered
          by his grace, having such a heart, are not like common trees, green
          only one while of the year, but those are ever green, and are yielding
          their fruit in their season, Psalm 7:3. Such an heart takes with the
          stock, and so lives by its sap.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) It is a heart resolute in obedience. We will do it, say they,
          stand in the way what will. See the portraiture of such a heart, Micah
          4:5, "For all people will walk every one in the name of his God, and
          we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever." Such a
          heart had Caleband Joshua, they followed the Lord fully. It made them
          row against the stream. It gives the man courage for the arduous
          enterprise. Heaven is sweet in the eyes of all; why then do so many go
          to Hell? why, they have not such a heart. There are difficulties in
          the way to Heaven, they have no courage to grapple with these. They
          see Heaven afar, but there is a great gulf between them and it, and
          they have not such a resolute heart as to venture on it, and Heaven
          will not drop into their mouths.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) It is a heart that is content to know what is duty and what is
          sin: "Speak you unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto
          you, and we will hear it and do it." And indeed that is a very rare
          heart; for most people are glad to lodge lust; as some lodged
          intercommuned people, they are willing they should get house-room, but
          are desirous that they themselves should not see them, so as to know
          that they are there. But such a heart loves to know the whole counsel
          of God: John 3:20, "But he who does truth comes to the light, that his
          deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God." It is a
          sinmcere heart, which is content to have all anatomized and searched
          out; which in every case is ready to say, "Speak, Lord, for your
          servant hears;" which is content to sit down at Christ's feet and
          learn all; while others lodge their lusts under disguise, and loathe
          the discovery of them, rebel against the light, and shut their eyes,
          until God judicially blind them, so as that they at last come to
          believe lies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) It is a heart to which God's bare will is a sufficient reason
          both for faith and practice. Such a heart receives the speaker for the
          word's sake, and not the word for his, but for God's sake. Such a
          heart receives the kingdom as a little child, who has authority enough
          if father or mother say it. Such a heart bad Abraham; he gets a
          strange commandment, for which he could see no reason but the will of
          God, Genesis 22. Father and son must part, not to see other more in
          this world, though the son of the promise. The Father himself must do
          the deed. Here were many deaths both to the father and to the son; but
          God's will was revealed, and they were about fully to obey; then says
          the Lord, verse 12, "Lay not your hand upon the lad, neither do you
          anything unto him, for now I know that you fear God;" that you have
          such a heart. We go on to observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. It is a heart that has high and honorable thoughts of God, verse
          24, "Behold the Lord our God has showed us his glory, and his
          greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire;
          we have seen this day that God does talk with man, and he lives." His
          greatness; "O that there were such a heart in them!" They professed
          this. High and honorable thoughts of the husband is necessary to the
          comfort of the married state, and to the performance of duties. The
          queen stands upon the right hand, Psalm 45:9. Mean thoughts of God are
          the neck-break of right obedience to him. They think him such an one
          as themselves, Psalm 50:21. Hence mean, pitiful services are thought
          sufficient. They forget that he "will be sanctified in them that come
          near him, and before all the people will he be glorified, Leviticus
          10:3. Such a heart is let into the view of his greatness in some
          measure, so that its conclusions will be, Psalm 95:3, "The Lord is a
          great God, and a great King above all gods." So that the soul's
          familiarity with God will yet be managed with a due regard to the
          awful greatness and infinite distance between God and the creature.
          And this may serve as a help to distinguish true communion with God
          from delusions, Hebrews 12:28, 29. John 20:28.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a heart which the voice of God has reached, verse 24, (quoted
          above.) O that this voice had had as much access to their hearts as to
          their ears! Paul spoke, and God spoke, and Lydia's heart was opened.
          "My sheep," said Jesus, "hear my voice, and I know them, and they
          follow me," John 10:27. To honest covenanters there is something more
          in preaching than a bare sound, something more in sacraments than
          bread and wine: these are but the vehicles of the Lord's voice to the
          soul, and the ordinances are empty things when there is no divine fire
          enfolded in them. There is a voice of the Lord in our mother's house;
          in the public ordinances there is a good report of Christ. Sinners are
          invited, commanded to hear and believe. But Christ comes into the
          inner chamber of the elect's hearts, and there he gives his voice,
          which is a majestic voice, a heart-melting sound; Jeremiah 23:29, "Is
          not my word like as a fire? says the Lord; and like a hammer that
          breaks the rock in pieces?" It thaws the frozen affections. A
          quickening voice that puts activity in the soul; it puts the spirit in
          motion, so as that it rests not until it has taken up its rest in God;
          John 6:63, "It is the spirit that quickens, the flesh profits nothing;
          the words that I speak onto you, they are spirit, and they are life."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10. It is a heart which takes up with the Lord for its God, even when
          he appears in the glorious robes of his perfect holiness. This they
          professed; but "O that there were such a heart in them!" The truth is,
          the carnal mind is enmity against God; and none but saints indeed can
          give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness, Psalm 30:4. God is
          glorious in his holiness indeed; but none will love him for that
          glory, but such as are partakers of his divine nature. Those who love
          him for this, love him for himself. And indeed such a heart, being a
          holy heart, will cleave to the fountain of holiness, to the end that
          they may be transformed into the same image. To take God in the robes
          of mercy, is not strange; but God's holiness chases unholy hearts away
          from him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11. It is a heart sensible of that vast distance which sin has made
          between God and the soul, which has got such a sight of his own
          sinfulness, and God's holiness, that it sees there is no transacting
          with God but by a Mediator, verse 27. Such a heart will say as Luther,
          "I will have nothing to do with an absolute God." Such will not offer
          to come into the presence of God but as introduced by the King's Son,
          nor will desire to look on God but as veiled with flesh, knowing that
          a sight of unveiled majesty is enough to confound a sinner. And truly,
          until the Lord touch the heart, it will not be such a heart, but, like
          a fearless beast, will touch the fiery mountain. Such a heart will
          highly prize Christ, and come to the Lord under the veil of Christ's
          flesh, and will have no boldness of access but what flows from the
          blood of Christ, Hebrews 10:19, 20.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12. It is a heart reconciled to the whole law of God, verse 27. It is
          not every heart which is such. They only have it, "who walk not after
          the flesh but after the spirit," Romans 8:1. Hypocrites' hearts are
          never reconciled to the whole law of God. They cannot say they are not
          ashamed in having respect to all God's commandments, Psalm 119:6.
          There are always some parts of the Bible, which hypocrites would spend
          their blood on to blot them out, if that would do. Here, there is a
          raging lust says, yes; there, there is a holy law says, nay; the heart
          cannot be reconciled to both at once. Both may be in the experience
          both of the sincere Christian and the hypocrite. What is the
          difference? why, the hypocrite would gladly have the law bow to his
          lusts, the sincere soul would have his lusts bow to the law. For he
          "delights in the law of the Lord after the inward man," Romans 7:22.
          And his heart will approve the law, when it forbids, accuses, and
          condemns his corruptions, verse 16, "If then I do that which I would
          not, I consent to the law, that it is good."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13. It is a heart which is for taking the law only out of Christ's
          hand as Mediator, ver 27. The Mediator first makes the peace between
          God and the sinner, then bids the man work. But the law of itself
          first bids sinners work, and tells them they shall have their peace
          according to their work; which would be dreadful news to such a heart.
          Under the law to Christ, 1 Corinthians 9:21. The law, cast into a
          gospel-mold, is the only law such a heart desires to meddle with,
          that, "being married to Christ, they may bring forth fruit to God,"
          Romans 7:4; that being by Christ made partakers of the adoption, they
          may serve as sons, not as hired servants or slaves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It is a heart ready for obedience, verse 27. The soul then
          stands at Mount Zion, and says, "Speak, Lord, your servant hears."
          They have had Christ's banner in the banqueting-house, as being ready
          to rise up and fight his battles, under the conduct and influence of
          their glorious leader. Such a heart has eaten the Passover with its
          loins girt, and with a staff in its hand, ready for the journey. The
          heart that is for obedience, but not yet, is not such a heart; it is
          but a shifting heart, which will end in a refusal. It is but a civil
          way of putting off for altogether; Psalm 119:5, "O that my ways were
          directed to keep your statutes!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">We now proceed,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show that such a heart is a most valuable thing.—It must be so;
          For,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Such a heart is God's delight; "O that there were such an heart in
          them!" This would give content to the heart of Christ. This is his
          rest. The very prayer of the upright is his delight; Psalm 11:7, "For
          the righteous Lord loves righteousness, his countenance does behold
          the upright." Such a heart is pleasing to God; and it cannot be
          otherwise, for it is shaped out according to his mind. The person who
          has such a heart is another David, a man according to God's own heart.
          It is a heart which, as believing, pleases God; a heart well pleased
          with him, in which God is well pleased.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is that heart without which the largest profession, and the most
          express covenanting with God, is little worth. Without this heart men
          do but as the Lord's enemies, they lie unto him. And it is a dangerous
          thing to lie unto the Lord, like Ananias and Sapphira, who died with a
          lie in their mouth. They take God's name in vain. The voice indeed is
          Jacob's, but the hands are Esau's. It is but mocking God, and juggling
          with the Holy One. It is but doing the work of the Lord deceitfully,
          and offering the blind and the lame for sacrifice, which will bring
          down a curse instead of a blessing. Let a man be at never so much
          pains in duties, yet still the one thing is lacking while they have
          not such a heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The want of this heart is very grievous to the spirit of Christ.
          The Lord does thus, in the text, lament their want of it. If anything
          pierce the heart of God, it is when, with a covenanting people, there
          is wanting such a heart. What can be more grievous in a married lot
          than when the husband has not the wife's heart? Ezekiel 6:9, "I am
          broken, says God, with their whorish heart, which has departed from
          me, and with their eyes, which go a-whoring after their idols." There
          can be no contentment in that condition, as Haman said, "Yet all this
          avails me nothing," Esther 5:13. And a soul's grieving the Lord's
          Spirit, is a forerunner of the Lord's grieving them; Psalm 16:4,
          "Their sorrow shall be multiplied that hastens after another God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. God accepts of the duty, and is well pleased with the bargain,
          where there is such a heart; "O that there were such an heart in
          them!" There wants no more to complete the bargain between them and
          me. Then, as they call me their God, so would I call them mypeople by
          a saving relation. But where such is not, the contract between Christ
          and the soul is written indeed, but it is not signed. Would you know,
          then, if Christ be yours, with all the benefits of the everlasting
          covenant; why, if you have such a heart, you have Christ's heart, you
          are married to the Lord, and shall never be put away. A voice of the
          word without, and an echo to it of the heart within, closes the
          bargain; Psalm 27:8, "When you said, Seek you my face; my heart said
          unto you, Your face, Lord, will I seek." See also Jeremiah 3:22.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Where there is such a heart God will be well pleated with the
          person, and accept the duty, though it have many defects; albeit he be
          not pleased with these defects, yet in mercy he will overlook them; "O
          that there were such an heart in them!" As if be had said, O if they
          were but honest in the main, I would not be severe on them for every
          escape. The Lord will use the indulgence of a father for such
          infirmities; Song 5:1, "I have drunk my wine with my milk." Milk, that
          is, he accepts the meanest work where there is such an heart. A groan,
          a tear, a breathing after the Lord, is accepted; as the father loves
          more the lisping child's expression of its affection to him, than all
          the towering compliments of a flattering tongue, 2 Chronicles 15:17;
          the eye of their faith, though, like a bleared eye, Song 4:9; the fire
          of their love, though weak, verse 10; the hand of their confidence,
          though a trembling hand; the anchor of their hope, though feeble,
          Psalm 47:11; their feet of obedience, though lame, like Mephibosheth,
          yet shall they be set at the king's table; though their very sincerity
          be not without a mixture of hypocrisy, Galatians 2:13, yet it holds
          weight in the balance; Christ takes their petitions, though not every
          way well drawn, blots out some, fills up other things in them, and
          gets them answered. Their will is accepted for the deed; their grief
          for want of will, for the will itself; all this where there it such a
          heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. They will never prove steadfast in the Lord's covenant without such
          a heart; "O that there were such an heart in them!" They have spoke
          fair, but they will never keep a word they say, for they have not such
          a heart; Psalm 78:37, "For their heart was not right with him, neither
          were they steadfast in his covenant." The heart it the principle of
          actions; such a heart is the principle of perseverance; and there can
          be no steadfastness without a principle; Matthew 13:6, "And when the
          sun was up, they were scorched, and because they had not root they
          withered away." The tree which is set in the ground but does not take
          root in it, will be easily blown over. The house without a foundation
          cannot withstand the storm, Matthew 6:23. They who have covenanted
          with God without such a heart, will make foul work, it will appear
          that the devil has gone down with the sop, their former lusts will be
          swallowed over again, 2 Peter 2:20–22. Their last state will be worse
          than the first. Their vows will be no stronger than Samson's withs;
          their resolutions, like the walls of Jericho, will fall down at the
          sound of the horn of temptation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Such an heart will fence the man against apostasy; "O that there
          were such an heart in them!" They would not then turn away from me;
          they would keep by their covenant: Luke 7:15, "But that on the good
          ground are they which in an honest and good heart, having heard the
          word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience, Cleaving to Christ
          with constancy, without apostasy, is the very essence of such a heart.
          Gold is not gold but dross, if it do not continue in the fire. Men's
          hearts may get some light strokes of the Spirit, some fleeting motions
          of the same, and the heart still unsound as the stony ground. But the
          Spirit of God and of glory rest not on the heart, it is not such an
          heart; 1 John, 2:27. "But the anointing which you have received of
          him, abides in you;" the fire of true love will be preserved, though
          it flame not, whatever cools there may be taking place. Such an heart
          has learned so math of the grace of God as to deny worldly lasts, and
          all fortaken lovers, when they come to court the soul. Where such a
          heart is, there is the root of the matter in the man, Job, 19:28; and
          there is sap enough to keep in the life of it, Proverbs 12:3. "The
          root of the righteous shall not be moved. Yes, the Root of Jease has
          engaged that this root shall not fail," John 4:14. They are kept
          through the power of God. God is careful of the leaves of
          Christianity, Psalm 1:3. much more of real Christians themselves;
          therefore says Job chapter 17:9, "The righteous shall hold on his way;
          and he who has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger." Be their
          light never so weak, it will last, yes it will grow, and shine more
          and more unto the perfect day. It is the abiding seed of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Such a heart enriches the man who has it; "O that there were
          such an heart in them!" they want no more to make them happy here and
          hereafter. Grace and glory, and all good, is the portion of those who
          have such an heart Such an heart has taken Christ, is married and knit
          to him, and then Christ is yours, all is yours; pardon, peace, and
          every blessing; as he who gets a hold of the main link of a chain,
          draws all after him; "There the Lord commands the blasting, even life
          which never ends."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We shall conclude this discourse with beseeching you to be in earnest
          that you have such a heart. This is that which you all need, that
          without which you must be miserable forever.—It is a most invaluable
          blessing, what you should highly prize; what is precious in God's
          esteem, and what he is urgent with you that you may possess: "O that
          there were such an heart in them!"

          but solemn trifling, and not heart-work. It is of importance that you
          may be stirred up to take heed to the deceits which we may discover in
          this weighty business. With this view, we observe,

          1. That apostasy and defection from the good ways of the Lord, persons
          returning again openly to the same courses which they pursued before.
          This is an evidence, 2 Peter 2:19–22; Matthew 12:45, "Then the evil
          spirit goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked
          than himself, and they enter in and dwell there, and the last state of
          that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this
          wicked generation." They who have no root soon wither away, Matthew
          13:6. There are many who, since the revolution, have solemnly
          covenanted with the Lord at sacraments, and many who have done it,
          when they dared not so well avow it as now, who have given a sad
          account of themselves since that time, having returned to their former
          courses of wickedness and profanity. Fallen stars were stars never but
          in appearance. To lose both life and leaf is a dreadful symptom; John
          15:6, "If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
          withered; and men gather them, and east them into the fire, and they
          are burned." Another evidence is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When some lusts are maintained in Christ's room, as when an
          adulterous woman takes another man instead of her husband. There are
          some lusts from which the heart is never loosed, right eyes they
          cannot part with; this is secret apostasy from the Lord: Hebrews 3:12,
          "Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
          unbelief, in departing from the living God." When the Lord offers
          himself to sinners, he says, if you will take me, let these go their
          way. Some enter into a marriage-covenant with the Lord, but they give
          their hearts to other lovers, Psalm 14:4, (quoted before). This is
          hypocritical dealing with God, which is a disease in the vitals of
          religion, Psalm 78:37, (quoted above). Another evidence is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Persons making their covenant with the Lord, a cover to their
          sloth, and a pander to their lusts. It is sad work which persons make
          of covenanting, when it serves only to conjure their consciences, who
          hence can sleep more securely in their sins. Many are never more
          light, vain, and frothy, than after such a work; a most shrewd sign of
          a whorish disposition: Proverbs 7:14, "I have peace-offerings with me.
          This day have I paid my vows. Therefore came I forth to meet you,
          diligently to seek your face." The covenant of God is a covenant of
          peace and war, which inclines the sinner to be at peace with the
          Lord's friends, and at war with his enemies. It makes the soul to say
          to former lusts, I have learned from the gospel, to deny ungodliness
          and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in
          this present world," Titus 2:12. Hence, Christ no sooner enters the
          heart, but he comes as Captain of the Lord's host; and the person's
          heart thus becomes the seat of war: Galatians 5:17, "For the flesh
          lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and these
          two are contrary the one to the other." And these lusts which were
          formerly gold chains, are now turned into heavy iron fetters: Romans
          7:24, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of
          this death?"—Another evidence is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The barrenness of the lives of professors, nothing of the fruits of
          holiness appearing in their lives. We are, Rachel-like, barren, having
          no more but the leaves of a profession, the performance of external
          duties, to give us the name of Christians. Alas! fire from Heaven
          seems to have blasted many of us, and the curse of the Lord is as a
          worm at our root. Married to the Lord, and yet barren, is a
          contradiction, Romans 7:4. For the very end of this marriage it, that
          we may bring forth fruit unto God. Where the soul is joined to the
          Lord, it is made the habitation of the Spirit: and this is that which
          produces the fruits of holiness, Ephesians 5:9, "For the fruit of the
          Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here some may say, Alas! this speaks death to me, for do what I will,
          the weeds in the cursed soil of my heart suffers no fruit to appear
          there. To such I answer.—There is no fruit which grows in the heart of
          a believer in the world, but it has a weed of corruption by the side
          of it; their faith is marked with unbelief, their hope with
          diffidence, their very sincerity with hypocrisy. But are you at pains
          to pluck up these? If you should look into a garden, and saw nothing
          but weeds in it, yet if you saw the gardener weeding it, you would
          conclude there must be something else there; so in this ease. Will you
          see if there be any thriving of undergrowth in your hearts, if you be
          growing downwards in humility, self-loathing, self-denial, depending
          and clearing more from a sense of need to the Lord? Ephesians 4:15,
          16. Barren trees use not to have their branches hanging down to salute
          the ground, unless they be broken off by a violent wind.—Another
          evidence is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. The having no communication of the life of grace from Christ to the
          soul: John 14:19, "Because I live, you shall live also." Food and
          clothing are what every soul married to the Lord get from him. If the
          soul be truly united to Christ, it will partake of the root and sap of
          the vine: John 6:57, "He who eats me, says Jesus, even he shall live
          by me." True faith opens a way for a stream of blood to run through
          the heart, by which the soul is purged and quickened. The blood of
          Jesus "purges the conscience from dead works, to serve the living
          God," Hebrews 9:14. But, alas! the faith of many is like a pipe laid
          short of the fountain, and so brings none of the water of life into
          the soul. Many covenant with the Lord as the seven women, Isaiah 4:1,
          who take hold of one man, as it is there said, they will be called by
          his name; for so is Christ's spouse, in token of her
          marriage-relation, she loses her name, and takes her husband's, Isaiah
          44:5, "One shall say, I am the Lord's; and another shall call himself
          by the name of Jacob." This will take away their reproach before the
          world, and it will do much to silence the blustering tongue of an
          ill-natured conscience. Yes, but after all this, they will eat their
          own bread, Isaiah 4:1. They will live upon their own stock of natural
          and acquired abilities, for they are not, as in Matthew 3:5, "poor in
          spirit." They come not, as true believers, with a weak soul to a
          strong God, an empty vessel to a full fountain. Thus does the true
          believer, who says, Galatians 2:20, "I am crucified with Christ;
          nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life
          which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God,
          who loved me, and gave himself for me." But the other will live on
          their lusts; Christ gives rest to their consciences, and their lusts
          give rest to their hearts; he shall bear up their hopes, and their
          lasts shall satisfy their desires.—They will wear their own apparel.
          Romans 10:3, "For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and
          going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
          themselves to the righteousness of God." Their duties make a great
          figure in their own eyes, and therefore are ciphers in God's account.
          Hence the more they do and the better they do, the more they are in
          conceit with themselves, and the further from Christ It is quite
          contrary with true covenanters; Philippians 3:3, "They rejoice in
          Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:" Revelation 2:14,
          "They wash their robes, and make them white in the blood of the
          Lamb."—We shall only add as an evidence,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, The having no contentment in Christ alone. Where the soul
          heartily closes with Christ, he is to the soul a covering to the eyes:
          Psalm 73:25, "Whom have I in Heaven but you? and there is none upon
          earth that I desire beside you." Hence the triumph of faith, even when
          all external things fail; Habakkuk 3:17, "I will rejoice in the Lord,
          and joy in the God of my salvation." But, alas! how many of as have no
          comfort, but when the cisterns of creature-comforts are running full!
          how few arrive at the height of rejoicing in the Lord, when these
          cisterns are dried up! Matthew 13:45, 46. Every person's house stands
          upon two props, Christ and the creature, but the weight lies only upon
          one of them. Take away the world from the believer, he stands firm on
          the rock Christ; take away the world from the hypocrite, and all falls
          down together. A person may bear to have some branch of his comforts
          cut off; but when God strikes at the root of creature-comforts, then
          may the hypocrite say, You have taken away my gods, and what have I
          more? Some can endure anything but poverty, for covetousness reigns in
          them; others anything but disrespect, for pride is their idol.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here again some may say, If this be an evidence, we know not who will
          make sure work, for many time gracious persons are as much, if not
          more, cast down with the loss of creature-comforts, than others; To
          this I answer, No doubt gracious souls will sometimes be more joyful
          on the receipt of a temporal mercy, and more east down on the loss of
          them, than others: for the chief thing which affects him is the face
          of God appearing in it, either as favorable or frowning; so that they
          will be ready to say on such an occasion, as in Genesis 33:10, "For
          therefore I have seen your face, as though I had seen the face of God,
          and you were pleased with me." And this will make a mole-hill mercy or
          cross appear like a mountain. The godly in this case fetch their
          comfort from the Lord, others fetch theirs from something else in the
          world; when one stream runs dry, they go to another, like the prodigal
          before he came home. The drying up of the streams sends the gracious
          soul to the fountain.

        <p align="justify">We now proceed,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show when covenanting is not heart-work, but a trifling
          business.—It is so,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. When the soul is not divorced from sin. The heart is naturally
          glewed to sin, and it is impossible that the heart can at once be both
          for the Lord and lusts, Matthew 6:24. The first marriage must be made
          void before a second can be made sure. They must have their covenant
          with their lusts broken, who will have their covenant with the Lord
          sure; Hosea 14:8, "Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with
          idols?" Living lusts and the living Lord will not both get the throne
          of the heart. In the day of espousals, when Christ gets the crown,
          lusts get the cross. Many will be in suit of the heart, and the heart
          for a time may be halting between two; but in a covenanting day with
          the Lord, all others must be discharged; Psalm 45:10, "Hearken, O
          daughter! and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own
          people, and your father's house." Here some may inquire, How may a
          person know if their heart be divorced from sin?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. That which makes the man and his lusts one, is the greedy grip
          which the heart takes of sin, it is the heart cleaving to its lusts:
          Jeremiah 8:5, "Why then is the people of Jerusalem slidden back by a
          perpetual backsliding? They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return."
          The heart and affections in sin are like the hot iron, where the iron
          and the fire are very close together. The man's lusts are to him like
          a leg or an arm which is knit to the body with joints and bands. Now,
          where the heart is divorced, it loathes that sin which before it
          loved. Though sin cleaves to the man, yet he cleaves not to it, Romans
          7:17–22. Never was the captive more desirous to be loosed of his
          bands, than that soul to be free from sin. Like a weak honest virgin,
          though it cannot shake itself loose of its grips, yet it would be
          content if one would set it free. Solemn covenanting is trifling,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When the soul is not divorced from the law, Romans 8:4, "Wherefore,
          my brethren, you also are become dead to the law by the body of
          Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is
          raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God." Legal
          professors do but trifle with the Lord, and never make heart-work of
          covenanting with him. They may bind themselves faster and faster to
          duties, but there is no engaging their heart to the Lord of duties;
          they are as they who would draw up with the handmaid instead of the
          mistress; and do but bind themselves to the work of spinning out their
          own rain out of their own affections. There is a generation who get
          some convictions of their misery by sin, the law comes and takes them
          by the throat, and then they cry, Have patience with me, and I will
          pay you all. Hence they bestir themselves, and fall a trading to gain
          something for Heaven and eternal life; they set about secret duties,
          attending public ordinances, and take the sacrament, and the effect of
          all is but to wreath their necks faster in the yoke of law-bondage,
          and to remove themselves farther from Christ. This is but trifling.—If
          it be inquired, How may one know if they be divorced from the law? you
          have the word, Galatians 2:19, "For I through the law am dead to the
          law, that I might live unto God." The law comes home to the soul with
          such force and power, that it cuts off all hopes of the soul's ever
          mending itself by its works; makes the soul see its utter emptiness
          and weakness; and hence it dies off, and lies at the foot of free
          grace, with that prayer in its month, Jeremiah 31:18, "You have
          chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the
          yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are the Lord my
          God." Then Christ's blood is the soul's only refuge for guilt,
          Christ's Spirit for holiness; and the soul will have no peace but what
          comes from this blood; while many instead of this, lick themselves
          whole of their wounds by confession, mourning, prayer for pardon, and
          engaging not to do so any more. But it is quite different from this,
          when, as above, the Spirit of Christ leads his divorced bride out of
          the house of her former husband to Jesus himself.—It is so,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. When the soul comes not heartily and freely to the Lord in his
          covenant, Psalm 78:34–37. The Lord will not meet that soul. He cares
          not for persons giving the hand, when they do not give him their
          hearts. Indeed this is a covenant which speaks out the extreme
          naughtiness of men's hearts, by their coming into it grudgingly and
          per force. The sacrifice that is dragged to the altar, will not be
          accepted, it will run away from it again. It will be like the strong
          bough which is forcibly bowed, which will soon fly back. When the Lord
          comes to a soul, he deals with the heart. He touches the heart, as he
          touched the hearts of Saul's companions, 1 Samuel 10:26; Jeremiah
          31:3, "The Lord has appeared to me of old, saying, Yes, I have loved
          you with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have I
          drawn you." There is grace in the Lord's lips, heavenly rhetoric to
          catch a sinner's affections, Psalm 45:2. When the Spirit of the Lord
          pours in overcoming grace, then the man pours out his heart before
          him, Psalm 62:8. Thus the people become willing in the day of his
          power, Psalm 110:3. Here we may shortly state and consider two cases—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          CASE 1. What shall become of those, then, who are driven to the Lord
          by terror? I answer, Those who are only driven by terror, they will
          even leave him again when the terror is over, for terrors will break a
          heart of stone, but will not melt it. At the same time, terror may
          begin the work, which love will crown: Hosea 2:14, "Therefore, behold
          I will allure her and bring her into the wilderness, and speak
          comfortably unto her," When the Lord is to match with sinners, they
          are bold and perverse, they will not speak to him, until he has shot
          an arrow into their flesh, until he has made them prisoners of war;
          and then, when he has them in chains, he makes love to them. He first
          drives the sinner, and then he draws him like Noah's dove into the
          ark, Genesis 8:9. The Lord sets the avenger of blood in pursuit of the
          poor criminal, he with a heavy heart leaves his own city, and his old
          acquaintances, and flees for his bare life to the city of refuge, to
          which he has no inclination, but must do is a great thing. When be
          comes to the gates, and sees the beauty of the place, the excellencies
          and loveliness of the city charm him; then he says, This is my rest,
          here will I dwell.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          CASE 2. I often find, when I am to go to the Lord's table, a great
          backwardness to the duty. What should be done in this case? I answer,
          There is a great difference between a man's turning his back and
          running away from his friend, and a sickly man's coming slowly to him.
          And if I might be allowed so to speak, I should distinguish between a
          backward heart, and a backwardness upon the heart; Matthew 26:41,
          "Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed
          is willing, but the flesh is weak." A backward heart is a foolish
          heart, and will make sad work of a communion; Proverbs 17:16,
          "Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom,
          seeing he has no heart to it?" I wish the Lord may turn this people
          from the Lord's table, until he has turned their hearts back to
          himself; or else, when they have put their hands to the plough, they
          will after all leave it, and injure religion more than if they had
          never meddled with it. But for others, our Master allows you to come
          as you are able, with your burden upon your back, and lay it down at
          his feet; Matthew 11:28, "Come unto me, all you that labor, and are
          heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Psalm. 65:3, "Iniquities
          prevail against me; as for our transgressions, you shall purge them
          away." The great Physician knows very well his patient comes with
          heart and good will, though his sickness and indisposition makes him
          come with a slow pace. It is trifling,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. When the soul comes to the Lord in his covenant for peace to their
          consciences, but not for victory over their lasts. Many come to the
          Lord, as a sick man to the physician, to cure him of his wounds, but
          not to live upon his charges; Psalm 78:34, "When he slew them, then
          they sought him; and they returned and inquired early after God." They
          have use for the blood, not for the water, which came from the side of
          Jesus. This is but half-work, not heart-work. Enemies to the spirit of
          holiness are enemies to Christ I never think it the best frame for a
          communion table when people sit down at the Lord's table chiefly for
          peace and comfort. A view of the King, a transforming sight which
          might strengthen the soul, to have this before our eyes sitting down
          at the feast, would certainly be most safe. To get a touch of the hem
          of Christ's garment, for stopping the issue of sin, will be beneficial
          indeed. It is so,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. When the soul accepts of conditional promises, but does not accept
          of and receive the Lord himself in absolute promises. This is to agree
          upon the less points of the covenant, and to neglect the main point,
          Hebrews 8:10. The great thing God offers in the gospel is Christ. He
          is a foolish man that would claim the benefit of the contract, while
          he neglects to marry the woman. It is a dreadful thing to turn the
          covenant of grace into a mere servile or mere social covenant, as
          passes between neighboring independent states. It is most properly a
          marriage-covenant, where the soul first takes the Lord himself, and
          then looks for the benefits accruing to it by the happy match. Natural
          men fancy a very easy covenant in,—"He who confesses his sins, shall
          find mercy.—Call en me, and I will answer thee.—What does the Lord
          require of you, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly
          with your God?"—He will accept the will for the deed; not considering
          that all the promises are yes and amen in Christ; and suppose they
          could perform the condition of these promises, yet they could not have
          benefit by them while they have not the Lord Christ, dwelling, living,
          and reigning in them.—It is solemn trifling,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, When there is not an absolute resignation of the will to the
          will of the Lord. This is to have reserves in our covenanting with the
          Lord. Man's will is the great rebel against the Lord, and must, if we
          make sure work, be bound hand and foot in a covenanting day. There
          must be a double resignation,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) To the preceptive will: Romans 6:17, "You have obeyed from the
          heart that form of doctrine which was delivered unto you." The soul
          must no more snarl with duty, but be content to take on the yoke of
          Christ's commands. And they who are not content to stand and receive
          the same commands from mount Zion, which were thundered into their
          hearts from mount Sinai before, their hearts are not for this work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) There most be resignation to the providential will of God. It has
          been long a question between the Lord and you, who shall be master of
          your process, who shall carve out your lot? Are you come to a point
          now? even to that point? Psalm 47:4. "He shall choose our inheritance
          for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved." It is well, you are
          wise; for our own will, and nothing else, is our wreck.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">We should now,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Show how people come to make solemn covenanting but a trifling
          business. But for this, see the third head of doctrine first.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">We proceed, then,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. To show the danger of trifling, and not making heart-work of this
          weighty business.—This will appear if we consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That the Lord rejects the work: Malachi 1:13, "You said also,
          Behold what a weariness is it, and you have snuffed at it, says the
          Lord of hosts, and you brought that which was torn, and the lame, and
          the sick; thus you brought an offering; should I accept this of your
          hands? says the Lord." Whatever pains persons may be at about
          covenanting, the Lord has no regard to it while it is not heart-work,
          Isaiah 1:11. It is true, you may even sign the contract, but the Lord
          will not subscribe it, seeing it has not the upright consent of your
          hearts, Psalm 50:16, 17. You may expect the entertainment recorded,
          Matthew 22:12, "Friend, how came you in thither, not having a
          wedding-garment? And he was speechless."—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That it puts men more securely in Satan's grips than before. In
          this sense that holds true which you have in Isaiah 28:22, "Now
          therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong."
          Publicans and sinners will enter before these. Such are twice dead,
          where the devil goes out and returns with seven other spirits worse
          than himself. The last end of such a person is worse than his
          beginning.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That it exposes men to spiritual strokes; Jeremiah 48:10, "Cursed
          be he who does the work of the Lord deceitfully." Deadening strokes.
          These are silent arrows which fly from the hand of God into the soul
          without noise; Isaiah 6:10, "Make the heart of this people fat, and
          make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their
          eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and
          convert, and he healed." Sometimes men are like Saul among the
          prophets, but afterwards they are knocked in the head by the secret
          judgment of God, because of their hypocritical dealing with him, it
          may be at a communion table, in so much that they have never a day to
          do well after; and from that time God answers them not, but they live
          and rot above the ground; their hearts are deadened, their affections
          dozened, their gifts withered, and their souls blasted; John 15:6, "If
          a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered;
          and men gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned."
          Quickening strokes, whereby the man is dreadfully alarmed, the
          conscience is awakened, and made like Mount Sinai, where nothing but
          fire and smoke appear. God takes the filthy rags of their mock
          covenanting, wraps them in brimstone, and sets them in fire about the
          sinner's ears. Their wounds which were scurfed over bleed more
          dreadfully, while the plaster they made will not stick. Besides these,
          there are strokes upon their bodies. As Nadab and Abihu, Leviticus
          10:1, 2. A wrong look into the ark cost the men of Bethshemesh dear, 1
          Samuel 6:19. God smote Uzzah, and he died by the ark, 2 Samuel 6:7.
          And the apostle tells us, 1 Corinthians 11:30, "For this cause many
          are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep." Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, That however quietly people may get it carried in life, it
          will bring them a sad disappointment at death. The house built on the
          sand fell by the storm, and great was its fall. A great fall from high
          hopes into deep despair; like the foolish virgins, who were
          unexpectedly shut out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">We are now,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          V. To apply the subject. Which we shall do only in an use of
          exhortation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I would then exhort one and all of you to make heart-work and sure
          work in your covenanting with the Lord, and not to trifle in so solemn
          a business. You have heard the danger you incur by trifling with it.
          But perhaps some will say with a whole heart, that as they are
          resolved to keep themselves out of harm's way, they will not come to
          the Lord's table. To this I would answer, Well, will you not enter
          into covenant with the Lord? if not, then you will never see Heaven;
          Ephesians 2:12, "Strangers from the covenants of promise, having no
          hope, and without God in the world." Where will you appear at the
          great day? Psalm 50:1–5. You must take hold of the Lord's covenant, or
          be damned. Sirs, if you enter at all into this work, my exhortation
          reaches you. You may trifle with God upon your knees, as well as at
          his table. And if you be not minded to refuse this covenant, why stand
          you back from the seals of it? why do you not prepare yourselves for
          it? why slight you this love token of our dying Lord? I would think if
          you were in earnest for the covenant, you would not slight the seal of
          it. Make sure work then. To induce you to be serious in this weighty
          work, I would mention and urge the following motives.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 1. You have need to make sure work, for you have deceitful hearts
          to deal with, Jeremiah 17:19. Let not the bands be put on slightly, or
          it will soon slip them all. Therefore dig deep, by serious solemn
          examination of your consciences before the Lord, that you may build as
          on a rock.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 2. Consider the weight of the business; the business of
          salvation, or damnation, is not a matter to trifle with. Sirs, life
          and death are before you. Your eternal state lies at the stake. I
          bescech you then, by all that weight of glory that awaits the saints,
          as you would not ruin your souls which a thousand worlds cannot
          repair, for the loss of the soul cannot be made up, that you seriously
          consider the business.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 3. Consider the Lord is not trifling, but is in good earnest with
          you; "O that there were such a heart in them!" There is a match
          proposed between the King of glory and the daughter of Zion, the
          bridegroom is willing; Revelation 3:20, "Behold I stand at the door
          and knock." There is nothing wanting on his part; Matthew 22:4," All
          things are ready, come unto the marriage." How passionately does he
          call for her consent in the text: And now, when the Lord is thus
          offering himself to you, why will you refuse or trifle with him? Here
          some may propose this,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION. This is a flourish which may pass well enough in a pulpit.
          But, O! if the Lord were really offering himself to me, I would never
          refuse. To this I answer, The offer is real, though ministerial. We
          have our commission from our Lord to bear us out in it, and he would
          do the same if he were here bodily present; 2 Corinthians 5:10, "Now
          then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by
          us: we pray you in Christ's stead be you reconciled to God." Hence, in
          the days of his flesh, he offered himself both to those that did, and
          those that did not receive him. Consider, he said to his disciples,
          "He who hears you, hears me." We are the friends of the Bridegroom; as
          Abraham's servants, we are come to bring you to our Master's son. What
          would you have to make the offer real, if you may not take it as such
          from the mouth of his messengers? Would you have him leave his glory a
          second time, and come in person to make the offer? Or would you have
          him come down in his glory? If so, you know not what you ask. It would
          set you better to do as Abigail, bow yourself to the earth, and humbly
          accept of the offer, 1 Samuel 25:40, 41. So real is the offer, that if
          you refuse, you will be damned for the refusal; Mark 16:15, 16, "And
          he said unto them, go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to
          every creature. He who believes and is baptized, shall be saved; but
          he who believes not, shall be damned." John 17:20, "Neither pray I for
          these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their
          word." See then what you do. It is a serious business on the Lord's
          part, and there is a prize in your hands, which you would do well
          diligently to improve. Does he indeed offer himself to me? do you say?
          notwithstanding my unworthiness. Yes, to you, we make no scruple to
          offer him particularly to every one of you, the vilest of you all;
          Revelation 3:20, "Behold I stand at the door and knock: if any man
          hear my voice, and open the door, I will come into him, and will sup
          with him, and he with me." It is not unworthiness, but unwillingness,
          that will mar the bargain; "The Spirit and the bride say, Come, and
          let him that hears say, Come, and let him that is athirst say, Come,
          and whoever will let him take the water of life freely."
