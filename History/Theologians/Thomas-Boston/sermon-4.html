<p align="center">The difference between the Righteous <br/>

    and the Wicked in their death<br/>

 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"The <b>wicked</b> is driven away in his wickedness; but 

    the <b>righteous</b> has hope in his death." Proverbs 14:32.</p>
<p align="justify">This text looks like the cloud between the Israelites and 

    Egyptians; having a dark side towards the latter, and a bright side towards 

    the former. It represents death like Pharaoh's jailor, bringing the chief 

    butler and the chief baker out of prison; the one to be restored to his 

    office, and the other to be led to execution. It shows the difference 

    between the godly and ungodly in their death; who, as they act a very 

    different part in life, so, in death, have a very different exit.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">As to the death of a WICKED man</p></b></font>, here is,

    
<b>
<p align="justify">1. The MANNER of his passing out of the world.</p></b> He is 

    "<i>driven</i> away;" namely, in his death, as is clear from the opposite 

    clause. He is forcibly thrust out of his place in this world; driven away as 

    chaff before the wind. 
<b>
<p align="justify">2. The STATE he passes away in.</p></b> He dies also in a <i>

    sinful</i> and <i>hopeless</i> state.
<p align="justify">A. In a <b>sinful</b> state– He is driven away in his 

    wickedness. He lived in it, and he dies in it. His filthy garments of sin in 

    which he wrapped up himself in his life are his prison garments, in which he 

    shall lie wrapped up forever. </p>
<p align="justify">B. In a <b>hopeless</b> state– "but the righteous has 

    hope in his death;" which plainly imports the hopelessness of the wicked in 

    their death. Whereby is not meant, that no wicked man shall have <i>any</i> 

    hope at all when he is dying, but shall die in despair. No– sometimes it is 

    so indeed; but frequently it is otherwise; foolish virgins may, and often 

    do, hope to the last breath. But the wicked man has no <i>solid</i> hope– as 

    for the delusive hopes he entertains himself with, death will root them up, 

    and he shall be forever irretrievably miserable.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the death of a righteous man, he has hope in his 

    death. This is ushered in with a "but," importing the removal of these 

    dreadful circumstances, with which the wicked man is attended, who is driven 

    away in his wickedness; but the godly are not so. </p>
<p align="justify">1. Not so, in the <b>manner</b> of their passing out of 

    the world. The righteous are not driven away as chaff before the wind; but 

    led away as a bride to the marriage chamber, carried away by the angels into 

    Abraham's bosom, Luke 16:22. </p>
<p align="justify">2. Not so as to their <b>state</b>, when passing out of 

    this life. The righteous man dies, not in a sinful, but in a <b>holy</b> 

    state. He does not go away <i>in</i> his sin, but <i>out of</i> it. In his 

    life he was putting off the old man, changing his prison garments; and now 

    the remaining rags of them are removed, and he is adorned with robes of 

    glory. Not in a hopeless, but a <b>hopeful</b> state. He has hope in his 

    death; he has the grace of hope, and the well-founded expectation of better 

    things than he ever had in this world– and though, the stream of his hope at 

    death may run shallow, yet he has still so much of it as makes him venture 

    his eternal interests upon the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 1. The WICKED dying, are driven away in their 

    wickedness, and in a HOPELESS state.</p></b></font> In speaking to this 

    doctrine, 
<p align="justify">I. I shall show how, and in what sense, the wicked are 

    "driven away in their wickedness" at death. </p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall prove the hopelessness of their state at 

    death. </p>
<p align="justify">III. And then apply the whole.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. How, and in what sense, the wicked are "driven away in 

    their wickedness."</p></b></font> In discoursing of this matter, I shall briefly 

    inquire, 
<p align="justify">1. What is meant by their being "driven away." </p>
<p align="justify">2. Why they shall be driven, and where. </p>
<p align="justify">3. In what respects they may be said to be driven away 

    "in their wickedness." </p>
<p align="justify">But before I proceed, let me remark, that you are 

    mistaken if you think that no people are to be called wicked, but those who 

    are avowedly vicious and profane; as if the devil could dwell in none but 

    those whose name is Legion. In Scripture account, all who are not righteous, 

    in the manner hereafter explained, are reckoned wicked. Therefore the the 

    text divides the whole world into two sorts– "the righteous and the wicked," 

    and you will see the same thing in Malachi 3:18, "Then shall you return, and 

    discern between the righteous and the wicked." Therefore if you are not 

    righteous, you are wicked. If you have not an <i>imputed</i> righteousness, 

    and also an <i>implanted</i> righteousness, or united to Christ by faith, 

    however moral and blameless in the eyes of men your conversation may be, you 

    are the wicked who shall be driven away in their wickedness– if death finds 

    you in that state. Now,</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. As to the MEANING of this phrase, "driven away,"</p></b> 

    there are three things in it; the wicked shall be taken away suddenly, 

    violently, and irresistibly.
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) </p></b>Unrenewed men shall be taken away <b>SUDDENLY</b> 

    at death. Not that all wicked men die suddenly; nor that they are all wicked 

    that die so; God forbid. But, 
<p align="justify">1. Death commonly comes upon them <b>unexpectedly</b>, 

    and so surprises them, as the deluge surprised the old world, though they 

    were forewarned of it long before it came; and as travail comes on a woman 

    with child, with surprising suddenness, although looked for and expected, 1 

    Thess. 5:3. Death seizes them, as a creditor does his debtor, to drag him to 

    prison, Psalm 55:15, and that when they are not aware. Death comes in, as a 

    thief, at the window, and finds them full of busy thoughts about this life 

    which that very day perish. </p>
<p align="justify">2. Death always seizes them <b>unprepared</b> for it; the 

    old house falls down about their ears, before they have another provided. 

    When death casts them to the door, they have not where to lay their heads; 

    unless it be on a bed of fire and brimstone. The soul and body are as it 

    were hugging one another in mutual embraces; when death comes like a 

    whirlwind, and separates them. </p>
<p align="justify">3. Death hurries them away <b>in a moment</b> to 

    destruction, and makes a most dismal change– the man for the most part never 

    knows where he is, until "in <i>hell</i> he lift up his eyes," Luke 16:23. 

    The floods of wrath suddenly overwhelm his soul; and before he is aware, he 

    is plunged into the bottomless pit!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.)</p></b> The unrenewed man is taken away out of the world

    <b>VIOLENTLY</b>. Driving is a violent action; he is "chased out of the 

    world," Job 18:18. Gladly would he stay, if he could; but death drags him 

    away, like a malefactor to the execution. He sought no other portion than 

    the profits and pleasures of this world– he has no other; he really desires 

    no other– how can he then go away out of it, if he were not <i>driven?
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Question.</p></b> "But may not a wicked man be willing to 

    die?" <b>Answer.</b> He may indeed be willing to die; but observe it is only 

    in one of three cases. 
<p align="justify">1. In a fit of passion, by reason of some <b>trouble</b> 

    that he is impatient to be rid of. Thus, many people, when their passion has 

    got the better of their reason, and when, on that account they are most 

    unfit to die, will be ready to cry, "O to be gone!" But should their desire 

    be granted, and death came at their call, they would quickly show they were 

    not in earnest; and that, if they go, they must be driven away against their 

    wills. </p>
<p align="justify">2. When they are brim-full of <b>despair</b> may they be 

    willing to die. Thus Saul murdered himself; and Spira wished to be in hell, 

    that he might know the uttermost of what he believed he was to suffer. In 

    this manner men may seek after death, while it flees from them. But fearful 

    is the violence these undergo, whom the terrors of God do thus drive. </p>
<p align="justify">3. When they are <b>dreaming of happiness after death</b>. 

    Foolish virgins, under the power of delusion, as to their state, may be 

    willing to die, having no fear of lying down in sorrow. How many are there, 

    who can give no scriptural ground for their hope, who yet have no bands in 

    their death! Many are driven to darkness 'sleeping'– they go off like lambs, 

    who would roar like lions, did they but know what place they are going to; 

    though the chariot in which they are, drives furiously to the depths of 

    hell, yet they fear not, because they are fast asleep!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.)</p></b> The unregenerate man is taken away <b>

    IRRESISTIBLY</b>. He <b>must</b> go, though sore against his will. Death 

    will lake no refusal, nor admit of any delay; though the man has not lived 

    half his days, according to his own computation. If he will not <i>bow</i>, 

    it will <i>break</i> him. If he will not come forth, it will pull the house 

    down about his ears; for there he must not stay. Although the physicians 

    help, friends groan, the wife and children cry, and he himself use his 

    utmost efforts to retain the spirit, his soul is required of him; yield he 

    must, and go where he shall never more see light.
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Let us consider, WHY they are driven, and WHERE.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When the wicked die, </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.)</p></b> They are driven <b>out of this world</b>, where 

    they sinned, into the other world, where they must be judged, and receive 

    their particular sentences, Heb. 9:27, "It is appointed unto men once to 

    die, but after this the judgment." They shall no more return to their 

    beloved earth. Though their hearts are wedded to their earthly enjoyments, 

    they must leave them, they can carry nothing hence. How sorrowful must their 

    departure be, when they have nothing in view so good as that which they 

    leave behind them!
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.)</p></b> They are driven out of the society of the saints 

    on earth, <b>into the society of the damned in hell</b>, Luke 16:22-23, "The 

    rich man also died, and was buried. And in hell he lift up his eyes." What a 

    multitude of the devil's goats do now take place among Christ's sheep! but 

    at death they shall be "led forth with the workers of iniquity," Psalm 

    125:5. There is a <i>mixed</i> multitude in this world, but no mixture in 

    the other; each party is there set by themselves. Though hypocrites grow 

    here as <i>tares</i> among the wheat, death will root them up, and they 

    shall be bound in bundles for the fire. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) </p></b>They are driven<b> out of time into eternity!</b> 

    While time lasts with them, there is hope; but when time goes, all hope goes 

    with it. Precious time is now lavishly spent– it lies so heavy on the hands 

    of many, that they think themselves obliged to take several ways to drive 

    away time. But beware of being at a loss what to do in life– improve time 

    for eternity, while you have it; for before long, death will drive it from 

    you, and you from it, so as you shall never meet again. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.)</p></b> They are driven <b>out of their specious 

    'pretenses to piety'.</b> Death strips them of the splendid robes of a fair 

    profession, with which some of them are adorned; and turns them off the 

    stage, in the rags of a wicked heart and life. The word "hypocrite" properly 

    signifies a stage-player, who <i>appears</i> to be what indeed he is not. 

    This world is the stage on which these children of the devil impersonate the 

    children of God. Their 'show of religion' is the player's coat, under which 

    one must look, who will judge of them aright. Death turns them out of their 

    coat, and they appear in their native dress– it unveils them, and takes off 

    their mask! There are none in the other world, who pretend to be better than 

    they really are. Depraved nature acts in the regions of horror, undisguised!

    
<b>
<p align="justify">(5.) </p></b>They are driven away from all means of grace; 

    and are set beyond the line, quite <b>out of all prospect of mercy</b>. 

    There is no more an opportunity to buy oil for the lamp; it is gone out at 

    death, and can never be lighted again. There may be offers of mercy and 

    peace made, after they are gone; but they are to <i>others</i>, not to them– 

    there are no such offers in the place to which they are driven; these offers 

    are only made in that place from which they are driven away.
<b>
<p align="justify">3. In what respects may they be said to be driven away in 

    their wickedness?</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Answer 1. In respect of their being driven away <b>in</b></p>
<p align="justify">their sinful unconverted state. Having <i>lived</i> 

    enemies to God, they <i>die</i> in a state of enmity to him– for none are 

    brought into the eternal state of consummate happiness, but by the way of 

    the state of grace in this life. The child that is dead in the womb, is born 

    dead, and is cast out of the womb into the grave– so, "he who is dead while 

    he lives", or is spiritually dead, is cast forth of the womb of time, in the 

    same state of death, into the pit of utter misery. O miserable death, to die 

    in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity! It had been incomparably 

    better for such as die thus, that they had never been born!</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 2. In regard that <b>they die sinning</b>, acting 

    wickedly against God, in contradiction to the divine law; for they can do 

    nothing but sin while they live– so death takes them in the very act of 

    sinning; violently draws them from the embraces of their lusts, and drives 

    them away to the tribunal, to receive their sentence! It is a remarkable 

    expression, Job 36:14, "They die in youth," the marginal reading is, "their 

    soul dies in youth"– their lusts being lively, their desires vigorous, and 

    expectations big, as is common in youth. "And their life is among the 

    unclean;" or, "And the company" or herd "of them" dies "among the 

    Sodomites," namely, is taken awny in the act of their sin and wickedness, as 

    the men of Sodom were, Genesis 19; Luke 17:28, 29. </p>
<p align="justify">Answer 3. As they are driven away, <b>loaded with the 

    guilt of all their sins</b>; this is the winding-sheet that shall lie down 

    with them in the dust, Job 20:11. Their works follow them into the other 

    world; they go away with the yoke of their transgressions wreathed about 

    their necks. Guilt is a bad companion in life, but how terrible will it be 

    in death! It lies now, perhaps, like cold brimstone on their benumbed 

    consciences– but when death opens the way for sparks of divine vengeance, 

    like fire, to fall upon it, it will make dreadful flames in the conscience, 

    in which the soul will be, as it were, wrapped up forever!</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 4. The wicked are driven away in their wickedness, 

    in so far as <b>they die under the absolute power of their wickedness. </b>

    While there is hope, there is some restraint on the worst of men; those 

    moral endowments, which God gives to a number of men, for the benefit of 

    mankind in this life, are so many restraints upon the impetuous wickedness 

    of human nature. But all hope being cut off, and these gifts withdrawn, the 

    wickedness of the wicked will then arrive at its perfection. </p>
<p align="justify">As the seeds of <i>grace</i>, sown in the hearts of the 

    elect, come to their full maturity at death; so <i>wicked and hellish 

    dispositions in the reprobate, come then to their highest pitch! </i>Their 

    prayers to God will then be turned to horrible curses, and their praises to 

    hideous blasphemies, Matthew 25:13, "There shall be weeping and gnashing of 

    teeth." This gives a <i>dismal</i>, but <i>correct</i> view of the state of 

    the wicked in another world.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. I shall discover the HOPELESSNESS of the state of 

    unrenenewed men at death.</p></b></font> It appears to be very hopeless, if we 

    consider these four things.
<b>
<p align="justify">1. Death cuts off their hopes and prospects of peace and 

    pleasure in this life</p></b>. Luke 12:19, 20, "Soul, you have much goods laid 

    up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said 

    unto him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you– then who 

    shall have those things which you have provided?" They look for great 

    matters in this world, they hope to increase their wealth, to see their 

    families prosper, and to live at ease; but death comes like a stormy wind, 

    and shakes off all their fond hopes, like green fruit from off a tree. "When 

    he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon 

    him," Job 20:23. He may begin a web of contrivances for advancing his 

    worldly interest; but before he gets it wrought out, death comes and cuts it 

    off. "His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth; in that very day his 

    thoughts perish." Psalm 146:4.
<b>
<p align="justify">2. When death comes, they have no solid ground to hope 

    for eternal happiness.</p></b> "For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he 

    has gained, when God takes away his soul?" Job 27:8. Whatever hopes they 

    fondly entertain, they are not founded on God's word, which is the only sure 

    ground of hope; if they knew their own case, they would see themselves only 

    happy in a 'dream'. And indeed what hope can they have? The <b>law</b> is 

    plain against them, and condemns them. The curses of it, those cords of 

    death, are about them already. The <b>Savior</b> whom they slighted, is now 

    their <b>Judge</b>; and their Judge is their <b>enemy</b>! How then can they 

    hope? They have bolted the door of mercy against themselves, by their 

    unbelief. They have despised the remedy, and therefore must die without 

    mercy. They have no saving interest in Jesus Christ, the only channel of 

    conveyance through which mercy flows– and therefore they can never taste it.

    
<p align="justify">The 'sword of justice' guards the door of mercy, so as 

    none can enter in, but the members of the mystical body of Christ, over 

    whose head is a covert of atoning blood, the Mediator's blood. These indeed 

    may pass without a harm, for justice has nothing to require of them. But 

    others cannot pass, since they are not in Christ– death comes to them with 

    the sting in it– the sting of unpardoned guilt. It is armed against them 

    with all the force which the sanction of a holy law can give it. 1 Cor. 

    15:56, "The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law." When 

    that law was given on Sinai, "the whole mount quaked greatly," Exodus 19:18. 

    When the Redeemer was making satisfaction for the elect's breaking it, "the 

    earth did quake, and the rocks rent," Matt, 27:51. </p>
<p align="justify">What possible ground of hope, then, is there to the 

    wicked man, when death comes upon him armed with the force of this law? How 

    can he escape that fire, which "burnt unto the midst of heaven?" Deut. 4:11. 

    How shall he be able to stand in that smoke, that "ascended up as the smoke 

    of a furnace?" Exod. 19:18. How will he endure the terrible "thunders and 

    lightnings," verse 16, and dwell in "the darkness, clouds, and thick 

    darkness?" Deut. 4:11. All these comparisons heaped together do but faintly 

    represent the fearful tempest of wrath and indignation, which shall pursue 

    the wicked to the lowest hell; and forever abide on those who are driven to 

    darkness at death.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">3. Death roots up their delusive hopes of eternal 

    happiness</p></b>; then it is that their covenant with death and agreement with 

    hell, is broken. They are awakened out of their golden dreams, and at length 

    lift up their eyes; Job 8:14, "Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust 

    shall be a spider's web." They trust that all shall be well with them after 

    death– but their trust is as a web woven out of their own bowels, with a 

    great deal of art and industry. They wrap themselves up in their hope, as 

    the spider wraps herself in her web. But it is a weak and slender defense; 

    for however it may withstand the threatenings of the word of God; death, 

    that broom of destruction, will sweep them and it both away, so as there 

    shall not be the least shred of it left; and he, who this moment will not 

    let his hope go, shall next moment be utterly hopeless. Death overturns the 

    house built on the sand; it leaves no man under the power of delusion.
<b>
<p align="justify">4. Death makes their state absolutely and forever 

    hopeless.</p></b> Matters cannot be retrieved and amended after death. For, 
<b>
<p align="justify">1.</p></b> Time once gone can never be recalled. If cries or 

    tears, price or pains, could bring time back again, the wicked man might 

    have hope in his death. But tears of blood will not prevail! Nor will his <i>

    roaring</i> for millions of ages cause it to return! The sun will not stand 

    still for the sluggard to awake and enter on his journey; and when once it 

    is gone down, he needs not expect the night to be turned into day for his 

    sake– he must lodge through the long night of eternity, where his time left 

    him.
<b>
<p align="justify">2.</p></b> There is no returning to this life, to amend what 

    is amiss; it is a state of probation and trial, which terminates at death; 

    therefore we cannot return to it again; it is but once we thus live, and 

    once we die. Death carries the wicked man to "his own place," Acts 1:25. 

    This life is our working day. Death closes our day and our work together. We 

    may readily admit the wicked might have some hope in their death, if, after 

    death has opened their eyes, they could return to life, and have but the 

    trial of one Sabbath, one offer of Christ, one day, or but one hour more, to 

    make up their peace with God– but "man lies down, and rises not until the 

    heavens be no more; they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep," 

    Job 14:12. 
<b>
<p align="justify">3.</p></b> In the other world, men have no access to get 

    their ruined state and condition retrieved, though they be ever so desirous 

    of it. "For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the 

    grave, where you go," Eccl. 9:10. <i>Now</i> a man may flee from the wrath 

    to come; he may get into a refuge. But when once death has done its work, 

    "the door is shut!" there are no more offers of mercy, no more pardons– 

    where the tree is fallen, there it must lie.
<p align="justify">Let what has been said be carefully pondered; and that it 

    may be of use, let me exhort you,</p>
<u>
<p align="justify">First</p></u>, To take heed that you entertain no hopes of 

    heaven, but what are built on a solid foundation– tremble to think what fair 

    hopes of happiness death sweeps away, like cobwebs; how the hopes of many 

    are cut off, when they seem to themselves to be at the very threshold of 

    heaven; how, in the moment they expected to be carried by angels into 

    Abraham's bosom, into the regions of bliss and peace; they are carried by 

    devils into the society of the damned in hell, into the place of torment, 

    and regions of horror! 
<b>
<p align="justify">I beseech you to BEWARE– </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">1. Of a hope built upon ground that was never cleared. 

    The wise builder dug deep, Luke 6:48. Were your hopes of heaven never 

    shaken; but have you had good hopes all your days? Alas for it! you may see 

    the mystery of your case explained, Luke 11:21, When a strong man armed 

    keeps his palace, his goods are at peace. But if they have been shaken, take 

    heed lest some breaches only have been made in the old building, which you 

    have got repaired again, by ways and means of your own. I assure you, that 

    your hope, however fair a building it is, is not fit to trust to, unless 

    your old hopes have been razed, and you have built on a foundation quite 

    new. </p>
<p align="justify">2. Beware of that hope which looks bright in the dark, 

    but loses all its luster when it is set in the light of God's word, when it 

    is examined and tried by the touchstone of divine revelation, John 3:20, 21, 

    "for every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, 

    lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that does the truth, comes to the 

    light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God." 

    That hope, which cannot abide <i>scripture trial</i>, but sinks when 

    searched into by sacred truth, is a delusion, and not a true hope– for God's 

    word is always a friend to the graces of God's Spirit, and an enemy to 

    delusion. </p>
<p align="justify">3. Beware of that hope, which stands without being 

    supported by scriptural evidences. Alas! many are big with hopes, who cannot 

    give, because they really have not, any scripture grounds for them. You hope 

    that all will be well with you after death– but what word of God is it, on 

    which you have been caused to hope? Psalm 119:49. What scriptural evidence 

    have you to prove that yours is not the hope of the hypocrite? What have 

    you, after impartial self-examination, as in the sight of God, found in 

    yourself, which the word of God determines to be a sure evidence of his 

    right to eternal life, who is possessed of it? Numbers are ruined with such 

    hopes as stand unsupported by scriptural evidence. Men are fond and 

    tenacious of these hopes; but death will throw them down, and leave the 

    self-deceiver hopeless. </p>
<p align="justify">4. Beware of that hope of heaven, which does not prepare 

    and dispose you for heaven, which never makes your soul more holy, 1 John 

    3:3, "Every man that has this hope in him, purifies himself, even as he is 

    pure." The hope of the most part of men, is rather a hope to be free from 

    pain and torment in another life; than a hope of true happiness, the nature 

    whereof is not understood and discerned. Therefore it rests in sloth and 

    indolence, and does not excite to mortification and a heavenly life. So far 

    are they from hoping aright for heaven, that they must own, if they speak 

    their genuine sentiments, removing out of this world into any other place 

    whatever, is rather their <i>fear</i> than their <i>hope</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">The glory of the heavenly city does not at all draw their 

    hearts upwards to it, nor do they lift up their heads with joy, in the 

    prospect of arriving at it. If they had the true hope of the marriage day, 

    they would, as the bride, the "Lamb's wife," be "making themselves ready for 

    it," Rev. 19:7. But their hopes are produced by their sloth, and their sloth 

    is nourished by their hopes. Oh, Sirs, as you would not be driven away 

    helpless in your death, beware of these hopes! Raze them now, and build on a 

    new foundation, lest death leave not one stone of them upon another, and you 

    never be able to hope any more.</p>
<u>
<p align="justify">Secondly</p></u>, Hasten, O sinners, out of your wickedness, 

    out of your sinful state, and out of your wicked life, if you would not at 

    death be <i>driven</i> away in your wickedness! Remember the fatal end of 

    the wicked as the text represents it. I know there is a great difference in 

    the death of the wicked, as to some circumstances– but ALL of them, in their 

    death, agree in this, that they are driven away in their wickedness. Some of 

    them die <b>resolutely</b>, as if they scorned to be afraid; some in raging

    <b>despair</b>, so filled with horror that they cry out as if they were 

    already in hell; others in sullen <b>despondency</b>, oppressed with fears, 

    so that their hearts sink within them, at the remembrance of misspent time, 

    and the view which they have of eternity, having neither head nor heart to 

    do anything for their own relief. And others die <b>stupidly</b>; they live 

    like beasts, and they die like beasts, without any concern on their spirits, 

    about their eternal state. They groan under their <i>bodily</i> distress but 

    have no sense of the danger of their <i>soul! </i>One may, with almost as 

    much prospect of success, speak to a stone, as speak to them; vain is the 

    attempt to teach them; nothing that can be said moves them. To discourse to 

    them, either of the joys of heaven on the torments of hell, is to plough on 

    a rock, or beat the air. Some die like the <b>foolish</b> virgins, dreaming 

    of heaven; their foreheads are steeled against the fears of hell, with 

    presumptuous hopes of heaven. The business of those who would be useful to 

    them, is not to answer doubts about the case of their souls, but to discover 

    to them their own false hopes. But which way soever the unconverted man 

    dies, he is "driven away in his wickedness." 
<p align="justify">O dreadful case! Oh, let the consideration of so horrid a 

    departure out of this world, move you to flee to Jesus Christ, as the 

    all-sufficient Savior, an almighty Redeemer. Let it prevail to drive you out 

    of your wickedness, to holiness of heart and life. Though you reckon it 

    pleasant to live in wickedness, yet you cannot but own, it is bitter to die 

    in it. And if you leave it not in time, you must go on in your wickedness to 

    hell, the <i>proper</i> place of it, that it may be set there on its own 

    base. For when you are passing out of this world, all your sins, from the 

    first to the last of them, will swarm about you, hang upon you, accompany 

    you to the other world, and, as so many furies, surround you there forever.</p>
<u>
<p align="justify">Thirdly</p></u>, O be concerned for <i>others</i>, especially 

    for your relations, that they may not continue in their sinful natural 

    state, but be brought into a state of salvation; lest they be driven away in 

    their wickedness at death. What would you not do to prevent any of your 

    friends dying an untimely and violent death? But, alas! do you not see them 

    in hazard of being driven away in their wickedness! Is not death approaching 

    them, even the <i>youngest</i> of them? And are they not strangers to true 

    Christianity, remaining in that state which they came into the world? Oh! 

    make haste to pluck the brand out of the fire, lest it be burned to ashes! 

    The death of relations often leaves a sting in the hearts of those they 

    leave behind them, because they did not do for their souls as they had 

    opportunity; and because the opportunity is forever taken out of their 

    hands.
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>
<p align="justify">The state of the GODLY in death is a HOPEFUL state </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">We have seen the dark side of the cloud looking towards 

    ungodly men, passing out of the world; let us now take a view of the bright 

    side of it, shining on the godly, as they enter on their eternal state. In 

    discoursing on this subject, I shall <b>confirm</b> this doctrine, answer an

    <b>objection</b> against it, and then make some <b>practical improvement</b> 

    of the whole.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. For CONFIRMATION</p></b></font>, let it be observed, that 

    although the passage out of this world by death has a frightful aspect to 

    poor mortals, and to miscarry in it must needs be of fatal consequence; yet 

    the following circumstances make the state of the godly in their death, 

    happy and hopeful.
<b>
<p align="justify">1. They hare a trusty good Friend before them in the 

    other world.</p></b> Jesus Christ, their best Friend, is Lord of the land to 

    which death carries them. When Joseph sent for his father to come down to 

    him to Egypt, telling him, "God had made him lord over all Egypt," Gen. 

    45:9, "And Jacob "saw the wagons Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of 

    Jacob revived," verse 27. He resolves to undertake the journey. 
<p align="justify">I think, when the Lord calls a godly man out of the 

    world, he sends him such glad tidings, and such a kind invitation into the 

    other world, that, he has faith to believe it, his spirit must revive, when 

    he sees the 'wagon of death' which comes to carry him there. It is true, 

    indeed, he has a weighty trial to undergo– after death the judgment. But the 

    case of the godly is altogether hopeful; for the <i>Lord</i> of the land is 

    their <i>husband</i>, and their husband is the <i>judge</i>. "The Father has 

    committed all judgment unto the Son," John 5:22. Surely the case of the wife 

    is hopeful, when her own husband is her judge, even such a husband as hates 

    divorce. No husband is so loving and so tender of his spouse, as the Lord 

    Christ is of his. One would think it would be a very bad land, which a wife 

    would not willingly go to, where her husband is the ruler and judge.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, their judge is the <i>advocate</i>, 1 John 2:1, 

    "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." Therefore 

    they need not fear their being put back, and falling into condemnation. What 

    can be more favorable? Can they think, that he who pleads their cause, will 

    himself pass sentence against them? </p>
<p align="justify">Yet further, their advocate is their <i>Redeemer</i>; 

    they are "redeemed with the precious blood of Christ," 1 Pet. 1:18, 19. So 

    when he pleads for them, he is pleading his own cause. Though an advocate 

    may be careless of the interest of one who employs him, yet surely he will 

    do his utmost to</p>
<p align="justify">defend his <i>own</i> right, which he has purchased with 

    his money– and shall not their advocate defend the purchase of his own 

    blood?</p>
<p align="justify">But more than all that, their Redeemer is their <i>head</i>, 

    and they are his members, Eph. 5:23, 30. Though one were so silly as to let 

    his own <i>purchase</i> go, without standing up to defend his right, yet 

    surely he will not part with a <i>limb</i> of his own body. Is not their 

    case then hopeful in death, who are so closely linked and allied to the Lord 

    of the other world, who are "the keys of hell and of death?"</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. They shall have a safe passage to another world.</p></b> 

    They must indeed go through "the valley of the shadow of death;" but though 

    it be in itself a 'dark and shady valley', it shall be a 'valley of hope' to 

    them– they shall not be driven through it, but be as men in perfect safety, 

    who fear no evil, Psalm 23:4. 
<p align="justify">Why should they thus fear? They have the Lord of the 

    land's safe conduct, his pass sealed with his own blood; namely, the blessed 

    covenant, which is the saint's death-bed comfort, 2 Sam. 23:5, "Although my 

    house be not so with God, yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, 

    ordered in all things and sure– for this is all my salvation, and all my 

    desire, although he make it not to grow." Who then can harm them? It is safe 

    riding in Christ's chariot, Cant. 3:9, both through life and death. They 

    have good and honorable attendants– a guard, even a guard of angels. These 

    encamp about them in the time of their <i>life</i>; and surely will not 

    leave them in the day of their <i>death</i>. These happy ministering spirits 

    are attendants on their Lord's bride, and will doubtless convey her safe 

    home to his house. </p>
<p align="justify">When friends in mournful mood stand by the saint's 

    bedside, waiting to see him draw his last breath, his soul is waited for by 

    angels, to be carried into Abraham's bosom, Luke 16:22. The captain of the 

    saint's salvation is the captain of this holy guard– he was their guide even 

    unto death, and he will be their guide through it too, Psalm 23:4, "Yes, 

    though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no 

    evil; for you are with me." They may, without fear, pass that 'river', being 

    confident it shall not overflow them; and they may walk through that 'fire', 

    being sure they shall not be burnt by it.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Death can do them no harm!</p></i> It cannot even hurt their 

    bodies– for though it separate the soul from the body, it cannot separate 

    the body from the Lord Jesus Christ. Even death is to them but 'sleep in 

    Jesus', 1 Thess. 4:14. They continue members of Christ, though in a grave. 

    Their dust is precious dust; laid up in the grave as in their Lord's 

    cabinet. They lie in a grave 'mellowing', as precious fruit laid up to be 

    brought forth to him at the resurrection. The husbandman has corn in his 

    barn, and corn lying in the ground– the latter is more precious to him than 

    the former, because he looks to get it returned with increase. Even so the 

    dead bodies of the saints are valued by their Savior– they are "sown in 

    corruption," to be "raised in incorruption"; "sown in dishonor," to be 

    "raised in glory," 1 Cor. 15:42, 43. It cannot hurt their souls. It is with 

    the souls of the saints at death, as with Paul and his company in their 

    voyage, whereof we have the history, Acts, chapter 27. The ship was broken 

    to pieces, but the passengers got all safe to land. 
<p align="justify">When the dying saint's speech is stopped, his eyes set, 

    and his last breath drawn, the soul gets safe away into the heavenly 

    paradise, leaving the body to return to its earth, but in the joyful hope of 

    a reunion at its glorious resurrection. But how can death hurt the godly? It 

    is a foiled enemy– if it casts them down, it is only that they may rise more 

    glorious. "Our Savior Jesus Christ has abolished death," 2 Tim. 1:10. The 

    soul and life of it is gone– it is but a 'walking shadow' that may <i>fright</i>, 

    but cannot <i>hurt</i> saints– it is only the 'shadow of death' to them– it 

    is not the thing itself; their dying is 'but as dying', or 'somewhat like 

    dying'. </p>
<p align="justify">The apostle tells us, "It is Christ that died," Rom. 

    8:34. Stephen, the first Christian martyr, though stoned to death, yet only 

    'fell asleep', Acts 7:60. Certainly the nature of death is quite changed, 

    with respect to the saints. It is not to them, what it was to Jesus Christ 

    their head– it is not the venomed ruining thing, wrapped up in the sanction 

    of the first covenant, Gen. 2:17, "In the day you eat thereof, you shall 

    surely die." It comes to the godly without a sting– they may meet it with 

    that salutation, "O death, where is your sting?" Is this Mara? Is this 

    'bitter' death? It went out full into the world, when the first Adam opened 

    the door to it, but the second Adam has brought it again empty to his own 

    people. </p>
<p align="justify">I feel a <i>sting</i>, may the dying saint say– yet it is 

    but a bee sting, slinging only through the <i>skin</i>– but, O death, where 

    is your sting, your old sting, the serpent's sting, that stings to the <i>

    heart</i> and <i>soul? </i>The sting of death is sin– but that is taken 

    away. If death arrests the saint, and carries him before the Judge, to 

    answer for the debt he contracted, the debt will be found paid by the 

    glorious Surety; and he has the discharge to show. The <i>thorn of</i> <i>

    guilt</i> is pulled out of the man's conscience; and his name is blotted out 

    of the black roll, and written among the living in Jerusalem. </p>
<p align="justify">It is true, it is a great journey through the valley of 

    the shadow of death– but the saint's burden is taken away from his back, his 

    iniquity is pardoned, he may walk at ease– "No lion shall be there, nor any 

    ravenous beast," the redeemed may walk at leisure there, free from all 

    apprehensions of danger.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">3. They shall have a joyful entrance into the other 

    world.</p></b> Their arrival in the regions of bliss, will be celebrated with 

    rapturous hymns of praise to their glorious Redeemer. A <i>dying</i> day is 

    a <i>good</i> day to a godly man. Yes, it is his <i>best</i> day; it is 

    better to him than his birth-day, or than the most joyous day which he ever 

    had on earth. "A good name," says the wise man, is "better than precious 

    ointment– and the day of death, than the day of one's birth," Eccl. 7:1. 
<p align="justify">The notion of the immortality of the soul, and of future 

    happiness, which obtained among some pagan nations, had wonderful effects on 

    them. Some of them, when they mourned for the dead, did it in women's 

    apparel; that, being moved with the indecency of the garb, they might the 

    sooner lay aside their mourning. Others buried them without any lamentation 

    or mourning; but had a sacrifice, and a feast for friends, upon that 

    occasion. Some were used to mourn at births, and rejoice at burials. But the 

    practice of some Indian nations is yet more strange, where, upon the 

    husband's decease, his wife, or wives, with a cheerful countenance, enter 

    the flames prepared for the husband's corpse. </p>
<p align="justify">But however <i>false notions</i> of a future state, 

    assisted by pride, affectation of applause, apprehensions of difficulties in 

    this life, and such like principles proper to depraved human nature, may 

    influence crude uncultivated minds, when strengthened by the arts of hell; O 

    what solid joy and consolation may they have, who are true Christians, being 

    in Christ, who "has brought life and immortality to light through the 

    gospel!" 2 Tim. 1:10. Death is one of those "all things," that "work 

    together for good to those who love God," Rom. 8:28. When the <i>body</i> 

    dies, the <i>soul</i> is perfected– the 'body of death' goes off at the 

    'death of the body'.</p>
<p align="justify">What harm did the jailer to Pharaoh's butler, when he 

    opened the prison door to him, and let him out? Is the bird in worse case, 

    when at liberty, than when confined in a cage? Thus, and no worse, are the 

    souls of the saints treated by death. It comes to the godly man, as Haman 

    came to Mordecai, with the royal apparel and the horse, Esther 6:11, with 

    commission to do them honor, however awkwardly it be performed. I question 

    not but Haman performed the ceremony with a very ill mien, a pale face, a 

    downcast look, and a cloudy countenance, and like one who came to hang him, 

    rather than to honor him. But he whom the king delighted to honor, must be 

    honored; and Haman, Mordecai's grand enemy, must be the man employed to put 

    this honor upon him. Glory, glory, glory, blessing and praise to our 

    Redeemer, our Savior, our Mediator, by whose death, 'grim devouring death' 

    is made to do such a good office to those whom it might otherwise have 

    hurried away in their wickedness, to utter and eternal destruction! </p>
<p align="justify">A dying day is, in itself, a <i>joyful</i> day to the 

    godly; it is their redemption day, when the captives are delivered, when the 

    prisoners are set free. It is the day of the pilgrims coming home from their 

    pilgrimage; the day in which the heirs of glory return from their travels, 

    to their own country, and their Father's house; and enter into actual 

    possession of the glorious inheritance. It is their marriage day– now is the 

    time of espousals; but then the marriage is consummated, and a marriage 

    feast begun, which has no end. If so, is not the state of the godly in 

    death, a <i>hopeful</i> state?</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Objection</p></b></font>– "But if the state of the godly 

    in their death be so hopeful, how comes it to pass that many of them, when 

    dying, are full of fears, and have little hope?" 
<b>
<p align="justify">Answer</p></b>– It must be owned, that saints do not all die 

    in one and the same manner; there is a diversity among them, as well as 

    among the wicked; yet the <i>worst</i> case of a dying saint is indeed a <i>

    hopeful</i> one. Some die triumphantly, in a fnli assurance of faith. 2 

    Timothy 4:6-8, "The time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good 

    fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is 

    laid up for me a crown of righteousness." They get a taste of the joys of 

    heaven, while here on earth; and begin the songs of Zion, while yet in a 

    strange land. 
<p align="justify">Others die in a solid dependence of faith on their Lord 

    and Savior– though they cannot sing triumphantly, yet they can, and will say 

    confidently, "The Lord is their God." Though they cannot triumph over death, 

    with old Simeon, having Christ in his arms, and saying, "Lord now let your 

    servant depart in peace, according to your word– for my eyes have seen your 

    salvation," Luke 2:29, 30; yet they can say with dying Jacob, "I have waited 

    for your salvation, Lord," Gen. 49:18. His left hand is under their head, to 

    support them, though his right hand does not embrace them– they firmly 

    believe, though they are not filled with joy in believing. They can plead 

    the covenant, and hang by the promise, although their house is not so with 

    God as they could wish. </p>
<p align="justify">But the dying day of some saints may be like that day 

    mentioned in Zechariah 14:7, "Not day, nor night." They may die under great 

    doubts and fears; setting as it were in a cloud, and going to heaven in a 

    mist. They may go mourning without the sun, and never put off their spirit 

    of heaviness, until death strips them of it. They may be carried to heaven 

    through the confines of hell; and may be pursued by the devouring lion, even 

    to the very gates of the new Jerusalem; and may be compared to a ship almost 

    wrecked in sight of the harbor, which yet gets safe into her port, 1 Cor. 

    3:15, "If any man's work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss– but he 

    himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire." There is safety amid their 

    fears, but danger in the wicked's strongest confidence; and there is a 

    blessed seed of gladness in their greatest sorrows– "Light is sown for the 

    righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart," Psalm 97:11.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, saints are liable to such perplexity in their death, 

    because, though they are Christians indeed, yet they are men of like 

    passions with others; and <i>death is a frightful object in itself</i>, 

    whatever dress it appears in– the stern countenance with which it looks at 

    mortals, can hardly fail of causing them to shrink. Moreover, the saints are 

    of all men the most jealous of themselves. They think of eternity, and of a 

    tribunal, more deeply than others do; with them it is a more serious thing 

    to die, than the rest of mankind are aware of. They know the deceits of the 

    heart, the subtleties of depraved human nature, better than others do. 

    Therefore they may have much to do to keep up hope on a death-bed; while 

    others pass off quietly, like sheep to the slaughter; and the rather, that 

    Satan, who uses all his art to support the hopes of the hypocrite, will do 

    his utmost to mar the peace, and increase the fears, of the saint. </p>
<p align="justify">And finally, the bad frame of spirit, and ill condition, 

    in which death sometimes seizes a true Christian, may cause this perplexity. 

    By his being in the state of grace, he is indeed always habitually prepared 

    for death, and his dying safely is ensured– but yet there is more necessary 

    to his actual preparation and dying comfortably, his spirit must be in good 

    condition too.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore there are <b>three cases, in which death cannot 

    but be very uncomfortable to a child of God– </b></p>

<p align="justify">1. If it seizes him at a time when the guilt of some 

    particular sin, unrepented of, is lying on his conscience– and death comes 

    on that very account, to take him out of the land of the living; as was the 

    case of many of the Corinthian believers, 1 Cor. 11:30, "For this cause," 

    namely, of unworthy communicating, "many are weak and sickly among you, and 

    many sleep." If a person is surprised with the approach of death, while 

    lying under the guilt of some unpardoned sin, it cannot but cause a mighty 

    consternation. </p>
<p align="justify">2. When death catches him napping. The midnight cry must 

    be frightful to sleeping virgins. The man who lies in a ruinous house, and 

    awakes not until the timbers begin to crack, and the stones to drop down 

    about his ears, may indeed get out of it safely, but not without fears of 

    being crushed by its fall. When a Christian has been going on in a course of 

    security and backsliding, and awakens not until death comes to his bedside, 

    it is no wonder that he gets a fearful awakening. </p>
<p align="justify">3. When he has lost sight of his saving interest in 

    Christ, and cannot produce evidences of his title to heaven. It is hard to 

    meet death without some evidences of a title to eternal life at hand; hard 

    to go through the dark valley without the candle of the Lord shining upon 

    the head. It is a terrible adventure to launch out into eternity, when a man 

    can make no better of it than a leap in the dark, not knowing where he shall 

    land, whether in heaven or hell.</p>
<p align="justify">Nevertheless the state of the saints, in their death, is 

    always in itself hopeful. The presumptuous hopes of the ungodly, in their 

    death, cannot make their state hopeful; neither can the fears of a saint 

    make his state hopeless– for God judges according to the truth of the thing, 

    not according to men's opinions about it. Therefore the saints can be no 

    more altogether without hope, than they can be altogether without faith. 

    Their faith may be very weak, but it fails not; and their hope very low, yet 

    they will, and do hope to the end. Even while the godly seem to be carried 

    away with the stream of doubts and fears, there remains still as much hope 

    as determines them to lay hold on the tree of life that grows on the banks 

    of the river. Jonah 2:4, "Then I said, I am cast out of your sight– yet I 

    will look again toward your temple."</p>

</b>This speaks <b>comfort to the godly against the fear of death</b>. 

    A godly man may be called a happy man before his death, because, whatever 

    befalls him in life, he shall certainly be happy at death. You who are in 

    Christ, who are true Christians, have hope in your end; and such a hope as 

    may comfort you against all those fears which arise from the consideration 

    of a dying hour. This I shall branch out, in answering some cases briefly–

    
<b>
<p align="justify">Case 1</p></b>– "The prospect of death," will some of the 

    saints say, "is uneasy to me, not knowing what shall become of my family 

    when I am gone." 
<p align="justify">Answer. The righteous has hope in his death, as to his 

    family, as well as himself. Although you have little, for the present, to 

    live upon; which has been the condition of many of God's chosen ones, 1 Cor. 

    4:11, "We," namely, the apostles, "both hunger and thirst, and are naked, 

    and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;" and though you have 

    nothing to leave them, as was the case of that son of the prophets, who 

    feared the Lord, and yet died in debt which he was unable to pay, as his 

    poor widow represents, 2 Kings 4:2; yet you have a good Friend to leave them 

    to; a covenant God, to whom you may confidently commit them. "Leave your 

    fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust 

    in me." Jer. 49:11.</p>
<p align="justify">The world can bear witness of signal settlements made 

    upon the children of providence; such as by their pious parents have been 

    cast upon God's providential care. It has been often remarked, that they 

    lacked neither provision nor education. Moses is an eminent instance of 

    this. He, though he was an outcast infant, Exod. 2:3, yet became learned in 

    all the wisdom of the Egyptians, Acts 7:22, and became king in Jeshurun, 

    Deut. 33:5. O! may we not be ashamed, that we do not confidently trust him 

    with the concerns of our families, to whom, as our Savior and Redeemer, we 

    have committed our eternal interests?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Case 2</p></b>– "Death will take us away from our dear 

    friends; yes, we shall not see the Lord in the land of the living, in the 

    blessed ordinances." 
<p align="justify">Answer– It will take you to your best Friend, the Lord 

    Christ. The friends you leave behind you, if they be indeed people of worth, 

    you will meet again, when they come to heaven, and you will never be 

    separated any more. If death takes you away from the temple below, it will 

    carry you to the temple above. It will indeed take you from the <i>streams</i>, 

    but it will set you down by the <i>fountain</i>. If it puts out your candle, 

    it will carry you where there is no night, where there is an eternal day.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Case 3</p></b>– "I have so much to do, in time of health, to 

    satisfy myself as to my interest in Christ, about my being a real Christian, 

    a regenerate man, that I judge it is almost impossible I should die 

    comfortably." 
<p align="justify">Answer– If it is thus with you, then double your 

    diligence to make your calling and election sure. Endeavor to grow in 

    knowledge, and walk closely with God– be diligent in self-examination; and 

    pray earnestly for the Holy Spirit, whereby you may know the things freely 

    given you of God. If you are enabled, by the power and Spirit of Christ, 

    thus diligently to prosecute your spiritual concerns, though the time of 

    your life be neither day nor night, yet at evening time it may be light. </p>
<p align="justify">Many weak Christians indulge doubts and fears about their 

    spiritual state, as if they placed at least some part of religion in their 

    imprudent practice; but towards the end of life, they think and act in 

    another manner. The traveler, who reckons that he has time to spare, may 

    stand still debating with himself, whether this or the other be the right 

    way– but when the sun begins to set, he is forced to lay aside his scruples, 

    and resolutely to go forward in the road which he judges to be the right 

    one, lest he lie all night in the open fields. Thus some Christians, who 

    perplex themselves much, throughout the course of their lives, with jealous 

    doubts and fears, content themselves when they come to die, with such 

    evidences of the safety of their state, as they could not be satisfied with 

    before; and by disputing less against themselves, and believing more, court 

    the peace they formerly rejected, and gain it too.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Case 4</p></b>– "I am under a sad decay, in respect of my 

    spiritual condition." 
<p align="justify">Answer– Bodily consumptions may make death easy– but it 

    is not so in spiritual decays. I will not say, that a godly man cannot be 

    easy in such a case, when he dies, but I believe it is rarely so. 

    Ordinarily, I suppose a cry comes to awaken sleeping virgins, before death 

    comes. Samson is set to grind in the prison, until his locks grow again. 

    David and Solomon fell under great spiritual decays; but before they died, 

    they recovered their spiritual strength and vigor. However, bestir 

    yourselves without delay, to strengthen the things that remain– your fright 

    will be the less, for being awakened from spiritual sleep before death comes 

    to your bedside– and you ought to lose no time, seeing you know not how soon 

    death may seize you.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Case 5</b>– "It is terrible to think of the other 

    world, that world of spirits, which I have so little acquaintance with."</p>
<p align="justify">Answer– Your best friend is Lord of that other world. 

    Abraham's bosom is kindly even to those who never saw his face. After death, 

    your soul becomes capable of converse with the blessed inhabitants of that 

    other world. The spirits of just men made perfect, were once such as your 

    spirit now is. And as for the angels, however superior their nature in the 

    rank of beings, yet our nature is dignified above theirs, in the man Christ, 

    and they are all of them your Lord's servants, and so your fellow-servants.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Case 6</p></b>– "The pangs of death are terrible." 
<p align="justify">Answer– Yet not so terrible as pangs of conscience, 

    caused by a piercing sense of guilt, and apprehensions of divine wrath, with 

    which I suppose them to be not altogether unacquainted. But who would not 

    endure bodily sickness, that the soul may become sound, and every whit 

    whole? Each pang of death will set sin a step nearer the door; and with the 

    last breath, the body of sin will breathe out its last. The pains of death 

    will not last long; and the Lord your God will not leave, but support you 

    under them.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Case 7</p></b>– "But I am likely to be cut off in the midst 

    of my days." 
<p align="justify">Answer– Do not complain, you will be the sooner at home– 

    you thereby have the advantage of your fellow-laborers, who were at work 

    before you in the vineyard. God, in the course of his providence, hides some 

    of his saints early in the grave, that they may be taken away from the evil 

    to come. An early removal out of this world, prevents much sin and misery. 

    They have no ground of complaint, who get the residue of their years in 

    Immanuel's land. Surely you shall live as long as you have work cut out for 

    you by the great Master, to be done for him in this world– and when that is 

    at an end, it is high time to be gone.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Case 8</p></b>– "I am afraid of sudden death." 
<p align="justify">Answer– You may indeed die so. Good Eli died suddenly, 1 

    Sam. 4:18. Yet death found him watching, ver. 13. "Watch, therefore, for you 

    know not what hour the Lord does come," Matt. 24:42. But be not afraid, it 

    is an inexpressible comfort, that death, come when it will, can never catch 

    you out of Christ; and therefore can never seize you, as a jailor, to hurry 

    you into the prison of hell. Sudden death may hasten and facilitate your 

    passage to heaven, but can do you no prejudice.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Case 9</p></b>– "I am afraid it will be my lot to die lacking 

    the exercise of reason." 
<p align="justify">Answer– I make no question but a child of God, a true 

    Christian, may die in this case. But what harm? There is no hazard in it, as 

    to his eternal state– a disease at death may divest him of his reason, but 

    not of his religion. When a man, going on a long voyage, has put his affairs 

    in order, and put all his goods aboard, he himself may he carried on board 

    the ship sleeping– all is safe with him, although he knows not where he is, 

    until he awake in the ship. Even so the godly man, who dies in this case, 

    may die uncomfortably, but not unsafely.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Case 10</p></b>– "I am naturally timorous, and the very 

    thoughts of death are terrible to me." 
<p align="justify">Answer– The less you think on death, the thoughts of it 

    will be the more frightful– make it familiar to you by frequent meditations 

    upon it, and you may thereby quiet your fears. Look at the white and bright 

    side of the cloud– take faith's view of the city that has foundations; so 

    shall you see hope in your death. Be duly affected with the body of sin and 

    death, the frequent interruptions of your communion with God, and with the 

    glory which dwells on the other side of death– this will contribute much to 

    remove slavish fear.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">It is a pity that saints should be so fond of life</p></i> as 

    they often are– they ought to be always on good terms with death. When 

    matters are duly considered, it might be well expected that every child of 

    God, every regenerate man, should generously profess concerning this life, 

    what Job did, chap. 7:16, "I loath it, I would not live always." In order to 

    gain their hearts to this desirable temper, I offer the following additional 

    considerations.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Consider the SINFULNESS that attends life in this 

    world.</p></b> </font>While you live here, you sin, and see others sinning. You 

    breathe infectious air. You live in pest-house. Is it at all strange to 

    loathe such a life? 
<p align="justify">1. Your <b>own</b> plague sores are running on you. Does 

    not the sin of your nature make you groan daily? Are you not sensible, that 

    though the cure is begun, it is far from being perfected? Has not the 

    leprosy got into the walls of the house, which cannot be removed without 

    pulling it down? Is not your nature so vitiated, that no less than the 

    separation of the soul from the body can root out the disease? Have you not 

    your sores without, as well as your sickness within? Do you not leave marks 

    of your pollution on whatever passes through your hands? Are not all your 

    actions tainted and blemished with defects and imperfections? Who, then, 

    should be much in love with life, but such whose sickness is their health, 

    and who glory in their shame? </p>
<p align="justify">2. The loathsome sores of <b>others</b> are always before 

    your eyes, go where you will. The follies and wickedness of men are 

    everywhere conspicuous, and make but an unpleasant scene. This sinful world 

    is but an unsightly company, a disagreeable crowd, in which the most 

    loathsome are the most numerous. </p>
<p align="justify">3. Are not your own sores often breaking out again after 

    healing? Frequent <b>relapses</b> may well cause us remit of our fondness 

    for this life. To be ever struggling, and anon falling into the mire again, 

    makes weary work. Do you never wish for cold death, thereby effectually to 

    cool the heat of these lusts, which so often take fire again, even after a 

    flood of godly sorrow has gone over them? </p>
<p align="justify">4. Do not you sometimes <b>infect </b>others, and others 

    infect you? There is no society in the world, in which every member of it 

    does not sometimes lay a stumbling-block before the rest. The best carry 

    about with them the tinder of a corrupt nature, which they cannot be rid of 

    while they live, and which is liable to be kindled at all times, and in all 

    places– yes, they are apt to inflame others, and become the occasions of 

    sinning. Certainly these things are apt to embitter this life to the saints.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Consider the MISERY and TROUBLES that attend it.</p></b></font> 

    Rest is desirable, but it is not to be found on this side of the grave. 

    Worldly troubles attend all men in this life. This world is a sea of 

    trouble, where one wave rolls upon another. They who fancy themselves beyond 

    the reach of trouble, are mistaken– no state, no stage of life, is exempted 

    from it. The <i>crowned head</i> is surrounded by thorny cares. <i>Honor</i> 

    many times paves the way to deep disgrace. <i>Riches</i>, for the most part, 

    are kept to the hurt of the owners. The fairest rose lacks not prickles; and 

    the heaviest cross is sometimes wrapped up in the greatest earthly comfort.

    
<p align="justify"><i>Spiritual troubles</i> attend the saints in this life. 

    They are like travelers journeying in a cloudy night, in which the moon 

    sometimes breaks out from under one cloud, but quickly hides her head again 

    under another– no wonder they long to be at their journey's end. The sudden 

    alterations which the best frame of spirit is liable to, the perplexing 

    doubts, confounding fears, short-lived joys, and long-running sorrows, which 

    have a certain affinity with the present life, must needs create in the 

    saints<i> a desire to be with Christ, which is best of all.</i></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. Consider the great IMPERFECTIONS attending this 

    life.</p></b> </font>While the soul is lodged in this cottage of clay, the 

    necessities of the body are many– it is always craving. The mud walls must 

    be repaired and patched up daily, until the clay cottage falls down for good 

    and all. Eating, drinking, sleeping, and the like, are, in themselves, but 

    base employments for a rational creature; and will be reputed such by the 

    heaven-born soul. They are 'badges of imperfection', and, as such, 

    unpleasant to the mind aspiring unto that life and immortality which is 

    brought to light through the gospel; and would be very grievous, if this 

    state of things were of long continuance. 
<p align="justify">Does not the gracious <i>soul</i> often find itself yoked 

    with the <i>body</i>, as with a companion in travel, unable to keep pace 

    with it? When the spirit is willing, the flesh is weak. When the soul would 

    mount upward, the body is a clog upon it, and a stone tied to the foot of a 

    bird attempting to fly. The truth is, O believer, your soul in this body is, 

    at best, but like a diamond in a ring, where much of it is obscured; it is 

    far sunk in the vile clay, until relieved by death.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    I conclude this subject with a few <font color="#ff0000"><b>DIRECTIONS how 

    to prepare for death</b></font>, so that we may die comfortably. I speak not 

    here of habitual preparation for death, which a true Christian, in virtue of 

    his gracious state, never lacks, from the time he is born again, and united 

    to Christ; but of actual preparation, or readiness in respect of his 

    particular case, frame, and disposition of mind and spirit; the lack of 

    which makes even a saint very unfit to die.</p>
<u>
<p align="justify">First</p></u>, Let it be your constant care to

    <font color="#0000ff"><b>keep a clean conscience</b></font>, "A conscience 

    void of offence toward God, and toward man," Acts 24:16. Beware of a 

    standing controversy between God and you, on the account of some iniquity 

    regarded in the heart. When an honest man is about to leave his country, and 

    not to return, he settles accounts with those he had dealings with, and lays 

    down methods for paying his debts in due time, lest he be reckoned a 

    bankrupt, and arrested by an officer when he is going off. Guilt lying on 

    the conscience, is a fountain of fears, and will readily sting severely, 

    when death stares the criminal in the face. Hence it is, that many, even of 

    God's children, when dying, wish passionately, and desire eagerly, that they 

    may live to do what they ought to have done before that time. 
<p align="justify">Therefore, walk closely with God; be diligent, strict, 

    and exact in your course– beware of loose, careless, and irregular 

    conversation; as you would not lay up for yourselves anguish and bitterness 

    of spirit, in a dying hour. And because, through the infirmity cleaving to 

    us, in our present state of imperfection, in many things we offend all, 

    renew your repentance daily, and be ever washing in the Redeemer's blood. As 

    long as you are in the world, you will need to wash your feet, John 13:10, 

    that is, to make application of the blood of Christ anew, for purging your 

    consciences from the guilt of daily miscarriages. Let death find you at the 

    'fountain'; and, if so, it will find you ready to answer at its call.</p>
<u>
<p align="justify">Secondly</p></u>, <font color="#0000ff"><b>Be always 

    watchful, waiting for your change</b></font>, "like unto men that wait for 

    their Lord– that when he comes and knocks, they may open unto him 

    immediately," Luke 12:36. Beware of "slumbering and sleeping, while the 

    bridegroom tarries." To be awakened out of spiritual slumber, by a 

    surprising call to pass into another world, is a very frightful thing– but 

    he who is daily waiting for the coming of his Lord, will comfortably receive 

    the 'grim messenger', while he beholds him ushering in him, of whom he may 

    confidently say, "This is my God, and I nave waited for him." The way to die 

    comfortably, is, to die daily! Be often essaying, as it were, to die. Bring 

    yourselves familiarly acquainted with death, by making many visits to the 

    grave, in serious meditations upon it. This was Job's practice, chapter 

    27:13, 14, "I have made my bed in the darkness." Go and do likewise; and 

    when death comes, you shall have nothing to do but to lie down. "I have said 

    to corruption, You are my father– to the worm, You are my mother and my 

    sister." You say so too; and you will be the fitter to go home to their 

    house. 
<p align="justify">Be frequently reflecting upon your conduct, and 

    considering what course of life you wish to be found in, when death arrests 

    you; and act accordingly. When you do the duties of your station in life, or 

    are employed in acts of worship, think with yourselves, that, it may be, 

    this is the last opportunity; and therefore do it as if you were never to do 

    more of that kind. When you lie down at night, compose your spirits, as if 

    you were not to awake until the heavens be no more. And when you awake in 

    the morning, consider that new day as your last; and live accordingly. 

    Surely that night comes, of which you will never see the morning; or that 

    morning, of which you will never see the night. But which of your mornings 

    or nights will be such, you know not.</p>
<p align="justify"><u>Thirdly</u>, <font color="#0000ff"><b>Employ 

    yourselves much in weaning your hearts from the world.</b></font> The man 

    who is making ready to go abroad, busies himself in taking leave of his 

    friends. Let the mantle of earthly enjoyments hang loose about you; that it 

    may be easily dropped, when death comes to carry you away into another 

    world. Moderate your affections towards your lawful comforts of life– let 

    not your hearts be too much taken with them. The traveler acts unwisely, who 

    allows himself to be so allured with the 'conveniences of the inn' where he 

    lodges, as to make his necessary departure from it grievous. Feed with fear, 

    and walk through the world as pilgrims and strangers. Just as, when the corn 

    is forsaking the ground, it is ready for the sickle; when the fruit is ripe, 

    it falls off the tree easily; so, when a Christian's heart is truly weaned 

    from the world, he is prepared for death, and it will be the more easy to 

    him. A heart disengaged from the world is a heavenly one– we are ready for 

    heaven when our heart is there before us, Matt. 6:21.</p>
<u>
<p align="justify">Fourthly</p></u>, <font color="#0000ff"><b>Be diligent in 

    gathering and laying up evidences of your title to heaven</b></font>, for 

    your support and comfort at the hour of death. The neglect thereof mars the 

    joy and consolation which some Christians might otherwise have at their 

    death. Therefore, examine yourselves frequently as to your spiritual state; 

    that evidences which lie hid and unobserved, may be brought to light and 

    taken notice of. And if you would manage this work successfully, make 

    solemn, serious work of it. Set apart some time for it. And, after earnest 

    prayer to God, through Jesus Christ, for the enlightening influences of his 

    Holy Spirit, whereby you are enabled to understand his own word, and to 

    discern his own work in your souls; examine yourselves before the tribunal 

    of your own consciences, that you may judge yourselves, in this weighty 

    matter.
<p align="justify">And, in the first place, let the marks of a regenerate 

    state be fixed from the Lord's Word– have recourse to some particular text 

    for that purpose; such as Prov. 8:17, "I love those who love me." Compare 

    Luke 14:26, "If any man comes to me, and hates not his father, and mother, 

    and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yes, and his own life 

    also, he cannot be my disciple." Psalm 119:6, "Then shall I not be ashamed, 

    when I have respect unto all your commandments." Psalm 18:23, "I was also 

    upright before him; and I kept myself from my iniquity." Compare Romans 

    7:22, 23, "For I delight in the law of God, after the inward man– but I see 

    another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind." 1 John 3:3, 

    "Every man that has this hope in him, purifies himself, even as he is pure." 

    Matt. 5:3, "Blessed are the poor in spirit– for theirs is the kingdom of 

    heaven." Phil. 3:3, "For we are the circumcision, which worship," or serve 

    "God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in 

    the flesh."</p>
<p align="justify">The sum of the evidence arising from these texts, lies 

    here– a real Christian is one who loves God for himself, as well as for his 

    benefits; and that with a supreme love, above all persons, and all things; 

    he has an weighty and impartial regard to God's commands; he opposes and 

    wrestles against that sin, which of all others most easily besets him; he 

    approves and loves the holy law, even in that very point wherein it strikes 

    against his own beloved lust; his hope of heaven engages him to the study of 

    universal holiness; in which he aims at perfection, though he cannot reach 

    it in this life; he serves the Lord, not only in acts of worship, but in the 

    whole of his conversation; and as to both, is spiritual in the principle, 

    motives, aims, and ends of his service; yet he sees nothing in himself to 

    trust to, before the Lord; Christ and his fullness are the stay of his soul; 

    his confidence is cut off from all that is not Christ, or in Christ, in 

    point of justification or acceptance with God, and in point of 

    sanctification too. Everyone, in whom these characters are found, has a 

    title to heaven, according to the word. It is convenient and profitable to 

    mark such texts, for this special use, as they occur, while you read the 

    Scriptures, or hear sermons.</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">The marks of a regenerate state thus fixed, in the next 

    place <b>impartially search and test your own hearts</b> thereby, as in the 

    sight of God, with dependence on him for spiritual discernment, that you may 

    know whether they be in you or not. When you find them, form the conclusion 

    deliberately and distinctly; namely, that therefore you are regenerated, and 

    have a title to heaven. Thus you may gather evidences. But be sure to have 

    recourse to God in Christ, by earnest prayer, for the testimony of the 

    Spirit, whose office it is to "bear witness with our spirit, that we are the 

    children of God," Rom. 8:16. </p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, carefully observe the course and method of <b>

    providence</b> towards you; and likewise, how your soul is affected under 

    the same, in the various steps thereof– compare both with Scripture 

    doctrines, promises, threatenings, and examples– so shall you perceive if 

    the Lord deals with you as he always does unto those who love his name, and 

    if you are going forth by the footsteps of the flock. This may afford you 

    comfortable evidence. Walk tenderly and circumspectly, and the Lord will 

    manifest himself to you, according to his promise, John 14:21, "He who has 

    my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and he that loves 

    me, shall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest 

    myself to him." But it is in vain to think of successful self-examination, 

    if you are loose and irregular in your walk.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Dispatch the work of your day and generation with 

    speed and diligence. David, "after he had served his own generation by the 

    will of God, fell asleep" Acts 13:36. God has allotted us certain pieces of 

    work of this kind, which ought to be dispatched before the time of working 

    be over, Eccl. 9:10, "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might– 

    for there is no work, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, where you are 

    going." Gal. 6:10, "As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto 

    all men, especially unto those who are of the household of faith." If a 

    passenger, after he has gotten on ship, and the ship is getting under sail, 

    remembers that he has omitted to dispatch a piece of necessary business when 

    be was ashore, it must needs be uneasy to him. Even so, reflection in a 

    dying hour upon neglected seasons, and lost opportunities, cannot fail to 

    disquiet a Christian. Therefore, whatever is incumbent upon you to do for 

    God's honor, and the good of others, either as the duty of your station, or 

    by special opportunity put into your hand, perform it seasonably, if you 

    would die comfortably.</p>
