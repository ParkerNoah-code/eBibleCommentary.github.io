          2 Timothy 2:1 "You therefore my son, be strong in the grace that is in
          Christ Jesus."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IN his banqueting house, Christ displays his banner of love over his
          people. For those who are fed at his table must arise and fight their
          way to Immanuel's land, to which they have professed themselves to be
          traveling. And our text is an exhortation to animate them in their
          journey. "You therefore my son, be strong in the grace that is in
          Christ Jesus."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These words are a practical inference drawn from the doctrine of the
          preceding chapter, namely, that God had already bestowed on Timothy,
          and the rest of the saints, great things, verses 7–9. That the gospel
          was such a noble cause that none need to be ashamed of suffering on
          the account of it, verse 10, 11, 12. That God is able to see to his
          people in all circumstances and make a good account of them at last,
          verse 12. That there was a great falling away from the good ways of
          the Lord, verse 15. From all which he exhorts Timothy to be strong. In
          the text we have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The compilation my son. Paul was an aged man, Timothy was young.
          Elder Christians should excite and animate the younger sort to the
          vigorous pursuit of religion. In this case surely days should speak.
          It is a chief part of our generation work, to be concerned for a right
          turn to the rising generation. And the slackness in this, owing partly
          to the untowardness of the younger sort, and partly to the elder,
          their falling from their first love, is a sad prognostic of worse days
          following our evil days, if sovereign grace do not interpose.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Paul had a peculiar respect to Timothy. If he had not begotten him to
          the faith, he had surely instructed him more fully in it, and had him
          often with him. If there be any to whom we bear a peculiar regard, we
          ought to show it in a peculiar concern for the welfare of their souls.
          And therefore as we ought to have a peculiar regard to our families,
          we should show it by a peculiar concern for the welfare of their
          souls, in instructing, and inciting them to the good ways of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There is a necessary duty to which he incites him. Be strong. He
          supposes that both as a minister and as a Christian, he would meet
          with opposition in an evil world, and that he behooved not to be
          driven out of his Christian course by it, nor faint and give it over:
          but he wills him valiantly to stand his ground, and go on his way
          through all the difficulties with which he might meet.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. He gives him true advice, what way he might do this. "Be strong in
          the grace that is in Christ Jesus." Some take this for the thing about
          which he was to be strong, As if he had said, be strong in preaching
          the grace that is in Christ Jesus. This, I doubt not, is the great
          thing ministers are called to aim at in their preaching; even to
          preach the unsearchable riches of Christ. All other preaching without
          it will never make good Christians. In this grace only is discovered
          the way of justifying the guilty, and sanctifying the unholy. But yet
          I think the simple, plain, and native import of the words, which is
          always the preferable, is to direct Timothy to the grace treasured up
          in Christ, to be communicated to his members, in partaking of which,
          out of weakness, he might be made strong, Ephesians 6:10. "Finally, my
          brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine.—They who have a mind for Heaven, must be strong, and that in
          the grace which is in Christ Jesus, if ever they would get there. In
          prosecuting this doctrine, I shall,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Consider this duty incumbent on all who have a mind for Heaven,
          namely, to be strong.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I shall consider the direction, namely, that those who would be
          strong, "Must be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus." I am
          then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To consider this duty incumbent on all who have a mind for Heaven,
          namely, to be strong.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Here I shall state and answer two questions.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question 1st. What is it to be strong in the sense of the text? And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It presupposes one thing, namely, they must be spiritually alive. A
          sick man has some strength, but a dead man has none at all. A child of
          God has a little strength, when he is even weakest. But the ungodly
          are quite destitute of spiritual strength. "For when we were without
          strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly." If you be not born
          again, and really united to the Lord Jesus by his quickening Spirit
          dwelling in you, your carcases will fall in the wilderness, though you
          have eaten at the Lord's table. "For except a man be born again, he
          cannot see the kingdom of God. If a man, says Jesus, abide not in me,
          he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them and
          cast them into the fire, and they are burned." Why is it that many
          cannot resist a temptation, but are led captive by it, and cannot do
          one duty in a right manner? Why, but because their living lusts prey
          upon their souls without resistance; because their souls are
          spiritually dead. O communicants see to your state.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">To be strong imports three things.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. To be ready for action, according to the difficulties you may meet
          with in your way. "Let your loins be girded about, and your lights
          burning." No person will get to Heaven sleeping. Heaven is a rest, and
          that supposes those who come there, not to be loiterers, but laborers.
          "Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall
          after the same example of unbelief." The promise is to him that
          overcomes, though not for his, but Christ's overcoming, Revelation
          3:21. The wind will be in your face, if you set your face heavenward
          in good earnest; so you must be strong, and prepared to make your way
          against it, however hard it blow.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That you be resolved. Thus David exhorts Solomon, "Take heed now,
          said he, for the Lord has chosen you, to build an house for the
          sanctuary: be strong and do it." That is, be fully resolved and
          peremptory, so as not to be diverted by any emerging difficulties. O
          Christians, communicants, put on a resoluteness of spirit to be
          forward in your way to Heaven, come what will. "Have your feet shod
          with the preparation of the gospel of peace; and cleave unto the Lord,
          with purpose of heart." If this resolute purpose be not formed in your
          hearts by grace, you will never get safe to your journey's end. For if
          you be of those that may be broken, you will be broken; in regard you
          will be tried to the utmost, to cause you to give it over.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It imports that you be of good courage. Say to them that are of a
          fearful heart, be strong, fear not. Put on holy courage to face the
          difficulties you may meet with in your Christian course. When the
          heart fails in such encounters, the hands must needs hang down; and
          therefore unbelief is a worm at the root of all Christian endeavors.
          But faith animates a Christian, inspires his soul with holy courage,
          and so causes him to go through the most difficult steps of his way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question: 2nd. What need is there to be strong? If you have no mind
          for Heaven, you may fold your hands and lie at your ease; the flood
          runs strong enough to carry you of itself to destruction, where there
          is no rowing against the stream. But if you mind for Heaven, you have
          need to be strong. For,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. You have much work before you. The work of your own salvation is
          upon your hand, Philippians 2:12. You have also to serve your
          generation, by the will of God. You have much work laid to your hand.
          Though it is not doing and working, but believing that is required of
          you to enter you into the covenant personally, and to interest you
          savingly in Jesus Christ, and his salvation; yet being in the covenant
          in Christ, by faith, you have as much to do, as the broad law of the
          ten commandments carries out to you in first and second table duties.
          And if you habitually and knowingly neglect any of them, you will
          thereby evidence, that you are yet lying in your natural state, quite
          without strength, and without Christ. You will not want suffering work
          also. "For we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of
          God." We may assure you of private sufferings. For every follower of
          Christ, must take up his own cross. And you have need to lay your
          account with public sufferings also; for they are so usual in the
          cause of religion, that all Christ's disciples are martyrs, though not
          in action, yet in affection and resolution. So you need to be strong.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You will meet with much opposition in your work. Satan is a strong
          enemy, and he will be at your right hand to resist you. The world also
          will oppose you in your work. The men of the world will be agents for
          the devil against you. You will have the weight of their example to
          strive against, and perhaps their tongues and hands will both be
          employed to divert you from your work. The things of the world, the
          cares of it, the smiles and frowns of it will be of a malignant
          tendency in this case. And above all your own corrupt hearts will be
          your most dangerous opposers. This made Paul complain, "O wretched man
          that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death." All
          these will work against you; so that in your Christian course, you
          will find yourselves obliged to work as the builders of the walls of
          Jerusalem did, with the trowel in the one hand, and the sword in the
          other. So you have need to be strong. I now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To consider the direction, namely, that those who would be strong,
          must be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Here I shall state and answer three questions.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question: 1st. What is the grace that is in Christ Jesus? It is
          twofold.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Relative grace, that is the free favor of God to poor sinners, by
          which they are embraced in the arms of his love unto salvation. "But
          we believe that through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we shall
          be saved, even as they." This is only to be found in Christ, and no
          ways in our works and doings. He alone is the mercy-seat, where a
          guilty creature can meet with God comfortably. Every the least
          gracious smile given by a holy God, to any of fallen Adam's race, is
          and will be forever through the wounds of a crucified Redeemer. And a
          guilty creature can never draw strength for obedience from an absolute
          God, a God out of Christ. But on the contrary a broad view of him as
          such, is enough to loose every joint of his soul and body, and leave
          him weak as water. But in Christ the believer has that grace, by which
          the curse is taken away, his person justified, and his works accepted.
          And this is a foundation upon which we may be strong. It is a spring
          of holy strength, resolution and courage.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Real grace, that is the fullness of the Spirit, and his graces,
          lodged in Jesus Christ, as the fountain and head of influences, from
          which they are to be derived, into all his members. "For it has
          pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness dwell. And out of
          his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace." The unholy
          creature could never have had immediate access to God, no, not for
          sanctification. The curse lay upon him, which in point of justice,
          barred the emanation of sanctifying influences. But the fullness of
          the Spirit of holiness, the purchase of Christ's death and
          satisfaction, is lodged in Christ to be communicated; so the union
          between Christ and the soul, being once constituted, and the curse
          removed, the soul has access to the continual supply of the Spirit of
          holiness. In Christ then there is a fullness of grace, of light, life,
          strength, and whatever is necessary to nourish the new creature, to
          carry it on to perfection, and continue it forever in that perfection.
          So the believer has all in Christ, that is necessary, to carry on and
          complete his begun salvation, "and so is complete in him, who is the
          head of all principality and power."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question: 2nd. What is it to be strong in the grace that is in Christ
          Jesus?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is to be animated to duty by the faith of that grace that is in
          Christ Jesus for us, both relative and real. "Forasmuch then as Christ
          has suffered for us, in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the
          same mind." The same mind, that is the believing consideration of it.
          "I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me." The faith
          of strength and grace in Jesus Christ, by which we may be enabled to
          perform duty; and of favor and grace in him by which our work when
          done may be accepted, cannot fail of exciting and strengthening to
          duty, according to the measure of it, and of making men resolute and
          courageous in their Christian course. "For the which cause I also
          suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed; for I know whom I
          have believed, I am persuaded he is able to keep that which I have
          committed unto him against that day." And according as the faith of
          either of these do fail, the Christian's heart will faint and his
          hands hang down, as unfit for work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is to be strengthened to duty by supplies of grace, derived from
          Christ Jesus by faith. "He who eats me, says Jesus, even he shall live
          by me." And says Paul, "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I
          live; yet not I, but Christ that lives in me; and the life which I now
          live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved
          me, and gave himself for me." There is a real communication between a
          full Christ and an empty soul in the way of believing, by which the
          dark soul is enlightened, the weak strengthened, and the unholy
          sanctified; however mysterious it is to the world. Hence it is the
          saints have done such great things, and suffered such great things,
          and all through faith as the apostle shows, Hebrews 11. Why is it that
          the goodness of many is like the morning cloud and the early dew, but
          that their pretended faith is like a pipe laid short of the fountain?
          The little water that is in it runs out, and there is no more comes in
          because it communicates not with the spring. And why are believers so
          often in a withered condition, but because they are not in the
          exercise of faith, the pipe is stopped.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question: 3d. Why must those that would be strong, be strong in the
          grace that is in Christ Jesus?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because all those that would be strong, must be strong as members
          of Christ, as branches of the vine. "I am the vine, you are the
          branches: he who abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth
          much fruit; for without me you can do nothing." Now it is evident that
          the strongest limb will fail if the communication between it and the
          head and heart do fail: and so will the branch wither, if the
          communication between it and the stock be stopped.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because the grace that is in Christ Jesus, is only sufficient to
          bear us through. "My grace, says he is sufficient for you; for my
          strength is made perfect in weakness." There is nothing in us to which
          we may safely trust, and place confidence upon it, either for
          justification or sanctification. "My soul wait you only upon God, for
          my expectation is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation: he is
          my defense, I shall not be moved." Hence the saints are described, "as
          being the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice
          in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Use. 1. Of information. This shows us,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That such whose spirits are so softened with the love of their
          lusts, and world's ease, that they have no heart to face and combat
          the enemies of their souls, the devil, the world, and the flesh, will
          never get through safely to the other side. "The kingdom of Heaven
          suffers violence, and the violent take it by force." Either you must
          be the ruin of your lusts, or they will be your ruin. "If you live
          after the flesh, you shall die, but if you through the Spirit do
          mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That those who are strangers to the life of faith and the way of
          making use of Christ for sanctification, will never get through
          safely. Men may be at much pains this way, and go the round of
          external duties, and yet fall short of Heaven at length. "The labor of
          the foolish wearies every one of them; because he knows not how to go
          to the city." Some of these are filled with self-confidence, not
          doubting but that they are able to do the work in which they have
          engaged. Others are afraid that they will never get it done, but
          resolve to do as well as they can, and to look to Christ for pardon
          wherein they come short. But I would advise both as ever they would
          see Heaven, to go out of themselves for all, and be strong in the
          grace that is in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 2. Of exhortation. O Christians and communicants as ever you would
          see Heaven, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. Strong and
          resolute against difficulties you must be, else you will never get
          there; and you can never be wrong indeed but in that grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question. How may you be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus,
          for the work of the Christian life, whether doing or suffering? Answer
          1. You must be in Christ, in the first place by faith, accepting and
          embracing him, fleeing out of yourselves, confiding and trusting in
          him for all his salvation, on the gospel offer to you. The branch
          cannot partake of the sap of the stock until it be united with it.
          John 15:1–6.

          2. Be sure the work for which you would be strengthened be called for
          by God at your hand. "The way of the Lord is strength to the upright:
          but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity." One's call to a
          work must first be cleared, before he can justly look to the Lord, to
          be with him in it. The communication of grace is not to be expected
          out of the way of duty.

          3. When your duty is cleared be emptied of yourselves; and make
          nothing in you your confidence. Look upon yourselves as empty vessels
          that must be filled from Heaven, else nothing to purpose can be done
          by them. Amen.
