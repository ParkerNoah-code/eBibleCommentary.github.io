          2 Corinthians 4:18 "While we look not at the things which are seen,
          but at the things which are not seen."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          YOU have now been eating your gospel Passover, and should therefore be
          preparing for your journey through the wilderness. You have enlisted
          under the standard of Jesus Christ, and should march on to follow your
          leader. You will meet with difficulties in the way, that will make you
          in danger of fainting, standing still, and giving it over, as a
          journey which you are not able to accomplish. To prevent this, you
          must take your aim right, and still keep your eye upon it; looking not
          to the things which are seen, but to the things which are not seen. In
          the text there are three things to be considered.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The mark which the Christian is to keep in view in his journey
          through the wilderness. The traveler will always be looking to
          something, and it is of great importance for the journey that he takes
          his view right. He must look, namely, with an attentive eye, as one
          does to a mark at which he shoots, taking his aim right. The object
          which the Christian is to keep in view is described.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Negatively, He is not to look at the things which are seen. He must
          not look to, but overlook and disregard, those things that fall under
          his senses. The things of this world, by which natural men are led. It
          is Christ's call to his people, to leave the world with him, and for
          him, to lift their eyes and hearts from these things, and live like
          those of another world. "Come says he, with me from Lebanon, my
          spouse, with me from Lebanon."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This object is described positively, "but at the things which are not
          seen." He must with an eye of faith, look to and keep in view, those
          things that are beyond the reach of the carnal eye. He must have an
          eye in his heart, to fix on those things that do not lie open to the
          view of his bodily eyes. God, and grace, and glory, which cannot be
          seen with our eyes, yet to them we must look.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Observe the reasonableness of this view, which the Christian has.
          Religion is the most reasonable thing in the world. The world smiles
          in a very engaging manner on the Christian, to draw him after it, out
          of the Lord's way; but by these he will not be moved. It frowns
          bitterly, but he regards it not. What, is the man mad, says the carnal
          worldling? What is he looking for? What does he see? Why truly he sees
          other smiles that move him, other frowns that he seriously regards.
          And good reason, for the smiles and frowns to which worldly men look,
          are but temporal for a season; the world's favor and enmity also will
          soon be over. But the smiles and frowns to which the Christian looks
          are eternal; they will last forever. Does he not then act most
          rationally. Observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The fruit of this believing view. It makes him follow Christ
          through good and bad report, while others turn their backs upon him.
          Particularly it keeps him from the ill of afflictions. It is a cordial
          to keep him from fainting under all pressures from the world. There is
          a thorn hedge in his way, but he breaks through it, seeing the
          paradise that is on the other side, verse 16. "For which cause we
          faint not." It brings him good out of them. For while the view of
          things not seen, carries him through the hardest parts of his lot, he
          comes in the end to be a gainer and not a loser by his afflictions,
          verse 17, 18. "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
          works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while
          we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
          not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things
          which are not seen are eternal."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine.—They that would get safely through this world to Immanuel's
          land, must so look to things that are not seen, as to overlook, and
          put on a holy regardlessness of the things that are seen.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In prosecuting this doctrine, I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Take notice of some things that are supposed in it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Speak of the unseen things to which we are to look.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Show in what respects we must look to them.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. Show how we must overlook, and put on a holy disregard of the
          things that are seen. We are then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To take notice of some things that are supposed in the text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is supposed that there is an unseen world, as well as a seen
          one. There is a future state into which we shall pass, when we are
          gone out of time. When we are dead, we are not done, but only enter
          into another state. This world is but the present world, so there is
          another world, called by our Savior, that world, in opposition to
          this, Luke 20:35.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That the things of the unseen world are of vastly greater
          importance, than those of the seen world. If we look to the upper part
          of the unseen world, there is a weight of glory that would infinitely
          counterbalance the best things here. It is called, "a far more
          exceeding and eternal weight of glory." If we look to the lower part
          of it, there is a weight of wrath heavier by far than the worst things
          here.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We are all in our journey to the unseen world. This is but the
          place of our sojourning. However strongly we incline to make it our
          home, it will not be our long home. We can no more abide here, than a
          man going through a town in his journey, who comes in at one gate and
          goes out at another. "We have here no continuing city, but we seek one
          to come." One generation passes away, and another generation comes.
          The saints in glory are come to their journey's end, the damned to
          theirs, we are only upon the way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The things that are seen in our journey are apt to entangle us, to
          lead us wrong, and make the end miserable. If we stand to look and
          gaze upon them, we are ready to be frightened, or flattered out of our
          way, to our ruin; for the lions have their dens there, and the
          leopards their haunts in the most pleasant spots of it, Song 4:1.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, As we look now in this world we will live forever in another
          world. It was looking that ruined man. The eyes were the doors by
          which destruction at first entered. Our first parents got their first
          wound in the eye, Genesis 3:6. And it is by looking we must be saved.
          "Look unto me, says Jesus, and be you saved, all the ends of the
          earth; for I am God, and there is none else." And now that we are on
          our journey through this ensnaring world, it concerns us highly to
          take our view right; for if we follow the sight of the eyes in our
          head, it will lead us into the snare of everlasting ruin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How shall we take our view then, that we may get safely through? To
          answer this, let us proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To speak of the unseen things to which we are to look and keep in
          view. To represent these things fully is what no mortal can do. "As it
          is written, eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
          the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love
          him." We cannot even conceive them. Yet as a traveler may look to a
          mountain, though he can never grasp it in his arms, so we may look to
          what we cannot apprehend. Take a taste of the unseen things then, in
          these few particulars, assuring yourselves when we have said all, the
          half is not told.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          O you travelers setting out to Immanuel's land, take these directions
          along with you. You will see many things in your way at which you must
          not look, but at things unseen you ought to look.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Look at the unseen world, the better, the heavenly country. You
          will see a fair faced world, a bulky vanity, upon which most men are
          strongly bent. But as you love your souls do not stand looking at it.
          You must look at and keep in view the unseen world above the skies
          where glory dwells. "Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty, they
          shall behold the land that is very far off." Look at Immanuel's land.
          It is the pleasant land. The land to which all the holy patriarchs and
          prophets directed their eyes. It is a better country than the best
          under the sun. Your Savior is there and he bids you follow him with
          your eye, until you personally arrive in the happy place.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Look at the unseen God. You will see idols in abundance by the way,
          craving you to fall down and worship them. But you must look at the
          unseen God, as Moses did, when he was in the way, "For he endured, as
          seeing him who is invisible." The seen world has three idols that keep
          many men in their embraces. "For all that is in the world, the lust of
          the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of
          the Father, but is of the world." But you must look at the holy
          Trinity, to be fully enjoyed in the unseen world. The Father, Son, and
          Spirit. This one God is the first principle in all things, the
          fountain of all perfections, in whom our happiness lies, and therefore
          he is the chief end to whom we are to look, and in the enjoyment of
          whom only our souls can rest. Look to him then and keep your eye on
          him always.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Look to the way that leads to Immanuel's land. Keep your eye
          constantly upon it. You will see the way of the world, a broad way, an
          easy way, lying down the hill, and if you begin to look at it, you may
          be seduced into it, and in the end tumble into the chambers of death
          to which it leads. O! look then to the unseen way that leads to the
          unseen world where felicity and glory forever dwell.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Remember that the Lord Jesus Christ is the unseen personal way to
          Heaven. "I am, says he, the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes
          unto the Father but by me." Behold an unseen Jesus at the Father's
          right hand, who has purchased the pardon of sin, peace, grace, and
          glory by his precious blood to sinners; and by his intercession is
          preparing places for them in his Father's house of many mansions.
          Behold him sitting at the end of the race, with the crown in his hand,
          to give to him that so runs as to obtain. "Lay aside then every
          weight, and the sin which does so easily beset you, and run with
          patience the race that is set before you, looking unto Jesus, the
          author and finisher of your faith." Jesus is the glory of the upper
          house, and his superlative beauty draws the eyes of all the heavenly
          company to fix on him. Look to him then, though you see him not. "Whom
          having not seen, you love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet
          believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory."
          Remember also that holiness is the unseen real way to Heaven. "And an
          highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The way of
          holiness: the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for
          those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein." Were
          the form of godliness and the mere performance of external duties the
          way to glory, it would be a seen way. But it is not so. The Christian
          life is an unseen, hidden life. It is hidden with Christ in God. The
          new man is the hidden man of the heart. The king's daughter is indeed
          all glorious, but it is within. He who has no more religion than what
          eye can see, will be seen by all the world at length to have none at
          all. Faith, love, and all the duties of internal worship are unseen
          religion. Look to this, if ever you would see Heaven; for without
          holiness no man shall see the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Look at the unseen, happy, and glorious society of Heaven. You will
          see carnal company, that will be agents for the devil to lead you off
          your way. But you must look at the unseen society above. There dwell
          the saints and the angels singing their Hallelujahs to the Lamb, and
          to him that sits upon the throne. There full and uninterrupted
          communion with God is enjoyed; and this shall constitute the eternal
          happiness of the glorious inhabitants. "They shall be ever with the
          Lord. Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell
          with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with
          them, and be their God." There will be no solitude there, no
          unpleasant company there, no grief, no jarring strings in the harmony,
          "For God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be
          no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any
          more pain: for the former things are passed away."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Look at the glorious reward of Heaven. You will see petty profits,
          gains and advantages, which the men of the world are keenly pursuing,
          taking the world's offer trifling as it is. These are penny wise, and
          pound foolish; for while they gain a penny at one hand they are losing
          a talent at another. But do you look at the unseen profits of Heaven,
          and like "Moses, have respect unto the recompense of reward." There is
          a treasure before you. A precious treasure which can neither be
          corrupted nor plundered. Not, however, a treasure of gold, for that is
          no treasure in the upper world, but serves only to pave the streets of
          the city, "which is of pure gold, as it were transparent glass." That
          the saints may eternally tread upon that, upon which the men of the
          world now set their hearts. But it is a treasure of glory. Even "a far
          more exceeding and an eternal weight of glory." A matchless treasure
          for preciousness, for variety, solidity, and security, so that it can
          neither be exhausted nor lost. It will make you rich to the most
          extensive desires and everlasting satisfaction of your souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Look to the unseen, pure and lasting pleasures and honors of
          Heaven. You will see insipid pleasures, empty honors, and short lived
          joys, which the men of the world are most actively pursuing, with all
          the earnestness of children running after butterflies. Yet these
          things when obtained are little worth, and far from being a recompense
          for their toil. But do you look at the unseen pleasures, those
          exquisite pure rivers of pleasures, which flow eternally from the full
          enjoyment of God, the blessed sight of his glory, which mortals cannot
          behold. Psalm 16:11. Look at the unseen honors which the saints shall
          obtain, when they arrive at their own country and get home to their
          Father's house. For then, they shall receive a crown, the very summit
          of worldly ambition, but such a crown as fades not away; a kingdom
          that cannot be moved; a throne, the highest that men are capable of.
          "To him that overcomes, says Jesus, will I grant to sit with me in my
          throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his
          throne." Look at the unseen joys that begin, when the world's joy
          ends. You shall hear the joyful sound of your Savior's voice at the
          end of the race, saying, "well done, you good and faithful servant;
          you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over
          many things; enter you into the joy of your Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Look at the unseen rest of Heaven. You will see crosses,
          tribulations, and perhaps bloody persecutions by the way, and feel
          them also. By these the God of this world will set himself to terrify
          you and draw you out of your way. But you must look at the unseen
          rest, peace, refreshment, and ease of Immanuel's land. "In the world,
          says Jesus, you shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have
          overcome the world." When you come to the everlasting rest, you shall
          no more have the least uneasy thought about all with which you have
          met. There you shall enjoy an everlasting calm, an eternal repose.
          "The gates of the city shall not be shut at all by day; for there
          shall be no night there." There the conquerors get on their crown,
          they lay aside their swords, and get the palm in their hands, and that
          land rings eternally with the shout of victory, victory for evermore.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. Look at the fullness and complete happiness of Heaven. You will see
          many wants and miseries in this world. The flesh will always be
          wanting something. What shall I eat? And what shall I drink? And
          wherewithal shall I be clothed? And many are so completely engaged in
          answering these questions, that they entirely forget the things not
          seen. But do you look at the fullness and complete happiness before
          you. They that can get forward will soon obtain a rich supply of all
          their wants. There is no want in Immanuel's land. "He who overcomes
          shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my
          Son, says the Lord." There you will find God, and Christ, and a full
          covenant comprehending all to make the believer perfectly happy. And
          now small drops and foretastes of that fullness are given them in the
          way, but then it shall be told out to them in full and forever more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify">Uses of this Doctrine</p>
        <p align="justify">Use 1. Take these three lessons from it.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. He is the wisest man that quits the world's certainty for hope. If
          ever you would be wise, you must become fools. Though the sight of the
          eyes is better than the wandering of the desire, yet the unseen things
          upon which faith fixes, are a thousand times better. It is better to
          have God's bond, than the world's hand payment; for when the latter is
          spent and gone, the other will tell out forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You will see your way through this ill world best, if you will shut
          your eyes. And indeed it would be a token for good, that you have seen
          the Lord this day, if your hearts within you were saying, as one
          sometimes said coming from duty, "Now my eyes, be you shut." The sight
          of our eyes is apt to betray us into a thousand snares. You have been
          taking an unseen guide, follow not then the sight of your eyes, for
          they will make the world's molehills mountains before you. And
          remember they are best guided that follow Christ, as the blind man
          follows his guide. "I will bring, says he, the blind by a way which
          they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I
          will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight.
          These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. They will get best through the world's snares, that look least at
          them. A holy contempt of the world's good and its ill, of its frowns
          and flatteries, is a noble preservative against them. Flee from
          idolatry, and from fornication, says the scripture. Turn your backs on
          them. It is the best way to entertain the world with a holy disdain.
          It was looking at the forbidden fruit, and it is tampering with
          temptation, that catches the soul in Satan's snare.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 2. Mind this doctrine, O Christian communicants!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. When your former lusts come back to you, like Potiphar's wife to
          Joseph, offering you deadly poison in a golden cup. Look not to the
          things that are seen. It will be bitterness in the end, if you do. But
          look to him that is invisible, as he did, and say, "How then can I do
          this great wickedness, and sin against God. As obedient children, you
          must not fashion yourselves according to the former lusts in your
          ignorance. But as he who has called you is holy, so be you holy in all
          manner of conversation." You must not again sit down to dust, it is
          the serpent's meat; but you have unseen meat to eat in communion with
          God, to fit you for your journey to the unseen world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When sloth comes to you, like Peter to Christ, covering a sharp
          sword with words softer than oil, saying, Master, spare yourself. What
          needs all this bitter repenting, wrestling in prayer, watching over
          heart and life? Less surely may suffice. Soul, take your ease. Here is
          a sound sleep to be enjoyed on the sluggard's bed. A way strewed with
          roses. Look not to the things that are seen, if you were once asleep,
          you will be an easy prey to the robbers! And all you have obtained,
          you may quickly lose. "The slothful man roasts not that which he took
          in hunting; but the substance of a diligent man is precious." Look to
          the things that are not seen, and you will see good reason to exert
          yourselves more and more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. When you return to your worldly employments, and your carnal
          companions come to you, as the chief priests to Judas, offering you
          thirty pieces, if you will betray Christ, look not then on the things
          that are seen, but on them that are not seen. You see their way, but
          look to the end of it. Their joy will be turned into weeping at last.
          "But he knows not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in
          the depths of Hell." And remember, if you intend Heaven you must
          forsake the company of those whose faces you see are not thitherward.
          "He who walks with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools
          shall be destroyed."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, When the enemies of God and his work may be let loose upon
          you, like the Jews on Christ, "gaping upon you with their mouths, as a
          ravening and a roaring lion." Our adversaries are restless. But that
          is not the chief thing. An impure church looks like as if a fire were
          abiding it, to try of what metal we are. And who knows how far it may
          go. Look not then to the things that are seen: if you do, you will
          deny Christ. But look at the things that are not seen, and you will be
          carried through safely.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. I proceed to show in what respects we must look to the things
          that are unseen.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. We must believe the reality of them. Faith is the eye of the soul,
          that takes up the things not seen, and views the land afar off. It
          makes future things present, and discovers the reality of invisible
          things, "being the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of
          things not seen." Faith goes upon divine testimony, and sees these
          things by the help of the map of the heavenly Canaan drawn in the
          scriptures. This is the faith of the operation of God to which the
          world is a stranger. For in effect to most men, the doctrines of the
          Bible concerning things not seen, are but as idle tales, and all the
          promises about them but as fair words; of this the small regard which
          they pay to them in practice is an evident proof.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. We must value them in our practical judgment above all other
          things. For this looking to them plainly implies an overlooking of
          other things. "Yes, doubtless, says Paul, and I count all things but
          loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord; for
          whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but
          dung, that I may win Christ." You must not look on them only as good,
          but as of all good things the best, and not only as the best in
          general, but best for you at all times. So that when the world makes
          its offer of seen things, you must prefer the Savior's offer of unseen
          things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We must love and desire them above all. "Whom have I in Heaven but
          you? And there is none upon the earth that I desire besides you." If
          we do not thus love and desire them, our looking to them will be to no
          purpose for supporting us under sufferings and carrying us forward
          through the world. Look at them with superlative love and desire,
          breathing out your souls for these unseen things. "When the many say,
          who will show us any good? Do you cry, Lord, lift you up the light of
          your countenance upon us. You has put gladness in my heart, more than
          in the time that their corn and their wine increased." Hence we find
          the saints breathing after the land that is afar off, saying, "We have
          a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better." After
          the Lord of the land, saying, "O that we knew where we might find
          him." And after the perfect holiness and felicity of Heaven. "For in
          this tabernacle we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with
          our house which is from Heaven."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. We must make them our main scope and aim, looking to them as one
          does at a mark at which he will shoot. Let it be your chief end to
          seek God, and not yourselves, to glorify and please your unseen Lord
          and Master, and to attain the enjoyment of him forever. Let all things
          else be but secondary work in comparison of this. Be assured your
          happiness lies not in this present world; the sweetest smiles of it
          cannot make you happy, and the severest frowns of the world cannot
          make you miserable. If you obtain the unseen things, you gain all; if
          not, you gain nothing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. We must accustom ourselves to the habitual consideration of them.
          For it is not a glance at them on the Sabbath, or at a communion, that
          will answer the grand purpose, but a fixed looking at them in the
          whole course of our lives. Whatever we have in hand, and wherever we
          be, each of us should be ready to say, "I have set the Lord always
          before me, and when I am awake I am still with him." Our conversation
          must be in Heaven now, if we expect to be received into it at death.
          We must keep the other world habitually in our view while we walk
          through this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. We must entertain the hope of unseen things. "For we are saved by
          hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees why does
          he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with
          patience wait for it." The soul of man is an empty thing and must be
          fed by hope, until it come to enjoyment. And if there be not settled
          hope of unseen things, the heart will naturally embrace seen things.
          "When there is no hope, the soul says, I have loved strangers, and
          after them I will go." Despondency cuts the sinews of the traveler
          through the world, and will quickly cause him stop.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Look to them, so as to overlook and put on a holy disregard of
          the things that are seen. And this brings me,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. To show how we must overlook and put on a holy disregard of the
          things that are seen. The seen things are the things of this world. We
          cannot avoid seeing them while we are in it. But we must not look at
          them, we must see them as if we saw them not, and put on a holy
          disregard of them. They may be reduced to two heads. The evil and the
          good things of the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Put on a holy disregard of the evil things of the world, which tend
          to divert you from your Christian course. This world was and ever will
          be a weary land to the travelers to Zion. You must go into the world,
          and I tell you before, that there is an ill air blowing in it, which
          none of us shall ever be able to correct; and the more we set our
          faces heaven-ward, the more it will blow upon us. But we must resolve
          to be forward, and take it as we find it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Put on then a holy disregard of the seen evil things of the world,
          such as its crosses and tribulations. These we must both see and feel,
          for in the world we shall have tribulation. But mind your Lord and
          Master who set his face to the storm, and being resolved to be
          forward, put on a holy contempt of it. "For the joy that was set
          before him, he endured the cross, despising the shame." And indeed we
          will need to have our foreheads steeled with holy resolution, when
          going through the world. For we may lay our account with having a
          cross for every day. Every day will have the evil thereof. The
          follower of Jesus must take up his cross daily; and the clouds will
          return after the rain. We may meet with these, where we least expect
          them, perhaps by the time we enter our own houses, we will see one
          ready shaped out for us, and we must take it up. We may lay our
          account also with what may be called holidays' crosses, the day of
          Zion's distress and persecution, or public calamity. "You have called
          as in a solemn day my terrors round about; so that in the day of the
          Lord's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I had swaddled and
          brought up has mine enemy consumed." Ever since the Christian race was
          opened, Satan has raged against those that have set out in it. He has
          set up reproaches, poverty, blood and slaughter in it, to drive people
          from it. And he wants but to have his chain lengthened, and the enemy
          would begin the bloody work as keenly as ever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But happy they, who, though they see this evil of worldly crosses, do
          not look at them, but put on a holy disregard of them. That is, do not
          pore upon them, for often while one muses that way the fire burns. And
          the cloud, which in itself is but like a man's hand, by a faithless
          looking at it, increases until it appears to blacken the very heavens.
          Do with them as a man on his journey, who meets with a mire or rugged
          step, he cannot avoid seeing it, but he must not stay to look at it,
          especially in a place where all around is mire. It is remarkable of
          Jacob, that when Rachel named the child of which she died, Benoni, the
          son of my sorrow, but his father called him Benjamin; the son of my
          right hand; near and dear and precious to him as his right hand.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Do not terminate your view upon your crosses, but look beyond them to
          the bright side of the cloud. If the mist of trouble rise before you
          in the way, look through it to the unseen things before you and press
          forward. Some professors are like delicate persons that go abroad in a
          fair hour to take the air; but whenever a shower comes on they wrap
          themselves up in their cloaks, and return to their houses. Their
          religion endures until they meet with a cross: and then they take such
          a look of their cross, as drives them at once out of all the little
          wisdom which they ever had in religion; "For having no root in
          themselves, when tribulation or persecution arises because of the
          word, by and by they are offended." But be you like one who is
          traveling on necessary business, he cannot command the clouds, but he
          looks to his business; and be it fair or foul weather he must be
          forward.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You must also put on holy contempt of the world's way, which must be
          reckoned among its evil things. If you design for Heaven, you will
          soon see that the multitude are not going your way, and that their
          course is opposite to the one you must steer. "They walk according to
          the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the
          air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience." Their
          way leads to things that are seen, but to none of the things that are
          unseen, except the wrath to come. They despise religion, the profane
          mock at it; worldly wise men gravely pronounce it folly. Every one of
          them disregards it and goes after his own way, any way, but God's way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You will see all this, and behold it to mourn over and watch against
          it. But look not at it, to esteem, love, choose, or tamper with it.
          "Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away." Many look at
          it, so as that their eyes betray their hearts, they fall in with it;
          because they see it is the way that is most frequented, as if they
          thought it safe enough to go to Hell with company. "But be not
          conformed to this world, but be you transformed by the renewing of
          your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and
          perfect will of God." Therefore I would say to you as Peter did, save
          yourselves from this untoward generation. And remember that the
          separation to be completed at the last day, is begun and working now.
          For you shall keep them, O Lord, you shall preserve them from this
          generation forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Put on a holy disregard of the world's good things also. This is
          necessary if ever you would go safe through the world, for its good as
          well as its evil things have a tendency to divert you from your
          Christian course. And the case is much the same, whether the world
          cudgel us to death with its blows, or hug us to death with its
          treacherous embraces. The fawning as well as the frowning world is
          dangerous, and we may say of it as Solomon does of wine. "Look not you
          upon the wine when it is red, when it gives his color in the cup, when
          it moves itself aright. At the last it bites like a serpent and stings
          like an adder." Like Joab, the world pretends fair, while it gives a
          home thrust to the soul. Like the panther, which with the sweet smell
          of his breath draws other beasts to him, and then devours them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The world will court you, with its profits, saying, "All these things
          will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me." And O what an
          ensnaring sight to many! "For the love of money is the root of all
          evil; which, while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith,
          and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The world thus prevails with many to take away their desire from the
          unseen things. "And they all with one consent began to make excuse.
          The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must
          needs go and see it: I pray you have me excused." Men who are led by
          sense count nothing substantial good, but what they can see with their
          eyes, or handle with their hands and which will improve their fields
          and fill their barns and coffers. These are the bird in hand, with
          them preferable to the unseen treasures of another world, that are but
          the bird in the bush in their esteem.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The world will court you also with its seen pleasures, that gratify
          the senses. "Even all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and
          the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life." O what a bewitching
          sight is this to many. And how many does it keep back from the
          Christian course. Hence if you will look through the world, you will
          see multitudes, plunged in the mire of sensuality, whose souls are
          sacrificed to please their flesh. They are bound over to death in
          these silken cords and ruined with these siren songs, that will be
          bitterness in the end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And we are not only in danger by the unlawful, but also by the lawful
          comforts of the world. It is a sad but true observation, that many
          perish by lawful things. The inhabitants of the old world "were eating
          and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, all lawful things,
          until the day that Noah entered into the ark. And knew not until the
          flood came and swept them all away." Two unhappy sons stole away the
          heart of good Eli; and the gourd of a night, the heart of the prophet
          Jonah.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But look not at the world's seen good, if ever you would get safe
          through it. Do not tamper with its unlawful profits or pleasures.
          Check the first side look of the heart after them, the first rising of
          strong desire to them, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
          They that begin to look at them are in the fair way to leap over the
          hedge for them. The fort is near to surrender that comes to a parley.
          And they that parley with temptations can hardly ever come fair off.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Make not the world's seen good your main scope and aim, you need the
          world's comforts in this state of mortality, and God requires as well
          as allows us, "To provide things honest in the sight of all men." But
          let your great view be beyond the clouds, and be not seekers of the
          world, but seekers of the kingdom of God. And you may know your case
          in this point by this mark. That is your main view, to which your
          other views are made to yield. If you manage in seen good, so as may
          best suit the advancing of your enjoyment of the unseen good; then it
          is well.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You must also moderate your affections to the seen good of the world.
          "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any
          man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." Let not
          your hearts sink deep among these ensnaring good things, but go
          lightly over them. Loose reins given to the affections even in lawful
          things, may soon give you a miserable fall. The way through the best
          of this present world is slippery, and there is need to keep a good
          bridle hand. The boundaries between lawful and unlawful things are so
          very small, that it is difficult to go to the utmost of what is
          lawful, without slipping into what is unlawful. For though the very
          edge of the rock be firm, yet our heads are too light to venture on
          it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, Undervalue and disregard the best things of the world in
          comparison of Christ. "If any man, says he, come to me, and hate not
          his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and
          sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple." When
          they come in competition with him, give up with them. When they stand
          in your way to him, tread over them, that you may get forward, and
          count them but dung that you may win Christ. It was the commendation
          of Levi, when seen things and unseen were in competition, he looked
          not at them; "Unto his father and mother, he said, I have not seen
          him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren; nor knew his own
          children."

          1. You may see here, where your danger lies, in your course through
          this world. It is on the one hand in looking at things that are seen.
          These things will present themselves to your view, and strive to wind
          themselves into your affections. And the farther you launch into this
          deep, the more will you lose sight of Immanuel's land. Therefore take
          heed that you be not betrayed by the sight of your eyes, driven out of
          the way by the world's evil, or flattered out of it by its good
          things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          On the other hand your danger lies in losing sight of things not seen.
          We are apt to do so, and if we do not watch we cannot escape doing it.
          It is difficult to cause wet wood take fire, and as difficult to make
          it keep fire. And so carnal are our hearts, that it is difficult to
          get our eyes lifted up to look at the unseen things of another world,
          and when we have it, it is as difficult to keep the view. Therefore be
          upon your guard.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 2. For exhortation. Let me exhort you all as ever you would see
          Heaven, so look to unseen things as to overlook the things that are
          seen.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motives 1.—Consider the vast disproportion of the objects. Why should
          you not look at what is most worthy of your regard? Is the world, and
          all that is in it, to be laid in the balance with the favor and
          enjoyment of God? Can all the world's gain recompense the loss of the
          soul? I will give you only two views between them that may show the
          disproportion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Seen things can never be truly satisfying, but unseen things are
          perfectly satisfactory to the soul. Seen things are not commensurate
          to the desires of the soul. If the world should cast all its best
          things into your bosom, would there not still be a want? "I have seen
          an end of all perfection." You have long squeezed the world for its
          sap, but did you ever yet come to say, it is enough? No, and you never
          will. For as a circle can never fill a triangle, so the world can
          never fill the heart of man. He was a fool that said to his soul,
          "Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease,
          eat, drink, and be merry."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But unseen things are perfectly satisfying. They are suited to the
          spiritual nature of the soul, and an infinite good is sufficient for
          the boundless desires of the soul. See what they are in time, Psalm
          4:7. "You have put gladness into my heart, more than in the time that
          their corn and their wine increased." See what they are in eternity,
          Psalm 17:15. "As for me, I will behold your face in righteousness: I
          shall be satisfied when I awake with your likeness." Therefore I would
          say, "Wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread? And
          your labor for that which satisfies not? Hearken diligently unto me,
          and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in
          fatness."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Seen things are but temporal, unseen things are eternal. The
          world's smiles and frowns will soon be over, but God's smiles and
          frowns will last forever. Before long this stage of vanity and misery
          will be taken down, but another scene will commence that will last
          forever. Will you look forward to death, that will be the end of seen
          things to you. Look to the end of the world, that will be the end of
          them to all. But then the unseen things take place, never to give
          place to a change. Let me say then, Will you set your eyes upon that
          which is not? For riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly
          away, as an eagle toward Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 2. Consider this is the way in which all the saints have gone
          to glory. "They walked by faith, not by sight." Had the fair ones now
          in Heaven looked to what was seen, their carcasses had fallen with
          others in the wilderness. But they had more noble views, "The prize of
          the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. They desired a better
          country, that is an heavenly." Thus the cloud of witnesses steered
          their course, and thus did the King of saints upon their head, "Who,
          for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the
          shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 3. There is an unseen evil in the best things of the world,
          that afterwards comes to be severely felt. "But they that will be rich
          fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful
          lusts; which drown men in destruction and perdition." Since the curse
          was laid upon the earth, thorns and briers have not ceased to grow up
          with our greatest worldly comforts. Brethren! Why all this looking at
          seen things? Have you not found sometimes your greatest cross, where
          you looked for your greatest comfort? Have you not, sucking greedily
          at the dry breasts of the world, wrung out blood instead of milk? Have
          you not often been therein like one striking at a flinty rock for
          water, and got nothing but fire flashing in your faces.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Looking to the unseen things will help you on your way to
          Immanuel's land, whatever wind blow. This will make you easy, go the
          world as it will. He who while he has the world's good things does not
          stand by them, will stand without them when they are gone. "Although
          the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines;
          the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat;
          the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd
          in the stalls: Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God
          of my salvation." This has made confessors take joyfully the spoiling
          of their goods, and martyrs joyfully to embrace a stake or a gibbet.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. If you look to the things that are seen, then seen things will be
          your portion. And when the turn of unseen things comes, you will get
          that cutting memorandum, "Son, remember that you in your lifetime
          received your good things." You will never see the land that is afar
          off, otherwise than the rich man saw it in Hell. And by the time you
          are in another world, the support which you have derived from the
          world's good things will be gone, and you will awake and find
          yourselves faint; but through eternity you shall not once taste the
          comforts of another world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, If you overlook the things that are seen, and look at the
          things which are not seen, you shall not be disappointed. "For unto
          them that look for him shall Christ appear the second time, without
          sin unto salvation." What you look for now, you shall then fully
          enjoy, and be happy forever, in being forever with the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify">Directions</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Live much by faith. "The life which I now live in the flesh, I live
          by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for
          me." The life is the soul's continual traveling between Christ's
          fullness and self-emptiness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Be much in prayer, so will you converse with the Lord of the unseen
          world, and about the unseen things of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Be much employed in reading the scriptures, for in them we have the
          account of the unseen things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Be much given to meditation. Use stated meditations, and
          particularly I would recommend solemn secret fasting and humiliation.
          "And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house
          of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of
          Nathan apart, and their wives apart."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Converse most as you have access, with those that are best
          acquainted with the unseen things and seem to have the savor of them
          most upon their spirits. And watch your hearts, that they slip not
          into a forgetfulness of things unseen, and return to a fondness for
          things that are seen. Amen.
