          >WHEN Satan had taken man prisoner, he put him in chains, Isaiah 61:1.
          Chains of several links, even divers lusts and pleasures. With these
          he attempts to hold them, until he get them in chains of darkness in
          Hell. Jesus Christ has broken the chains of some of these prisoners of
          Satan: but very many of them are yet as Adam left them. Some the devil
          has in the chain of irreligion and profanity, even a chain so short,
          as they have no power to set a foot on God's way. Some are in the long
          chain of formality, as this man; and as for them, you may see, that
          they are as sure in the devil's grasp as those whose heads he holds in
          greater restraint. One thing you lack. They get so much scope in the
          ways of God, that they can scarcely think that the devil has them in
          his chain. All these, said this man, have I observed from my youth.
          But when a convenient time comes, the devil can draw them to himself,
          quite out of God's way. Verse 22. He was sad at that saying, and went
          away grieved: for he had great possessions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the 20th verse this man had made an ample profession of a good
          life, and in the text we have Christ's return. In which we have,
          <br />
          1. Christ's gesture towards him, he beheld him, he cast his eyes anew
          upon him, on that word, looking on him so as to express his inward
          affection to him. <br />
          2. The Savior's affection to him. He loved him. <br />
          3. His answer to him. One thing you lack.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. We have our Lord's gesture and carriage to him. He beheld him
          wishfully. The eyes are the windows through which the soul looks out,
          and they admirably discover the affection of the mind; either love or
          hatred. It was love here, particularly compassion and pity, which is a
          kind of love especially discovered by the eyes. Christ had a human
          compassion towards so civil a person.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But why did Christ thus look upon him? Because he was true man, and so
          capable of true human passions and affections, and particularly of
          pity towards objects of compassion, which this man in a special manner
          was. And so we find him affected even to the shedding of tears, over
          the case of those, on whom as God he was about to bring wrath to the
          uttermost. When Jesus beheld Jerusalem, he wept over it. And there was
          much in this man's case to move a generous spirit to compassion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. He was a civil discreet man, but possessed of no religion, an
          absolute stranger to true godliness. There are some people who have
          neither grace nor manners; they are abominable to the godly, because
          they have no religion; and to civil men, because they have not so much
          as common civility. But this man was civil and discreet, yet being
          without true religion, he was a pitiful sight to move compassion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such persons excite compassion because they are dutiful to all but God
          and their own souls. They feed others but starve themselves. They make
          themselves lovely to men, but remain hateful to God. Besides if they
          had religion, it would be much better for them. Civility and
          discretion go far to recommend religion to the world, that knows it
          not, and cannot value it for its intrinsic beauty. Hence we are
          commanded to be all of one mind, having compassion one of another,
          love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous, Religion with an
          unpolished conversation is like gold in the ore; but accompanied with
          this discretion shines as a piece of gold new struck.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. He was a man concerned to be at Heaven, but likely never to see it;
          and such an one is a spectacle of commiseration indeed. Some persons
          are posting so fast to the pit, that they never look over their
          shoulder to Heaven: if they go to Hell, they can scarcely say that
          they are disappointed, for they were not minding Heaven. They have
          found a broad easy way, and they have a mind to hold by it end where
          it will. But Oh! what shall we say, or what tears of blood may not
          their case draw forth, whose eyes are still fixed on Heaven, while the
          devil is driving them in an invisible chariot to destruction? They are
          running to obtain the crown of glory, but have mistaken the way, and
          will land in eternal reproach. The labor of the foolish wearies every
          one of them; because he knows not how to go to the city. Strive, says
          our Lord, to enter in at the strait gate; for many I say unto you,
          will seek to enter in and shall not be able. They are courting their
          own damnation in a mask, and grasp at a weight of wrath, instead of
          the weight of glory, which must needs make a fearful surprise when
          they are undeceived.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. He was a man of a good natural temper, but no grace. All these,
          says he, have I kept from my youth. He was none of the devil's lions,
          filling the place where he lived with the noise of his ravelings and
          extravagancies; but he was one of the devil's lambs, going to Hell
          without letting the world hear the sound of his feet. And such surely
          is a pitiful sight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some persons have grace, but a rugged natural temper like Jonah, who
          was seldom but out of humor. They have the jewel, but an ill case to
          keep it in.—Some have good nature, but no grace, they have the
          cabinet, but they want the jewel to put into it. Ah! what pity is it
          to see such a fair building empty, or rather made a habitation of
          devils.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. He was a man that had done many things in the way of a good life,
          but marred all he had done with the want of one thing. If you saw an
          artificer at great pains to make a curious piece of work, and when he
          had done break all in pieces with a rash touch of his hand, you could
          not observe it without regret. Or if you saw one make such a piece,
          but when he comes to one thing necessary to make it useful, he stops
          there and with all his are cannot master it, would not that be a
          pitiful sight? So here. Oh! it is sad to think how with some that do
          many things in religion, there is still something that stands between
          Heaven and them.—Though they are not far from the kingdom of Heaven,
          yet they never enter into it. We have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Christ's affection to him. He loved him. There is a special love
          which God bears to his own, which cannot be understood of this man, as
          appears from the sequel, where he showed he loved the world better
          than Christ. But there are two things in it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. There was a real affection of passion and love in Christ's human
          soul towards this man, upon the account of the many good
          qualifications which appeared in him, all the good gifts of God. 2.
          Forasmuch as in God there are no affections or passions properly so
          called, (such prove one a man, not God) the love of Christ, as God, is
          to be understood in respect of the effect, not of the affection; and
          such love God has to all his creatures in so far as he wills and does
          them good, seeing everything God made was good and is in itself good.
          Besides there is a love to men of which the scripture speaks, Titus
          3:4. By which God loves his own work and his own good gifts in them
          more or less according to their measure. Thus he loved him, spoke
          friendly to him, approving what was good in him, so far as it was
          good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Out of this a popish commentator offers to hammer two things. 1. That
          the man spoke truth, verse 20th otherwise Christ had loved a liar, or
          a lie. Answer, He might as well have inferred Christ's commending
          deceit and injustice from his commending the unjust Steward, Luke
          16:8. But his keeping of the commandments, so far as he had really
          done it, was good in itself: his moral seriousness was good in itself
          and so lovely, and thus he might in that view love him with a general
          love, as well as the godly with a special love, notwithstanding of
          defects. 2. The congruous merit of good works before faith, because
          Christ loved him for these. Answer, What God loves and approves is not
          therefore meritorious: but if so it was incongruous to set him away
          without faith, which yet was done and that is to blaspheme.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here I shall first show out of the context why Christ loved him. Now
          to draw from this lovely picture, which yet wanted one stroke to make
          it complete for salvation, the want of which marred all the rest; I
          remark,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That he was a zealous man; he came running to Christ. Though he had
          little light he had much heat; much affection for Heaven, though
          little judgment about the way. His zeal carried him to wait on, and
          not to let slip an opportunity of conversing with Christ, and he would
          rather marr his gravity by running than lose it. This was good in
          itself, besides there was something good in his zeal, for it was in a
          good thing, and herein he condemned many.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many who run away from Christ, turn their backs on him and his way
          after they had made a profession of it, 2 Peter 2:22.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He condemned also those who have no heart for conversing with Christ,
          but are dragged to duties as the malefactor to the execution; whose
          heart that way is gone, and they are without all life and vigor in the
          way of God. Those also whose zeal carries them off the way where
          Christ walks, and excites them to separate themselves, and to entice
          others to withdraw from the means of knowledge, how they may inherit
          eternal life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. He was a civil discreet man, and respectful to Christ as a teacher,
          though he took him not for the Messiah. Rudeness was no part of
          religion to him, and this was good in itself, though it made him no
          better Christian, than he who answered discreetly, Mark 12:34. By this
          he condemned many whose religion makes them rude, and leaves them not
          within the bounds of common discretion, especially setting themselves
          to trample under foot the stars that Christ holds in his own right
          hand.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. He was willing to learn and asks a religious question; that was
          good, though not enough. Hereby he condemned many who neither have
          knowledge nor are willing to be instructed, and those that are puffed
          up with their knowledge, so as they are above teaching, and who are so
          far from beginning religious discourse, that they will not hold it up
          when it is begun to their hand.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. His question was about the great and main thing of religion, how to
          be saved. He started not the question about ceremonies and traditions
          as the Pharisees were accustomed to do, but about the substantials of
          practical godliness. That was good, but not enough. He looked beyond
          time and was concerned for how it might be with him in eternity. By
          this he condemned those that live like the beasts groveling on the
          ground, and are never considering what way they shall stand before the
          tribunal of God; and those who will propose any question than what way
          they shall be saved; who in all their religious questions are sure to
          abide about the out-skirts of religion and never touch the vitals of
          it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. He was a man of a blameless life outwardly, that had studied to
          keep the law of God so far as he understood it, and that from his
          youth. This was good, but not enough; more than Paul's religion before
          his conversion, which yet condemns many who make no conscience of
          living according to the very letter of the law of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, Add to all this, he was a young man, Matthew 19:20. A ruler
          and a rich man; yet neither his youth, honor, nor riches, diverted him
          from these things. There are but few like him in our day, few
          concerned about their eternal state, while in the flower of youth;
          especially if they be honorable and rich.—Many of the higher ranks
          among us, especially of the younger sort, reject religion utterly, and
          live as if their birth, honor, and riches, gave them a dispensation to
          be vile. It is like that Christ looked upon him the rather, that there
          were but few of his kind, that had any appearances of good in them.
          "Have any of the rulers believed on him?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall now, secondly, show why Christ loved him on these accounts.
          The reason was, because these things were the good gifts of God,
          though not grace, they showed in so far a respect to the law. They
          came from God, James 1:17. and he cannot but love what comes out of
          his own hand, for nothing comes from him but what is good. If God
          should withdraw from us all that is his, there would be nothing left
          us but sin, which is the only thing in which there is no good, and
          that came not from God. Now a jewel is still precious though in a
          dunghill.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Inference 1. How much more will the Lord love them who are true
          Christians, not only outwardly, but inwardly. Does he love those
          external acts of moral discipline, how much more the spiritual man and
          his graces? Does he discern and love those things that are excellent
          in natural men, how much more real grace in renewed men, though mixed
          with corruption.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, Learn to love the good gifts of God in whoever they appear, and
          stand not to commend what good is discernable in any person, whatever
          evil be with it. It is an evil eye that can fix on nothing but men's
          sores and faults.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let this commend morality and the external duties of morality to you.
          Though they are not the whole, they are a part of religion. And though
          they will not get an eternal reward, yet God usually gives them a
          temporal one. They are of use to preserve external order in society,
          and so far contribute to the honor of God and his law.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. I come to the main thing in the text, our Lord's answer, in which
          we have two things. 1. A defect alleged against him. One thing you
          lack. 2. A discovery of that defect, namely, his worldliness. Go your
          way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor.—Here he touches his
          idol of jealousy, and brings forth the lurking venom of his heart. One
          thing you lack. It does not import, that he had no more wants but one.
          But, 1. That this was one thing that stood between him and eternal
          life; and 2. That this one thing marred all his other things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine I. Persons may go far in the way of religion, and yet have
          one thing that effectually stands between Heaven and them. Here I
          shall,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. Confirm the doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Show whence it is that one thing should still be lacking in many
          who come a great length in religion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. I am to confirm the doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It appears from scripture instances, where we find persons going a
          great length, yet one thing mainly their ruin. Herod did many things,
          but stuck at his lust, would not, could not part with Herodias. That
          was a step in the way to Heaven, that he could never ascend. Judas's
          covetousness; Demas' snare was the present world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is plain hypocrites may go far in religion, and may attain a
          great height in mortification, such as it is, yet it is no less plain
          there is still someone lust or other where they stop. For a universal
          hatred of, and resistance to sin, is a mark of sincerity, Psalm 119:6.
          And their feigned repentance should be true, were there not some sweet
          morsel still reserved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The godly themselves will readily be found to have one thing that
          is hardest to subdue and that gives them the greatest trouble, though
          the power of it be broken. There is a weak side, a sin that most
          easily besets them. David makes his victory over it a mark of
          sincerity. "I was also, says he, upright before him; and I kept myself
          from mine iniquity." If this be so in the green tree, how must it be
          in the dry.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. There are some sins, that like Saul among the people, are head and
          shoulders above the rest. Our Lord calls these, right eyes and right
          hands. Some sins are like the nails and hairs in the body, which can
          be taken off without pain. No wonder that some people shake off these;
          but for sins which the corrupt heart cannot want, more than the body
          can want the eye or the hand; here is the difficulty, and there is the
          ruin of many souls. Such are like those who have a male in their
          flock, but will not part with it for God, but vow a corrupt thing
          which they can more easily spare. For further confirmation I shall
          instance in some particulars.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Persons may have many exercises about their case and yet never
          attain sufficient humiliation, the want of this stands in the way of
          many to keep them out of Heaven; they want root and soon wither away.
          This is the great spring of hypocrisy and of apostasy. The wound is
          given but it is not deep enough, hence it is healed again before ever
          the corruption be expelled, as in Pharaoh; the ground of the heart is
          not ploughed up, though the surface be broken, hence sowing among
          thorns. It strikes not at the root of sin, the sin of our nature,
          hence it retains its vigor. And this is the cause why all falls
          together.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They may have many changes to the better, yet lack the great saving
          change, as Judas, the stony and the thorny ground hearers. Persons may
          be cast into several molds, yet never into that of regeneration.—Many
          new things may be about persons while they lack one thing, the new
          nature. This will effectually bar them out of Heaven. New affections
          may be where the old stony heart remains. A new life where the old
          nature is still. And what serves all these changes, while that one
          thing is lacking. "For except a man be born again, he cannot see the
          kingdom of God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. People may do many things in religion, who yet stick at someone
          thing that they can never do. There are some duties to which men's
          nature is most opposite, and this produces a difficulty which it is
          impossible to get over without saving grace. So that these are still
          the exceptions in the soul's closing with Christ, the right eyes with
          which they cannot part. Such was the contempt of the world to this
          man. God points at that in particular, and that by all things they
          cannot comply with.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. People may bear many things and yet there may be one thing which
          they cannot bear by any means.—Even like a person that has a sore in
          his body, he can bear a touch any where but in that place. The world
          is the idol of some people, they can bear anything but poverty; credit
          is that of others, anything but what injures it. Someone thing or
          another they set their hearts upon, and they can bear anything but the
          want of that. God wreathes that yoke about their necks, but they like
          unruly beasts struggle in the bond and rage as a wild bull in the net.
          We now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show whence it is that one thing should still be lacking in
          many who come a great length in religion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because the power of sin is not broken in them, but it still lives
          and reigns whatever progress they make in religion. Hence it must and
          will undoubtedly exert itself one way or another. As where a stream is
          banked up, but the fountain not stopped up, the water will always
          break out at one place or another, it must have a vent. So here, lust
          is powerful and if the power of it be not broken, it will domineer and
          keep the soul in subjection one way or another.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because it is never complete in them, and where it ceases they will
          always lack one thing. In the truly godly the change is not perfect,
          but yet it is that which goes through all. "If any man be in Christ he
          is a new creature. Old things are passed away, behold all things are
          become new." All the members of the old man with head and heart are
          struck with a deadly blow though none of them are killed outright; but
          in the hypocrite it is not so. They may be wounded in many parts of
          the old man, but one at least remains entire, like a man whose heart
          is whole which secures his life, though otherwise in bad case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because their souls never come to take up their rest in God, which
          is done only by true faith. "For we which have believed do enter into
          rest." Man is a weak empty creature and must needs have something to
          rest in. By nature we have lost God, and they continue under that
          loss, hence they rest in the creatures, and when God has removed many
          lusts from them as their pillows on which they laid their head, there
          must still be one thing left, or they can have no rest at all.—Hence
          that one thing is something, on which their satisfaction which they
          neither have in God nor in other things, depends.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because they have two parties to satisfy as double-minded men,
          conscience and corruption. The reformation attained to conscience, one
          thing is lacking to corruption. Conscience obliges to do many things,
          which corruption, reigning, will not let be done. There are duties to
          feed their hopes, lusts to feed their desires, and thus is the heart
          divided between Christ and their lusts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Use 1. Of information.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It informs us of the certainty of the mark of grace, universal
          obedience. "Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect to all
          your commandments."—A heart loosed from all idols and hating every
          false way, is real sincerity. The most refined hypocrisy leaves still
          one thing that is lacking, one lust, one idol with which the heart
          cannot part; some lust from which the hypocrite was never weaned and
          which was never made bitter enough to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Many good duties and great performances in religion will be lost as
          to eternal life, 2 John, 8. O it is sad to think how men go many a
          difficult step in the way of religion and get over them, and yet stick
          at last in one step and never come to the journey's end.—This brings a
          sad disappointment, as if a man should plough and sow with others, but
          when reaping time comes, he has nothing, as the foolish virgins lacked
          oil in their lamps.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. See here the root of defection and apostasy from God, men's falling
          off from any life and vigor in religion which they have attained. How
          often is that verified, "your goodness is as the morning cloud and
          early dew, it passes away." How is it confirmed in our experience! How
          flat and dead are many turned since the sacrament; how unlike to those
          that were witnesses to, and partakers of that work? Alas! where at
          best one thing is lacking, matters cannot long be in a prosperous
          state. For,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Where one thing is lacking Satan has still a sure hold; he is like
          Pharaoh in another case; if ought be left he knows people will come
          back again. One lust unmortified, not given up, will open the door to
          the rest, and make their latter end worse than their beginning,
          Matthew 12:44. He can sink the ship with one leak as well as an
          hundred.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, where one thing is lacking, there has been no real closing with
          Christ, and where there is no marriage, no wonder the soul does not
          bring forth fruit unto God. The branch that unites not with the stock
          must needs wither, and one unmortified idol will draw away the soul
          from the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Where one thing is lacking, there wants but a temptation suited to
          that one thing, and then the soul is just where it was. And Satan will
          watch the opportunity to set fire to and blow up the house by the
          train that is left, especially after solemn engaging to Christ. There
          are four things I fear have done us an ill turn.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The world. Is there an eclipse come over you in respect of your soul's
          case, then look that the earth has not got in beween God and you; Luke
          8:14.—It is a busy time. I am afraid that Martha's business, has made
          Mary's part to be forgotten, and that people have looked so
          steadfastly upon the earth, that Heaven is out of their sight. That is
          the handle with which the devil holds fast many souls. Reigning sloth
          hurts many, Ecclesiastes 10:18. Many awaken for a while and begin to
          work, who in a little give over; sloth creeping on by degrees, which
          was never truly mortified, like weeds in the spring. Few have Caleb's
          spirit to follow the Lord fully. But they are at pains to get
          something, and when they have got it, they fold their hands and sleep,
          until poverty come upon them, as one that travels, and that is the one
          thing that ruins them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Self-confidence injures many. Though all should deny you, yet will not
          I, said Peter to his Master. When men cast off fear they are near a
          fall. The mountain is never nearer to being removed, than when persons
          are saying it stands sure. A jealousy of ourselves, I fear is the one
          thing many of us lack, and that is our loss. The fixed stars appear to
          tremble most; and that Christian stands fastest, who is always afraid
          lest he fall and lose what he has attained. When men view the duties
          of the covenant, and do not improve the grace of it, they will soon
          turn slack-handed in these duties.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, An unstable mind and judgment is very hurtful. No wonder the
          tree wither, that is never fast at the root. This was the one thing
          that ruined the Galatians, for though they had received the Spirit by
          the hearing of faith, yet when Satan came in upon them, with that they
          quickly lost all the savory impressions which they had of the hearing
          of faith. The wavering temper among us, I am confident, is no small
          hindrance in the way of the gospel's success. And as I bless God for
          what stability any of you have attained, so as for you that deserted
          the message which I had from God to you this day eight days, whether
          there were many of you or few, and joined yourselves to those, whose
          work it is to break down what we build up, and that after that solemn
          reproof of, and lamentation over that practice, and other
          heart-breaking pieces of your contempt of the gospel, which was given
          on the fast-day, and after what you heard and saw on the sacrament
          day, I do, as the messenger of the Lord, in his name, rebuke you here
          as obstinate despisers of the message sent of God unto you, and
          protest as the messenger of God to you, that this rebuke stand before
          the Lord that sent me, until it be wiped out by repentance, and
          fleeing to the blood of Christ for pardon; so I leave it before him
          who confirms the word of his servants.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 2d. of Exhortation. I would exhort you, 1. To search and try
          whether or not there be one thing lacking in you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That finding it out you will labor to get over it. But before I
          enter on this, I will propose,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine II. The one thing lacking that stands between a man and
          Heaven may be hidden from him and out of his view. This want was a
          thing this man was not dreaming of, until it was discovered to him by
          Christ. Now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To confirm this point. Consider the lamentable delusion that some
          are under as to their state, whereby a man may be a hypocrite and not
          know himself to be such. "There is a generation that are pure in their
          own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness." See also
          Isaiah 44:20. Such was the case of Laodicea. One thing God knew they
          lacked but they knew it not, Revelation 3:17. How many bless
          themselves in their hearts whom the Lord curses. The foolish virgins
          knew not that they lacked oil until it was too late to rectify the
          mistake; and the house on the sand was never thought to lack a sure
          foundation until the storm came.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. If you consider the deceitfulness of the heart it will not be
          thought strange, for the heart is deceitful above all things and
          desperately wicked. The deceitful heart can draw a veil over the one
          thing lacking and entertain it in the house, while the master knows it
          not. Many evils lurk in the heart which men do not know, until by the
          special operation of the Spirit they be discovered unto them. How
          clear does the sin of many appear to others, who yet cannot be
          convinced of it themselves; how much more may it be so in those sins
          which lie not open to the view of the world. Let us inquire,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Whence it is so. It may be hidden on several occasions. As,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Seeing spiritual sins are most subtle, and are not known until the
          law in its spirituality be carried home on the soul, when that one
          thing is of a spiritual nature it may be lying hid. So it was with
          Paul, he discerned not the evil of his Pharisaical duties; for he was
          alive without the law. A man will easily discern when he performs or
          omits external duties; but it is very possible he may be leaning on
          duties, putting them in Christ's room, and yet not know the danger of
          it for want of spiritual light; nay, nor see those motions of cursed
          self.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That one thing may be taken for a great duty, and their greatest
          impediment in the way to Heaven, may be looked on as their greatest
          furtherance to it. Alas! it is too, too incident to blinded man to
          value himself on that for which God undervalues him, Acts 26:9.
          Fearful are the effects of delusion, and dreadful are the heights to
          which it may go, so that Satan gets many kept in his dark prison of
          ignorance of Christ and of themselves with his iron fetters, which
          they take for God's golden chains. And thus glory in their shame, and
          look for salvation in that way that will ruin them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That one thing often is in lawful things, and there it is hard to
          discover it. Many perish by lawful things. This was the ruin of the
          young man in the text. It was lawful for him to have great
          possessions, but in them his snare lay. The world was his idol though
          he never saw it was so until Christ discovered it to him.—Things in
          themselves unlawful are quickly seen, the devil soon discovers himself
          by the cloven foot; but it is not so easy for people to discover their
          lying in a husband, wife, children, goods, or effects, but there it
          often lies, Luke 14:18–20.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. That one thing may be negatives and omissions which are not so
          easily discerned as commissions.—Swearing may lie heavy on the man's
          conscience, while the bloody sin of unbelief sits as fast though
          unobserved; and yet it is that one thing that ruins the world of
          hearers of the gospel. There are sloth and carnal ease, what havoc do
          they make among professors, but who sees them with that venom in them
          which gnaws out the affections of the soul. On the contrary, they are
          hugged and they are sweet sins which people can keep with little
          noise, and in which they sleep and slip to Hell at their own ease.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. That one thing often goes under the name of an infirmity which
          though evil in itself, yet cannot keep one out of Heaven. Thus it is
          veiled with false notions, and the venom of it hidden from the eyes of
          men. The wise virgins slumbered, and the foolish virgins slept,
          thinking they were no worse than their fellows. Thus many a man
          deceives himself, while sin reigns in him, but he lives at ease,
          seeing every man has infirmities and he has his also. The truth is, no
          sin of a believer is a reigning sin, but a sin of infirmity, Romans
          6:14; neither can a sin of infirmity properly be ascribed to a natural
          man, seeing he is altogether without spiritual strength. The
          difference lies in these. 1. Reigning sin is committed with a whole
          bent of will. Infirmity has but a half will, there is another
          principle in the will against it, Romans 7:19. The will, as
          regenerate, opposes that to which the will, as unregenerate, carries
          the man; whereas there is no opposition to reigning sin, but what
          flows only from an unenlightened conscience. 2. Sins of infirmity are
          great burdens to the soul, from which it wishes to be freed, and they
          carry the persons to a hatred of the root of sin, which they look upon
          as iron fetters, Romans 7:24 whereas the heart is knit to sin while it
          reigns.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Self-love acts its part here, and so covers this fault, while it
          magnifies the good that is in men, and extenuates the evil, and is
          always ready to construe the best of a man's state, and keeps back the
          soul from a serious and impartial search of what may be lacking in
          it.—Thus men nourish their disease, and hug the viper in their bosoms
          that will gnaw out their affections.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, There may be a judicial stroke in it, John 9:39. Men sometimes
          unkindly entertain the discoveries that God makes to them of what they
          lack, they shut their eyes at the light, and God strikes them blind;
          2. Thessalonians 2:10, 11. Their hearts cleave to it, and therefore
          they desire not to see it in its ugly colors, they are for peace in it
          at any rate, and they get it, Isaiah 66:3, 4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use of Exhortation. 1. Let one and all of us search ourselves if there
          be any one thing lacking that stands between Heaven and us. I would
          have you all going in search of this one thing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. Is there not need for it, when you say it may be where it is
          not observed. If this mortal disease may infect those who find no pain
          from it, does it not concern us all very nearly to search the
          innermost parts of our hearts with the candle of the Lord. The mortal
          enemy is among us, and may lie hid, up then and search.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. If upon search you shall find that there is not one thing lacking,
          the comfort of the discovery will counterbalance the pains of the
          search. How comfortable a reflection had David, "I was, says he, also
          upright before him, and kept myself from mine iniquity."—And he was a
          man intent on searching and being searched, Psalm 139:23, 24.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It cannot be mortified until it be discovered; and if it be not
          mortified, it will keep you out of Heaven. Search out the poison then,
          lest it kill you; the one thing wanting, lest it conclude you under
          the loss of God's favor forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, God will discover it, if you do not, either here or hereafter.
          It will not always be kept secret. God will lead out the idol of
          jealousy and set it before your eyes, whether you will or not, as in
          the text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now to help you in this search I shall lay down some things that may
          serve to point at the one thing lacking, which is most likely to stand
          between Heaven and you. And because, though the godly do not totally
          lack anything, yet they may have one thing which they are in greatest
          hazard of, and that they need particularly to set themselves against,
          as that which comparatively is the one thing lacking. I shall lay down
          such helps as may be serviceable to both.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Consider what it is that you have of all things least power to
          resist, that is certainly the weakest side, the one thing you lack
          which of all things else threatens your ruin most. For all the
          reproaches, etc. cast upon Jesus and his disciples, we never heard of
          Judas making any resentment, until that was cast in his way that might
          feed his covetousness. Men may be as brass and iron with respect to
          many temptations; yet are weak as water with respect to one thing.
          Persons may find out a sore by examining the whole body.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Consider what way the natural bias of the heart turns. Persons will
          readily find something upon which their heart fixes most readily and
          quickly, such is the sin of their constitution, as lust, pride,
          passions, envy, covetousness. It was lust that gave David the greatest
          dash in his way to Heaven. Whatever this be, it will be found the sin
          that most easily besets us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Consider what that is of which the heart keeps the most obstinate
          hold, and is most averse to part with it. That surely is the right
          eye, or the right hand. There is an idol of jealousy, which, if the
          man be denied, he says in effect as Micah, "You have taken away my
          gods; and what have I more?" He can less digest the want of it than
          the want of communion with God.—Look then if there be anything whereof
          when you are deprived, all your other comforts, all the promises, nay,
          God himself cannot satisfy you, but your contentment stands or falls
          according to that thing; that doubtless is the one thing lacking,
          without which the man cannot rest, as Ahab could not be satisfied
          without Naboth's vineyard.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Consider what that is which your own conscience, and the finger of
          God in the preaching of the word does most frequently point at, and
          check you for, that is likely to be one thing. It is in this case as
          when a man has a sore finger, he finds it touched oftener than any
          other. Double calls then require double diligence for mortification.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Consider what it is your thoughts run most upon, the idol of
          jealousy will readily take them up most.—And therefore think what it
          is that ordinarily has your last thoughts at night, and your first
          thoughts in the morning, which are due to God only; that is another
          God, before the Lord. This is the woeful carcass, where it is the
          thoughts of the heart will be gathered together.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Consider for what it is that God most frequently corrects you, and
          what conscience hangs most upon in time of affliction. God ordinarily
          writes his indignation upon the one thing, and levels his stroke
          particularly against it, and that with a witness, that the guilty
          conscience can interpret the stroke to be for that. Consider then what
          that is, in respect of which you are as a silly dove that still haunts
          the place where she has been robbed of her young, Hosea 7:11, 12. That
          which you will still be handling, though your fingers have been often
          burnt in reaching to it. Compare Hosea 14:3. "Ashur shall not save us,
          neither will we ride upon horses, nor say any more to the works of our
          hands, you are our gods, for in you the fatherless finds mercy."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. What it is in which your will opposes most the will of God, in
          which you have greatest difficulty to say, the will of the Lord be
          done, which is the great obstacle in your resignation to the will of
          God, Mark 10:21, 22. Is there one thing, that you could part with your
          will in all things but in it: that is the one thing lacking. Jonah
          discovered his weak side to be pride, and love of his credit, this
          way. And God crossed with him until he was brought fairly to yield it
          to the Lord. That same was Ahithophel's. God crossed with him, but he
          kept to the point until he died, desperately hanging himself, because
          he could not get his own will and his counsel was not taken.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. Consider what that lust is, that like Joseph's sheaf all other
          lusts must bow to it. That is it which commands in chief, and is the
          lust upon the throne. There may be in men's hearts some one or other
          corruption that is like the great channel into which other lusts, as
          so many little brooks, disburden themselves. He to whom the world is
          the one thing needful, will sacrifice ease, luxury, and almost
          everything to his favorite object, and will make stepping-stones of
          all other things to get at it. He who is setting up for
          self-righteousness will make many lusts fall a sacrifice to it, and
          build that lust with the spoil of others. For one lust may be contrary
          to another, and for the principal one all the rest are cut and carved
          as may best suit it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9. Consider what is that which is the greatest hindrance of your
          duties towards God, that either keeps you back from them as the world
          made Demas forsake God, or that mars them so that they are performed
          very heartlessly; that looks like to be the one thing, 1 Samuel
          2:24–29. What lies on the heart as the one thing, will readily be
          found to leave the marks of it on the several duties men perform.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10. Consider what that is in which you can rest satisfied if you have
          it; though you have not God in it to rest in. There may be one thing
          the want whereof squeezes all the comfort and satisfaction out of
          other things to a man. This was the case with Haman. All his honors
          availed him nothing while he saw Mordecai the Jew sitting at the
          king's gate. Nothing can satisfy a proud man when he is in disgrace.
          But the enjoyment of their object though they have not God in it gives
          them rest. Thus the rich man said to his soul, "Soul, you have much
          goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be
          merry." Surely that is the idol. Thus we may all see what that one
          thing lacking totally or partially is with us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I would exhort you to set yourselves against that one thing to get
          over it; and prove yourselves sincere by your victory over it. And to
          urge this, I shall propose,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine III. That the lack of that one thing will spoil all the other
          good things we have. One thing you lack which stands effectually
          between you and eternal life, and draws a black stroke through all
          those other things which you have.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall show you how that one thing lacking totally and not got over
          sincerely, though it cannot be got over perfectly until death, spoils
          all other things. It does this two ways, by way of evidence, and by
          way of efficacy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. It spoils all by way of evidence. It will disprove all your
          evidences for Heaven which you pretend to be enough, it will blot them
          out and will be a contrary evidence that will prove all the rest
          false. There are these six sad conclusions, that one thing lacking
          will prove against you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Conclusion 1. That you are yet in the black state of nature, not born
          again, not new creatures for all the other things you have attained.
          This conclusion is infallibly true, being grounded on express
          scripture. "If any man be in Christ he is a new creature: old things
          are passed away, behold all things are become new." For the new
          creature from the time of its birth is perfect in parts, though not in
          degrees. The new man is furnished with all the integral parts, though
          none of them are come to their full growth. There is something lacking
          in every part of the new man, but no part altogether lacking. Compare
          1 Thessalonians 3:10. with 2 Peter 1:9. therefore they are not new
          creatures in whom one thing is lacking.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This conclusion draws deep. "For except a man be born again, he cannot
          see the kingdom of God." If you be not born again you are not the sons
          of God, and if so, you have no right to the inheritance. See then how
          this one thing will shut you out of Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That you are but hypocrites and not sincere Christians for all the
          length you have come, Psalm 18:23 and 119:6. Since Christians are
          universal in their obedience, and will not entertain any one idol, but
          part with those that are dearest to them. She is an adulteress that
          takes another instead of her husband. None ca sincerely close with
          Christ, but those that are content to part with all their idols for
          him, and all true Christians do so, Matthew 13:45, 46.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This goes deep, for if you are hypocrites what avails your religion
          before the Lord? You are in some sort in a worse case than the openly
          profane. You are lukewarm, neither cold nor hot; and Hell, not Heaven,
          will be your lodging place. See where the one thing lacking will carry
          you: for hypocrites shall have their portion in the place where shall
          be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That you do not so much as one duty right, or so as to serve the
          Lord acceptably in any one thing, Isaiah 1:11, 15. The reason is, it
          is not out of love to God, nor from respect to his command that you do
          what you do; because if it were so, you would regard his authority in
          that one thing as well as in other things, and true love to God would
          not allow you to set any thing in his room, James 2:11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is a heavy conclusion, what reward can they look for but wrath,
          that do nothing pleasing in the sight of God, that make themselves and
          not God their principle and end?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. That you have not the spirit of Christ in you, however elevated you
          may sometimes seem to be; and the reason is, because wherever the
          spirit of Christ dwells he brings forth the fruits of holiness, and
          these are in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth.—Where then
          there is only some goodness, and not all goodness, as where one thing
          is lacking, the spirit is not there. And that draws deep, leaving you
          among sensualists, and cuts off all your pre-tensions to Christ, for
          if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if
          without Christ, then without the favor of God, without the covenant,
          without hope, Ephesians 2:12. So does one thing lacking deprive of
          all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. That you are not truly mortified, but under the reigning power of
          sin; the reason is plain, because your right eye sins are yet
          untouched. True mortification is universal. While one member is alive
          the body is not dead. Death takes the life out of every part and so
          does true mortification. While one lust is on the throne, Christ is
          not there. Sin can keep its dominion by one lust as well as by many.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is a sad conclusion. It makes you none of Christ's, leaves you
          under the rigor of the law of works, and leaves you no appeal to
          grace, and binds you over wholly to Hell fire, Matthew 5:29; and so
          far by the saving of one thing, you eternally lose all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. That you are despisers of the whole law of God and of the whole
          yoke of Christ, James 2:10, 11. As the breaking of one link breaks the
          whole chain. The authority of God is stamped upon all his
          commandments, and he who despises it in one despises it in all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This draws deep, showing that you have no kindly respect to any of his
          laws, and so that they are not written in your hearts, consequently
          that he is not your God, and therefore you are not his people. How
          dreadful must it be to entertain that which blots out your name from
          among the people of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. It mars or spoils all by way of efficacy. As we say of the want of
          original righteousness, so of this, it is not a pure and idle want,
          but an active want, that has a most malignant influence, as the want
          of sight makes the whole body full of darkness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It spoils the acceptance of all your other duties before the Lord.
          "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me." This
          the prophet Haggai teaches the Jews by a similitude taken from the
          ceremonial law, chapter 2:11–14. The many good things which we have,
          will not sanctify one thing lacking; but one thing lacking will
          pollute all our other good things. Saul made dreadful havoc among the
          Amalekites, but the sparing of Agag, the bleating of the sheep, marred
          the acceptance of all. Will the putting away of many lovers while one
          is still retained satisfy a jealous husband? no more will the putting
          away of many lusts while one is retained satisfy a jealous God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It quite mars our pretensions to true repentance and true holiness,
          for it is of the nature of these to be universal, so as if they be
          not, they are no more true repentance and holiness. Repentance is a
          turning from every idol as being from sin, because it is sin, so
          holiness has respect to all God's commandments. As a man cannot come
          to a city, unless he go the whole way; to stand at the gate keeps him
          out the same as if he had stopped at a greater distance. Thus goes the
          reformation of many.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is an abiding root of universal apostasy. It is enough to keep
          the soul in Satan's grasp still, and to be in due time an engine for
          overturning all the fair fabric of their partial religion as in Judas
          and Demas. That house can never stand sure that lacks a foundation.
          Hence men of the greatest attainments have lost all, to which the one
          thing needful has still been the handle. "Therefore we ought to give
          the most earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any
          time we should let them slip."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It still carries the soul off from God, and mars its resting in him
          alone as the chief good. The evil heart of unbelief leads to depart
          from the living God. As it is impossible for a man to grasp Heaven and
          earth in his arms at once, or to fix his eyes on the heavens and earth
          at once; so the soul cannot fix the heart upon one idol, but that must
          take it off from the Lord. For no man can serve two masters. Hence if
          the soul would rest in the Lord, it must forego all others, Psalm
          45:11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It will effectually mar salvation. One sin cleaved unto will
          ruin the soul as well as a thousand. It keeps the soul from Christ,
          and so leaves the man under the curse of the law, Galatians 3:10. One
          thing lacking will be a sufficient bar to hold men out of Heaven. A
          right eye spared will cost the whole body's being cast into Hell fire,
          Matthew 5:29.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use. Let me then renew the exhortation to you touching that one thing.
          Set yourselves particularly against it, to fill up that want, to get
          over that particular idol, to pluck out that right eye. Here is matter
          of exercise to you which may be near your hearts. You have heard
          motives to stir up to this duty. I shall only farther propose.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Is it not a sad matter to lose all for one thing, to lose all the
          good that is in you, and done by you and your souls too, and all for
          one thing? O what a cursed idol is that to which you will offer such a
          costly sacrifice? What man in his senses, would not rather pluck out
          an eye, than lose his life by the keeping of it. It is a dear bought
          enjoyment of an idol that is bought at such a rate.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Is it not sad to be so near Heaven and yet miss it? Have you come
          all the way and only one step remains, and yet you will stand there?
          Why not let go that idol as well as the rest? Why so far and no
          farther? O will you fall from the very threshold of Heaven? Are the
          children brought to the birth and must they die there?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. What better will you be than those that have nothing? If a man
          perish, what better is he if he perish in a brook than in a sea. If
          you go to Hell for one thing, what are you the better for going so far
          in the way to Heaven. O sad, to have many items in religion all dashed
          out in one but, in the end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Directions.—1. Labor in the first place to get the deep impressions of
          the evil of this one thing fixed on your spirits. That is the first
          wedge to be driven to separate your souls from it. Consider the evil
          of it, as contrary to the holy nature of God. Consider the evil that
          attends it as before explained. Until once the evil of sin be seen,
          the heart will never be willing to part with it. And look to the Lord
          for sight in this particular and meditate upon it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Set yourself against it in a way of believing. The law makes
          nothing perfect. We must go against it as David against Goliath, and
          fight this battle under the banner of Christ. "I can do all things,
          says Paul, through Christ which strengthens me." Now to do this, we
          must be emptied of ourselves, stripped of confidence in ourselves for
          victory in that point as in all others. There is reason for it, for if
          we are not able to turn away the face of the least, far less of the
          greatest of the devil's captains, 2 Corinthians 3:5 and then we are in
          a fair way to get over it. "For his grace is sufficient for us, and
          his strength is made perfect in weakness." The more we see our own
          weakness, the stronger we are. We must by faith take hold on Christ
          for all: so particularly that one thing. And we must take himself for
          it, and so make a blessed exchange of that idol to Christ. The heart
          of man must needs have something to rest in, and it must always appear
          to be for something better that we make the change. Then Christ in his
          riches and glory must be put in the balance with the one thing, and
          when the soul sees the transcendent excellency of Christ, that will
          captivate the affections from the one thing to Christ, as the pearl of
          great price; for until the soul put Christ in the room of that one
          thing, the heart will never get over it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must take him in all his offices, for it in particular, and that
          first as a Prophet. When we are to grapple with that one thing, look
          to Christ as a prophet in that particular, giving yourself up to him
          to be taught and enlightened in the knowledge of the evil of it the
          way to be led over it. This is the way to bring a strengthening light
          into your soul against it. "He who follows me, says Jesus, shall not
          walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." See David's
          experience, Psalm 17:4. But when men will hold fast their sin, then
          their habitation is in the midst of deceit, through deceit they refuse
          to know me, says the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As your Priest, as for all, so for that particular, were you to look
          to the merit of his blood, and that first for the pardon of it, as
          taking its guilt; and next for sanctification, as producing the
          removal of the power of sin, and of the Spirit for that end. For this
          blood cleanses us from all sin. Thus the blood of Christ purges sin;
          as when his side was pierced, blood and water came out together; so
          when the soul receives a pierced Christ by faith, his blood operates
          in the soul both pardon and purity, Hebrews 9:14. And as the fire that
          burned the incense, was brought from the altar of burnt offering, so
          the spirit that burns up corruptions flows from Christ sacrificed for
          us, in whom our old man was virtually crucified with him. Look to him
          also in his intercession. That is a part of what he intercedes for,
          victory to his people in their combats. He sits in Heaven as Moses did
          on the top of the hill while they fight in the valley, Exodus 17:11
          and we should combat our lusts with our eye on him, as at the Father's
          right hand, concerned for us in the combat.

          Look to him also as a King, and your King for that in particular, and
          this do when first under the sense of your inability to overcome it,
          and with a desire to have it rooted out, you lay it before him, that
          he may exert his kingly power in subduing it; and forasmuch as he has
          offered himself to subdue sin to all that will, accept of him as yours
          with an eye to that very thing, saying, Turn you me and I shall be
          turned, for you are the Lord my God. This is to put yourself under his
          shadow.—And next, when under the assaults you flee to him for
          protection, as the damsel attacked in the fields, crying for help from
          him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, We must do all this, believing the promises suited to that
          case. The word of promise is excellent armor for victory over sin. The
          promise assures us of victory and so strengthens the battle. It brings
          in the bosom of it, "They that wait on the Lord shall renew their
          strength." It puts God's faithfulness and the believer's victory in
          one bottom, so that if any fail, both fail together. God has made the
          promise, Micah 7:19. He will subdue our iniquities, and it is our duty
          to put him in remembrance of it. Say not the promises belong to you,
          if you be not willing to part with all sin and take Christ. You may as
          well think to fight casting away your weapons, as to overcome sin not
          believing the promises. This is to set against it in the way of
          believing.

          Direction 3. Join prayer with fasting upon that particular account. It
          is reasonable the remedy be proportioned to the disease. Pray much
          against it always. Let it be a chief matter of concern; and set some
          time apart by yourselves alone, to wrestle with God against that very
          thing, and enter into resolutions against it in the strength of the
          Lord. The wall should surely be strongest where the water beats with
          the greatest violence.

          Lastly, Keep a strict watch against it, beware of occasions to it,
          Romans 13:14. This will starve and weaken it. Resist it in the first
          motions thereof. It is with sin as with a fire, the longer it burns,
          the stronger it grows; and as a water, the farther it runs, it becomes
          the larger. If we cannot quench a spark, how shall we quench a flame.
          Be resolute then, for it is possible to overcome it. Amen.

          GOD will readily meet people with a special trial in the one thing
          lacking. They will likely be struck on the sore heel, and get strokes
          there, where they are least able to endure them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall first show how this is done, and then give reasons for the
          doctrine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I am to show how this is done. The Lord has many ways of doing it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Sometimes in the fury of his jealousy, he removes the idol of
          jealousy out of the way. Men set their hearts on some things in
          preference to others, and God directs his hand against these things in
          a special manner. He takes from them their strength, the joy of their
          glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their
          minds, their sons and their daughters. They lay themselves down to
          rest in something besides God, and he draws the pillow from under
          their head. There is not a readier way to make people quit of a thing,
          than to make an idol of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Sometimes by the reducing of a man to the necessity of quitting
          either that one thing, or his profession and pretension to Christ, as
          in the text. This touches a man to the quick. When Christ and the
          world go together, a man may follow both with ease, and get his good
          name among others, and opinion of himself, kept up; but when they
          part, he must betake himself to one of them only, and either lose that
          limb or lose the whole body, which is hard work go as it will. People
          are readily brought into this in the time of a storm on the church:
          even as where there is a hole in a house the storm will seek in there,
          though it may escape notice in the summer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A 3d way is, the wind is still blowing in a man's face with respect to
          that one thing, providence crossing him in it, and denying it to him,
          which makes a combat between providence and the man's heart, the one
          pressing forward, the other driving back. So it was in Jonah's case. A
          man sets his heart on one thing above all things; and God denies him
          that one thing above all things. There is a crook in his lot, his
          heart cannot bend to it, and God will not make it straight; and let
          him do what he will it remains still crooked; for God will have the
          man's heart either bow to it or break, Ecclesiastes 1:15. see Hosea
          2:6, 7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A 4th way is, God's making men's plague and punishment arise out of
          their sin, that one thing lacking, that they are most grievously
          wounded with the serpent they have hugged most. The Jews preferred
          Caesar to Christ, and God made Caesar their scourge. Many times God
          makes people's idols to be the great crosses they have in the world.
          Thus Isaac's fond love to Esau was punished, Genesis 25:28 compare
          chapter 26:35.—Whatever gets more of the heart than God gets, will
          readily turn upon the person himself with a stroke.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A 5th way is, by a flood of temptation beating on a man's weak side.
          That one thing may lie undiscerned while there is no temptation to
          draw it forth; but temptation will exhibit a man in his own colors,
          witness Judas and Demas. Whatever it be a man lacks, the storm of
          temptation will readily find it out. There will not want temptations
          suitable to the sin. So they get temptations of that sort, which of
          all they are the least able to resist. Let us now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. Give the reasons of the doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Hereby the Lord vindicates the glory of his omniscience, leveling
          the stroke against that which has the chief room in the heart, he
          thereby discovers a special eye on the idol of jealousy, and teaches
          men that nothing can be so hidden or smoothed over, but he will know
          it thoroughly. Of the church of Thyatira he says, "I will kill her
          children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am He
          which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of
          you according to your works."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because God has a special hatred of that one thing, and that
          because it is a sin to which the heart cleaves most; and always the
          more the heart cleaves to anything, the more is the Lord provoked. It
          is that which of all things takes up his room in the heart most; no
          wonder then a holy God leaves special marks of indignation upon it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. For the discovery of their state before the Lord. Hereby God
          discovers hypocrites, while these strokes on that one thing lacking
          makes the heart cleave more fast to it, and discovers that hold which
          it has of the heart. This may be the mean whereby God discovers a
          person's own naughtiness to himself. And hereby the sincerity of
          others is discovered, while they forego that which otherwise they have
          least will to part with at God's command, Psalm 18:23. This makes them
          like Abraham who showed that he feared God by not withholding his only
          Son from him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. To wean their hearts from it, Hoses. 2:6, 7.—God refuses to give
          men ease in their idol of jealousy that they may give up with it. He
          puts gall in the breast of the one thing, that the heart may be weaned
          from it. With the more ease one enjoys an idol, it grows the stronger;
          but the more strokes that are made on it, it is in the fairer way to
          be broken.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use of information. 1. The way to remove anything from us, or to make
          it uneasy to us is to make an idol of it. The fixing of the heart upon
          anything inordinately, is that which makes it a mark to the arrows of
          God, Ezekiel 24:25. So here, the world is his idol, and now he must
          part with it or God's favor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Where there is one thing lacking, there is an open fountain of much
          misery. Where the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered
          together. What is said 1 Timothy 6:10. we may here apply; "The love of
          money is the root of all evil." Men by that one thing lay themselves
          open to sharp trials from God, as in the text, and to terrible
          temptations from the devil. While one thing is lacking, there is
          something for a holy God to aim his stroke particularly against; and
          something for Satan to fix his temptation where it will most surely
          take effect.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Then there is no lasting rest in the bosom of an idol. There will
          always be such a reckoning at length as Samson got. They will not rest
          very long there, but they will find thorns under their heads. Stolen
          waters may be sweet a while, but they will be bitterness in the end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. This may let you see the evil in that one thing lacking. It cannot
          but be singularly evil which he levels his stroke against. And such is
          that idol be what it will. It is that which is set up specially in
          God's room that gets the cream of the affections, and is the great
          hindrance between people and Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Then where you find you are trysted with special trials, look that
          your sin lie not in that, wherein your affection lies. It will readily
          be found so. If the Lord in his providence cross you in such a thing,
          look that the heart has not been too much wedded to it. If you meet
          with many temptations in one particular, take heed that be not a very
          weak side of yours, that you must either get made stronger, or you
          will lose all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 2d. of Exhortation. 1. If there be any side in you weaker than
          another, then expect a trial on that side.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When you are meeting with trials in that way, join in with the hand
          of God against that one thing lacking. If you have discovered the one
          thing, you may likewise see how the Lord is trysting you with special
          trials in that point. When then God is at work against it, be you so
          too.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. Not a trial you meet with in that way, but it is the voice
          of God to you to mortify it. If you find God has made a wall, as
          Hosea. 2:7. it is for that end that you may return. Why would he stop
          you or make your way uneasy, if he were not calling you to return.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You have the advantage of help towards the victory over it. The
          more bitter God makes it to you, it may be the easier to part with it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. If you continue it still, take heed that the mask be not pulled off
          your face by a temptation suited as in the text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, The Lord in that case has you upon your trials for eternity;
          and if you be right metal you will not perish in the furnace: you will
          stand by resting on God, whatever he take from you. You will rather
          quit the one thing than Christ.

          professors and Heaven. And then add some improvement. I am then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show what of the world it is that stands between many professors
          and Heaven. I shall not here speak of the God of the world, his
          immediate temptations; nor of the men of the world, their
          persecutions, oppressions, reproaches, ill example, and the like, all
          which have a dreadful influence; but confine myself to the things of
          the world, which are what the text aims at. Now this monstrous beast
          pushes men out of the way to Heaven with two horns. These are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The pleasures of the world. These are great impediments in the way
          to Heaven. They are Satan's silken cords by which he draws many after
          him. There is first the pleasures of the eye, which the apostle John
          calls the lust of the eyes. By these doors the heart often breaks
          forth and unites itself to the world, and separates from God.
          Therefore Job made a covenant with his eyes, that they should not be
          panders to the lusts of his heart. The carnal heart is as a bird in a
          cage, whose door the eyes are, that scarcely can be sooner opened on
          objects agreeable to the carnal disposition, but as soon the heart
          flies out at them. A very gourd stole away the heart of Jonah. Two
          graceless sons of Eli were a great snare to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Add to these the pleasures of the flesh, which are more grossly
          sensual, arising chiefly from the senses of tasting and touching, 1
          John 2:16. These often drown the soul in perdition. They are such as
          gluttony, drunkenness, and all sorts of sensuality in which the
          sensual appetite seeks its satisfaction. This induced Paul "to keep
          under his body and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means
          when he had preached to others, he himself should be a cast away."
          These two ruined Adam and the professors of the old world. Love of
          pleasure and a form of godliness may meet in the same persons, even as
          certain birds sometimes fly in the air, and sometimes swim in the
          water, 1 Timothy 3:4, 5.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The profits of the world. These are thorns that choke the word,
          Luke 8:14. These keep such a hold of the hearts of men that they let
          go their hold of Christ, Mark 10:22.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is a snare in the having of the world. Hence Jesus said "that a
          rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of Heaven." How many are
          ensnared with the much business they have, which they would not have
          if they had not so much of the world already.—"The abundance of the
          rich suffers him not to sleep." How hard is it not to embrace and set
          the heart upon a smiling world?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is a snare also in the want of the world.—Hence the wise man
          prays against poverty, "lest he should be poor and steal, and take the
          name of God in vain." By this snare the world drags men after it, the
          bait is before them and they follow it until they are caught with the
          hook. When the miserable world even tramples us under its feet, even
          then we are ready to adore it. When it flies from us we follow it.
          What wonder then if we love it, while it caresses us. We proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show how the world effectually stands between men and Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. As it carries the heart away from God and sets it on itself, and
          thus the world is set in the room of God. Hence covetousness is called
          idolatry. Thus many worship the world's trinity, instead of Father,
          Son, and Spirit. And this is done especially three ways. When men
          esteem it more highly than they do God, his favor and communion with
          him, pursuing the world as their chief good; weighing their happiness
          or misery according to their having or wanting the world. Their cry
          still is, who will show us any good? This appears in their being more
          satisfied in the enjoyment of the world, than ever they were in the
          enjoyment of God, and more cast down at the loss of it, than at the
          loss of the Lord's countenance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, When they love it more than God. "If any man love the world,
          the love of the Father is not in him." How ardent are men's affections
          ordinarily to the creatures, beyond what they are to the Lord.—They
          are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Hence when God and the
          world stand in competition they will forsake him to gain the world.
          They will venture to buy a little of the world, at the rate of his
          displeasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The heart also is carried away from God, when men trust in the world
          more than in God. "Soul, says the rich man, you have goods laid up for
          many years, take your ease," Mark 10:23, 24. From this we may see,
          that it is hard to have the world and not to trust in it. There is
          great need of grace to lift up the hearts of men who have full houses,
          to look to God for their daily bread. It is hard to have the world,
          and not to be secure because we have it: and we are ready to make gold
          our confidence. Hence, says Paul, "Charge them that are rich in this
          world, that they be not high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches, but
          in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. As it diverts men's minds from Heaven and eternal life, and thus
          carries them away from the chief thing, the great work of their
          salvation. "Martha, Martha, said Jesus, you are careful and troubled
          about many things. But one thing is needful." Ah! how many are fixed
          to this earth, that they never get leave to look upward. God calls us
          to run, so as to obtain the prize, but Satan throws his golden balls
          on every side, and while men are busy gathering them up, they lose the
          prize which God sets before them. Thus men trifle away precious time,
          and never open their eyes until death. They are busy, very busy doing
          nothing. The poor how to get, and the rich how to keep and manage; and
          while they are thus busied, their lusts appointed of God for death,
          make their escape, and their souls go for them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The world stands between men and Heaven, as it spoils their duties
          egregiously, makes them unacceptable to God, and unprofitable to
          themselves. The destructive influence of the world upon religious
          duties clearly appears in a variety of respects. Sometimes the world
          jostles out religious duties altogether, leaves no room for them, and
          makes people neglect them.—Thus we find, Luke 14:18. that the business
          and enjoyments of the world prevented those that were bidden from
          coming to the gospel feast. Care for the body leaves no time for care
          about the soul. Martha's business hinders Mary's choice. Men involve
          themselves so deeply that they cannot get time for the concerns of
          their souls. The care of their house, their farm, their work, their
          cattle, often goes between them and their spiritual duties. Hence
          these persons have prayers and family exercises of religion at night,
          because their work is over, but none in the morning, because their
          business, which they reckon of greater importance, will not allow it.
          But if it even leaves them time, it leaves them no heart for it.
          Accordingly we find, that the world very much indisposes men for
          religious duties, even when they have time for them. A man that is
          ever uttering the world's cry, who will show us any good, is very
          unfit to offer up the saint's prayer, Lord, lift you up the light of
          your countenance upon us. As wet wood is unfit for the fire, so the
          man that is drowned in worldly pleasures, is unfit for the enjoyment
          of the pure pleasures of communion with God. And as the troubled water
          is unfit to receive the image of the sun, so the heart tossed with the
          cares of the world, is very unfit to lay the great business of
          salvation to heart, and entertain communion with God in duties.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, The world makes the duties of these persons very lifeless when
          they come to them. They are run out of breath in pursuing the world
          eagerly before they come to them, hence nothing remains for God but a
          few faint wishes, for the cream and strength of their spirits is spent
          on other things. Though they shut their eyes, they see still a
          thousand vanities, and though the door is closed the thief is in the
          house still, that steals away the heart, in the very time that it
          leaves the tongue speaking to God. And readily something will be
          minded when they are on their knees that had escaped them before.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, The world prevents men from looking after the success of
          their duties. They give in their petitions to the Lord, but they are
          so busy with other things, that they cannot wait to see what answer
          they get. And thus the world in the heart makes men perform their
          duties as a task, or as a by-hand work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The world stands between men and Heaven, as it is a great enemy to
          the efficacy of the word upon their hearts. It prevents the entrance
          of the word into the heart. It is rare for the riches of this world
          not to make men proof against the word. And oftentimes racking crosses
          in the world make the word tasteless to those that are under it. By
          their crosses the Israelites were filled with murmurings. They
          embitter a carnal spirit, that knows no comfort but what is drawn out
          of the creatures. And as the world often prevents the entrance of the
          word, so it also chokes it when it has taken some hold of them. How
          many convictions, resolutions of amendment, and fair blossoms of
          reformation have been choked among these thorns? Hands and head full
          of the world again, have soon emptied the heart of all good motions,
          and brought persons back to their usual security. The bewitching world
          brings them back that have apparently been fairly set on the way to
          Heaven. It remains,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To show how the world comes to be the one thing that commonly
          stands between professors and Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Because there is a liberty allowed us to use the world, and
          therefore men think they cannot go wrong in this. Even religion
          enjoins us to be careful about it, and the march between lawful and
          unlawful is so small, and the hearts of men so deceitful, that they
          easily pass over into an excess. The world being a thing lawful in
          itself, the snare is not so easily seen as in other things which are
          in themselves absolutely forbidden. See the context.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because this sin can be more easily covered than many others. It
          puts on a fair name of frugality and honest care about our business,
          and the venom of the heart's cleaving to the world does not appear to
          others, so that the man has something to defend his practice before
          men. And so gets his idol and his profession to keep to his ruin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because unsound professors never bring their hearts to rest in God,
          and yet bring them off the gross pollutions of the outward man, and
          therefore it follows of course that they rest in the world, and that
          is their great idol. They forsake the fountain, and therefore go to
          the streams. They forsake the most polluted streams, and therefore
          swim in those that are not so gross.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because worldliness is opposite to many vices in which the profane
          part of the world is drowned. Such as idleness, prodigality, luxury
          and riot: and so while fools shun one rock they split upon another.
          While some men toss the world from them as a ball at their foot, they
          take it up as a burden on their back, while they ought only to use it
          as a staff in their hand, to help them on their journey to another
          world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use of Exhortation. 1. I would exhort you to search and try whether or
          not this be the one thing you lack, whether the world be your idol or
          not. You must know that the world may be the poor man's as well as the
          rich man's idol. The excessive love of the world may lodge in a poor
          man's breast, as well as a rich man's. They are not all rich of whom
          it is said, "whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and
          whose glory is in their shame, and who mind earthly things." You may
          gather the knowledge of this, from what has been said before in
          general, and more particularly. 1. Does your joy and sorrow,
          confidence and fear, depend on the success of worldly things? then
          surely it is your idol, the fountain of your joy, the spring of your
          sorrow, Luke 12:19. Grace will teach people to hang their joys and
          sorrows on another pillar, even on the God of their salvation.
          Habakkuk 3:17. Ah! how many have felt more joy in a good bargain, than
          in the covenant of grace; and more sorrow in some deadly loss, than in
          the loss of the favor of God; and are more afraid that things go wrong
          with them in the world, than with their souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When people have sense of worldly things, but no proportionable
          sense of spiritual things, that shows that they are more taken up with
          the world than with their souls, Matthew 13:22. It is sad to think how
          many have as much skill as their neighbors for the management of
          worldly things, but are completely stupid in the things of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. When the heart so cleaves to it, that it is the person's element,
          so that in the very duties of religion, the heart is going out after
          the world, Ezekiel 33:31. and the time spent in these duties is
          wearisome, ever saying in their hearts, "when will the new moon be
          gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth
          wheat?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. What is it that your heart is most bent to pursue? "For where your
          treasure is, there will your heart be also." If your treasure be
          above, you will be most bent on securing that; if not, the world
          surely is your idol, as that which lies nearest your heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. See then that this stand not between Heaven and you. Beware that
          be not the one thing lacking. Let us shake off this idol, and be
          denied to the world, if ever we would see Heaven. I speak particularly
          to those that are professors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. The world has been the ruin of many eminent professors of
          religion, as Judas, Demas, and others. They followed religion, but
          with the world in their heart, hence by the weight of it, they fell at
          length, as stars from Heaven. Oh! shall we not be afraid of the rocks
          upon which, we see that others have split before us. Look on it as a
          fearful root of apostasy, which while it sits fast, there is not one
          pin of all your religion sure. The devil has still a handle to catch
          you by and bring you back again, 1 Timothy 4:10.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That very thing appears to be the great cause of the decay of
          religion, that has seized upon the professors of this generation. It
          is manifest that there is a great decay of religion among professors,
          and alas the world has a great hand in it. I will tell you three
          differences between professors now and formerly. Formerly God was
          always pulling the pillow from under their head, and that kept them
          awake: now they have had long ease, and they are fallen asleep. Thus,
          even Noah went astray in a time of ease, Genesis 9:20, 21. In the time
          of persecution they were kept awake, and were concerned for the temple
          of God without and within them; but now our own houses go between us
          and our concern for it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Formerly they cared less for the world and then they had more of it;
          and now they care more for the world and they have less of it. They
          were ready to quit with what they had for God, and he blessed what
          they had; now they are like to part with God for the world, and he
          blasts it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Formerly enemies took it from them, and they parted with it to them
          freely; now God is taking it from them, and their heart goes with it.
          And yet he is the same God that deals with them now, that dealt with
          them then. Oh! is not this sad, that we should grudge it to him
          whatever way he is pleased to call for it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Brethren stir up yourselves; mind Heaven more, and the world less, if
          ever you would be recovered. Out from among the stuff, if you have a
          mind for the kingdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The world is the cause of many scandalous out-breakings among
          professors, that expose religion to the scorn of a profane generation.
          Love of the world makes many break over the bounds of common honesty,
          if they can but get it secretly done. Hence so much injustice in men's
          dealings one with another, cheating and deceiving one another; and
          biting and devouring one another for trifles, lasting feuds and enmity
          between professors: all flowing from this one thing lacking.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Do you not know better things to be taken up with? Is there not
          treasure in Heaven to be sought after? The having of the world cannot
          make you happy, the want of it cannot make you miserable. But treasure
          in Heaven will make you happy. Behold then on what you set your
          hearts. Let the profane world that know no better seek these things,
          but why should you who know better do so.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. You will lose all your religion by it. No man can serve two
          masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else
          he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God
          and mammon. You will finally lose Heaven itself, for this is the
          doctrine of the text.

          THE Papists will have this to be an evangelical counsel, not a
          command; that is a good work shown to us by Christ, but not commanded,
          only commended by him. But all the counsels of God are commands,
          Revelation 1:19, 20. and all perfection is commanded peremptorily,
          Matthew 5:48. And for the one before us, it is a plain command
          peremptorily obliging him to obedience. True, it is not a universal
          command, but personal and explanatory, to discover the worldliness of
          this covetous wretch; and God having called for this at his hands, he
          could no more possess them with a good conscience. Hence in general
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine III. It is the duty of all to sit so loose to whatever they
          have in the world, as to be ready to part with it at the call of God.
          I will show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. When it is that people have a call from God to part with what they
          have. Here I remark,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That when in the holy providence of God, it comes to this, that
          people must either sin or suffer; when they must either part with
          their goods, or part with a good conscience, then God calls us to part
          with what we have. Hence we read, that in such times, "the saints took
          joyfully the spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves, that they
          had in Heaven a better and an enduring substance." At such times all
          that is called for and kept back, is robbed from, and cursed by God.
          It is not long since the violence of persecutors brought professors to
          this strait, and we know not how soon it may again be the case. But we
          must give it to them, though it be not theirs; for it is no longer
          ours than we can keep it without sin. The blood of the soul is such
          watering to what we have, that we cannot expect that it will thrive
          after. The world is the garment, which like Joseph, we must leave
          behind us, when we cannot retain it without sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When needy objects present themselves to us, and we are in capacity
          to help them, then God calls us to part with it to them. Hence it is
          said, "He who has pity upon the poor, lends unto the Lord; and that
          which he has given, will he pay him again." It is a dangerous thing to
          refuse God a loan. The poor have a right to a portion of our goods, by
          virtue of the command of God, who has given them to us with this
          burden, as the duty which we owe to him of whom we hold, as Lord of
          the earth. This is a time in which we have many such calls, let us
          then take heed we keep not back what God is seeking from us. "For
          whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry
          himself, but shall not be heard." Even then though people should be
          straitened themselves, yet let us remember how the deep poverty of the
          Macedonians, abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. When what people have has been acquired unjustly; what is got
          unjustly is not ours in the sight of God, and therefore God calls us
          to part with it again. Zacchaeus when converted said, "Behold, Lord,
          the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything
          from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold." Whatever is
          got unjustly is a moth among the rest, and brings a curse with
          it.—Surely they have a slippery hold of what they have, that possess
          other people's property as their own. Unjust dealing makes many
          persons' property go away from them very suddenly. Have not our eyes
          seen the ill gotten goods of persecutors and others, that have
          enriched themselves with the spoils of the Lord's people, vanish away
          from among their hands by virtue of a secret curse. How often do
          estates go from hand to hand, being purchased so much by injustice and
          oppression, which they will not restore, and God makes them vomit it
          up again. "The wicked man has swallowed down riches, and he shall
          vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly." In such a
          case then, both conscience and interest call for parting with it, Job
          20:10.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. When God by his providence is pulling it from us. Then it becomes
          us to say with Job, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
          shall I return thither; the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away;
          blessed be the name of the Lord." Sometimes God lays comforts to our
          hands, sometimes he returns and calls for his own again; then we
          should be ready to part with them. This is a day, in which God has
          many on their trials this way, take heed that you behave under them.
          When God is pulling away with his hand, let not your hearts draw
          against him. Never cast out with God and Heaven for this world's
          goods; never have a worse thought of him and his way, because he will
          have back his own again, but thank him for what he leaves you. Let us
          now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. Give the reasons of the doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because it is the command of God. "Love not the world, says he,
          neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world,
          the love of the Father is not in him." He has placed us in the world,
          and he commands us to sit loose to it. The authority of God should
          sway us. They sit too fast who are not ready to rise at his call.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because he has power to take from us whatever we have. He has a
          right to it. It is his own, and may he not do with his own what he
          pleases?—Whatever he has given us, he has not denuded himself of the
          right to it. The use of it during his pleasure is ours, the property
          his. He is also able to take it from us, whether we will or not. Keep
          as fast a hold as you can, God can easily divide you and it. And
          indeed people are never more exposed to this, than when they hold very
          fast. Now what reason, what wisdom in not sitting loose to that to
          which God has still a right, and is perfectly able to take whenever he
          pleases.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because he has given us the use of what we have on no other terms,
          but to part with it when he calls for it again. It is then a loan more
          properly than a gift. We are not to sit so loose to grace, for it is
          an irrevocable gift. The gifts and calling of God are without
          repentance. But for the world we are tenants at will, and he may raise
          us at any time, nor did he ever set us down upon other terms. "Will
          you set your eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make
          themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward Heaven." God has
          stamped uncertainty upon all our enjoyments, which, when we look to
          them, tells us to keep a loose hold of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because otherwise we put them in God's stead, and are therefore
          guilty of idolatry. Therefore it is said, If any man love the world,
          the love of the Father is not in him. For if there be anything which
          we are not ready to part with at God's call, then there is something
          we love more than God, seeing we will rather displease him than part
          with it. How can we say we love him, when we will not part with what
          we have for his sake? Is there anything to be laid in the balance with
          his favor? Is there anything can compensate the loss of it? Anything
          at the rate of which his frowns are purchased, that ought to be
          regarded.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Because there is nothing worthy of its room with us, after God has
          called for it from us. For it cannot be expected that God and it will
          lodge together after. "Neither will I be with you any more, said God
          to the Israelites, until you take away the accursed thing from among
          you." Whatever is thus kept will be fair to be a plague to you. Laying
          up often proves a plague, when God calls to laying out. "There is,
          says the wise man, a sore evil which I have seen under the sun,
          namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. But those
          riches perish by evil travail." See the end of the rich man, Luke
          16:19–23. Take heed that what you keep up, do not go a worse way and
          take away more with it, Malachi 3:8–10. God takes away all the good
          out of that which people cannot part with for him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Because we must part with it sooner or later, and this is the most
          pleasant way of parting with it. It is true, people may be longer in
          parting with it. But they will never part with it so easily as that
          way. Ripe fruit falls easily from the tree, when the unripe must be
          violently plucked. When the heart is loosed from what we have, it is
          easy letting it away, by what it is when the heart holds by it, until
          it is forced to let it go.—Again, we can never part with it so
          honorably. The liberality of the Macedonians was a clear evidence of
          the grace of God bestowed upon them. No thanks to you when God takes
          it from you, whether you will or not. People must let go what they
          have when they are utterly unable to keep it any longer. Oh! how
          honorable is it to forsake the world at God's call, Song 4:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use of Exhortation. O then sit loose to the world and whatever you
          have in it. Sell whatever you have in this respect. There is a twofold
          spiritual market spoken of in the scriptures. The first is that in
          which sinners are called to buy whatever they want. "I counsel you,
          says Jesus, to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich;
          and white clothing that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your
          nakedness do not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you
          may see." This market is opened in the gospel, and God has stored it
          with whatever may suit our necessities. The second market is that in
          which sinners are to sell whatever they have.—This market is
          mentioned, Matthew 13:44–46. All that have a mind for Heaven must
          trade in both these markets. It is the last of these of which I now
          speak, and invite you to trade in. I shall speak of five things
          respecting this market.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. The opening of this market. This God himself has done by open
          proclamation in his word, bearing two things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That whoever will bring whatever they have to this market and sell
          it, it shall be bought, and they shall get an upmaking price for it, a
          thousand times more than it is worth. See the text. See also Matthew
          19:29. Matthew 6:19, 20. Whoever will thus lay out their treasures in
          earth for God, shall lay up treasures in Heaven. Is not this an
          engaging market?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That all are obliged to bring whatever they have to it, and sell it
          there. So says the text. It is laid on us as a peremptory duty, thus
          to sell all, Song 4:8. 1 John 2:15. It is not left to our option
          whether we will do it or not, but enjoined with certification of God's
          highest displeasure if we do it not, Matthew 16:25, 26. And there are
          many who are set up as monuments of God's indignation, because they
          would not do it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Who is the buyer? In the other market God is the seller, and
          sinners are the buyers: here God is the buyer, the sinner the seller.
          It is the Lord, the happy merchant resigns it, whoever he employs to
          receive it. God can employ the wind, water, fire, enemies, thieves,
          oppressors, devils, death, and the like, to receive it. But it is to
          himself that it goes. For he gave and he takes away. It is he who pays
          the price, though not of debt, yet of grace, even treasures in Heaven.
          "The gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord." It
          is God that makes the offer for it, and strikes hands with the sinner
          for the up-making reward. Now who would refuse to part with all to
          him, who leaves it for the most part, and his blessing with it unto
          the sinner for a long time, when once it is given up to him, and they
          are ready to part with it. No sooner the soul enters home to Christ,
          but it lays all down at his feet, saying, "Lord, what will you have me
          to do," and he leaves it with them until he see need to call for it.
          Again, yes, he never actually takes it from them, but when it is good
          for them to want it.—"For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve
          the children of men." When Isaiah intimated to Hezekiah, the judgments
          that were to come upon his family and kingdom, the king said, "Good is
          the will of the Lord which you have spoken; he said, moreover, For
          there shall be peace and truth in my days." So indeed runs the
          promise. "All things shall work together for good to them that love
          God." All is for their good, for all things are theirs. And faith will
          make the soul say, He does all things well. All is best that he does.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Where is this market kept? This sale of all to God is made in the
          heart of the sinner. It is in the innermost parts of the soul that
          this solemn transaction passes. When God begins to deal with a soul,
          he puts the soul out of its sinful rest, and then all that a man has,
          is brought out and viewed in the heart. The Savior comes with his gold
          tried in the fire, and offers the exchange, and the soul seeing the
          emptiness of whatever it has, sells, renounces, and gives over all to
          the Lord, and consents to the blessed offer. And so necessary is this,
          that if it were most solemnly made by the tongue, or at a communion
          table, if it be not done in the heart, it is no bargain. But however
          secretly it is managed, there are two witnesses to it. These are 1st,
          The man's own spirit who knows the things of a man. "O my soul, says
          David, you have said unto the Lord, you are my Lord." This is as a
          thousand witnesses, and can often condescend on time and place, where
          this solemn bargain was made. The 2d, Is the Spirit of God, who is a
          joint witness with our spirit. "For the Spirit bears witness with our
          spirit, that we are the children of God." He likewise seals the
          blessed bargain, as the privy seal of Heaven. "For we are sealed with
          that holy spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance."
          Thus the bargain is secretly ratified. And in the sacraments it is
          publicly sealed, both on God's part and the sinner's part. In these
          the sinner renounces the devil, the world, and the flesh, and openly
          declares his willingness to part with all for Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. What are these things we must sell in this market. It is whatever
          we have in this world. We must sit so loose to it as to be ready to
          part with it whenever God calls for them at our hands. There must be
          nothing but what we thus sell in affection. Particularly, 1st. Our
          nearest relations. "If any man, says Christ, come to me, and hate not
          his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and
          sisters, yes and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple." True,
          we are to love them, and that as ourselves, yet not as our God, and
          therefore we must be ready to part with them at his call. It was the
          commendation of Levi, that in the cause of God, he regarded none of
          these, Deuteronomy 33:9. If you be a true Christian, if God should
          take away husband, wife, children, and other relatives from you, it
          would be but the delivering up of what you did solemnly part with to
          him, when you closed with Christ. O what fast holds do we keep of
          these things! How unready to part with them! How ready to quarrel with
          the Lord upon these things! but consider our Lord's words, "He who
          loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he who
          loves son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Our goods and possessions be they great or small, lest we be like
          him of whom the text speaks, verse 22. We must part with all to the
          Lord, houses, and lands, and goods, and be ready to part with them at
          a call, and lay them all down at the Lord's feet that he may dispose
          of them as he will. Though our idols were of gold, they must be sold
          off as thick clay that can do nothing but lade us, when God calls for
          them. For no man can serve two masters. In the day you take God for
          your Lord, you must renounce mammon's Lordship.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Our worldly pleasures and satisfactions. These also must be laid
          down at the Lord's feet; and we content to be without them, as well as
          with them, and never to launch so far, but when God calls we be ready
          to come ashore. If God shall please to deny us even our lawful
          desires, mingle our drink with gall and make us of those that never
          eat with pleasure, we must be ready to give up with what he sees not
          meet to let us keep.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Our credit and esteem is in the world. This is a great mercy in
          itself. For a good name is better than precious ointment. But it is
          oftentimes a great idol, so that the credit of many goes between God
          and them. But we must lay it at the Lord's feet among other things.
          There are few that have much of it but they suffer an eclipse of it
          some time or other. God even sends for it, and sometimes to be a
          stepping-stone to his glory. We should not refuse it to him, but be
          content to follow him through ill as well as good report. They have
          not made this sale that are not content to part with it at his call,
          and even lie down among the pots until he himself bring them out
          again.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Our liberty and ease. "I am ready, said Paul, not to be bound only,
          but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." The
          flesh cries, man spare yourself; but the Spirit offers the flesh to
          the Lord, that he may dispose of it as he will. It is a mercy to have
          liberty and ease, but we must be ready to part with them if we should
          never get an easy hour, but be hunted as partridges, until we get to
          Heaven. He who loves his liberty so as not to part with it at God's
          call is yet the devil's bond slave, and has not been at this market.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Our very life must be brought hither and sold. For unless a
          man hate his own life also, says Jesus, he cannot be my disciple. You
          must give your bodies to the Lord, not only for service, but for a
          sacrifice also if he requires them. And when you have made this
          bargain it is no dear purchase, Acts 20:24.—There are none that go to
          Heaven, but are martyrs either in affection or action. Perhaps the
          Lord may have use for your strength, beauty, leg, or limb, and perhaps
          for your blood. You must not stand with him for any of these things,
          but make them his by resignation; and when he calls for his own let
          him have it with good-will. Most probably he will not seek your life,
          but in a natural way, but you must be ready so as to part with it, if
          he call for it. "I am ready, said Paul, not to be bound only, but also
          to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">V. In what this sale consists.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In the heart's renouncing its property in these things, Matthew
          16:24. These things the heart of man naturally looks upon, and holds
          as its own, as suited to its corrupt state; and therefore its own by
          choice, Luke 12:19. Hence so many carnal <i>my's</i>, my corn, my
          cattle, etc. but not a word of my God among them all, Hosea 2:5. Now
          there must be a selling of them in affection. The heart must quit its
          firm hold of them, and so be loosed from them, the bonds of iniquity
          that bound the heart and the world together being broken. "If any man,
          said Jesus, come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife,
          and children, and brethren, and sisters, yes, and his own life also,
          he cannot be my disciple."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In the heart's resigning of these things unto the Lord, saying with
          Paul, Lord, what will you have me to do. The soul must thus give up
          all unto the Lord, that he may do with them as with his own, what he
          pleases, 1 Samuel 3:18. 2 Samuel 15:25, 26. No soul closes with Christ
          aright, who does not lay all its enjoyments, even life itself at his
          feet. These were the man's gods before, now they are laid on the altar
          for sacrifices to the true God, and the man is ready to surrender them
          all to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The heart's accepting of the treasure in Heaven, for and instead of
          them, so says the text, you shall have treasure in Heaven. God does
          not desire us, nor will the heart part with these but for something
          better, Matthew 13:44–46. Thus the heart rises from off the earth and
          embraces Heaven. And the former my's are changed unto my Lord, and my
          God. But treasure in Heaven is far off from them. How then can they
          accept of it? Answer, Many a good bargain is made, where there is not
          hand payment. But they get a present right to Heaven and all the
          treasure.—All things are theirs, and they are Christ's. They are
          immediately heirs of glory. "For to as many as receive him, Jesus
          gives power to become the sons of God. And if children, heirs, then
          heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ." They have then a right to
          all the weight of glory. They have also God's bond of payment, and
          what though he take a day, it will be punctually kept. All the
          promises are theirs. They get the earnest in hand. "After they
          believe, they are sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is
          the earnest of our inheritance." Thus as the spirit of the world goes
          out, the Spirit of the Lord comes in. Now this earnest is both part of
          the price, and a pledge of the rest. Yes, they get the chief, the best
          part of the treasure in hand, Matthew 13:45, 46. The one pearl of
          great price. Christ is theirs, who is God's unspeakable gift, he is
          the great leading and comprehensive one of all. Thus is that blessed
          bargain made.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          VI. How is this sale to be managed. If you would manage it right,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. You must sell wholesale. God will not bargain for parcels. The text
          is express. All or nothing.—God needs none of these things. It is your
          heart only that he is seeking: and he would buy up these things that
          your hearts may not be led away with them. Now the heart may go a
          whoring after one as well as after many; therefore if there be any one
          thing, which you would keep up, God is set to have that by all the
          rest; and if you will not give it to him, he will take it, and give
          you nothing for it but wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You must not value your wares, nor think God in your debt when you
          resign these things to him. We can pay no proper price for Heaven. The
          gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Is there
          any proportion between what we have, and the weight of glory. Besides
          we do but give him his own in this case; and we are in his debt for
          grace to induce us to part with them. "But who am I, said David, and
          what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after
          this sort? for all things come of you, and of your own have we given
          you." This is no proper sale, but all is of grace. If you give up what
          you have with an opinion of merit, you will lose it and your reward
          also: it will dye your blood (though you should give it) as black as
          Hell.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. You must sell willingly, God loves a cheerful giver. If it be not
          done with the whole heart, it is not done at all to purpose. It is all
          one among men whether the seller be willing to part with his goods or
          not, if he but say the word it is enough. It is not so here.—This
          transaction is done in the heart; and by the heart. And if the heart
          do not give up with these things, though the hands deliver them up,
          you cannot look for the treasure in Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. You must do it in the view and in the faith of a treasure in
          Heaven. If this man in the text had possessed the faith of this, he
          had not gone away sorrowful. God loves to be trusted. This was the
          thing which made the possessors part with their goods, and the martyrs
          with their lives. "They knew that they had in Heaven a better and an
          enduring substance. Yes, they did not accept deliverance from death,
          that they might obtain a better resurrection." If we had the faith of
          this, we would part with what we have more cheerfully than we do.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Absolutely and forever without thoughts of claiming our possession
          again. It is not for a time we must make this bargain as many
          unfaithfully do at a communion, or some solemn time, and just return
          as they were, taking as firm a hold of the world as ever, 2 Peter
          2:22. But the treasure in Heaven must be an eternal covering of the
          eyes to you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, presently. "Today if you will hear his voice, then harden not
          your hearts." The things to be sold are now in your hand, you have it
          in your power to part with them. But perhaps this night they may be
          required at your hand; they may be taken from you, and then you will
          not have them to sell. We cannot promise you this market tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let me therefore now renew my exhortation to you, to sell all in this
          respect, to sit loose to the world, to renounce and resign it, to
          accept of Christ Jesus as your all in all. In this consists your
          loosing from the world. And endeavor through the whole of your life to
          sit loose to it, which, in consequence of that selling, lies in these
          three things to which I exhort you also.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Look on whatever you have as no more your own but the Lord's, which
          he may dispose of as seems good in his eyes. This follows on your
          having renounced and resigned them. You are not your own, but bought
          with a price. Hence the children of God are said to look on themselves
          as pilgrims and strangers in the world. Their language is, "God forbid
          that we should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." If
          you take me, says Christ, let these go their way. If you will have
          Christ to be yours, let all you have be his, and look on it as such.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Place so little dependence upon what you have, as that you may be
          able to stand without them, when they are called from you. "This I
          say, Brethren, the time is short. It remains, that both they that have
          wives, be as though they had none. And they that weep, as though they
          wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they
          that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this world,
          as not abusing it, for the fashion of this world passes away." If you
          take the treasure in Heaven instead of these things, it follows of
          course, that as he who sells his land, especially for more than its
          worth, can live without it on its price; so in the want of these
          things, you will rejoice in the Lord, and will joy in the God of your
          salvation. Why should a man's heart sink, when the thing sold is
          delivered, while he has more than the worth instead of it. O it is a
          sad mark when a man falls, while anything of the world is removed, as
          a house when its pillars are overturned.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Be ready always to part with them when God calls for them. If they
          be not yours, you are but stewards of that which is the Lord's, and
          why should he be refused what of his own he calls for? And what is
          that to you, or to any of us, whom he employs to receive it, or to
          whom he obliges you to give it up. You are in his debt for the use you
          have had of his so long. For God might have obliged you to deliver up
          all in the moment of sale. In the moment that you renounced the world
          and took Christ, he might have stripped you naked of all earthly
          enjoyments, and by virtue of your own voluntary resignation. Again,
          there is no term for delivery condescended upon, but it is to be made
          on demand. Should we not rather wonder then, that God is so long in
          calling for his own, and that he leaves us the use of it so long,
          especially considering we so much abuse it. Surely this is not the
          manner of men. Therefore,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When God calls for anything we have, we should part with it freely,
          and not grudgingly. O it is a sad matter that God must wring his own
          out of our hands; and that we should spoil the gift with the surly way
          of giving it. If the heart had not too fast a hold of it, we would
          part with it more freely, as a matter of bounty, and not of
          covetousness. We should also do it thankfully, we should not only
          barely submit, but submit thankfully, saying, good is the will of the
          Lord. There is matter of thankfulness, that we have had it so long in
          loan, and that ordinarily God takes not all his own way at once; but
          while life is left he leaves the best, For the life is more than meat,
          and the body than clothing. And if life itself be called for, we must
          even be ready to die for the name of the Lord Jesus. We should also be
          ready to acknowledge that we are not losers at his hand.—"We should
          with Paul, count all things but loss for the excellency of the
          knowledge of Jesus Christ; for whom we suffer the loss of all things,
          and do count them but dung that we may win Christ." In allusion to
          David's excessive sorrow for the death of Absalom, we may remark, that
          often the manner in which we part with what we have, says, we think
          that God is in the wrong to us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Perhaps it may be objected that these things might do well enough in
          the parting with the world for the cause of Christ? but that is not
          our case, and so these things do not concern us. Answer. It may
          however come to be your case, and therefore you ought to sit loose to
          the world in view of it. It is true also that many go to Heaven, that
          never suffer by persecutors for religion, but none go there but
          through tribulation. Do you think that God never has people on their
          trials, whether they love Christ, or the world best, but when enemies
          are fining, plundering, or hanging them, if you do, you are mistaken.
          See the text. Your daily crosses are trials of this nature; and let me
          say it, sometimes these prove a greater trial than the other.—Some
          have given what they had to enemies with better will, than to God
          taking it away immediately by his own hand. Again, the cause is still
          the same, for in private trials, our love to Christ and the world are
          still in competition, and whatever way God calls for it, we must part
          with it, for his sake.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motives To press this duty of sitting loose to the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Consider the vanity of the world. "Vanity of vanities, all is
          vanity." This world is a heap of vanities. Men are carried away
          snatching at shadows.—All things in the world are so empty and
          uncertain, that no dependence can be placed upon them. There is an
          insufficiency, and an emptiness in all earthly things. They are
          greater in expectation, than in enjoyment.—A man shall as soon fill
          his hand with the wind, as his heart with the world, Proverbs 23:5.
          These things are also uncertain. There is nothing constant here but
          inconstancy. The world is a wheel, in which that spoke that was now
          upmost, is next the lowest. Nothing is secure, our relations may be
          lost by death; and sometimes there is less satisfaction in the having
          of them, than it were so. How quickly do worldly goods go away,
          Matthew 6:19. Pleasure is attended with pain and is short lived. The
          most untainted reputation may die with the bite of a malicious tongue.
          Our life itself hangs on a thousand uncertainties.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You must part with all you have sooner or later. Death approaches,
          that will permit us to carry nothing away but a coffin and shroud. Let
          men hold as fast as they will they must part. It is wisdom then to sit
          loose to that which we cannot keep, especially when we are not sure of
          retaining them one moment. It is bad preparation for death to be fixed
          to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Consider that sitting loose to them, is necessary preparation for
          suffering. We may be called to suffer. God has told us, "that in the
          world we shall have tribulation," and he will have all that come to
          him to lay their account with it. Besides, it is very probable the
          things that concern us make haste. Things have a very bad aspect at
          this time. Our enemies are lifting up their heads. But above all that
          which may strike a damp into our hearts, is the sin of the land
          ripening for the sickle of vengeance. The gospel is despised; atheism,
          profanity, and irreligion, abound more and more. All flesh has
          corrupted their ways. As for our great people generally they have
          burst the yoke.—Ministers and professors have had long ease and they
          have all gathered much mud. The gospel does generally so little good,
          that I believe there are not a few who could be content to welcome the
          cross, so as the gospel might have more influence on the hearts of
          themselves and their people. But O how will you stand it, if not loose
          to the world. A carnal heavy heart, is a heavy weight on all good
          motions of the soul. If a storm blow, it will blow out the fire of
          some, and blow up the fire of others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Consider that if ever you have engaged to Christ, then you give up
          the world in profession, when you were baptized, and you that sat down
          at the Lord's table you have solemnly renounced and resigned it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Consider that persons have the most unsure hold of that to
          which their hearts are most attached.—Jonah was exceeding glad for the
          gourd. You cannot take a surer way to make yourselves quit of any
          enjoyment, than to let it run away with your heart. They that sit
          loosest to the world have the surest hold.—"Delight yourself also in
          the Lord; and he shall give you the desires of your heart. Commit your
          way unto the Lord: trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine IV.—A heart loosed from the world, so as to be ready to part
          with whatever we have at God's call, is necessary to evidence our
          sincerity. This was the very thing by which our Savior discovered the
          hypocrisy of the man in the text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Reason 4. Because the soul cannot reasonably lay hold on Christ, but
          it must needs let the world go. The laying hold on Christ, necessarily
          infers our loosing our hold of the world, Luke 14:26. We may as soon
          grasp Heaven and earth at once, as fix on Christ and not loose from
          the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because it is impossible, that the love of God and the world can be
          both predominant in the heart. One of them must prevail above the
          other. If it be the love of God, then it will command the love of the
          world to give place, Hebrews 11:25, 26. If it be the love of the
          world, then it leaves no love to God, because no predominant love.
          "For if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
          This proves the man a hypocrite. For whoever will be the friend of the
          world is the enemy of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because otherwise our obedience is not universal, there is someone
          thing lacking, that will bring shame on us at last, Psalm 119:6. Such
          cannot follow the Lord wherever he goes, but have their exceptions at
          his commandments, which discover their hypocrisy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because otherwise there is no universal resignation to the will of
          God, which is necessary to prove the sincerity of the heart, Acts 9:6.
          If this be wanting there is nothing done; there is no giving to the
          Lord what he chiefly seeks, namely that we may be all his. A certain
          evidence, the work of grace was never carried through else we would
          have been a people of willingnesses. Psalm 110:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Use 1. Of Information. This writes death.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. To all covetous wretches whose hearts are glued to the world, so as
          they cannot part with it at God's call, as in the text. That idol
          mammon has many adorers, who set their affections on things on the
          earth; whose excessive love of the world overturns all their pretenses
          to the love of God. These are they whom God abhors, and whom he
          excludes from Heaven, 1 Corinthians 6:10 and whose end shall be
          destruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. To those who can part with many things at God's call, yet have
          someone thing that the heart is fixed to, in which their will can
          never comply with the will of God to part with it, such was
          Ahithophel's reputation. God will have all or nothing. It is all one,
          whether the persons have many idols, or only one: if there be anything
          he cannot part with for God, he is, and will be miserable.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. To those who though they cannot part with what they have for God,
          they can part with at the devil's call, and give it out on their lusts
          to satisfy them.—How liberally will men bestow on their lusts, who
          look on all as lost that is given out for God and his service, like
          Nabal, 1 Samuel 25:36 and those described by the apostle James,
          chapter 4:3, 4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. To those who instead of parting with what they have, will part with
          God and a good conscience to gain something more of the world. Common
          honesty is failed with many, especially of the poorer sort, who giving
          themselves up to picking and stealing to the dishonor of God, and
          disgrace of the society to which they belong. Alas it is sad, that
          that should be all the effect of God's heavy hand on families. These
          things are kept hidden from the eyes of men, but there is a God that
          sees and will bring such persons to a dreadful account, 1 Corinthians
          6:9, 10. Zechariah 5:3, 4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 2. Of Exhortation. Evidence your sincerity by being ready to part
          with what you have at God's call. I told you before when God calls you
          to part with what you have. Now when any of these is your case God has
          you on your trials. Accordingly I exhort you,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That whenever it is so, that you must either sin or suffer loss.
          Choose always the last. The greatest loss in the world is to be chosen
          rather than the least sin. A man should rather lose his life than tell
          a lie. Consider there is more evil in the least sin, than in the
          greatest suffering or loss. Sin is a sinful evil, the other but a
          penal evil. There is some good in the evil of punishment, the good of
          justice, there is none in sin. Losses come from the Lord, sin only
          from the devil. Sure that which comes from the devil, must be worse
          than what comes from God. Sin is the only object of God's hatred: if
          all other evils in the world should center in a man, God could love
          him for all that; but if all other goods should meet in him, God would
          hate him for sin. There is more evil in sin, than there is goodness in
          all the angels of Heaven; therefore when it entered it spoiled all
          their goodness, and made them devils, which could not have been, if
          the goodness in them had been greater than the evil of sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, If you intend to follow the footsteps of the flock you must
          take this way. As for the fearful, that fear suffering more than sin,
          their doom is, "to have their part in the lake which burns with fire
          and brimstone, which is the second death. Fear not them which kill the
          body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather him which is able
          to destroy both soul and body in Hell." Daniel would rather be cast
          into the den of lions than sin. The primitive Christians chose loss
          and poverty, yes, prisons and death rather than sin, Hebrews 11:25,
          26, 35. It is better to be God's prisoner, than the devil's freeman.
          Nay, they chose Hell rather than sin. They whose experience has given
          them a commentary on 2 Corinthians 7:11. clearing, indignation, fear,
          vehement desire, seal, revenge, will own it. It was a saying of
          Chrysostom, I thus think, and I will constantly declare, that it is
          more bitter to sin against Christ, than to suffer the torments of
          Hell.

          Mark 10:21 "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you
          have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then
          come, follow me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          FROM these words taken in their strict connection with the preceding
          and following clauses of the verse, I would exhort you to make
          conscience of giving to the poor. This is a duty at all times, and the
          present is in a peculiar manner a hard time. Many are reduced to great
          want, and it is certainly God's call to us, in a special manner, now
          to put on affections of mercy for that effect. Here I shall show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, How or in what manner God calls us to give to the poor, and,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Bring forward motives to enforce this duty. I am then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show how or in what manner God calls us to give to the poor. We
          are to do it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Under a sense of the command of God. "He who has pity upon the
          poor, lends unto the Lord; and that which he has given will he pay him
          again." God asks it of us by the mouth of needy creatures, and it
          should be given as to him, who in that way calls for it. This is
          necessary to make it a Christian giving.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. For his sake. Love to the Lord should be the source of it, and his
          glory the end of it. "Honor the Lord with your substance, and with the
          fruits of all your increase." He gave us what we have, and it should
          be laid out for his sake. Hear our Lord's own words, and from them
          learn how highly he values this duty. "Whoever, says he, shall give to
          drink unto one of these little ones, a cup of cold water only in the
          name of a disciple, truly I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his
          reward." Again, "Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of
          these my brethren, you have done it unto me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But it may be objected, that there are but few to whom we can give it
          as saints. Answer, It is a sad truth, most of the poor of the world
          are poor every way. But you see the rule in this case. It therefore
          opportunity, let us do good unto all men, them who are of the
          household of faith." Though poor are not God's saints, they are God's
          creatures; not true Christians, yet men of the same blood with
          ourselves, and so our neighbors, whom we are to love as ourselves. See
          Genesis 9:6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Humbly without any opinion of merit or valuing ourselves upon our
          charity. "When you do alms, let not your left hand know what your
          right hand does." It is but God's own we return him, why should we
          think much of it. They that think to buy Heaven with their works of
          charity, will find that they have sold it by their presumption.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Compassionately and tenderly. Hence it is called showing mercy,
          because it should flow from a charitable and compassionate mind,
          pitying those that are in distress. The injunction is, "Put on
          therefore (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) affections of
          mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering." And
          thus it will be given without shaming the poor. Thus Boaz caused, "let
          some handfuls fall on purpose for Ruth, and leave them that she may
          glean them, and said, reproach her not."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Seasonably, when there is most need. Unnecessary delays must be
          carefully avoided. The command is, "Withhold not good from them to
          whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it." Say
          not to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give;
          when you have by you." A gift in season is a double gift. And much of
          God's goodness is sometimes seen in that.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Cheerfully, with real good will. The Lord loves a cheerful giver.
          What is given with a grudge, is much lost before the Lord. Why should
          we that are but stewards of our Lord's goods, grudge to give out at
          his command.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But to this it may be objected that the poor are often unthankful.
          Answer, That is their sin, but let it not be your temptation. You are
          to give as unto the Lord, and look for your reward at his hand, not at
          the hands of those to whom it is given. "Love your enemies, and do
          good, and lend, hoping for nothing again: and your reward shall be
          great; and you shall be the children of the Highest; for he is kind
          unto the unthankful and to the evil." We are then to seek God's honor,
          not ourselves in the matter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Liberally, according to your ability; making it a matter of bounty.
          We must give as God has prospered us. We cannot determine what, and
          how much is to be given particularly, but that must be determined by
          every person considering his own ability, and the need of the object.
          "Those to whom God has given much, of them much is required." But
          though a man have not a farthing to give, he ought to give in
          affection, and whatever way it is in his power to help the poor he is
          bound to do it. Our own straits do not altogether excuse us, though
          they warrant us to give the less, as the widow's mite was fully enough
          for her. Men are even bound to labor and work for that very end, that
          they may have to give to the poor, Ephesians 4:28. 2 Corinthians
          8:1–4. I shall now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Bring forward some motives to enforce this duty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. We are not absolute masters, but stewards of what we have in the
          world. The world is God's household. To some he has given the
          stewardship, others are to be fed by them, Luke 16:10, 12. we must
          give an account to him of our stewardship, even to him who could have
          put us in their case, and them in ours. The due consideration of this,
          would make us more easily part with a portion of what we have to the
          poor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a duty bound upon us with ties both divine and natural. The
          law of God, in the scriptures, requires it, 2 Corinthians 9th and 9th
          chapters. Nature itself binds it on us, teaching us to do to others,
          what we would others should do to us, if we were in their case. It is
          not only charity, but humanity itself that commands us to supply the
          necessities of the poor. And therefore unless we divest ourselves of
          humanity we must attend to this duty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Consider the evil of shutting up our affections from the poor. It
          is a sin of a deep dye. It is horrid ingratitude to God. He has given
          unto us so much, and yet we will not part with a portion of it back
          again to himself when he calls for it. It is Christ himself that asks
          alms of us by the mouth of the poor, Matthew 25:40, 45. Now, if Jesus
          Christ came to us personally, what a dreadful thing would it be to
          deny him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is perfidiousness to God, and unfaithfulness in the charge which he
          has committed to us. It is as if a steward should turn all to his own
          use, which the master has entrusted to him for the maintenance of the
          family. It is even a kind of theft, and that of the worst sort,
          robbing the poor of what God has made their due. This God will punish,
          though the laws of men do not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a decree of murder, 1 John 3:15, 17. For as the fire may be put
          out by withholding fuel, as well as by pouring water upon it, so a
          man's life may be taken away by denying to him the supports of life,
          as well as by doing violence to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Consider the evil that follows it. It is a disposition of soul most
          disadvantageous, attended with a train of miserable consequences. It
          brings a moth into what a man has, and is the highway to poverty and
          want. "There is that scatters, and yet increases; and there is that
          withholds more than is meet, but it tends to poverty." For while men
          thus hold together, God in his anger scatters what they have. It is
          also a very black mark against the soul in religion. It is
          inconsistent with the true love of God. "For whoever has this world's
          good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his affections of
          compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him." Yes, it
          declares a person to be void of all religion, James 1:27. It is
          followed with most dreadful threatenings of the Lord's showing no
          mercy to such. "They shall have judgment without mercy, that have
          showed no mercy. Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he
          also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Consider the excellency of a charitable frame of spirit, ever ready
          to communicate to the poor. It is a blessed thing even by our Lord's
          own verdict, and he commends it as a thing more to be desired than
          received. It is more blessed, said he, to give than to receive. In
          this duty we do in a special manner put on the image and likeness of
          God, Luke 6:35, 36. Our Lord Jesus Christ when he was in the world,
          though he became poor, yet by his own example he recommended the duty
          of giving to the poor. It is selected from among other works, and
          applauded in the day of judgment, Matthew 25.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Consider the advantages which attend it. God has bound many signal
          advantages to it by promise. It is the very way to secure a
          through-bearing. Give in this way what you have at God's call, and you
          shall be provided for. "He who gives to the poor shall not lack; but
          he who hides his eyes shall have many a curse." It is the best way to
          secure our means that are liable to so many accidents, Ecclesiastes
          11:1–3. Laying out for God is better security than laying up what God
          calls for, for thus it is put in a sure hand, who will be sure to pay
          it again, Proverbs 19:17. It is the best way to be rich, as that way
          is pointed out by the Lord. If we thus honor God with our substance,
          our barns shall be filled with plenty, and our presses burst out with
          new wine. Solomon observes the accomplishment of this, for there is
          that scatters, says he, and yet increases; and every age has produced
          instances of this truth. You may see a cluster of benefits annexed to
          this duty, Psalm 40:1–5.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, To sum up all, God has promised mercy to those that are thus
          rightly qualified. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain
          mercy. Therefore our Lord tells us how to improve the goods of this
          world for eternal life. "Make to yourselves, says he, friends of the
          mammon of unrighteousness, that when you fail, they may receive you
          into everlasting habitations."—See also 1 Timothy 6:17–19. I shall
          shut up this by recommending to your serious reading and meditation,
          two passages of holy writ, Deuteronomy 15:7–11. Observe upon verse
          7th, That the poor as well as the rich are to be treated as brethren;
          and a hand shut to the poor, is an evidence of a hard heart. Observe
          upon verse 8th, We should give bountifully. Verse 9th, It is a
          dreadful thing to have a poor person justly table a complaint before
          the Lord against us. Verse 10th, We must not give with a grudge, and
          what is given in that way, will bring a blessing on what is behind.
          Verse 11th, The world shall never see the day in which men shall be
          able to serve God without cost and expenses. See also, 2 Corinthians
          8th and 9th chapters.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I would now, in strict connection with the doctrine of the text,
          exhort you to give evidence of your sincerity by parting with, and
          restoring whatever ill-gotten goods any of you have. This reaches to
          thieves, to oppressors, to cheaters, to unjust dealers of every
          description, and all that possess anything of their neighbors' got
          unjustly. Restoration ought to be made of the thing itself taken away
          if possible, and if not, of the value of it. And restoration is to be
          made to the true owner if he can be found, Nehemiah 5:11, his heirs,
          or to whoever his goods belong, and failing these, to God, bestowing
          it to be employed to pious uses, or towards the poor, Numbers 5:7, 8.
          Luke 19:8. If the person be not able, I judge in that case confession
          should be made, if a great evil do not follow, and the party engaged
          to restore if ever he be able, and in the mean time he be ready to do
          whatever he can towards the compensation, as by service, Exodus 22:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the retaining of ill-gotten goods is a continued theft,
          oppression, or cheat, and it is inconsistent with sincere repentance
          knowingly and willingly to keep still that which ever is the matter of
          our guilt, and the accursed thing among our stuff. To repent and yet
          still to enjoy the sin willingly is a contradiction. That man repents
          not of the wrong he has done to others, who, though he can, yet will
          not mend it, and is not disposed to give every one their own.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, I exhort you to give evidence of your sincerity, by parting
          willingly with what providence will not allow you to keep, but pulls
          out of your hands. Whatever satisfaction the Lord denies you in
          worldly things, whatever losses you meet with, know this, God has you
          on your trials, and the mere parting with them will not evidence your
          sincerity, for that you must do, whether you will or not: But you must
          do it freely.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Submissively, without murmuring against the Lord either in your hearts
          or words. So Aaron parted with his sons, He held his peace. Lament.
          3:27, 28. God must have his own at his call, and we should not
          entertain a wrong thought of him for it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must do it contentedly and thankfully. If the Lord will take away
          anything, we should be content to want it. Saying with David, "Behold
          here are we, let him do to us as seems good unto him: and let us learn
          in whatever state we are therewith to be content;" and to love him as
          well under the want, as the enjoyment of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Consider you are put to the trial. In that case the devil alleged that
          Job was a hypocrite; the trying point which he chose was losses and
          crosses in the world, Job 1:9–11. But Job proved himself sincere in
          that way. They that put in for the crown, must pass their trials for
          it under the cross. But of this afterwards.

          Mark 10:21 "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you
          have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then
          come, follow me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          <br />
          DOCTRINE I
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A VIEW of the treasure in Heaven is the best expedient to sink the
          value of the world in the hearts of men. This is the method our Lord
          takes with this man. This is the argument by which he tries to
          separate his heart from the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Reason 1. Because the heart will always hold to the world, until it
          see something better to which it may cleave. The heart is an empty
          hungry thing that must have something to feed upon. It is needless to
          desire it to part with husks, unless you show it bread enough which it
          may have, then it will throw away the husks with goodwill. Until God
          effectually overbid the world, it will always keep the man's heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because the treasures in Heaven infinitely transcend the world, and
          all that is in it; so that when they are both seen together, the world
          must, as the stars, disappear before the rising sun. A man may highly
          value a cottage in a wilderness, but place it in a city amidst
          splendid buildings, and he would be ashamed of it. Therefore Satan
          hinders men to look upward. The world is a contemptible heap of dust,
          to a man who views it from among the stars, Philippians 3:20, 21.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Not to insist, but make short work, I shall come to the application of
          this point. And the best use which I can make of it is to try this
          method with your hearts, to loose them from the world and make them
          heavenly. I might use many motives to urge you to bid an eternal
          farewell to the world, that you might take up your rest in God. I
          might open the gates of the bottomless pit, that the smoke thereof
          might blind your eyes, and the flames flash in your faces, to stop you
          in the pursuit of these miserable vanities. I might tell you,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That this miserable world is the devil's bait, with which he draws
          men in shoals down the stream, into the sea of God's wrath, Matthew
          4:9. And which is most sad, he draws many with baits made of that, who
          yet never taste the bait. How many have been eternally ruined,
          pursuing some worldly thing which they could never reach; but lost
          both their souls and their pains; yes and before they could get at
          Hell, they have got a Hell within them of tormenting passions, because
          God would not bow to their will, and give them what they would have
          had. I might also tell you,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The sweet of the world's cup will soon be exhausted, but you will
          never get to the bottom of the dregs of it, Luke 16:25. There is a now
          you are tormented, that will never be over. There will be a long
          eternity to pay the expense of this foul feast, which the heart is
          making on the things of the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The fire of God's wrath will loose those firm holds of the world,
          that the fire of God's word cannot.—The things of the world run so
          fast away with the hearts of men, that they cannot hear God's voice
          calling them to return. The lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh,
          and the pride of life hang so about men now, that they cannot get
          looked up to behold the beauty of Christ. But the fire of Hell will
          burn them off, and leave them to lie down naked in the flames. Dives's
          table is drawn now. The rich man, Luke 12 has no more to do with his
          barns. When Judas went to his own place, he left the thirty pieces
          behind him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The world and all you have in it, will be in flames before long,
          and you will perish in the flames, if you escape not now in time. All
          these things are "reserved unto fire, against the day of judgment and
          perdition of ungodly men." Be not then so fond of that which will make
          an ill end. Haste and escape for your life, for there is a shower of
          fire abiding the world and all that take it for their portion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But I would rather open heaven's door to you, to give you a view of
          the treasure there, according to our Lord's method in the text, in
          which he teaches other two things, namely,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine 2nd. Whoever will sell whatever they have in the world for
          Christ, they shall suffer no loss, they shall have treasure in Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine 3d. But they that will needs keep their hold of the world,
          may bid an eternal farewell to the treasure in Heaven, for they have
          neither lot nor portion in it. These are forcible motives indeed! O
          that they might take with us. For the first of these. I have been
          telling you of a market to be held in your hearts, where you should
          sell to God whatever you have. I come this day in his name to make an
          offer for whatever you have, that the blessed bargain may be
          closed.—And I entreat you all to take it to you. Let not poor persons
          think themselves unconcerned, because they have nothing: if it were as
          far from your hearts as from your hands, you would be happy people.
          Let none think themselves unconcerned here as if this were not their
          temptation. I know there are some ready to say, with a whole heart,
          they care not for the world and need not the exhortation to part with
          it. I have no hope of prevailing with these people while of that mind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. I believe all in the world who are exercised unto godliness, will
          allow you to stand alone, and tell you to reign as kings without them.
          For in themselves they feel a body of death that cares so much for the
          world, that they have much to do to keep it down, and that they find
          no easy work with their various worldly lusts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Let me ask you, how got you that heart of yours loosed from the
          world? I am sure it would abide a pull of the hand of Omnipotence
          before it was done: have you felt this? "For whatever is born of God,
          overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world,
          even our faith. Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes
          that Jesus is the Son of God?" But alas the victory of many over the
          world, comes to them in a morning dream, and is itself but a dream.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. How do you get free of the world's grasp? If this costs you hard
          struggling, you will not think you care not for it. If it costs you
          none, I will tell you the mystery of your great ease that way. "The
          strong man armed, still keeps the house with you."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. What means the bleating of the sheep; and your other symptoms of
          love to the world. There is a blind generation that cannot see their
          own defilement, unless they be completely sunk in gross actions. They
          do not, they cannot view the secret outgoings of the heart after
          idols. What means the Buts in your desires of the world—but as much as
          to keep your credit—but as much as will procure an honest
          through-bearing and the like. Whether does your heart slip most easily
          away to the thoughts of God, or the world; and which of them is it
          easiest to keep at? Nay, does not the world many times jostle out your
          duty to God, or at least indispose you for it? Whether looks religion
          or the world likest your by-hand work. Nay, nay, lay your hands on
          your mouths, and cry unclean, unclean. To you is this word of
          salvation sent, that you may make the blessed exchange. Sell all to
          the Lord, and you shall be happy forever. God is asking of you
          whatever you have, that you will just now part with it to him in
          affection, this moment take your heart from the creature to himself,
          and quit it freely in affection when he calls for it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          More particularly, that you will thus quit to him whatever you have in
          hand of the world, be it little or much, your goods and effects,
          relations, pleasures, comforts, and life itself. Lay all at his feet.
          Also, whatever you have in heart, the lust of the eyes, the lusts of
          the flesh, etc. Call in your desires now that are pursuing the world,
          and give them to Christ.—Leave the heart pursuit of created things.
          And you shall have treasure in Heaven. We are allowed to offer you
          this in his name. We are ambassadors for Christ, and have warrant to
          transact this bargain with you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
          If you will honestly consent to it, and this moment give up with all,
          we declare the treasure in Heaven shall be yours. And to make this
          offer take with you, I shall now proceed to lead your attention,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the first place, To the nature of this treasure.—And then shall
          unfold to your view, its special and excellent properties. Let us
          then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Consider the nature of this treasure in Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is a treasure in respect of variety and plenty. It is not one
          thing but many, that makes up a treasure. You are desired to part with
          many things, but God offers you more instead of them. What a poor
          scanty thing is this world. All that is in it is soon told. We have
          the inventory of it drawn to our hand, and it consists but of three
          things. "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the
          lust of the eyes, and the pride of life." But this treasure consists
          of all things. "He who overcomes, shall inherit all things." Neither
          heart nor eye can ever reach the bottom of it.—"Eye has not seen, nor
          ear heard, neither has it entered the heart of man, to conceive the
          things which God has laid up for them that love him." The apostle's
          arithmetic fails him to count this treasure, I will only tell you of
          four things which you will get in it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The whole collection of the graces of the Spirit, each of them more
          precious than gold. These make a person all glorious within and
          without also; whereas the world's treasure goes but the half of the
          way, yes the least of the worst half too. "The king's daughter is all
          glorious within; her clothing is of wrought gold." If ever your eyes
          be opened you would give ten thousand worlds for the least of these
          graces, however little valued now. Now whenever the soul goes to
          Christ from the world, Christ just stamps his image on that soul. When
          they believe they are sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The whole glorious collection of the privileges of the saints,
          peace, pardon, a right to Heaven purchased by the blood of Christ. All
          is in the treasure. God will heap privileges upon you. "He who spared
          not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not
          with him also freely give us all things." Will you leave this cottage
          of the world, forget your father's house, and you shall be brought
          into the family above, and have a right to all the privileges of the
          members of the family.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The eternal weight of glory above. Even the far more exceeding and
          eternal weight of glory. Put the world in a balance with it. O how
          little is it. All the angels in Heaven through eternity shall never be
          able to count the weight of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, The whole Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. "Behold the
          tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they
          shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their
          God. The Father shall be your Father, Christ yours, the Spirit yours.
          O the infinite fullness of God, which no creature is able to
          comprehend, in whom the soul shall find a treasure casting up
          something new through all eternity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a treasure in respect of preciousness. We do not make
          treasures but of things of worth. O! are not the graces of the Spirit,
          the privileges of the saints, the weight of glory and the enjoyment of
          God precious indeed. What is the world but a heap of loss and dung,
          according to Paul's account of it. Solomon reckous up all that is in
          the world, and sets down the title in two great ciphers, Ecclesiastes
          1:2. Vanity in themselves. Vexation in the getting, keeping, using and
          losing of them. And is this the price of your labor, sweat and cares?
          Are we so mad on loss; so unsatisfied and restless in pursuit of dung;
          so eager on vanity and so fond of vexation. O bewitched mortals, once
          look above, behold, a treasure well worth your pains, a treasure of
          precious things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is no refuse in this treasure, all in it is precious. The
          pleasures there are perfectly pure, free of all dregs, the riches
          there are durable; the glory there eternal, the very streets of the
          city are paved with pure gold. O then "lay up for yourselves treasures
          in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves
          do not break through nor steal."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This treasure was purchased with the precious blood of precious
          Christ, 1 Peter 1:19. Silver and gold could never have bought it. O
          how precious must that be, that cost the blood of the Son of God, not
          a few drops, but a treasure of blood. He was wise, and would not pay
          more for it than was needful. He was just, and a Father, and would not
          put his son to needless expense, especially of blood.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This treasure is enrapt up in precious promises. In the holy
          scriptures are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises.
          What is it that makes them precious, but the precious treasures that
          are in them, Matthew 13:44, 46. O if you had the eye of faith to see
          into the promises, you would see them big with glory, you would see
          their happiness in words and syllables, eternity couched in a
          sentence, an eternal weight of glory enrapt in a word.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is a treasure in respect of closeness. Treasures are not laid
          open to every one's view. This treasure is a hidden treasure, Matthew
          24:44. It is bid to the most of the world, they never hear of it. It
          is hidden to the unrenewed man, he cannot see it, no not when even the
          light of the gospel shines to make it visible. It is in a great
          measure hidden to believers. For it does not yet appear what we shall
          be. And even in glory they will not see to the very end of it. But for
          the world its treasures are common to the worst, who often have the
          largest share of them. And no doubt you have a hundred times seen
          completely through them, that there is no satisfaction to be had in
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now this treasure is the Lord's offer to you, will you accept of it or
          not? Have you any heart for it? Say Amen to the bargain then, and go
          your ways home, and make a solemn resignation of all you have in heart
          or hand to the Lord, and take this for all, and it is yours. I am now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To unfold to your view the special and excellent properties of
          this treasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is a real treasure. Other treasures have but the name, not the
          thing of a treasure. Consider the treasure in Heaven consists of the
          most certain realities. It is a substantial treasure. Earthly
          treasures are not so. Will you set your eyes upon that which is not.
          But the heavenly treasure is filled with substance. Hebrew. "That I
          may cause those which love me to inherit substance; and I will fill
          their treasures." The expression is massy. Earthly treasures are not
          what they seem to be to their possessors. They are but gilded vanities
          that deceive the eyes. They make men but full and rich in a dream; "as
          when a hungry man dreams, and behold he ea-teth, but he awakes, and
          his soul is empty." The reputation which they have in the world they
          owe to men's imagination, not to themselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the treasures of Heaven are not only what they seem, but more than
          they appear to the possessors of them. They are so as spoken of in the
          gospel, 1 Corinthians 2:9. Heaven will be a far greater surprise to
          the saints, than Solomon's glory was to the queen of Sheba. They are
          so as they appear in the glass of ordinances. The saints would not
          exchange for ten thousand worlds what they thus behold, how much more
          when face to face, Psalm 4:6, 7. They seem great, but are greater.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, Earthly treasures are not in respect of stability. We may say
          of the treasures as of the man of the world. After all his show "yet
          he passes away, and, lo, he was not; yes, I sought him, but he could
          not be found." They are bound to the possessors.—They are but
          sojourners with, not married to them, can leave them at any time. We
          may as easily lay up a treasure of water in a sieve, or treasure up
          moments of time which are not, before they be numbered, as a real
          treasure of the world. For the world passes away and the lusts
          thereof, Haggai 1:6. But the treasures in Heaven are fixed and stable,
          through eternity; we may say they are. Eternal wrath is, and will be
          always, the wrath to come. So likewise are the treasures in Heaven.
          This treasure is, that is, it is married to the man that once takes it
          by the hand. They will always be led to them. "The Lamb which is in
          the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto
          living fountains of water: and God shall wipe away all tears from
          their eyes."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Earthly treasures are not comparitively. They have no reality in
          comparison of treasure in Heaven. I am is the name of the treasure in
          Heaven, exclusive of all other, Exodus 3:14. All the treasures on
          earth have more of privation, than either matter or form. There is
          infinitely more of nothingness, and not-being than being in them. What
          they are may soon be told, but what they are not can never, until we
          search out the Almighty to perfection. Heap together all the gold of
          the universe, the most exquisite pleasures, highest honors,
          comfortable relations, and all that ever were, or shall be in the
          world; add to these all the angels in Heaven, united to you as one
          flesh, the little substance that is in all would be overwhelmed with a
          heap of wants, as a filing of gold under a mountain. Such are the
          treasures of Heaven, that all else dwindles into nothing besides them,
          as a candle before the sun in his meridian splendor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The treasure in Heaven, is a treasure of things truly precious and
          excellent. Earthly treasures are not so. The men of the world
          acknowledge this, that a treasure is only of precious substantial
          things. We shall find, say they, all precious substance. But they miss
          their mark; the godly only obtain it. What is the world and all that
          is in it, but loss and dung, vanity and vexation. It is but a scheme
          or draught of a thing.—Greek, 1 Corinthians 7:31. and that a passing
          scheme. Heaven only is the house in which we can dwell. The Spirit of
          God calls all Agrippa and Bernice's pomp but a fancy, Greek, Acts
          25:23. And is a heap of loss, emptiness, and fancies, the treasure
          with which you are so much bewitched. The best name they get is good
          things; but mark, they are only the wicked's good things, Luke 16:25.
          Well may they call them their goods, for there is nothing good in
          them, about them, or waiting on them, but these things. Your good
          things, said Abraham to the rich man, I indeed got good things, but
          not my good things, they were my comforts, not my treasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the treasure in Heaven is a treasure of precious things indeed.
          Jesus says, "I will cause those that love me to inherit substance, and
          I will fill their treasures." It is a weight of glory. This world's
          glory is as light as a feather, soon blown away; but this is massy and
          weighty. If you seek for riches in it, there are durable riches and
          righteousness. For pleasures, then at God's right hand are pleasures
          forever more. If you seek for gold, you will find it among your feet,
          were you at it; "For the street of the city is pure gold, as it were
          transparent glass." One jewel in that treasure is of more worth than
          all of the world, that ever hands could gather together; that ever
          hearts did, nay, or can conceive. "For wisdom is better than rubies,
          and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared with it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is a treasure for the soul. Other treasures are but for the
          body, the worst part of the man. Treasuring them up is but laying clay
          to clay. But treasure in Heaven is suitable to the nature of the soul.
          The soul is a spirit, and this treasure is spiritual containing "all
          spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ."—The soul cannot
          feed on the things of the world, more than the body can do on ashes.
          He was a fool that thought his soul could take ease in the treasure,
          laid up in his barns, Luke 12:19. Debase not the high born soul, to
          match with things of the world. It is an unsuitable match in which
          there will be no comfort.—The soul is immortal, and the treasure in
          Heaven is durable. "Riches and honor are with me, says Jesus; yes,
          durable riches and righteousness." The world will not go a step with
          you beyond this present life, but the treasure in Heaven will last
          forever; as long as the soul lasts it will not waste; for it is an
          eternal weight of glory. The soul may go to it and take out of it
          eternally, it will never grow less.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, This treasure is suited not only to the nature, but also to the
          necessities of the soul, as meat is to the hungry, drink to the
          thirsty, and rest to the weary.—The soul has many dismal wants, which
          all the world cannot supply, but the treasure in Heaven can. If your
          bodies be naked, you can procure cloth to cover them, but you cannot
          purchase a righteousness to cover the naked soul. But here is white
          clothing to clothe it. The fruits of the earth can feed your bodies,
          but your starving souls cannot be supported that way. But here is
          heavenly food for them. My flesh, says Jesus, is meat indeed, and my
          blood is drink indeed. Do you want a price for your redemption. Riches
          profit not in the day of death, and the fruit of the body cannot atone
          for the sin of the soul. But here is laid up the precious blood of
          Christ. Do you want a pardon? Here is a treasure of mercy. For your
          comfort, here are full breasts of consolation. Yes, here is complete
          happiness, and here are all things suited to the soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a satisfying treasure. I have all, says the apostle, and abound.
          All this world cannot satisfy a soul. The world can never fill the
          heart, but God can. You may as soon grasp your arms full of dreams,
          and hug your own shadow, as draw satisfaction out of the dry breasts
          of the world. Esau said to Jacob, I have enough, and Jacob said to
          him, Because God has dealt graciously with me, I have enough. O! what
          a vast difference between these two <i>enoughs</i>. Nay, the whole
          world is a bed shorter than the soul can stretch itself upon. Had we
          Absalom's beauty, Samson's strength, Solomon's riches and wisdom, nay
          Adam's paradise with the forbidden tree, which still told him his
          happiness was not there, they would still leave our souls dissatisfied
          and longing for more, as pinched with want. But,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The treasures in Heaven are satisfying in themselves. Even the
          treasures of grace here are so, where the light of assurance shines to
          let a man see how rich he is.—He values what he has in hand and in
          hope more than ten thousand worlds. A good man shall be satisfied from
          himself. From himself as united to God, in opposition to the heart
          that backslides from God. They have a Heaven within themselves. "For
          they know in themselves, that they have in Heaven a better and an
          enduring substance."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The treasures of glory are infinitely satisfactory. I shall be
          satisfied, says David, when I awake with your likeness. The soul shall
          be made happy with the same happiness with which God himself is happy,
          which is the enjoyment of himself. Glorious with the same glory with
          which he is glorious. Satisfied from the same fountain from which he
          himself is satisfied, 2 Thessalonians 2:14. compared with Revelation
          3:21.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As these treasures are satisfying in themselves, so they make worldly
          comforts satisfying. He who has most of Heaven, enjoys most of the
          earth, though others may possess more than he. "A little that a
          righteous man has, is better than the riches of many wicked." These
          treasures make the saint's dish of green herbs go farther than the
          stalled ox of others, and put more pleasure in their cup. This
          treasure produces in the saints mean thoughts of the things of the
          world, Philippians 3:8. It is because men have such high thoughts of
          these things, that they cannot get enough of them. But people soon get
          enough of what they do not care much for. Nature is content with
          little, grace with less, but lusts, like the grave, never have enough.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They stamp a value upon the little which the saints have of worldly
          things, these are additions to the treasure. "All these things, says
          Jesus, shall be added unto you; for our heavenly Father knows that we
          have need of these things." That may be thankfully taken for an
          addition, which for the main could never satisfy. Hence the reason of
          the difference between the godly and the wicked in these things. This
          treasure makes up all the wants, and the man has always what he needs
          that has it. Who are they in the world that have most to spare, not
          the rich man that abounds with worldly goods, for he never has more
          than he needs, nay, never so much. But the godly man, take from him
          all you can, he has always enough behind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5th and last place. The treasures are safe and sure, men may promise
          on the head of them forever. They are safe and sure in themselves.
          Though none should offer violence to them, they will rust and corrupt
          of themselves. There is nothing on the earth but what has a principle
          of corruption in itself, and carries the seeds of death about it in
          its bosom. The aged world tends to a dissolution. Men are now of lower
          stature, less bones and strength than their forefathers, and of
          shorter lives. So is the strength of nature's womb decayed, that it
          seems she is waxing old, and weary of conceiving, Psalm 102:25, 26. So
          that treasures on earth are like summer fruit, that have a luscious
          sweetness, but they will not keep.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the treasures in Heaven are sure in themselves. Though gold will,
          grace will not rust. Though all the beauty in the world fades, as the
          leaves in harvest, yet the fields of glory are ever green. It is "an
          inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fades not away. It is a
          crown of glory, that fades not away." Though this world wax old, the
          treasures in Heaven do not, Luke 12:33. There is no principle of
          corruption in them. These riches never fail, they are durable; the
          weight of glory never grows less, it is eternal.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These treasures are not only safe and sure in themselves, but are so
          also to the owners. Though this world were so in itself, yet it is not
          so to us. Its riches are uncertain. But of heavenly treasures we can
          never be deprived. All earthly treasures may be taken from us. We may
          live and see ourselves stripped naked of all we have. A Cynic called
          riches the vomit of fortune; and if so, like the dog she often returns
          and takes it again. Job saw himself both rich and poor to a proverb in
          his day. They are liable to an insensible consumption, as by a moth,
          Matthew 6:19. Proverbs 23:5. When men suffer their hearts to fly out
          at their eyes, like a ravenous bird upon them, they oft make
          themselves wings and fly away.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the heavenly treasures cannot be taken from us, Luke 10:42. God
          does but lend us the world, but makes an irrevocable gift of the
          treasure in Heaven, Romans 11:29. The devil took away by permission
          Job's worldly comforts and left him nothing, Job 2:7, 8. but he could
          not touch his treasure of grace, verse 9th.—Nor would he himself give
          it away, Job 27:5. Nor his treasure of glory, chapter 19:27–35. The
          waters of affliction may wash off the dust, but your land is still
          safe.

          We ourselves will be taken from the treasures on earth. Death will
          part them and us. All we have here, can only do as servants in an inn,
          who, while we are there, wait on us, but go not away with us, but
          remain to serve those that come after us. We must leave what we have,
          and always the more there is of it, the parting is the more heavy. A
          man may live more conveniently, but cannot die so easily in a palace
          as in a cottage. And when we leave them, we know not assuredly to whom
          they are to be left, whether to a wise man or a fool.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But though death takes the carnal man from, it carries the saint to,
          his treasure. The man whose treasure is in Heaven, is his own heir.
          Remarkable is that word, Matthew 6:10. Lay up for yourselves. You may
          lay up on earth, but none can answer that question. Who shall reap the
          fruit of your sweet care and toil? God made the Assyrian heir to the
          Philistines, Micah 1:15. But it is sure that the treasure in Heaven is
          laid up for ourselves. He who does the will of God abides forever,
          with his treasure, even as in the world both the lusts and the lusters
          perish, Revelation 14:13.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus you see what a treasure it is which God offers you, if you will
          quit the world. Give over seeking your treasure on earth, and you will
          get treasure in Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Objection. I am in no hazard of a treasure on earth. Answer. You are
          mistaken. You may have enough in heart though not in hand. The Spirit
          of God counts upon the former, and you must give up with it as well as
          the latter. What the heart dwells on, that is its possessions, and
          that you must part with.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And now are you for this blessed bargain or not? Has the beauty of
          this treasure touched your hearts. If so, I have but two words of
          advice to you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Make it your own by selling all, and buying the field where it is,
          Matthew 13:44. That is renouncing the world, and closing the gospel
          bargain with Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Dig for it, Proverbs 2:4, 5. You were at pains and labor on the
          world's treasure. Will you not be at due pains about it. Man is a busy
          creature, he is always doing something. We call you not to more labor,
          but to other labors. The watch goes as fast when it goes wrong, as
          when right.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If you have no such heart as to part with the world for it, I declare
          to you, you shall have no part nor lot in it. This was our third
          doctrine. You shall as soon grasp Heaven and earth at once, as get
          both. It is dear bought earth that is bought at the rate of the loss
          of Heaven: thus death and life are set before you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And now if there be any asking, how they may get their heart above the
          world, the answer from the doctrine is plain. Set the treasure in
          Heaven in your view. This is the best way to sink the value of the
          world in your hearts.

          YOU have heard what all that have a mind for Heaven must throw away,
          namely, the world; what they shall get at the end to take up in its
          stead, the treasure in Heaven. But in the mean time they must take up
          the cross. By this is meant all the troubles and afflictions with
          which the Lord is pleased to exercise his people in the world, so
          called in reference to the cross on which Christ suffered.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine.—All that have a mind for Heaven, as they must lay down the
          world, so they must take up the cross.—Here I shall,
        </p>

          I. Show why the Christian's troubles are called the cross.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. What it is to take up the cross. Let us then,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Show why the Christian's troubles are called the cross. The
          wicked's troubles are not a cross, but a curse; those of the godly are
          not curses, but crosses. This is a name of honor, a sweet cake in
          which the bitter pill should be pleasantly received. As the man
          himself, so his troubles get a new name, when he comes to Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because by them the Christian's state in the world, is made like
          Christ's while he was in it. "If so be that we suffer with him, that
          we may be also glorified together." He met with the cross, and so must
          they, that they may be like him. If the head wore a cross, it were
          unfitting the members to go without one. He was a man of sorrows, they
          must not be men of joys. Can the world that was a step-dame to him, be
          a natural mother to his?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because the Christian's troubles go to the quick, as the cross did
          with Christ, in respect of which his former miseries were blunt. When
          God has a mind to let blood of the heart vein of a Christian by the
          lance of affliction, to cure him, he will make a deep wound. The
          troubles of the wicked often, but lightly, touch their sores, but when
          God rips his own people, he will go to the quick. God's killing arrows
          go deep enough into the heart of the wicked, but wounds for their
          cure, never. They want not their troubles. But says the Psalmist,
          "they are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like
          other men."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because of the relation which they have to the cross of Christ.
          They are the cross set up again to Christ. In all their afflictions he
          was afflicted. They come very near him. He who touches you, says he,
          touches the apple of his eye. The enemies set up the cross again for
          him in his members, after they had buried it with him, Acts 9:4. His
          members are on it now; "and fill up that which is behind of the
          afflictions of Christ; in their flesh for his body's sake, which is
          the church." This agrees to all their afflictions. O! is not the cross
          lovely, while he is on it with us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Their troubles are Christ's cross to them as he has left it. Christ in
          person took up the cross, and when he took it up there was a curse in
          it. He took away the curse out of it, and then left it, and bids them
          take it up without it, for he has extracted the venom out of it. Now
          the tree is left, but the curse on it is gone. The nails are left to
          his people, but the venom in which they were dipped is gone. Though
          bulls should compass you about, they now want the horns, wherewithal
          they pierced him. Though poverty, shame, and crosses of all sorts are
          laid before you, if you be Christ's, you have but the carcass of these
          things wanting the soul and life, which the threatening of the law
          breathed into them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, Their afflictions grow out of the cross of Christ. That tree
          was watered with the blood of the Son of God, no wonder then that it
          be fruitful. All the fruits laid up for Christ's beloved, for time and
          eternity grow upon it. But perhaps you will not expect the Christian's
          bitter troubles among them, but mistake not. They must either be
          curses or blessings. If curses they are not crosses, Galatians 3:13.
          If blessings, where else will you find them. "For we are blessed with
          all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ." They are the
          privileges of adoption, Hebrews 12:7, 8. Benefits of the covenant,
          Psalm 89:31, 32.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The comforts of Christ's sheep, Psalm 23:4. Blessings which they
          thankfully acknowledge, Psalm 119:71. "therefore purchased by the
          blood of Christ, and promised to him in the covenant he made with the
          Father," Psalm 89:30. compare verse 19–29. O how might we kiss our
          cross, looking thus on it. Farther to clear this, that we may learn
          not to be angry at our blessings. Consider, that grace grows on the
          cross of Christ as the root doubtless, but our cross is the branch on
          which it grows. "It is good for me, says David, that I have been
          afflicted; that I might learn your statutes." See also Psalm 94:12,
          13. Isaiah 27:9. See what a cluster hangs on the cross, Romans 5:3–5.
          Not a stone thrown at a child of God, but it is to him a precious
          stone. Every wind, however adverse it blows, speeds him to his harbor.
          Our cross also is the branch on which glory grows. "If we suffer we
          shall also reign with Christ. Our light afflictions which are but for
          a moment, work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
          glory."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because the Christian's cross is a cross indeed. But to whom? Not
          to his graces. Indeed troubles may be a cross to the hypocrite's
          seeming graces, on which they may breathe out their last, Matthew
          13:6. His heap of chaff may bulk well until the wind rise, and his
          house on the sand may stand until the storms blow. Job's friends
          preached sound doctrine, though they erred in the application, chapter
          4:4–6. Many a one's faith, patience, love, etc. are like Job's
          friends. In trouble they deal deceitfully as a brook. They are
          nothing, chapter 6:15–21.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But not one of the real graces ever yet died upon a cross. Nay, it is
          as cold water cast on the face of a fainting person, it is a comfort
          that revives them, not a cross to kill them. "Before I was afflicted,
          I went astray; but now have I kept your word." The candle burns
          brightest in the dark, and the fire hottest in a frost. Many a wound
          ease and prosperity have given to real grace, for the cure of which
          the cross has been sent to them. But,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a cross to their corrupt will, that never goes right as long as
          it gets head. "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with
          the affections and lusts." The flesh would soon wax wanton if it were
          not nailed to the cross. The bullock unaccustomed to the yoke of
          resignation must be tamed by the cross. And many a cross that
          unreasonable beast will take before it be broken. The more that things
          go according to our will, it is the more fed, and the readier to kick
          against the Lord; but God in his providence crossing it, it is
          weakened, and made more pliable to the will of God. The soul becomes
          as a weaned child. It yields and returns to the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The cross is also a cross to the Christian's particular lusts, Hosea
          2:6, 7. It will cross our hopes, and so check our pride, or draw away
          some earth from us that was drawing us away from God. When a lust is
          drawing away a Christian from God, he will send the cross as he did
          Abigail to meet David; the storm to meet Jonah when fleeing from the
          presence of the Lord. If we were not too much one with our lusts, our
          crosses would sit lighter upon us, seeing they cross nothing but our
          corruptions. We now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show what it is to take up the cross. It imports,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That we are to wait for our cross until God lay it down before us.
          We are not to make up, but take up our cross that is made to our hand.
          Hence it is called the cross of Christ, and in respect of the bearer
          his cross, Matthew 16:24, not that which he made to himself, but that
          which God made his. A man makes his cross when he goes out of his way
          to seek a cross. It should be brought to us, and laid down at our
          door. We are not called to go to it. If a man be diligent in his
          business, and yet poverty come on him, let him cheerfully take up what
          God has laid down to him; but if he be negligent, and thereby become
          poor, his cross is his sin, he can have little comfort in it, it is of
          his own making. Some say, we will not leave our kirks, stipends, and
          warm firesides, I pray we may be helped to take up that cross when God
          lays it down before us, and when it comes, to be able to answer that
          question satisfyingly, "Who has required these things at your hand?" A
          cross of men's own making, may well feed their pride, it is not a fit
          mean for nourishing their graces, Colos. 2:18–21.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, A man makes his cross, when the cross has no existence but in
          his own foolish imagination. How often are people's minds made the
          devil's shop for making crosses to themselves, racking themselves with
          groundless suspicions and imaginations, and making mountains of
          mole-hills. Satan thus makes a forge of their mischievous tempers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. God will lay down the cross before every one that has a mind for
          Heaven. In the world you shall have tribulation, so that they shall
          have nothing to do but take it up.—He will lay it down before every
          one, to some of one sort, to others of another, Matthew 16:24. God had
          one Son without sin, but never a son without the cross. For what son
          is he whom the Father chastens not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question, But when does the Lord lay down the cross before us? Answer,
          When there is no lawful way to escape it, that is, when we must either
          suffer or sin, Hebrews 10:35. When the devil desired our Savior to
          cast himself down from a pinnacle of the temple, this was a cross of
          the devil's own making, because the stairs were at hand, and he had no
          lawful call to work a miracle. When God has left no way to escape, the
          cross is bound on by the holy hand of providence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We must notice the cross which the Lord lays down, otherwise we
          cannot take it up. It is a dreadful sign of a very desperate case when
          men say, "They have stricken me, and I was not sick; they have beaten
          me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again."
          This is gross stupidity. Many are like a blind man, that receives
          blows, but never sees the hand from whence they come. God is braying
          them with want, poverty, losses, and crosses of many sorts, yet they
          never have power to look to the Lord's hand in these things, or once
          to smite on their thigh, and say, What have I done; show why you
          contend with me, Jeremiah 5:3. They have many plagues of darkness upon
          earth, but never once inquire into the cause.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. We must not tread on the cross, and step over it, but take it up;
          we are ready to have courage against God, though but little for him.
          That sullen manliness, and Roman courage with which some bear their
          crosses, is rather a despite against God, than a taking up of the
          cross. When Heaven is our party, it is time to stoop, and not make our
          faces like flint, lest God be provoked to dash us in pieces.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. We must not fall a fainting at the sight of it. The exhortation is,
          "My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord; nor faint when
          you are rebuked of him." In this state we cannot take up the cross. O
          how ready are we to faint at the sight of the cross, and to say, my
          strength and my hope is perished from the Lord. To be sinking under
          discouragement by the cross is not the way to bear it; nay, it is next
          step to going out of God's way to avoid the cross, Hebrews 12:12, 13.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. We must not go about the cross when it lies from side to side in
          our way. Some people will shift the cross by going off that part of
          the way where it lies, in hopes to come into it again when they are
          past that place. But take heed, it is easy going off, but it is not so
          easy coming on the way of duty again. There are pits on every hand,
          quagmires of sin and sorrows also, in which you may stick so fast as
          never to get out again, 1 Timothy 6:9.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. We must not stand still until it be rolled out of the way. To
          follow Christ in the summer of prosperity, and in the winter of
          adversity to forsake his company, until the weather clear again is a
          sign self-love is stronger than our love to Christ. Such persons are
          time-servers, and not servants to Christ. "The righteous shall hold on
          his way, and he who has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger."
          Though a Red sea be before us, we must go forward, Exodus 14:15, 16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. We should take up no more than what God has laid down, not what the
          devil and our own corruptions add to it. God laid down barrenness to
          Rachel, and she laid death on her cross, Genesis 30:1. How often do we
          hang weights of our own on the cross, and then complain we cannot lift
          it. We are for the most part in the dark about crosses, and then
          mole-hills appear mountains. But when the Lord clears the soul to let
          it see the naked cross, it appears much less. Paul's troubles were
          none of the least, but he sees them to be light and momentary.
          Lightness itself is swift as a deer, 2 Corinthians 4:17.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. We are to make no choice but take up even the hardest trials which
          God lays before us; as the cross was a most painful death. We must be
          ready not only to run with footmen, but contend with horses. "I am
          ready, said Paul, not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem
          for the name of the Lord Jesus." Neither a choice of commands, nor
          crosses becomes a Christian. The shoulder must not refuse the hardest
          piece of service. We are apt to think that we could bear any trial but
          the one that God has laid upon us, but this only discovers our own
          ignorance, and imperfect resignation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10. We must take up the cross willingly. God can lay it on whether we
          will or not; but he will have us to take it up willingly, though not
          willfully. "My brethren, says the apostle James, count it all joy,
          when you fall into divers temptations." When you fall by the
          providence of God, not when you cast yourselves into them. We must not
          be like the refractory bullock, that will not receive the yoke; but as
          the camel that falls down on his knees, until his master lay on his
          burden. So Eli, 1 Samuel 3:18. Acts 9:6. Lament. 3:30.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, We bear it cheerfully. We are not to take it up, to fall down
          with it, and sink under it. Believers took joyfully the spoiling of
          their goods. There are riches in the cross, and the believer will
          discern them. They will have respect unto the recompense of
          reward.—Goodness is in it, and he will see it, Isaiah 39:8. It is no
          strange thing to the Christian, 1 Peter 4:12, 13. There is strange
          satisfaction and sweetness in the cross to them that find them out.
          There is a sweetness in a man's seeing himself on his trials for
          Heaven, standing candidate for glory; in passing these mountains where
          they see the marks of Christ's footsteps before them; in seeing how a
          good God crosses their corrupt inclinations, and prevents their folly;
          in seeing the thieves on the cross, and God starving their lusts so as
          they may not be ungovernable; and to see that paradise that is within
          this hedge of thorns.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In this way it must be borne until the Lord take it down. It is his
          work to take off the cross, ours to take it up. Let patience have her
          perfect work. It is sad to see persons when brought into afflictions,
          to be driven out of themselves, to be running away in a rage, with
          God's arrows sticking fast in them. In your patience possess your
          souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Inference 1. Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial. Nothing
          more unreasonable, and yet more common than to be surprised with a
          cross. We often look at the meeting with it, as if we had forgotten
          that article of our indentures. If public trials come upon the land or
          church, be not surprised, or when private crosses do befall you. It
          has been, must, and will be the lot of all that have a mind for
          Heaven. There is a cup of bitterness designed for Christ mystical, of
          which every one of his must drink their share.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They that cast out with the cross, do in effect cast out with
          Heaven. Though it be a rough way, it is the highway to it. It is the
          fire with which God tries what metal is fit to be made a vessel of
          honor, and it is a most dreadful token to be cast here as dross,
          Jeremiah 6:29, 30. Think on that you that are not made better, but
          rather worse under your afflictions. If you could think in every
          cross, now God has me on my trials for eternity, you would take heed
          that you forced not out a sentence against yourselves, Philippians
          3:18, 19.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lay your account with it, and be looking for it. A man forewarned
          is half armed. Job stood like an adamant wall against the bitter
          blasts. Why? "For, said he, the thing which I greatly feared is come
          upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. Why should we
          think to sleep to Heaven in a bed of roses, when others have gone
          before us through thorns and briars? If you have given yourself to
          Christ, you must show your faith by your works. If there be life in a
          tree, it will abide a winter blast.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Take kindly with the cross of Christ. It is a kindly name to
          the Christian, and all his afflictions public or private bear it. Let
          your back bow to it, and your heart not rise against it. Be not angry
          if you be marked among his sheep, with the fire-mark of a fiery trial.
          It may well consume dross, it will not consume gold. Do not murmur
          against the Lord, he knows well enough how to guide the world, and
          what is best for every one. Say not, "There is no sorrow like my
          sorrow. Every heart knows its own bitterness." But ordinarily the
          slaughter ox has been best fed; and they for whom the Lord had the
          greatest kindness have drunk deepest of the bitter cup. You may
          observe that those have been laid lowest, who have been most eminent
          for piety, for gifts, for manifestations of the Lord's kindness, and
          great benefits; witness Job, Heman, Paul, Jacob, David.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I come now to the last duty, Follow me, taking up the cross, as the
          words run in the Greek, or having taken up the cross.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine.—All that have a mind for Heaven, must follow Christ, with
          that cross which he lays before them. They must be like Simon the
          Cyrenian, who did bear the cross after Jesus. I will show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. In what respects they must follow Christ. In these two.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. They must follow him in profession. So he would have this man to
          follow him, to profess himself one of his disciples, and go with him
          as the rest of his disciples did. A profession is indispensably
          necessary.—Jesus will not allow any of his to say, What, take you me
          for a saint? Those that are his, "have his Father's name written in
          their foreheads, and these are they, even the hundred forty and four
          thousand, which follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They confess with
          the mouth the Lord Jesus, as well as believe with the heart, that God
          has raised him from the dead. For with the heart, man believed unto
          righteousness; and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation."
          If there be fire on the hearth, smoke will come out at the chimney. He
          is the high priest of our profession; and that profession is to be
          made with the mouth, even when the cross is on the back. This
          profession we must hold fast. This Jesus Christ himself did when
          before Pontius Pilate, he witnessed a good confession.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now there are two things which fall under the Christian profession.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Holiness of life. It is a holy profession, and a profession of
          holiness. Hence Christians are called, holy brethren, partakers of the
          heavenly calling. The light of their good works must not only burn but
          shine. "They must be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without
          rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation; among whom they
          are to shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of
          life."—They are to hold it forth as towers on the coast side on which
          lights are erected to direct sailors in the night. No lover of
          holiness but will profess himself such.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The truths of Christ. Errors and heresies fall under the black
          mark, and are arranged by the apostle along with the other works of
          the flesh, Galatians 5:19–21. It is an awful judgment, when God sends
          men, strong delusion, that they should believe a lie. God is the God
          of truth. Lies of all sorts are from the devil. We must adhere to the
          known truths of God, and his ordinances in their purity on all
          hazards. "Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom and instruction,
          and understanding." We must testify against all corruptions of word
          and ordinances; and when error, superstition, or idolatry threaten us,
          we must be ready to take up our cross and follow Christ. Some complain
          the ordinances are already corrupted among us, not knowing whereof
          they affirm. That there are corruptions in our management of all God's
          ordinances, we acknowledge, and so must they for themselves; and if we
          both acknowledge not this, neither will they nor we see Heaven. If
          they would follow their principle the length it would lead them, they
          should have no communion among themselves; nay, nor one of them with
          himself, unless they think that they are in greater hazard from the
          corruptions of others, than from their own. Where our additions to
          Christ's institutions, or what are those institutions of this church
          with which she has mixed his institutions. Take heed this absurd
          mistake be not cured by ordinances corrupted indeed. Our contempt of
          Christ's ordinances is the highway to it, Deuteronomy 28:64. Isaiah
          8:6, 7. But come what will, "let us earnestly contend for the faith
          once delivered unto the saints. For whoever, says Jesus, shall be
          ashamed of me and my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation,
          of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in the
          glory of his Father with the holy angels."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must follow Christ in practice. "He who says, he abides in him,
          ought himself also to walk, even as he walked." Christ has presented
          to us the copy of a holy life, we must write after it, if ever we
          would see Heaven. I have given you, says he, an example, that you
          should do as I have done to you. No less example of imitation does the
          Christian propose to himself. "For every man that has this hope in
          him, purifies himself, even as he is pure." His conversation is the
          compass by which we must steer our course, if ever we reach the shore
          of Immanuel's land. I will not launch forth into this extensive field,
          but content myself with directing your attention to four parts of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. We must follow him in his humility. In this he was most exemplary.
          From the highest pitch of glory, he descended as low as he could,
          Philippians 2:7, 8. He washed the disciples' feet. He was the very
          pattern of self-denial, meekness and lowliness. Good reason had he to
          say, "learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart." Alas! how few
          followers. By this you must correct your pride. Pride makes men like
          the devil, and most unlike Christ. He emptied himself of his glory,
          and can you be his followers, that fill and swell yourselves with an
          opinion of yourselves? How low did he stoop, and yet alas! how
          unwilling are many of us to yield?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Your passion. O fiery professors are you the followers of the meek and
          humble Jesus? You cannot abide to be controled, "but he endured the
          contradiction of sinners against himself." The Samaritans would not
          receive him, the disciples "would have had him to cause fire come down
          from Heaven to consume them," but he showed it was not his Spirit that
          moved them to it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Correct also your selfishness. Self-seeking professors look very
          unlike self-denying Jesus. I seek not, said he, mine own glory. It was
          prophesied of him, "He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice
          to be heard in the streets." This was fully accomplished in him, John
          7:3, 4. But alas, the religion of many is nothing but a Babel tower to
          exalt themselves upon, that they may be seen of men. How do they haunt
          for applause, and when that empty wind fills the sail, how quickly
          will they make way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In his contempt of the world. The profits of it were of no account
          with him. He had not where to lay his head. The pleasures of it, he
          despised. He often wept, sighed, never was seen to laugh, very seldom
          to rejoice, and that not from the smiles of the world, which he never
          regarded nor sought.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By this learn to correct the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh,
          and the pride of life. These are the gods which many worship. Their
          eyes are windows at which sinful objects enter into the soul, and at
          which the heart goes out after the world. The flesh often consumes all
          the vigor of the spirits, and men walk as if they were nothing but
          flesh. The vain pride of life, in honor, ambition, and pomp, carry
          away men as a stream.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. In his patience under the cross. His cross was infinitely heavy,
          but he endured all with untainted patience, not the least murmuring
          was ever heard from him. "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet
          he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and
          as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth." He
          would not revenge the injuries done to him, so much as by words. "When
          he was reviled, he reviled not again, when he suffered he threatened
          not." His soul was enrapt up in an absolute resignation to the will of
          God. Not my will, said he, but your be done.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By this learn to correct your murmurings and uneasy bearing of the
          cross. Did he as a sheep not open his mouth, and shall we "with the
          wicked, roar like a wild bull in a net." Look to Jesus and be ashamed,
          that the cross feels so hard upon your shoulders, Hebrews 12:1, 2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Let us follow him in heavenliness of conversation. His whole
          life was an uninterrupted course of walking with God. Often he sent
          away his disciples from him, spending whole nights in secret. His
          discourse was already heavenly. Whatever occurred he was ready to
          spiritualize it. So that on earth he lived in Heaven. By this learn to
          correct your carnality.—We are ready too much, and too frequently to
          mind earthly things. How unlike Christ while heavenly things are so
          little minded; meditation and converse about them are very rare. But
          we must follow him, if ever we see Heaven. He will be imitated as a
          pattern by all those who experience the efficacy of his blood. And
          surely many of us must turn over a new leaf if we fall on this way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But I will shut up this with some improvement. You have now heard much
          of the way you must take, if ever you see Heaven. What are you
          resolved upon? Are you resolved for Heaven or not? I think I may take
          you all up in five classes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. I fear there are some of you, that have never yet thought seriously
          upon the matter, now how can they be resolved? you that are young,
          have you thought upon the question yet? Have you ever been made to
          stand still and seriously inquire what was necessary for your eternal
          welfare? You that are older, when was the time that you gave this
          question a serious consideration? When was it that it kept you longer
          out of your bed than usual; that it disturbed your rest or raised you
          sooner to pursue the subject? Alas for many of our regular hearers
          that kept nothing of what they hear in their hearts, Ezekiel 32:31–33.
          The day is coming "they will lift up their eyes in Hell being in
          torments."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Some have thought on it, but they are not yet come to a conclusion.
          When there is much halting between two opinions in the vitals of
          religion, no wonder it be so in less matters. Heaven is very
          desirable, but sin is sweet. Treasure in Heaven is good, but treasure
          on earth is good also. You know not what to do. Conscience says, go
          forward; corruption says, nay, stand still a while yet. "How long halt
          you between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal,
          then follow him." I believe there are some now in Hell that were once
          as far forward as you. I think you should not take so long to advise
          on whether you will enter or not; for when the door is once shut, in
          vain will you plead for admission, Proverbs 1:24–33.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Perhaps there are some that in effect have resolved against it;
          saying, there is no hope, no: for I have loved strangers, and after
          them will I go. These are sullen desperate sinners, who are black hot
          in the fire of despair without noise. They have had their convictions,
          they have attempted reformation, but it would not do. Corruption has
          broken out on them, as the breaking forth of waters; hence they have
          given over hope, and dropped their endeavors, and stand to be carried
          whatever way the stream of their lusts leads them. O wretched
          generation, there is but one step between you and everlasting
          destruction. Brimstone is scattered upon your habitation, there wants
          but fire to make it consume you, Job 18:15.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Some that are resolved for Heaven if they can obtain it at their
          own offer. Like this man in the text, Heaven would be crowded if
          sinners could get liberty to blot out and interline words in the
          covenant here and there. If people could but retain a right eye, a
          right hand, a Delilah, Zoar a little one. But it will not do. All or
          nothing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. I hope there are some resolved upon it, cost what it will. They are
          peremptory. Well you must sell all, take up your cross, and follow
          Christ. I would have you then to resolve to follow Christ with the
          cross on your back.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Resolve to take up and follow Christ with your ordinary cross. "If
          any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
          cross daily, and follow me." Every day has the evil thereof, whatever
          may be left of former days. Evil to increase the heap, and men may
          bring forward of the following day.—Asaph was plagued all the day
          long, and chastened every morning. You must not expect one day fair to
          an end while here. Whether God lay down this cross by his immediate
          hand, or otherwise, you must take it up. What a vain thing is it to
          expect dry cheeks in the valley of tears; or that in such a place the
          clouds will not return after the rain. Daily sinning brings daily
          crosses. The thieves will never be brought off the cross until their
          life be extinguished.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Your holiday cross. The roll that was spread before Jeremiah, "was
          written within and without, and there was written therein,
          lamentations, and mourning, and woe." It is the same word that is used
          to signify the solemnities in which the Jews were gathered about the
          temple by the appointment of God. It signifies a stated time of
          meeting. Here is a solemnity of another nature, a solemn rendezvous of
          enemies against the church of God, for which God has set his times, it
          is not every day. On this you must resolve also. The church of God
          among us, has had a day of feasting of considerable length; it is like
          we may see a solemn day of terror on the back of it. Many a bitter
          storm has blown out against the church, and it cannot be thought but
          the clouds will return after the rain, Revelation 8:9.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Consider, we have had the Lord's talents among our hands these
          twenty years, and it is reasonable to think God will put it to the
          trial what we have made of them. Can it be but there will come a time
          in which we will be put to trial, what we have made of all the sermons
          and communions that we have enjoyed. Now the cross is God's trying
          piece, Matthew 7:24–27.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There are many who have followed Christ on plain ground very
          closely, that have shined in holiness of life in the time of outward
          peace in the church. They have given as it were but half evidence of
          their love to Christ, and that also the easiest half; they must even
          give fuller evidence of it, by cleaving to him in a time of
          tribulation. It will bring more glory to God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. There are many that have the root of the matter in them, that need
          to have it awaked with a storm.—Many sleeping Jonahs in our ship. Much
          filth and blood gathered by ease to be taken away by the Spirit of
          judgment, James 4:4. When the trees of God's vineyard begin to sit up,
          he will open them at the root, and let in the winter storm.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. There are many professors among us, that have more sail than
          ballast; their heads are too light for their hearts. If there be
          anything in them at all, and God have a kindness for them, he will lay
          some weight upon them to bring them to a consistency, that will make
          weight more, and bulk less in their own eyes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. There are many that have taken up a profession that have nothing of
          Christ but the name. They are among God's wheat, but are none of it;
          others are the worse of them, they must be cut up with God's axe as
          cumberers of the ground; and when there are fewer professors, they
          will likely be better.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. The appetite for the word with many is lost, and it is unfruitful.
          The edge is off our spirits. The preaching of the gospel is not much
          regarded. Many make silent sabbaths to themselves: and so little
          comfort have people in their ministers, and ministers in their people,
          that it looks very like a parting.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Enemies have a cup to fill up, they have filled it well
          already; but it is like they have more yet to do, to prepare them for
          an overthrow. Turn your face then heavenwards, and be resolved to
          cleave to Christ, and all will be well. The cross will never ruin the
          church. The more they were oppressed the more they grew. God makes the
          devil's lackeys run his errands, and what they mean for evil turns to
          good. She shall not lose one living member. Dross may be consumed, but
          gold cannot; but it is refined in the fire. Let the sieve be as large
          as it will, not one good grain shall be lost.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But as for those that will not take up the cross and follow Christ,
          God will lay his curse as another sort of weight upon them. Following
          him under the cross, is the right way of bearing it.

          Mark 10:22 "And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for
          he had great possessions."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          WE have here the lamentable issue of the conference. The man is
          offended, and leaves the Savior, rejecting his words. We have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His departure. He went away, not as Christ bade him to sell all, but
          to sit down on his possessions, to hug his beloved idol, never to come
          back again. Here he left Christ, rejected his company instead of
          following him, left the treasure in Heaven which he would not purchase
          as Christ offered it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He went away sad and grieved. Sad, with a sad, cloudy, dejected
          countenance; grieved at the heart, as the words may be distinguished.
          The first of these words is rendered, lowering, Matthew 16:3. He was
          morally serious in his desire of life; hence real grief in the heart
          for the disappointment, and the appearance of it in his countenance.
          The cause of his sadness was that saying, verse 21. That was the thing
          which affected him. The word rendered sad, signifies a mixture of
          sorrow and hatred. He loved the treasure in Heaven, but he hated the
          cross. He loved Heaven, but he hated the parting with the world as
          Hell, as that word also imports. Hence deep sorrow, on being deprived
          of that which he did so much desire.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now what made him so sad at that saying? What reason had he to be
          displeased at it? He had great possessions. But what of that? So had
          Abraham, Moses, Job, and others; and they were put to the same trial;
          and yet they did cleave steadfastly to the Lord. But alas! this man's
          possessions had a much surer hold of him, than he had of them. This
          way of expressing it teaches, that it is hard for them that have
          possessions to part with them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine I. It is difficult to have much of the world, and not to be
          ruined by it. This is a strange For, in the text. He was a man that
          had great possessions, and God has not many of that sort. "For you see
          your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh,
          not many mighty, not many noble, are called." To confirm this,
          consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That plain testimony given to this truth, by truth itself on this
          occasion, in the three verses which follow the text. In these the
          ground of the reasoning is, that it is a most difficult thing to have
          riches, and not to trust in them; difficult to have the staff in the
          hand, and not to lean upon it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They that have much of the world, have many snares, 1 Timothy 6:17.
          Satan has many handles by which to hold them, which he has not for
          others. "There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
          riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt." While the lusts of
          others by want have fuel drawn from them, they have much fuel added to
          theirs, Proverbs 30:8, 9. The more of the world that men have, they
          have the stronger temptations. We have that within that inclines us to
          court the world even when it frowns; how difficult must it then be to
          be kept from drowning in the embraces of a smiling world?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Very few rich men are found good men, 1 Corinthians 1:26. O how few
          have the art of carrying a full cup even! Of frowning on the world
          when it smiles on them. Most part of such have their portion in this
          life. Many have been injured by the world's smiles, but it is
          difficult to find those that have been made better by them. The
          sweetness of temporal things, usually makes spiritual things
          tasteless. The full soul loathes an honey-comb.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 1. Hence we may fairly account for that, why the meaner sort of
          people make up the greatest part of Christ's followers in the world.
          Why there are so few that have great possessions to be seen among
          them.—Be not stumbled at it, for that very thing which makes them most
          capable to be useful to God, if they had grace to guide it, suits so
          with their corruptions, that it makes them greater enemies to God and
          his way than others. The unicorn's horn is a precious thing, and if it
          were in the hand of a skillful artificer he could do good with it; but
          while it is in the beast's head it is dangerous and hurtful. What can
          be expected of that man that has no grace, much opportunity to be
          vile, many snares and temptations. Such persons are to be pitied,
          seeing they have no restraint neither from within nor without. God in
          mercy keeps much of the world out of the hands of the most part of
          those for whom he has a kindness; because it is so difficult to manage
          it, and not be ruined by it. "I will also leave in the midst of you an
          afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the
          Lord." If the world were such a desirable thing as men's corruptions
          say it is, would the children ordinarily have so little, and the dogs
          get so much of it? No surely.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. To those that are rich we would give that charge, "that you be not
          high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who
          gives us richly all things to enjoy." Rich people may be good though
          it but seldom falls out so. Be upon your guard. Poverty is a snare to
          many this day, that is like to ruin them eternally. Riches are no less
          a snare whatever they be more. Be not puffed up with them, trust not
          in them. If you have more snares than others, you had need of more
          grace, and to be more watchful.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. To those that are pinched with the world, be content with such
          things as you have, do not hasten to be rich. Why should men be so
          desirous of that which it is so difficult to have, and not be ruined
          with it? Can you guide your little so well, that you must needs have
          more? The bait is indeed pleasant, but O how difficult to touch it,
          and not be caught with the hook! And in such a time as this it is most
          unsuitable; the more we have to lose, it will be the harder to part
          with it, Jeremiah 45:4, 5. This brings me to,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine II. That the cross will greatly lessen the number of those
          that are in Christ's company in time of ease. The cross is a great
          discoverer of unsound professors. To confirm this, I will tell you
          four things which the cross has done.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It has checked that briskness of Spirit in religion, which many
          have had until it came, Matthew 8:19, 20. Mark 10:17–22. There are
          many very forward while they meet with no opposition, that shrink back
          at the appearance of the cross; like the flowers that open when the
          sun shines; but shut and are contracted at night, and in cloudy days.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It has extracted the sap out of religion to many, Matthew 13:20,
          21. They have had some delight in it, but when the waters of trying
          afflictions for it come to be mixed therewith it proves altogether
          bitter. Even as the Jews with Christ, Malachi 3:1–3. Isaiah 8:21. The
          cross so embitters some spirits that they lose all heart and hand to
          religion, raging under it as a wild bull in a net.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It has fed and nourished the spiritual lusts of many, that are like
          salamanders which can live well in the fire. "Though I bestow all my
          goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and
          have not charity it profits me nothing." It is not the bearing of the
          cross simply that proves a saint, but the following of Christ with the
          cross on our backs. Papists worship the cross, and Protestants may put
          it in Christ's room, 2 Corinthians 11:12–15.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It has had many apostates, who have quit Christ's side, and joined
          themselves to the devil's party, and turned persecutors of the way in
          which they walked before. Many fearful examples of this, trying times
          have given. The best meat corrupted, smells most abominably; apostates
          are like incarnate devils; as in these that sin against the Holy
          Spirit. None come to such heights as they do.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Reasons of the point.—1. Because the religion of many is a building
          reared up in a hasty manner, so cannot abide the storm. They count not
          the cost, Luke 14:25–33. Want of deliberation in taking on a
          profession makes it quickly go when that meets them that they were not
          thinking of. They stumble when they come to the cross.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because they want a root of grace they cannot be fixed, Matthew
          13:21. There is a root which establishes against falling away, as when
          a tree takes with the ground. "A man shall not be established by
          wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved." A house
          built on sand is in hazard by a storm. Lamps without oil will not do
          for a dark night. Many pools dry up in drought.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because the cross strikes at the very pillar that supported them.
          When Samson removed the pillars the house could not but fall. Many
          pretend faith in Christ, who are nevertheless borne up by the world,
          and when that goes they cannot stand, as we see in the text. It is
          Christ and the world together that give the man the ease; now when
          they part, he is as a bird which has one wing clipped and so cannot
          fly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 1. Be not then desirous of days of trial. It is to be regretted
          that some who wish well to Zion, their hearts are not trembling for
          the ark, but rather showing a kind of fondness of trials for the
          discovery of the unfaithfulness of others, and their own zeal for God.
          At leisure, you know not what spirits you are of. Many that have as
          little doubted their standing have deceived both themselves and
          others. Often has it been seen that they that have said most have done
          least.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Be not offended when in a day of trial you see men thronging away
          from Christ as fast as to him now. The gold is not the worse that the
          dross is consumed in the fire. The falls of some are like that of an
          oak, making many fall with it. But know that all is not gold that
          glitters now. No doubt many will leave Christ, that now look not like
          it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Be preparing for a trying time. Winter will inquire what
          summer has done. It is good to foresee the cross, and make ready for
          it, and to hear for the time to come.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Labor to get the foundation surely laid. Dig deep and build on the
          rock. A small stock of grace will go farther than great gifts. Make
          the covenant secure, the marriage-covenant between Christ and your
          souls. And try it now by what communication is between him and your
          souls. It will be sad if you never know the pipe laid short of the
          fountain until the cross come.—Again, Innure yourself to sit loose to
          the world, and all you have therein. They are as a leg that must be
          out off at last. It is best to be deadening the same now. It will go
          the easier.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, Study to carry your ordinary cross properly. Try to run with
          the footmen; that will help you to contend with horses. Consider
          carefully the directions given to us, 1 Peter 3:14–17.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine III. A person may take his farewell of Christ and holiness,
          with a grieved heart, and dejected countenance. Some go merrily away
          from the ways of God, as a wanton beast when it is turned loose. But
          all go not so. But if they be sorry for it, may you say, why do they
          go away? And if they will not stay, why are they sorry? So it is,
          however, as we see from this example: one sighing, and going backward,
          Lamentations 1:8. We have another instance in Orpah, Ruth 1:15. "She
          lifted up her voice with her mother-in-law, and wept when she left
          her, and the God of Israel at once." On this passage we may observe,
          1. That Orpah had as fair a pretense for what Ruth met with as she
          had. And that was, she became David's grandmother, and so one of the
          mothers of our Lord, Matthew 1:5, 6.—Now it would seem that Orpah was
          the eldest son's wife, Ruth 1:2, 4. Compare Genesis 29:6. And indeed
          God's choice we find has often gone that way, as in the cases of Cain
          and Abel, Esau and Jacob.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Orpah was once as fair set on the way to leave her father's house
          and her people, and go to the land of Judah, as Ruth was, verse 7, 8;
          and doubtless it was with an eye to embrace the Jewish religion, verse
          15, 17. Now the land of Judah was the holy land, where God manifested
          himself, Psalm 76:1, 2. Hence it is called the presence of the Lord,
          Jonah 1:3. As the visible church, Genesis 4:16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. She was once so fond of this happy change, that she could not
          endure to hear of giving it up. The very mentioning of it brought
          tears from her eyes, verse 9. She was very peremptory that nothing
          should hold her back. We will not leave you, but go to your people. As
          a certain scribe said to Jesus, Master, I will follow you wherever you
          go, so she was disposed to say to her mother-in-law. But,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. When Orpah more narrowly considers what she was likely to meet with
          in this new way on which she was entering of changing her God, her
          resolution quickly breaks, and she goes back. And that was the reason
          why Naomi desired them to return, namely, that they might not put
          their hand to the plough, unless they were fitted to ride out every
          storm.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Naomi herself, her people, her God, were dear to Orpah; but a
          husband was yet dearer to her than them all. She would rather have her
          own gods with a husband, than the God of Israel without one. Therefore
          finally she parts with all, and goes back to her gods with a grieved
          heart and wet cheeks, verse 14, 15. She cannot go with them, and yet
          is very sorry to part with them. O! if there had been but an husband
          you could have promised me in that land of Judah; if I could have but
          lived there, as I may live at home, I should never have preferred my
          people to yours, or my gods to your God. But back to her gods she goes
          however, and so lost all the glorious advantages which she might have
          reaped from such a change.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Reasons of the point.—1. Because, though sin be bitter to them, yet
          the want of it is more bitter. They have not much ease in the
          enjoyment of their lusts, but they can have none without them. "They
          have stricken me, shall you say, and I was not sick; they have beaten
          me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again."
          God plants a hedge of thorns and briars about some people's lusts,
          that if they will be at them, their flesh shall be torn in the way.
          Well, but the beast will rather break through that, than endure raging
          hunger within. As long as the sweet of sin masters the sour of it, the
          sinner will drink it up though it make them shrink. Therefore God
          always puts more and more bitterness in it, to his elect, until
          bitterness be predominant, Ecclesiastes 7:26.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Christ is sweet to the man, but his lusts are sweeter; hence if he
          could get both he would part with none of them; but seeing he cannot
          do this, he parts with Christ indeed, but with a grieved heart, as in
          the text. What a hankering had Orpah, how unwilling to leave Naomi.
          Christ will never get a soul truly home to himself, until he
          effectually outbid all others, Proverbs chapter 7 compared with
          chapter 8 particularly verses 18–21. People may say what they will of
          their sweet Savior, but as long as their sweet lusts are sweeter, they
          will, like Esau, part with the inheritance for present gratification.
          The blessing was sweet to Esau after the mess of pottage was digested,
          Genesis 27:38. But when the two were in a balance, and he behooved to
          part with one of them, they weighed down the blessing by far, Genesis
          25:30. Hebrew, Let me taste I pray of that red, That red; that, that.
          But verse 32. Hebrew, But for what is that to me a birth-right.
        </p>

          3. Because their light is strong, but their lusts are stronger. The
          first lets them see Christ, and that holiness is desirable, and puts
          them forward, the latter draws them back. Thus they are tossed between
          the two, though they must needs yield to the stronger as in the cases
          of Balaam and Pilate. Thus they part with Christ, as Phaltiel with
          Michal, 2 Samuel 3:15, 16. The love of his life was strong, but the
          love of his lusts was stronger. The consciences of many encounter much
          resistance before they can get back to their lusts. "They are of those
          that rebel against the light, they know not the ways thereof, nor
          abide in the paths thereof." Lusts rise against light, and drive the
          man out of the paths of it. They abide not in the paths thereof,
          leaving conscience overcome; they know not, or acknowledge not, the
          laws of light, therefore they rebel against it.

          4. They do not find what they expected in Christ. This is plain from
          the text. And disposes men to go away drooping. The disciples were
          almost carried off their feet with this. "But we trusted, said they,
          that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and besides all
          this, today is the third day since these things were done." This
          quickly overturned that man, Matthew 8:19–21. When a man is so sick
          that he looks for nothing but death, he gives away all for life,
          thinking if he had health, he could be content to beg his bread with
          it; but when he gets it he finds that will not do, he must have wealth
          again. So when people feel remorse of conscience, they would give
          anything for ease, but when they have it, they often return to their
          old ways. The mixed multitude of Egyptians who gladly joined with
          Israel at first, Exodus 12:38.—When instead of a Canaan they find a
          wilderness; they soon remembered their former enjoyments, and longed
          to return to them, Numbers 11:4, 5. The newness of the gospel makes a
          great commotion among the hypocrite's affections, then O how sweet is
          religion, prayers, sermons, and communions! But all the time there is
          no spring of grace in the heart which would last, and be a well of
          water springing up to everlasting life. Now it is not possible but his
          commotion must subside when once the novelty is gone, and then they
          thirst again after their lusts as much as ever. And Christ, and
          ordinances, and all turn tasteless to them; as a tale that they have
          heard over and over again. They find not God in his ordinances, and
          what they found is gone; hence they are as twice dead, and plucked up
          by the root.

        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, They desire to be at Heaven, but they have no heart for the
          rugged way to it as in the text. The desire of the slothful man kills
          him; for his hands refuse to labor. He has a mouth to wish for it, but
          no hands to labor for it. As a man that would be over a water, but it
          is so large he dare not venture to take it. They want that other
          spirit, Numbers 14:24 that would steel their foreheads with
          resoluteness against all difficulties. They love the gold but cannot
          dig for it; and leave it with a grieved heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Inference 1. It is very natural for backsliders and apostates to
          return to their lusts with more greediness than ever. It is plain they
          do, 2 Peter 2:20–22. compare Matthew 12:44, 45. For they are then like
          swine that have been kept clean a while, or as beasts freed from their
          confinement. But there is more in it, they have left Christ and
          holiness with a grieved heart, and they stand in need of something to
          comfort them more than others that never saw any beauty in religion,
          and they must do their best to draw that out of their lusts.—They have
          need of floods of lusts, because they have conscience to drown in them
          which others have not.
        </p>

          2. A warm side to religion is not enough, if people have not a warm
          heart to it. The warm side may burn in Hell forever. What is that but
          that people love Christ well, but love their lusts better. "He who
          loves father or mother, says Jesus, more than me, is not worthy of
          me;" therefore he loves me in some measure. Take heed to this,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You that think you keep a good heart to God, though you make not much
          noise about religion; that is, though there is nothing indeed of it in
          your life, and you never knew what it was to sacrifice a lust to his
          pleasure. The heart of the wicked is little worth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You also that mean well, and always would gladly be religious, and
          amend your lives, but yet you never do it. Ever learning, and never
          able to come to the knowledge of the truth. You are not so desirous of
          Christ as of your lusts yet; and what does he regard these your
          meanings? You have a hankering after Christ and religion, and what of
          that? So had this man. Why are you almost, and not altogether
          Christians?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, you also that sooth yourselves with this, that while you are
          living in sin, without endeavoring to mortify your lusts; your
          outbreakings in them are against your will, and you wish you could
          help it, but never seriously apply yourselves to help it. It is not
          against your will, it is but against your conscience; and if you hold
          on a while, it may come to that, your conscience may be quite dead,
          and seared as with a hot iron, and may travel with equal pace with
          that will of yours that loves idols, and after them will go, and will
          not come to Christ for life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, this writes death to them that have had their convictions, and
          have been endeavoring amendment, but found it would not do; and
          therefore they have given it over, and they are sorry for it that it
          would not do with them. Still they hope all may be well. I would have
          you to review that, your solemn farewell given to Christ. The best
          that can be made of it is, that you were sad at that saying, and went
          away grieved, and bade him farewell, and so parted with him, but with
          the tear in your eye. Amen.
