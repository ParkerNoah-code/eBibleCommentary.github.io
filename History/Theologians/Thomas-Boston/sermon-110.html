          2 Corinthians 5:7, "For we walk by faith, not by sight."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IN the preceding words we find a notable mystery of the Christian
          life, namely, it is a groaning life, verses 2, 4, and yet a life of
          confidence, wherein one is of good cheer, as safe and comfortable,
          verse 6. But if Christians are so confident, and of so good cheer, why
          do they groan? They are burdened, under a body of sin and death, a
          load of trials and afflictions. And burdened folk must groan; ay, and
          they may groan, and yet not grudge; for Christ himself was a groaner,
          but not a grudger, as we find John 11:33, "He groaned in the spirit,
          and was troubled." But then if they groan so heavily, how are they
          confident and of good cheer? how can these consist? Very well, says
          the apostle, "For we walk by faith's not by sight." Faith's prospect
          keeps up the heart, while sight and sense of the hardships of the way
          makes us groan; and we steer our course by the former, not by the
          latter. In the words we have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The present state and condition of the saints in this world; they
          are in the way, as travelers; "We walk." The saints in Heaven, and the
          damned in Hell, are come to their journey's end; they are, as to their
          bodies, in their long home; as to their souls, in their eternal home.
          We here are on the way; the wicked, some running, some stealing, on
          the way to destruction; the saints on their way to Heaven, groaning
          and pressing forward. The company before them is triumphant, the
          company with them militant; they are not yet got home, but they are on
          the way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. How they direct their course while in the way, for safety and
          comfort; for their road through this world is dangerous and gloomy, as
          in a wilderness. And positively,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. "By faith." They that are before them in Heaven, manage themselves
          by sight; for their sight cannot deceive; everything appears there in
          its true colors, and their sight discerns every thing as it is. The
          rest of the travelers through the world walk by sight; but sight and
          sense in the world are deceitful things; for there are many false
          appearances there, which whoever follow fall headlong into the dark
          dungeon of destruction. But their Father has given them faith's
          prospect to walk by; and that discovers things worldly sight cannot
          reach, and correct the mistakes of it in things it does reach; and in
          some measure it supplies the want of heavenly sight, giving a view of
          things not seen; Hebrews 11:1, "Now faith is the substance of things
          hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Negatively, "Not by sight." The word does not formally denote the
          sight seeing, but the sight seen; that is, the outward shape of
          things, the appearance they make to our sight, sense, and carnal
          reason. Hence it is rendered "shape;" John 5:37, "And the Father
          himself which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither
          heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape and "appearance;" 1
          Thessalonians 5:22, "Abstain from all appearance of evil." Now, that
          appearance of things is the guide in the way to carnal men; by it they
          take their marks, and are led to ruin. The saints forgetting
          themselves, sometimes take their mark by it too, and they smart for
          it; but their habitual deliberate course is not directed by it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. They that would safely and comfortably travel on their way
          through this world, must direct their course by faith, and not by
          sight, or the appearance things make to their sight, sense, and carnal
          reason.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine, I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. Consider the journey we are all on.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Show how we must, while we are on our way, direct our course by
          faith, and not by sight, as ever we would get safely and comfortably
          through.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Lastly, Apply.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall consider The journey we are all on. Saints and sinners are
          both travelers. The difference between them lies not in that the one
          are on their journey, and the other arrived at their home; nay, they
          are both by the way; and sinners are walking as fast to their home, as
          saints to theirs. But it lies here; the one "walk by faith," the other
          "walk by sight." Therefore hear a few words of our common journey.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The point where we began our journey, was from the womb; the moment
          we received life there, we set off in our way. Then we commenced
          sinful creatures, as says the psalmist; Psalm 51:5, "Behold, I was
          shaped in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me;" and
          therefore dying creatures. So we were on our way, before we could
          point a foot to the ground, before we knew where we were.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The point where we will end it, is another world, the unseen world,
          the place and state of the dead. The travelers will never halt until
          they be there, whether they sleep or wake; for says Job, chapter
          30:23, "I know that you will bring me to death, and to the house
          appointed for all living." The baiting-places by the way may be very
          different; but the lodging place is one; we will lie down alike in the
          dust.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Our journeying, or traveling, or walking itself, is our motion
          between these two points; and that is our living here. Our life in
          this world is not a rest, but a traveling motion; a traveling from the
          womb to the grave; a coming from the womb of our mother-woman, and
          going in again to the womb of our mother-earth; as says Job, chapter
          1:21, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return
          thither."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The place our way lies through, is this present world; where the
          rising and setting sun makes so many days and nights; where are so
          many summers and winters, while the travelers are on their road; where
          God sends out his messengers to direct as to the right road. Carnal
          men count it their dwelling-place; hence says the psalmist, Psalm
          49:11, "Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue
          forever, and their dwelling-places to all generations; they call their
          lands after their own names." Again, they call it their resting place;
          hence said the rich man, Luke 12:19, "And I will say to my soul, Soul,
          you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat,
          drink, and be merry." But it is but our journeying place we travel
          through; like a town on the road, where the traveler comes in at the
          one end of it, and goes out at the other; Ecclesiastes 1:4, "One
          generation passes away, and another generation comes."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. The way we make in our journey is our time. How much of our time,
          so much of our way is over; and one step of our way, right or wrong,
          we will never go back. Time flies away; and we out our way more
          quickly than a post; and therefore will soon be at our journey's end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, Every breathing we make, every pulse is a step in the way.
          God has determined how often every one shall breathe in and out the
          air, how many rounds the blood shall go in our bodies, what number of
          pulses it shall make. These are the steps by which this journey is
          made. At length the last pulse beats, the last breathing is made; and
          we are at our journey's end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The next thing is to show, How we most, while we are on our way,
          direct our course by faith and not by sight, as ever we would get
          safely and comfortably through.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. As we are by nature possessed of sight and sense, we must be by
          grace possessed of faith too. We are men endowed with sense and
          reason, but we must be Christians too, having received Jesus Christ by
          faith; as says the apostle, Colossians 2:6, "As you have received
          Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him." Mere sensual or natural men,
          without a gracious principle, a principle of faith, cannot walk but by
          sense. Faith must first fetch a new life, or new nature from Christ,
          in habitual sanctification, before one can walk by faith in actual
          holiness; 2 Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore," says the apostle, "if any
          man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away,
          behold, all things are become new." Ephesians 2:10, "For we are his
          workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has
          before ordained that we should walk in them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. We must no more make the present world our mark and chief aim, but
          the unseen world of eternal bliss. Sense discovers the seen world as a
          beautiful thing in the profits and pleasures thereof, and it
          terminates the view of the travelers by sight. But faith's travelers
          look beyond it, and discover the better country, Immanuel's laud; and
          being firmly persuaded it is a better country, steer their course
          directly for it; Canticles 8:5, "Who is this that comes up from the
          wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?" Hebrews 11:13, "These all died
          in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar
          off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that
          they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth." Philippians 3:14, "I
          press toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in
          Christ Jesus."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We must take our way-marks to that land by faith, and not by sight.
          The travelers that walk by sense, they see the multitude on their way,
          and they see it is approved by the general vote; and so they go on in
          their loose and easy way of religion, where the law as a law does not
          gird them strait; and in then legal way of religion, where they hang
          by the bit of the law as a covenant. For that is a sightly, rational
          way, not fanciful they think.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the travelers by faith look to the word, and by faith discover
          only Christ to be the personal way, and universal holiness the real
          way; John 14:6, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man
          comes unto the Father, but by me." Psalm 119:6, "Then," says the
          psalmist, "shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all your
          commandments." And therefore they work as if they were to win Heaven
          by working: and renounce all confidence before the Lord in their
          works, as if they had never done a good work; hence is that character
          given of them, Philippians 3:3, "We are the circumcision which worship
          God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence
          in the flesh."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. We must go on our way, not in felt strength, but believed strength.
          Sight and sense are bold, according to what the man finds within
          himself; as said Peter, "Though all should deny you, yet will not I."
          Faith is bold in what it sees in Christ; hence is that exhortation, 2
          Timothy 2:1, "You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in
          Christ Jesus." And hence the Christian's experience is, 2 Corinthians
          12:10, "When I am weak, then am I strong." For he says, Psalm 71:16,
          "I will go in the strength of the Lord God; I will make mention of
          your righteousness, even of your only."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. We must not wait the comforts of sight and sense, under the
          hardships of the way, but take the comfort of faith; Psalm 108:7, "God
          has spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice." They may wait long the
          other way before they get it; but faith is help at hand; for faith's
          cordial water is always ready, namely, the spring of the word that is
          always clear, even while the dispensations of providence are
          wonderful; hence says David, Psalm 56:10, "In God will I praise his
          word; in the Lord will I praise his word."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. We must not take the testimony of our sight and sense, but believe
          the report of faith, concerning all we meet with in our way; and walk
          accordingly. Worldly ease, wealth, and prosperity, are excellent good
          things; tribulations and trials very ill things, by the testimony of
          sense; but faith reports quite otherwise of them; that the former is
          dangerous, and the latter the more safe. Sense says, he hates, and
          therefore he rebukes; faith corrects the mistake by the word, and says
          he loves; and therefore "as many as I love, I rebuke and chasten,"
          Revelation 3:19. We must believe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Lastly, When sight and sense fails, we must hold faith's gripe, and
          press forward; hence says the psalmist, Psalm 73:26, "My flesh and my
          heart fails; but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion
          forever." In particular temptations, trials, etc., when the foot is
          ready to slip, we must hold fast the promise; for there is our safety
          and comfort too; Psalm 27:13, "I had fainted, unless I had believed to
          see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living." When all
          streams of consolation arising from this world are running dry, we
          must fetch in consolation from another world; hence says the prophet,
          Habakkuk 3:17, 18, "Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither
          shall fruit be in the vines, the labor of the olive shall fail, and
          the fields shall yield no meat, the flock shall be cut off from the
          fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in
          the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Sinners, be no longer deceived with vain appearances, cease
          your pursuit of the objects of sense as your great mark and aim, and
          close with Christ the object of faith, looking for your portion in the
          unseen world of happiness. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Sight and sense have deceived you, and will do so to the end,
          Ecclesiastes 1:2. It is impossible for what you see in this world, if
          it were all yours, to satisfy your heart in its cravings. You labor in
          vain; Ecclesiastes 1:8. "All things are fall of labor, man cannot
          utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled
          with hearing."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Faith will bring in full satisfaction to you; hence is that
          exhortation; Psalm 81:10, "Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it."
          It brings in a fully satisfying object; for such will be Christ in you
          the hope of glory; and according to the measure of your faith, so will
          your actual satisfaction and soul's rest be; and if it were perfect,
          the satisfaction would be so too.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">And if you would take this course,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Secure your belief of a better world, of a full and eternal
          happiness beyond the boundaries of time. Believe it on the testimony
          of God in his word. Alas! with most men it is rather may-be than a
          certainty; a probable opinion, than a matter of firm persuasion. If it
          were not so, men could not be so indifferent about it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Believe that Christ is held forth to you in the gospel-promise to
          be trusted to, and so to be embraced by you, that you may by that
          trust on him as your Savior be united to him; John 3:16, "For God so
          loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever
          believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
          Ephesians 3:17, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith," etc.
          And in and with him is held forth all the grace and glory of the
          unseen world; Romans 8:32, "He who spared not his own Son, but
          delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely
          give us all things?" So receiving him, you will be heirs of the
          eternal inheritance discovered and embraced in the promise by faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. Let such as are under spiritual desertion, going mourning
          without the sun, from whom the spiritual sight and comfortable sense
          they sometimes had is gone, know that believing is a proper course for
          them. Though your way unto God seems to be built up round about you
          with hewn stone, there is often a place left whereat you may walk out
          by faith; Isaiah 50:10, "Who is among you that fears the Lord, that
          obeys the voice of his servant, that walks in darkness, and has no
          light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Though former spiritual sight and feeling is gone, that you are
          left as a stone, the promise of the gospel is where it was still. Your
          mismanagement cannot make the faithfulness of God of none effect; 2
          Timothy 2:13, "If we believe not, yet he abides faithful; he cannot
          deny himself." The breasts of the promise are as full and free as
          before.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Try to believe and apply the promise. You find you have not the
          power of your spiritual limbs; but God calls you to arise and walk by
          faith. Show good-will and the obedience of faith upon Christ's call,
          as the man with the withered hand. There may be great mercy in the
          womb of the heavy dispensation you are shut up under; Romans 11:32,
          "For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy
          upon all." Strong appears that power, that suddenly looses the waters
          bound up with an intense frost.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Wait not for sense and feeling, that you may believe; but believe,
          that you may recover spiritual sense and feeling again; Psalm 65:3,
          "Iniquities prevail against me; as for our transgressions, you shall
          purge them away." Romans 15:13, "Now the God of hope fill you with all
          joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope through the
          power of the Holy Spirit."

          USE 3. Last, Remember that, particularly at the Lord's table, you walk
          by faith, not by sight. Labor by faith to discern the Lord's body
          exhibited unto you in the sacramental signs, and feed thereupon by a
          believing application of Christ to yourselves.

        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall offer a short view of walking by faith, and not by sight.
          It lies in these four,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In taking our aim by faith, and not by sight. The aim taken by
          sight is low; that by faith is high, out of reach of sight; hence says
          the apostle, Philippians 3:14, "I press toward the mark, for the prize
          of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." While the great aim of
          them that walk by sight and sense, is to win the world, the ease and
          comforts of it, let yours be to win Christ, as was Paul's; Philippians
          3:8, "Yes, doubtless, and I count all things but loss, for the
          excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have
          suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung that I may
          win Christ." Let it be to me with Christ, as was the same apostle's;
          chapter 1:23, "For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to
          depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better." Follow that aim
          and you walk by faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In taking your guide for your way by faith, not by sight. Give over
          walking according to the course of this world; but take Christ for
          your guide, whom the Father has given for that end; Isaiah 55:4,
          "Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and
          commander to the people." Your own sight and wisdom are not to be
          trusted for guiding you; you will never get through, if he be not eyes
          to you in the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. In taking your directions in the way by faith, not by sight. Sight
          takes up things by their outward appearance, faith views them in the
          glass of the word. And the word is the rule of the walk that is by
          faith; Isaiah 8:20, "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak
          not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."
          And to that word the traveler is to turn his eyes in all difficulties.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. In fetching in your support and provision in the way by faith, not
          by sight. Faith goes to the promise for that end; hence said Jacob,
          Genesis 32:12, "And you said, I will surely do you good, and make your
          seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
          It is the staff in his hand to help him forward, the well of
          consolation to drink at for refreshment, the cordial to keep from
          fainting.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Where lies the difference between faith and sight in this matter?
          There is a sight and sense of spiritual things, as well as of worldly
          things. But whatever kind sight and sense be of While we are in the
          way, there is a great difference between faith and it, so that we are
          to direct our course by the former, not by the latter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Sight looks into ourselves, and out to the world; but faith looks
          up to Christ. Hence many heavy things present themselves to the
          traveler's sight, partly without, and partly within him, which are apt
          to cause him to faint in his way. But faith looking to Christ,
          discerns in him what is more than balance for all these, 1 Peter 1:6,
          8, and makes him go cheerfully on. If at any time joyful and
          refreshing things present themselves to his sight, yet these are but
          some shallow streams from that fullness in Christ which faith sits
          down at; Colossians 2:10, "And you are complete in him, which is the
          head of all principality and power."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Sight proceeds upon the outward appearance of things; and because
          these are often false, the traveler is led out of his way thereby into
          pits and snares; as was the case with Samuel; 1 Samuel 16:6, 7, "And
          it came to pass when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and
          said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before him. But the Lord said unto
          Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature;
          because I have refused him; for the Lord sees not as man sees; for man
          looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart." And
          this is the very way how many are led off into the mire of profanity,
          following the sight of their eyes; others into damnable heresies,
          following the dictates of their corrupt reason in divine mysteries.
          But faith proceeds on the testimony of God, believing because God has
          said it; receiving the kingdom of God as a little child, to whom the
          Father's saying is enough for his believing, and his bidding for his
          doing. So walking by faith is sure walking, because on the testimony
          of God that cannot lie, Titus 1:2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The object of sight is very variable, sometimes waxing, sometimes
          waning, and sometimes disappearing for good and all; hence they that
          walk by it, are like men walking by the help of the moon in a cloudy
          night, that often leaves them in darkness. This was the psalmist's
          case; Psalm 30:7, "Lord, by your favor you have made my mountain to
          stand strong; you did hide your face, and I was troubled." Hence such
          unevenliness in the way of many. But the object of faith is fixed and
          unchangeable; Hebrews 13:8, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and
          today, and forever." 2 Peter 1:19, We have also a more sure word of
          prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as unto a light
          that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star
          arise in your hearts." And hence walking by faith is steady walking;
          the man holds on his way, though comforts fail without and within.
          Christ is to the fore, the promise is sure anchor-ground.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Sight reaches only to things present, but faith reaches to future
          things; Hebrews 11:1, "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the
          evidence of things not seen." Sight and sense looking to the present
          dispensation of providence, tells the traveler, what is; but faith
          looking to the promise, tells what will be. Sight says, there it a
          beautiful world for a resting place: and the traveler listening to its
          tale, begins to seek rest there. But faith tells, there is a train in
          the affections of it, that will blow it up, and it will be in flames
          shortly; and so he hastens forward; and, There is a better world to
          come. Sight says, often, There is a hard way, and a dark night, no
          appearance of day; but faith says on the credit of the promise, But
          the end will be peace, and the morning comes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, Sight reaches no further even into things present, than the
          outside; but faith looks in to what is enrapt up within them. It
          discovers the lion's and leopard's dens in Lebanon, hidden from sight
          by the pleasant growth there; the poison covered up in the world's
          golden dish, that deceived sense would otherwise receive. And it will
          discover a paradise, where nothing lies open to sight but a hedge of
          thorns, 2 Corinthians 12:10. "Therefore I take pleasure in
          infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in
          distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then am I strong."
          It will make surprising discoveries in a sore affliction. Weighing an
          affliction that to sense is the weight of a talent, it will discover
          it to be really light; measuring one of long continuance to sense it
          will discover it to be but for a moment; trying the nature and
          operation of one that appears deadly and destructive to sense, it will
          discover it to "work a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
          while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
          which are not seen; for the things which are seen, are temporal; but
          the things which are not seen, are eternal," 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. The next thing is, to give the reasons of the point. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It was walking by sight that first ruined the world; as we find
          Genesis 3:6, "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food,
          and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
          one wise; she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also
          unto her husband with her; and he did eat." And by the same method the
          ruin is a-carrying on still. If it was so dangerous to walk by sight
          in paradise, how is it possible it can be safe now, when snares are
          multiplied in the world, and our faculty of discerning is so notably
          impaired?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The life present is appointed for faith, the life to come for sight
          and sense. Now is the time of trial, and the trial of faith in
          particular, walk by it now; the trial will shortly be over, and faith
          will be turned into sight, and the saints shall be happy in seeing and
          feeling to their heart's wish forever. Two summers are not to be
          expected in one year; and they that will have their summer of sense
          now, will have a long winter of it through eternity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Faith and sight in the matter of comfort differ as duty and
          privilege. Faith is our duty at all times, foul or fair; hence is that
          exhortation, Psalm 62:8, "Trust in him at all times; you people, pour
          out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us." Spiritual sight
          and sense is a privilege that God gives or withholds from his people
          according to sovereign pleasure. The duty of believing is prescribed
          us for our work; sight and sense allowed now and then for our
          encouragement in it, as we see in the case of Thomas; John 20:27–29,
          "Then says he to Thomas, Reach hither your finger, and behold my
          hands; and reach hither your hand, and thrust it into my side, and be
          not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him,
          My Lord and my God. Jesus says unto him, Thomas, because you have seen
          me, you have believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet
          have believed." And therefore we are to walk by faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, Our happiness for time and eternity lies in unseen things;
          2 Corinthians 4:17, 18, forfeited. It is an unseen Christ from whom we
          have all our hope of happiness, Christ in you the hope of glory. It is
          an unseen world where we can be completely happy. Therefore we walk to
          destruction if we walk not by faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. 1st, As ever you would walk safely through the world, and not be
          ensnared for the present, and ruined in the end, walk by faith, and
          not by sight. And for this end consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. You are in an ensnaring world. You have a fair-faced deceitful
          world to deal with, a subtle devil ready to outwit you, and you are
          but weak-sighted for discerning snares. If you trust to sight and
          sense, and walk not by faith, you will be ensnared and circumvented to
          your eternal ruin. Therefore hear our Lord's direction, Canticles 4:8,
          "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from
          the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions'
          dens, from the mountains of the leopards."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Sight, and sense, and corrupt reason, are making fearful shipwreck
          of souls at this day; and spiritual plagues are a-dealing plentifully,
          in delivering up the generation to them, that have refused to walk by
          faith. The plague began in untender and loose practices; these have
          ate out the life of spirituality in religion; and it has proceeded to
          the casting off of the principles of religion at length, rejecting
          first the grace of Christ, and then attacking the doctrine of the
          person of Christ, his supreme Godhead, necessary and self-existence
          and independency. So that our posterity are like to have transmitted
          to them a mere rational kind of religion, under the name of
          Christianity, that has no dependence on nor relation to the glorious
          person, grace, and Spirit of Christ, the Father's equal; which differs
          not from Heathenism, but in some accidentals. And the spring of all
          is, walking by sight, not by faith; the pleasing of sense in practice,
          and corrupt reason in principles. Therefore take heed, and learn the
          humility of faith in practice and principles, to echo your soul's
          consent to "Thus says the Lord" in his word. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Walk by faith in duty. Your call to it being clear, go about it
          in the faith of the promise of through bearing; and not of your own
          gifts, abilities, and home furniture for it; Philippians 4:13, "I can
          do all things," says the apostle, "through Christ which strengthens
          me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Walk by faith against sin, and your several corrupt lusts that
          are to be mortified. Look to the cross of Christ, thence to bring
          destruction on them, applying the virtue of Christ's death to
          yourselves by faith; Romans 6:6, "Knowing this, that our old man is
          crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that
          henceforth we should not serve sin;" trusting to him for the efficacy
          of his Spirit in the appointed means of mortification; Romans 8:13,
          "For if you live after the flesh, you shall die; but if you through
          the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Walk by faith through temptations; being strong in the grace that
          is in Christ Jesus, believing his grace shall he sufficient for you,
          for that the battle is the Lord's. The fast hold of the promise of his
          grace, will be your security.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, As ever you would walk comfortably through the world, walk by
          faith, not by sight. The comfort of sight and sense is very uncertain
          and short-lived; the mountain may be standing sure this day, that may
          he overturned tomorrow. And whatever comfort you have that way now,
          you will certainly come to the time, when, if you cannot walk
          comfortably by faith, you will have no comfort at all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Walk by faith in desertion. Sometimes the candle of spiritual
          sense is blown out to God's people, but the sun of the promise is firm
          as the sun in the heavens. And they are brought to that case for the
          trial of faith, which must then act on the bare word of promise;
          Isaiah 50:10, "Who is among you that fears the Lord, that obeys the
          voice of his servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light? let
          him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Walk by faith in affliction, believing it is God's ordinance for
          humbling and purifying; that there is no needless affliction you meet
          with; that he will be with you in it, and will deliver you in the time
          that will be best for deliverance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Lastly, Walk by faith through death. So they walked through the
          Red Sea, and were safe, though the waters were as hanging heaps on
          every hand of them; confident on the ground of God's faithfulness in
          the word of free grace; Hebrews 11:29, "By faith they passed through
          the Red Sea, as by dry land, which the Egyptians essaying to do, were
          drowned."

          HAVING had occasion to discourse from these words at a late
          sacramental occasion, I observed the following point of doctrine from
          them, namely, They that would safely and comfortably travel on their
          way through this world, must direct their course by faith, and not by
          sight, or the appearance things make to their sight, sense, and carnal
          reason; which I endeavored to open up and apply; and without repeating
          what was then delivered, I shall, as the subject of farther discourse
          from this text, gather up the substance of the words in the two
          following doctrines.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. I. The Christian walk is not by sight, or the outward
          appearance of things.

          DOCTRINE. II. The Christian walk is a walking by faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In handling the first of these doctrines, I shall,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Show that there is such a walk in use in the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Open up the nature of this walking by sight, and show wherein it
          lies.

        <p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Make some practical improvement.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall show that there is such a walk in use in the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. There are many whose main care and concern is for the body, and the
          things of a present life; neglecting their souls and their eternal
          interest: hence says David; Psalm 4:6, "There be many that say, who
          will show us any good?" but there are few that say, "Lord, lift you up
          the light of your countenance upon us." This sad truth is obvious to
          discerning persons, who cannot but see the world thronged with such
          egregious fools, who are penny wise and pound foolish. But let such
          consider that word; Matthew 16:26, "What is a man profited, if he
          shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man
          give in exchange for his soul?"

        <p align="justify">
          2. The life of most men is passed in a dream, being one continued
          cheat imposed on them by the grand deceiver; Psalm 4:2, "O you sons of
          men, how long will you love vanity, and seek after leasing?" They
          never open their eyes, to see matters in their true colors, until all
          is past remedy. This was the ease of the rich man; Luke 16:23, "Who in
          Hell lift up his eyes, being in torments, and saw Abraham afar off,
          and Lazarus in his bosom." The foolish virgins dreamed on until the
          door was shut. See the spring of this; Isaiah 24:20, "He feeds on
          ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver
          his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Few are at pains to examine matters by the word, which gives
          heaven's testimony of them, Isaiah 8:20; but they take him according
          to their own outward appearance. Hence the bait is swallowed I
          greedily, without discerning the hook, until it stick in their throat.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Often things that are good and profitable, are neglected and
          shunned, because they are not pleasant to sense; and things pleasing
          to sense, though poisonous and destructive in their own nature, are
          greedily embraced. Hence is that woe; Isaiah 5:20, "Woe unto them that
          call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light and light
          for darkness; and put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter." A plain
          evidence that sense is the leading principle, and not faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I will open the nature of this walking by sight, and show wherein
          it lies. Walking by sight lies,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In taking your aim by sight, and not by faith, contrary to that; 2
          Corinthians 4:18, "While we look not at the things which are seen; but
          at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen, are
          temporal; but the things which are not seen, are eternal." Every man
          has some aim, which is the main thing he drives at; but most men take
          their aim by sight and sense, setting themselves to pursue that for
          their portion, which sight and sense recommend to them. Hence in
          walking by sight,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The seen world is preferred to the unseen; Psalm 4:6, "There be
          many that say, Who will show us any good?" In the word of the gospel
          we hear of an unseen world, where glory dwells, where there is an
          eternal enjoyment of all good; but with our eyes we see the beauty of
          a present world. So sight having more influence than faith, this world
          is chosen for a portion which we see; the other is neglected as a
          thing unseen, and therefore unsure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Present things to those that are to come. Hence said Paul of
          Demas; 2 Timothy 4:10, "Demas has forsaken me, having loved this
          present world." Sense says, A bird in hand, is worth two in a bush.
          Sense being the leading principle, the man must have his portion
          presently, he cannot wait; for sense cannot be gratified with anything
          but what is present, Psalm 17:14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Temporal things to spiritual, 2 Corinthians 4:18; forfeited. Gold
          is preferred to grace, the fellowship of the world to the favor of
          God, and all the privileges of the everlasting covenant. For the
          former are objects of sight and sense, the latter objects of faith;
          and if men walk by sight, they can never prefer spiritual things which
          they see not, to temporal things which they do see.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In directing your course by sight, and not by faith, through the
          world. Hence is that exhortation; Numbers 15:39, "Seek not after your
          own heart, and your own eyes, after which you used to go a-whoring."
          We have much need to be directed aright to the way we should take,
          through the world, wherein there are so many cross ways, byways,
          dangerous ways. Men sensible of their own weakness, strive to direct
          their course by faith; but most men, proud and presumptuous, direct
          theirs by their sight and sense. Hence,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The course of this world is followed instead of the way of God's
          commands. Hence said the apostle to the Ephesians; Ephesians 2:2, "In
          time past you walked according to the course of this world, according
          to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in
          the children of disobedience." Men think themselves safe enough, if
          there be a multitude before them; they are shameless in sin, because
          they have many neighbors; nay, they would think shame not to go in a
          way that is generally gone into; for it is a piece of the wisdom and
          good humor of the flesh, to be conformed to the world. But "be you not
          conformed to this world; but be you transformed by the renewing of
          your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and
          perfect will of God," Romans 12:2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The most easy way is followed instead of the most safe; Matthew
          7:13, "Enter in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is
          the way that leads to destruction, and many there be which go in
          thereat." For sense sees only what is present, sees not the end until
          it be come; so the broad, green, and easy way, though the pit of
          destruction is at the end, is preferred to the rugged way to life, by
          those walking by sense.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) The softest steps are taken, though they be not cleanly. What
          will gratify the sense is swallowed down, though it choke the
          conscience. When the eyes are fixed on beholding vanity, the soul runs
          headlong into the snare. Hence the world is filled with covetousness,
          sensuality, impurity, etc., being drawn into ruin with the silken
          cords of sense.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) Steps dangerous to sense are shunned, to the wounding of the
          conscience; Proverbs 29:25, "The fear of man brings a snare; but
          whoever puts his trust in the Lord shall be safe." Hence walking by
          sense in time of danger for religion, makes many apostates; and in
          time of the greatest peace, it brings a fearful snare; so that
          shunning to offend men, we often run ourselves on offending and
          grieving the Spirit of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. In taking your encouragement in the way from sense, not by faith;
          so venturing out on strength seen and felt, not in the strength of
          Christ secured in the promise. Jeremiah 17:5, "Thus says the Lord,
          Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and
          whose heart departs from the Lord." Most men know nothing of going in
          any strength, but what is in themselves. And hence in walking by
          sense,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Often there is a bold venturing on where there is a foul come
          off, as in Peter's case. Men presumptuously venture on such and such
          duties, where they sink and cannot get through, their own stock of
          ability failing them; they rush on temptations fearlessly, and they
          lose their feet, and fall into the mire. Their bow bent is broken, and
          they cannot find their hands in the day of battle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Often there is a cowardly shifting of duty which God calls for;
          Proverbs 26:13, "The slothful man says, There is a lion in the way, a
          lion is in the streets." The man is called to duty, but he sees he is
          not able for it; every call to duty bears a promise of strength; but
          he walks by sense, not by faith, therefore can venture on no more than
          what he feels and sees. And many duties are cast off this way, and
          much guilt fixed on the conscience.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. In rising and falling just according to sight and sense, and the
          outward appearance of providence. Most men know no other spring of
          trouble and sorrow, of peace and comfort, but that; and according as
          that spring runs clear or muddy, so do they find or lose their
          comfort. Hence,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) When the outward dispensations of providence are smiling and
          favorable to them, they are very easy, though perhaps matters are all
          wrong between God and their souls, as was the case with the rich man;
          Luke 12:19, "And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid
          up for many years, take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry." The
          concerns of the world prospering, they are well, they reign as kings,
          for they have no due concern about the matters of another world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) When these outward dispensations are all against them, they have
          no comfort; for the things of sense, the only spring of their comfort,
          is dried up. It was not so with Job walking by faith; Job 6:13, "Is
          not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?" nor with
          Habakkuk; chapter 3:17, 18, "Although the fig-tree shall not blossom,
          neither shall fruit be in the vines, the labor of the olive shall
          fail, and the fields shall yield no meat, the flock shall be cut off
          from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls; yet I will
          rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. To confirm the doctrine, consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Walking by sight and sense is not the way that Christ himself
          walked; and sure it is the duty of believers to walk after his
          example; 1 John 2:6, "He who says he abides in him, ought himself also
          so to walk, even as he walked." Now it is said of him expressly,
          Isaiah 11:3, "He shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither
          reprove after the hearing of his ears." We have a notable instance of
          it in the history of his temptations; Matthew 4:8–10, "Again, the
          devil takes him up into an exceeding high mountain, and shows him all
          the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, and says unto him,
          All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship
          me. Then says Jesus unto him, Get you hence, Satan; for it is written,
          You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve." So
          they cannot be followers of Christ that walk by sight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is not the way wherein the saints have got to the kingdom; 2
          Corinthians 4:18, "They looked not at the things which are seen, but
          at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are
          temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal." Had that
          been the way of walking every one took, where would men have been
          found who would have digested seen and felt hardships, for unseen
          comforts and happiness? Walking by sight would have been very unfit to
          make martyrs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is the highway of unregenerate men, sensual, not having the
          Spirit, Jude verse 19. The evil spies, and the murmuring generation
          that listened to them, were an awful emblem of such walkers, whose
          carcases shall fall in the wilderness, and they never see the promised
          land. Those only shall see it who, like Caleb and Joshua, have another
          spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">USE I. This informs us,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That those are not true Christians, who habitually walk by sight
          and sense, who make their sense and feeling, and outward appearance of
          things, the mark they walk by. If your course of life be not
          influenced by your belief of things that are not seen, you will never
          see the land afar off.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Let not Christians think strange, that things are generally ordered
          harsh to them in the world as to their sight and sense; for it is not
          by things soft and easy to these, that the Lord's children make their
          way home; nor yet that sight and sense in spirituals is but very
          seldom allowed them; for though some sips and drops of that kind may
          now and then be let fall with them, their meal of that kind is
          reserved for another world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. So far as a child of God walks by sight and sense, he is off his
          road; and he will find himself bemisted in it at length, and be gladly
          to return.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. Walk not by sight and appearance of things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 1. It is a wavering unsettled way of walking, James 1:8. "A
          double-minded man is unstable in all his ways." The objects of sense
          are very uncertain; they may be with one today, away tomorrow: wo to
          them that are building their peace and comfort on them; they are like
          one that would sleep on the top of a mast.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a deceitful way of walking. Things that have the fairest
          appearance to sight, are often the most hurtful and ruining; Canticles
          4:8, "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon; look
          from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the
          lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards." And Satan deceives
          men a thousand times by their sight and sense.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lastly, It is a dangerous way of walking. All mankind felt it in
          Eve's trusting to her eyes, and the consequences thereof; Genesis 3:6,
          "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
          was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise;
          she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her
          husband with her, and he did eat." And fearful havoc is still making
          by the same doors of destruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. The Christian walking is a walk by faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine, I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Give you a view of walking by faith, showing wherein it lies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. Show how they walk that walk by faith.</p>
        <p align="justify">III. Confirm the doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Apply.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall give you a view of walking by faith, showing wherein it
          lies. [Here the author repeated what was said upon the same subject in
          the beginning of the second sermon on this text, above, p. 471.]
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I shall show how they walk that walk by faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, They walk heavenly; Philippians 3:20, "For our conversation is in
          Heaven." They that walk by sense, have a carnal, sensual, worldly
          walk, like the rest of the men of this world; but they that walk by
          faith, walk as Christ walked, they walk heavenly; which we take up in
          four things,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Heaven and glory is the place and state they have in view to reach;
          2 Corinthians 4:18; they "look not at the things which are seen, but
          at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen, are
          temporal; but the things which are not seen, are eternal." They are
          set off in their journey, and there they design to be. There only they
          expect their rest, and there they desire to be; as was the case with
          the Old Testament saints; Hebrews 11:16, "But now they desire a better
          country, that is, an heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be
          called their God; for he has prepared for them a city." Those who are
          led by sense, like the Reubenites, etc., desire their portion on this
          side Jordan, and on that condition would quit their part of Canaan;
          but the saints are for the heavenly Canaan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They look on this world only as the place of their pilgrimage, and
          themselves as strangers in it, who are not at home; as did the Old
          Testament saints, who "confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims
          on the earth;" Hebrews 11:13. Others carry themselves as the natives
          of it, they are sojourners in it, and travelers, who must take it in
          their way home to their Father's house. And they entertain a holy
          comparative contempt of it; as did the apostle; Galatians 6:14, "But
          God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
          Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. They are moving heavenward; Canticles 8:5," Who is this that comes
          up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?" They are not only
          moving thither, by the course of nature hastening to another world;
          but in heart and affection. Their treasure is there, and therefore
          their heart is there. They are pressing towards it; as did Paul,
          Philippians 3:14, "I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high
          calling of God in Christ Jesus:" so running as they may obtain it at
          length. And at the root of all their struggles and endeavors against
          sin, is a desire to be with Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. They walk like men of another world; Philippians 3:20, "For our
          conversation is in Heaven." So the church in the exercise of grace is
          described, Canticles 3:6, "Who is this that comes out of the
          wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and
          frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?" Our Lord Jesus after
          his resurrection from the dead, though he continued in the world, yet
          did not familiarly converse in it as before; so they who by faith have
          received a new life, alter their course, conforming not to the world,
          but to the heavenly country.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Now faith makes them walk thus, as,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It views Christ in his transcendent glory and excellency, in the
          glass of the word of the gospel; 1 Peter 2:7, "Unto you which believe
          he is precious." 2 Corinthians 3:18, "We all with open face, beholding
          as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image,
          from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." Christ seen
          in his glory, is an attracting object, and will make the soul follow,
          though it should swim through a sea of blood. So the martyrs made
          their way to him. See Hebrews 11:27, "By faith Moses forsook Egypt,
          not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who
          is invisible."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. As it takes up this world, and the heavenly country, in their true
          colors, as described in the word. In the Bible we have illuminated
          maps of both worlds; but they cannot be rightly discerned by sense,
          but by faith. And the eye of faith discerns,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The reality of the heavenly country; that cannot be perceived by
          sense, and therefore is treated by sensual men as a creature of
          imagination, and at best uncertain. Faith fixes on the testimony of
          God anent it, and therefore is persuaded of the reality thereof;
          believing it, though they cannot see it; Hebrews 11:1, 13, "Now faith
          is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
          These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having
          seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The preferableness of the heavenly country to this world; Psalm
          4:6, "There be many that say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift
          you up the light of your countenance upon us." Hebrews 11:13,
          forfeited. Faith sees a weight of glory there, that outweighs the
          smiles and frowns of the world here as light things. It sees a
          suitableness in these to the satisfaction of the soul, and an
          unsuitableness in the things of the world. It sees the one to be
          eternal, the other but temporary. Hence the one is followed eagerly,
          the other not so.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, They walk safely; Proverbs 1:33, "Whoever hearkens unto me,
          shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil." This world
          is Satan's walk, a wilderness where like a beast he ranges to and fro
          for his prey; and they that walk by sense, fall a prey to him, some
          caught in one trap, some in another. Only walking by faith we can be
          safe. For,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Faith keeps the eye on Christ as the great leader; Proverbs 3:5, 6,
          "Trust in the Lord with all your heart; and lean not unto your own
          understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct
          your paths." And following him we will be safe; for he is the leader
          appointed by the Father; hence he said of himself, John 8:12, "I am
          the light of the world; he who follows me shall not walk in darkness,
          but shall have the light of life." The believer closes his own eye of
          sense, and takes Christ to be eyes to him in the wilderness by his
          word and Spirit. And hence distrusting himself, and trusting Christ
          for conduct, he is led on safely, where others stick and are mired.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Faith keeps the eye on the word of command from Heaven, Psalm 17:4,
          discerning the authority of God stamped upon it, which makes the soul
          obey without disputing, Psalm 119:4, "You have commanded us to keep
          your precepts diligently." Faith's view of the authority of God
          stamped upon a duty, will counterbalance all the reasonings of sense
          against it, taken from the hardship of it, danger about it, etc. And
          thus says the Lord, will be sufficient to the soul in the case, though
          the whole world should say the contrary. And that is sure walking;
          Proverbs 10:9, "He who walks uprightly, walks surely; but he who
          perverts his ways, shall be known."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Faith trusts to the divine protection in the way of duty; Psalm
          91:2, "I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my fortress; my
          God, in him will I trust." Presumption is for trusting to the divine
          protection, in a way that God calls not the sinner to. See Matthew
          4:6, 7. In such a case there is not a promise, and so there is no
          foundation for that trust. But faith has a promise of protection for
          the soul in the way of duty, however dangerous; Isaiah 43:2, "When you
          pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers,
          they shall not overflow you; when you walk through the fire, you shall
          not be burnt; neither shall the flame kindle upon you." And this
          promise being believed, will be made good, Romans 9:33, "Whoever
          believes on him, shall not be ashamed." Psalm, 2:12, "Blessed are they
          that put their trust in him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, Faith brings always safe to the journey's end, whatever
          storms blow, or dangers are encountered by the way; Mark 16:16, "He
          who believes, shall be saved: but he who believes not, shall be
          damned." Hebrews 10:39, "But we are not of them that draw back unto
          perdition; but of them that believe, to the saving of the soul."
          Walking by sense will land people in destruction, but walking by faith
          will bring to the heavenly country at length." This lesson is taught
          for all ages, in the carcases of the unbelieving Israelites, falling
          in the wilderness; and in Caleb and Joshua who believed the promise,
          their inheriting Canaan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, They walk comfortably, as well as safely; hence we read, Acts
          9:31, of "the churches walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the
          comfort of the Holy Spirit." Worldly men may walk comfortably, but not
          safely; but there is a worm at the root of their comfort, as in
          Babylon's case; Revelation 18:7, "How much she has glorified herself,
          and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she
          says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no
          sorrow." Saints may walk mournfully and yet comfortably; 2 Corinthians
          5:4, 6, "For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened:
          not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality
          might be swallowed up of life. Therefore we are always confident,
          knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the
          Lord." It is certain they have much grief and sorrow that others want;
          yet they want not comfort, if they live by faith; hence said our Lord
          to his drooping disciples, John 14:18, "I will not leave you
          comfortless; I will come to you." As the running brook may make more
          noise than the deep river, so the comfort of the ungodly may be more
          noisy than that of the saints; and yet the former is but like the
          crackling of thorns under a pot, no ways comparable to the solid
          comfort of faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Faith brings in fresh springs of comfort, when the world's cisterns
          are all run dry; Psalm 119:49, 50, "Remember the word unto your
          servant, upon which you have caused me to hope. This is my comfort in
          my affliction; for your word has quickened me." The Bible will
          comfort, when worldly comfort fails. There faith looking to the
          promise, "I will be their God," will comfort under the greatest
          pressures of affliction; hence said the prophet, Habakkuk 3:17, 18,
          "Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in
          the vines, the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall
          yield no meat, the flock shall be out off from the fold, and there
          shall be no herd in the stalls; yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will
          joy in the God of my salvation." Sense can only run from one creature
          to another for comfort; but faith runs from the creatures to God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Faith will discover love in the heart of an angry God, smiting, and
          forsaking, and pursuing a quarrel against one; Psalm 22:1, "My God, my
          God, why have you forsaken me? why are you so far from helping me, and
          from the words of my roaring?" Psalm 42:7, 8, "Deep calls unto deep at
          the noise of your water-spouts; all your waves and your billows are
          gone over me. Yet the Lord will command his loving-kindness in the
          day-time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer
          unto the God of my life." When God hides his face, and shoots his
          arrows against the believer; faith will let him see some glimmerings
          of love in his face; hence said Job, chapter 13:15, though he slay me,
          yet will I trust in him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Faith assures the believer of the truth of God, when his
          dispensations of providence seem to run cross to his promises; this we
          have exemplified in Abraham's case; Romans 4:18–20, "Who against hope
          believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations;
          according to that which was spoken, so shall your seed be. And being
          not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he
          was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
          womb. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was
          strong in faith, giving glory to God." Hebrews 11:17–19, "By faith
          Abraham when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and he who had received
          the promises, offered up his only begotten son; of whom it was said,
          That in Isaac shall your seed be called. Accounting that God was able
          to raise him up, even from the dead: from whence also he received him
          in a figure."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Faith eases the soul of many burdens that make uncomfortable
          walking. It eases it of a burden of guilt; Romans 5:1, "Therefore
          being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord
          Jesus Christ." It eases it of strong corruption, "Acts 5:9, "Purifying
          their hearts by faith." It eases it of a burden of care and anxiety, 1
          Peter 5:7, "Casting all your care upon him, for he cares for you." And
          it eases it of the burdensomeness of duty, Philippians 4:13, "I can do
          all things through Christ which strengthens me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, Faith gives a fair prospect of safe landing in Immanuel's
          land, amidst all the storms that happen in the voyage; Psalm 23:4, 6,
          "Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
          fear no evil; for you are with me, your rod and your staff, they
          comfort me. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of
          my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. To confirm this doctrine, consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The Christian's life is by faith; Galatians 2:20, "I am crucified
          with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me;
          and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the
          Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." And his walk must
          also be by faith, Colossians 2:6, "As you have therefore received
          Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Thus the Christian's life is distinguished from that of the saints
          in Heaven, and that of the wicked, as he is in a middle state between
          the two.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Thus Christ himself, and all the saints have walked; and thus also
          must all walk that intend to get to the heavenly Canaan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Then they who do not direct men to a life of faith, and walking
          by faith, teach not true Christianity. Of which unhappy number are
          many of the teachers of this day, whose continual theme is morality
          and virtue, and pressing men to the observation of these as the
          conditions of their salvation, and the road to happiness; without any
          notice of Christ, and faith in him, as the spring of all holy walking.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. Know you, you walk not as Christians indeed, if you walk not by
          faith. If you walk by sight, sense, appearance of things, and your own
          carnal reason, you have but the name of Christians. Walk looking to
          unseen things; fixing your eyes on God and Christ, and the things of
          the other world. And thus evidence yourselves to be Christians indeed,
          by having your conversation in Heaven, and your eyes turned away from
          all the objects of sense.
