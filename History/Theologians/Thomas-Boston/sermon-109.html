          Numbers 14:24, "But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit
          with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land
          where he went, and his seed shall possess it."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THE Lord being provoked with the murmuring of the people, in
          consequence of the ill report of the land brought by the spies, though
          he did not destroy the people all at once; yet, justly displeased, he
          threatened to cut off the whole generation of murmurers, so that not
          one of them should come to Canaan. His anger at the rebels, however,
          did not make him forget his faithful servant Caleb, who had acted a
          totally different part from the rest of the spies, together with
          Joshua, who is not named here, because now he was not numbered with
          the people, being for the present the attendant of Moses, and
          afterwards his successor, as captain to lead the children of Israel
          into Canaan. This intimates to us, that God's own people may get
          special intimations of his love in a time when God is angry with the
          generation. However great the darkness may be, some select ones will
          always have a Goshen, a land of light to dwell in. Joys may be their
          portion, while God is distributing sorrows to others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There were twelve spies, all of them noblemen or gentlemen, heads of
          the children of Israel, Numbers 13:3. There were two, and but two of
          them, faithful to God and their country. Ten of them brought up an ill
          report of the land, dishonored God, and ruined both their countrymen
          and themselves. They that are false to God, will never be true friends
          to their country. Hence we see, though not many noble are called, yet
          some are. Greatness and goodness met in Caleb.—Goodness, that he would
          not desert the cause of God, notwithstanding of all the ill company
          with which he was associated. They have little religion, that will not
          endure the shock of ill company, be they never so great.—In the text
          there is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Caleb's character.—More generally, God owned him as his servant.
          This honor God put upon him. It is an honor to the greatest to be
          God's servants; though the greater part will rather be the devil's
          slaves, and count that their honor. But blackness is beauty among
          black men.—More particularly, Caleb was a man of a truly gallant and
          generous spirit. His name signifies all heart, and his disposition
          corresponded with his name. He had another spirit than that of the
          world, another than his own, another than the rest of the spies. He
          possessed a spirit from Heaven, calculated for the work to which he
          was appointed; and that Spirit inspired him with courage, with
          undaunted resolution, while the rest were misled by a base, mean,
          sneaking spirit. He was truly courageous in his actions; his other
          spirit made him behave himself otherwise than the rest. He followed
          the Lord fully; he walked with the Lord, kept close by his duty, in
          opposition to all difficulties and discouragements. He was not afraid
          of the Anakim, nor did his undaunted heart shrink at the sight of
          their high walls. He knew that towns, walls, armies, and giants, must
          fall before the Lord, when his promise was engaged for it. His
          companions deserted and contradicted him in his good report. The
          people threatened him with stoning, but he was all heart, would not
          yield, but followed the Lord fully. (Hebrew, fulfilled after the
          Lord.) Whatever way the Lord led, he followed.—In the text there is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The gracious recompense which God promised to his steadiness and
          faithfulness; that is, the possession of that good land, while the
          carcases of the rest fell. Piety is the best policy. They who are
          careful of God's honor, he will see to their interest. Caleb was to
          fight for the land, but God says, I will bring him into it. The praise
          of the success of our endeavors is due to the Lord only; this promise
          secured his through-bearing over all difficulties.—From this subject,
          we may draw the following doctrines, which we shall attend to in their
          order, namely,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. I. That the honest servants of Jesus Christ must distinguish
          themselves from others, by following the Lord fully.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. II. That they who would follow the Lord fully must have
          another spirit, another than the spirit of the world, another than
          their own spirit naturally is.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. III. That those who, by following the Lord fully in the time
          of great declining, distinguish themselves from others, God will
          distinguish them, by special marks of favor in a time of great
          calamity.—The scripture affords many instances in proof of this, as
          Noah, Lot, Jeremiah, &amp;c.—We begin with
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. I. That the honest servants of Jesus Christ must distinguish
          themselves from others, by following the Lord fully.—For illustrating
          this doctrine, it is intended,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. To show what it is to follow the Lord fully.</p>
        <p align="justify">II. To give the reasons of the point. And then,</p>
        <p align="justify">III. To improve the subject.—We are then,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. To show what it is to follow the Lord fully.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is to follow the Lord only as our great guide and leader;
          Hebrews 12:2, "Let us run the race set before us, looking unto Jesus,
          the author and finisher of our faith." They that follow not the Lord
          only, do not follow him fully: Hosea 10:2, "Their heart is divided."
          Their heart was going, one part after the Lord, another after their
          idols. He must have the whole man. Now, this implies two things,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The soul's ceasing to follow all others who do not lead in
          subordination, but in contradiction to him. We have eaten our
          gospel-Passover, and must now set forward on our journey. We stand as
          in a place where two ways meet, and at the entrance to these ways
          there are false guides, who cry, Follow us; the Lord says, as in Song
          4:8, "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse."—We must not follow false
          guides.—We must not follow our own spirits: Proverbs 28:26, "He who
          trusts in his own heart is a fool." Most men's spirits are quite
          blind: "You were sometimes darkness," Ephesians 5:8. The best of them
          are but in their spiritual childhood, not to be trusted to themselves,
          but standing in need of a governor. They are naturally biased guides,
          having a bent the wrong way. There are many snares which our spirits
          perceive not, until they are caught in them as a bird; they often
          grasp delusions instead of light; and men's thoughts in religion, not
          regulated by the word, prove as false lights on the sea, that occasion
          the ship's dashing on a rock. Let us look above us, rather than within
          us, for our way.—Again, we must not follow our own lusts: Romans 8:1,
          "Who walk not after the flesh." Lusts are followed by many unto their
          own perdition; when they lead, the devil drives, because they lead the
          highway from God. Wind and tide from Hell go with the stream of
          corrupt lusts, while the soul follows as an ox to the slaughter. Much
          of the spiritual warfare here lies in striving against this
          stream.—Neither must we follow the world; the world would have the
          leading of all, and it gets the leading of its own.—We must not follow
          the men of the world: 1 Corinthians 7:23, "You are bought with a
          price, be not you the servants of men." No man must be followed
          farther than he follows Christ. The dictates and commandments of men,
          be they ever so great, are no rule for conscience and practice: "To
          the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this
          word, it is because there is no light in them." It was the sin of
          Ephraim, Hosea 5:11, that "he willingly walked after the commandment."
          They have little faith, or truth either, that will pin their faith to
          the sleeve of any.—Farther, Follow not the course and way of the
          world: Romans 12:2, "Be not conformed to the world." To be
          neighbor-like is not the plain way to Heaven, but a plausible way to
          Hell, for the most part of people's neighbors are going the broad way.
          There will none seek to Heaven, but a peculiar people, a singular sort
          of persons, true separatists from the multitude, who must resolve to
          be men wondered at. They that will follow the multitude must perish
          with the multitude, and it will be cold comfort to us, that we go to
          Hell with a company.—Finally, Follow not the smiles of the world. If
          we will follow the Lord fully, we must lift our process, and leave off
          to make our court to a bewitching world, which treats its followers
          like the false irregular lights that are sometimes seen in the night,
          which pleases the eye of the traveler, but lead him off his way into
          some quagmire, obliging him to retire with shame and sorrow. How often
          does the world repay our love with frowns, and kills when it
          flatters.—This implies,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The soul's following the Lord in opposition to all these. The
          souls of men are ruined by an exchange of the living God for idols;
          Jeremiah 2:13, "For my people have committed two evils: they have
          forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out
          cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water." And their salvation
          is begun by an exchange of idols for the true God. The devil, the
          world, and the flesh, make many offers; God makes one, "I will be your
          God," which, in a day of power, downweighs all the offers of the world
          and of Hell. Hence, when the man is brought to follow the Lord fully,
          then farewell all others, and the Lord is welcome for all. There the
          eye of the soul is fixed. You may take this in three things—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [1.] The Lord points out to his people the place of eternal rest, a
          city where they may abide. This they follow after as their grand
          prospect in the world: Hebrews 11:14–16 "For they that say such
          things, declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they
          had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might
          have had opportunity to have returned: but now they desire a better
          country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be
          called their God; for he has prepared for them a city." There they
          must be, there they are resolved to be, cost what it will: Matthew
          11:12, "The kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take
          it by force." Their great question is, "What shall we do to be saved?"
          While others are following what is about them, they follow what is
          above them for their happiness; they will not have their portion in
          this world, nor can such small things satisfy them. They are inspired
          with holy ambition to have a place among them that stand before the
          throne of God and the Lamb. Their other spirit so ennobles them, as
          that they cannot rest in these little views, which the serpent's seed
          have before their eyes. It is a holy flame which natively ascends, and
          carries the soul upward: Philippians 3:20, "For our conversation is in
          Heaven, from whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus
          Christ."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [2.] The Lord points out the way leading to eternal rest; and they
          following the Lord fully, their heart follows him, making choice of
          it. He points out Christ the personal way, John 14:6. Then the soul
          that was knocking at, and working to win in at Adam's bolted door, the
          covenant of works, gives it over, and comes in by the door of the
          sheep, renouncing the way of the law, that old dead, killing way, and
          choosing to enter by the new and living way Hebrews 10:20. The Lord
          points to the real way of holiness, Isaiah 35:8. That way they choose:
          Psalm 119:30, "I have chosen the way of truth." This is their choice,
          that they may not be either among the faithless workers, or the idle,
          indolent believers, neither of whom follow the Lord fully. True, it is
          a difficult way; both the way of believing, and the way of holiness,
          lie up-hill, but they halt no more. Their feet follow him, walking in
          it. He sets them to the strait gate, and they enter on the narrow way,
          and they walk in it. Better a narrow way to Heaven, than a broad way
          to Hell. Their choice is followed with action, their purposes issue in
          sincere endeavors, and their resolutions are crowned with practice:
          Psalm 119:106, "I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep
          your righteous judgments." Like Naphtali, they give goodly words, and,
          like Joseph, are as a fruitful bough.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [3.] The Lord goes before them, and they follow his steps. He is
          glorious in holiness, and their design is to be like him, holy as he
          is holy. They labor to imitate him in his imitable perfections. They
          are "followers of God, as dear children." There is a likeness between
          a man and his God, and therefore the heathens, when they could not be
          like God in holiness, they made their gods like themselves in
          filthiness; and God, to show men how they should walk, sent his own
          Son in manhood, both to die for sinners, and also to leave them an
          example, that men might see with their eyes how God walked, and so
          learn how he would have them to walk. Thus we must write after his
          copy, 1 John 2:6, "He who says he abides in him, ought himself so to
          walk, even as he walked." And no less pattern do they propose to
          themselves who follow the Lord fully.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. To follow the Lord fully, is to follow him universally: Psalm
          119:6, "Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all your
          commandments." Whoever says he will come after me, they must follow me
          "in all things, in all times, in all places, with all their souls." No
          exceptions can be admitted in following the Lord: but as the
          resignation at first was absolute, if honest, so must the following
          be. This is to follow him fully, to fulfill all the will of God.—More
          particularly,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They that would follow the Lord fully, must follow the Spirit of the
          Lord, and not follow their own spirit. It is an ordinary character of
          a Christian in Paul's epistles, that he walks after the Spirit. It is
          the work of the Spirit to bring in light, to discover sin and duty; we
          must entertain it, and comply with it, we must answer the call: Psalm
          27:8, "When you said, Seek you my face, my heart said unto you, Your
          face, Lord, will I seek." To incline and fit the soul for following,
          we must beware of quenching the Spirit, but rather, when the wind
          blows, spread out our sails, that they may be filled by it. We must be
          spiritual in our hearts, lips, and lives.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They must follow the word of the Lord, Psalm 119:30. The Lord's
          written word is the Christian's directory for Heaven, the compass by
          which he is guided on the sea of this world, and by which he is to
          steer his course. It is the map of the country to which, and through
          which, he is traveling. Thence must he take his waymarks. What the
          Bible says, should seldom be out of the Christian's heart. Those who
          study the Bible, have the advantage above all others, they get their
          directors away to Heaven with them. "It is written," will be enough to
          them that follow the Lord fully. They will make the word of the Lord
          overcome their prejudices. Isaiah 11:6, "The wolf shall dwell with the
          lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid: and the calf, and
          the young lion, and the fattling together: and a little child shall
          lead them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They must follow the providential will of the Lord: "Your will be done
          in earth, as it is in Heaven." If we have said, I am the Lord's, then
          we must have said, Our will is the Lord's. It remains that our will
          should follow the Lord's, as the shadow does the body. If it be God's
          will that we should be poor, sick, crossed, &amp;c., that should also
          be our will; if not, we do not follow the Lord fully. It is a sad
          matter we should give up ourselves to be servants, and yet still aim
          at being masters, to cut and carve for ourselves. There will be a
          crook in every lot of ours under the sun. Ecclesiastes 1:15, "That
          which is crooked cannot be made straight." That which is crooked, in
          respect of our will, is straight enough with God's, which is the true
          rule, so that if we follow the Lord fully, our will should be bended
          to the crook, and not the crook straightened to our will.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, we must follow the cause and interest of the Lord in the world.
          There is always war in the Heaven of the church, between Michael and
          the dragon, though it does not always come to blood. The armies are
          always in the field, though they are not always actually engaged in a
          furious battle. You must be on the Lord's side, whether it be the
          highest, or the lowest in the world. There is no lying neutral here;
          if we be not for God and his cause, then we are against him. This is a
          day wherein the enemy has displayed his banners; and we also have a
          banner to be displayed because of truth: "Who is on the Lord's
          side?—Who?" It is time God's people were taking courage to them, and
          cleaving to the Lord, his way and work, in this covenanted laud, in
          spite of all opposition.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the next place, we must follow the ordinances and institutions of
          the Lord, that doctrine, worship, discipline, and government, which
          has the Lord's stamp on it, the preaching of his word, and the
          sacraments, etc. It is lamentable to think how that spirit is gone,
          which some time ago was among people, for following the ordinances of
          the Lord. We are even glutted and surfeited with them. Opportunities
          of communion with God are undervalued. People will deprive themselves
          of them, from reasons which, if they were to lose a sixpence by, they
          would quickly come over. It was the commendation of the Levites, and
          godly people through the ten tribes in Jeroboam's time, that "they
          followed the ordinances of the Lord." All these came to Jerusalem, to
          sacrifice to the Lord God of their fathers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must also follow the worship of the Lord.—The secret worship of the
          Lord by ourselves alone: Matthew 6:6, "But you, when you pray, enter
          into your closet, and when you have shut your door, pray to your
          Father, which is in secret; and your Father which sees in secret,
          shall reward you openly." Secret prayer is a duty which they who are
          exercised unto godliness cannot live without, a duty in which
          communion with God is as readily to be had as in any other: and though
          there may be prayers in your family, yet, if you know your duty, you
          will also pray in your closet.—Family prayer: "Pour out," says the
          prophet, "your fury upon the heathen, and upon the families that call
          not upon your name." What do prayerless families but expose themselves
          to the wrath of God? Every house should be a church. We receive family
          mercies, and are chargeable with many family sins; why not then family
          worship? And do they follow the Lord fully that have their family
          worship? They will worship God at night, but not in the morning.
          Complain not of want of time, others in your circumstances get time
          when they have a heart to it.—Next, internal worship, without which
          all your external worship will be to no purpose. There is no following
          of the Lord fully, if that be wanting: Philippians 3:3, "We are the
          circumcision, that worship God in the spirit;" that is, in the
          exercise of grace with external worship; fear, reverence, faith, hope,
          love, and other holy affections, which are the life and soul of
          worship.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, they must follow the Lord so as that one thing be not
          wanting: Mark 10:21, "One thing you lack." There is one thing usually
          that is the great thing which stands between every one and Heaven: it
          is as it were the Shibboleth they cannot frame to pronounce. They can
          comply with any duty, part with every sin, bear any cross, but such a
          duty, such a sin, such a cross. And therein they say, as Naaman, 2
          Kings 5:18, "In this thing the Lord pardon your servant. When I bow
          down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon your servant in
          this thing." But this is not to follow the Lord fully. People must
          either come over that also, or they cannot prove their sincerity. The
          only course to take here is that in Matthew 5:29, 30, "And if your
          right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you; for it is
          profitable for you, that one of your members should perish, and not
          that your whole body should be cast into Hell. And if your right hand
          offend you, cut it off, and cast it from you." Herein lies the great
          evidence of sincerity; and the victory over predominant lusts is like
          that over the Anakim, which will cost many a severe struggle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. To follow the Lord fully, is to follow him uprightly. A hypocrite
          does but walk in a vain show. His feet only, not his heart, do follow
          the Lord. God, who is the maker and the searcher of the heart, will
          never reckon himself followed fully in a carcass of duties; but
          notices the manner, motive, principle, and end of actions, which, if
          they be not right, all is wrong.—Then, to follow the Lord fully, is to
          follow him honestly in respect of our principle, not with a carnal
          selfish principle, which can only set us agoing, but with a spiritual,
          principle; not as a mercenary soldier follows his captain, but as a
          child follows his father: John 6:26, "You follow me," said Jesus, "not
          because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves,
          and were filled." There is a selfish religion, where self is the chief
          wheel that sets all a-going.—We must follow him singly, in respect of
          our end; following the Lord with a design and desire to please him,
          and not for carnal selfish ends. What is not done for the Lord, as the
          chief end, he will never reward. Want of singleness in the end, maims
          the action: as when a wife adorns herself to please an adulterer, her
          aim would make her action abominable.—We must follow the Lord
          evangelically, in respect of the manner; following the Lord, leaning
          on his, and not on our own strength. This is the life of faith in
          obedience, by which the soul goes out of itself to the Lord for all
          strength, saying, as in Psalm 71:16, "I will go in the strength of the
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. To follow the Lord fully, is to follow him constantly: John 8:31,
          "Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue
          in my word, then are you my disciples indeed." It is a small matter to
          begin well, but it is the continuing to follow the Lord which is true
          following of him. It is a following the Lord habitually and evenly, so
          that our souls are fixed on this as their ordinary bend. It is not to
          take up our religion by fits and starts. We must delight ourselves in
          the Lord, and call always upon our God. This must be our daily
          business, not our by-hand work. It was the fault of Rehoboam, 2
          Chronicles 12:14, "He did evil, because he prepared not his heart to
          seek the Lord." And it is the fault of many, that they are unstable as
          water in matters of religion; many people's religion is like a
          tree-leg, which they can lay by and put to as their convenience
          requires. We must follow the Lord, so as to end our journey without
          defection and apostasy: "Be you faithful unto death, and I will give
          you a crown of life." We must not follow the Lord as ordinary
          servants, who have their term day, at which they give up with their
          masters. But our course of obedience must have its perfect work; we
          must go through with the work of Christ to the end. Apostates are not
          fit for Heaven: "No man," said Jesus, "having put his hand to the
          plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of Heaven," Luke
          9:62. But fearful is their doom, if they apostatize: "If any man,"
          says God, "draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him," Hebrews
          10:38.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, it is to follow the Lord resolutely, as Ruth did Naomi, in
          opposition to all discouragements and impediments in the way. There is
          the river of the evil example of the world, but they must strive
          against the stream; there are corrupt strong lusts of the heart, but
          they must cut off right hands, and pluck out right eyes; and there is
          the cross that will be laid on their backs, which they must go through
          with, and not turn their backs on the Lord in a stormy day, but
          trample on all which they have in the world to follow the Lord. They
          must not be as those who go to sea for pleasure, but like hardy
          mariners, who ride out the storm.—We now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. To give the reasons of the point.</p>
        <p align="justify">Among others, we shall mention the following—</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because the change made in regeneration is a real change though not
          perfect. Believers are God's "workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
          unto good works." The new creature, from the time of its birth, is
          perfect in its parts, though not in degrees. There is something
          a-wanting in every part of the new man, but no part is altogether
          awanting. Each gracious person has all the graces of the Spirit,
          though some of them are more eminent than the rest, and are as
          top-branches. This cannot but produce a following the Lord in a gospel
          sense.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In closing with Christ there is a universal resignation. They give
          themselves up wholly to the Lord. No exception can be made, but the
          most difficult duty is undertaken, the dearest lust is given up with.
          It remains that people's sincerity in closing with Christ be evidenced
          by their walk, in an unlimited respect to all his commandments, in
          following the Lord wherever he goes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and
          truth, Ephesians 5:9. When there is not something of all goodness,
          there the Spirit dwells not. Where the garden is only watered by man's
          hands, there some plants thrive, others go back for lack of moisture;
          but where the shower comes from Heaven, it brings all forward
          together. So where there is an artificial religion taken up by men,
          there may be some partial or external appearance of good fruits: but
          where the Spirit is at work in the soul, real goodness, and
          righteousness, and truth, will at once be brought forth in the life
          and practice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. True mortification is universal. Where death comes, it takes the
          life out of the whole body, the soul departs from every part. So,
          Galatians 5:24, "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with
          the affections and lusts." Sin keeps its dominion by one lust, as well
          as by many: therefore where any lust remains unsubdued, there is no
          genuine mortification there. But where genuine mortification to sin
          is, the soul will follow the Lord fully.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Hypocrites may follow the Lord, but none can fully follow him, but
          those that are sincere. Judas may be in Christ's company, but the bag
          was always dearer to him than his master. Demas, because he loved the
          present world, apostatized; so that, unless we follow the Lord fully,
          we go not beyond the line of hypocrites.—I now go on,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. To make some improvement.—And this,</p>
        <p align="justify">1. In an use of warning.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          This may serve to warn one and all of us, to take heed to our ways,
          and examine well our walk, whether we follow the Lord fully or not.
          Much depends upon it. None follow the Lord fully in a strict sense,
          while out of Heaven, but all honest Christians follow him in a gospel
          sense. Therefore you may well suspect your states, if you do not
          follow the Lord fully. This may strike a damp upon the spirits,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Of the mere gross sort of professors, whose religion appears
          plainly to be but half religion, who, even in the externals of
          religion, take some parts, and leave others which they know to be
          duty; like these, Zephaniah 1:5, "who worship the host of Heaven upon
          the housetops, and that swear by the Lord, and that swear by Malcham;"
          that will sometimes be praying, and sometimes cursing, taking parts of
          religion only here and there.—It may strike a damp on the spirits,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Of the more cleanly sort of professors, who go a great length,
          only lack one thing. There is one thing that is the great make-bate
          between God and them; and they go through all the rest of religion,
          but there they are mired, there they stick. That is the great gulf
          fixed between Heaven and them, through which they can by no means
          pass. But pass it we must, or we follow not the Lord fully. Some do
          not see it, then it is the more dangerous; but seen it must be, and
          also overcome, or men may bid farewell to Heaven: Revelation 3:21, "To
          him that overcomes, will I grant to sit with me on my throne, even as
          I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his throne."—Here
          some may state an
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION, If following the Lord fully take in all these things, who
          does it? In
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER, These follow the Lord fully in a gospel sense, who,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Observe the Lord daily, and bear up after him in every step, yet,
          like the weak child following its mother, their eye follows him, their
          desire goes out after him, they would be at him, and with him,
          wherever he goes.—This implies two things.—(1.) Their observing all
          the prints of his feet, they love all his footsteps, they love all the
          duties of religion for his sake, and desire to perform all his
          commandments: Psalm 119:5, "O that my ways were directed to keep your
          statutes!" Their heart is in some measure reconciled to every known
          duty, and at variance with every known sin. The spirit is willing,
          though the flesh be weak. Some sins lie nearer their hearts than
          others; some are as right eyes, others only but as left toes; but 0! a
          right eye plucked out is good in their sight, the contrary grace is
          beautiful and glorious, and the desire of their souls: Romans 7:12,
          "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and
          good,"—(2.) Their observing himself as the center of all their
          desires. All goodness, holiness, and perfection, center in him. That
          which is scattered here and there in his word, ordinances, and people,
          they take a view of, as concentered in himself, and be see in him at
          one view the whole of what they should be; they are pleased with it,
          and sincerely desire to be like him.—These follow the Lord fully,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Who aim after the Lord fully; though they cannot follow him
          precisely in every point, they aim at, they endeavor it, as the child
          following its mother, weeping, and making what way it can after her.
          This implies two things.—(1.) They aim at the performance of all
          duties, and warring against every sin. They do not give goodly words,
          and so fold their hands together, wishing they were better; but they
          even put their hands to roll up the stone, which yet perhaps may come
          down and down, over and over again, upon them. They aim at being holy
          in all manner of conversation, 1 Peter 1:15. Grace infuses a principle
          in the heart, that turns the man towards everything to which God
          calls.—(2.) They aim at the all of every duty, to get it right as to
          the manner, as well as to the matter: Philippians 3:3, "They worship
          God in the spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in
          the flesh."—I come now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">2. To an use of exhortation.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I exhort you to distinguish yourselves from others, by your following
          the Lord fully. Sirs! have you a desire for Heaven or not? If you have
          no desire, you may sit still at ease, time will carry you down the
          stream to an eternity of woe! If you have a desire for Heaven, then
          up, follow the Lord, follow him fully. Set your affections that way.
          You follow duties; that is not enough, follow the Lord in these fully,
          or you will never see Heaven. I hope you are not for bidding farewell
          to, and taking your last sight of Heaven. If then you be in earnest to
          get to Heaven, set yourselves to follow the Lord fully. Before I press
          this upon you by motives, I exhort you to take a solemn, grave, and
          serious consideration of what is lacking in your conversation, that
          you may fill it up by following the Lord. We must see our defects
          before we can fill them up. To assist you in this, consider what is
          wanting,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) In your mortification of sin, what right eye remains to be
          plucked out, lest there may be someone leak or other that may sink the
          ship: Psalm 66:18, "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will
          not hear me." Self-love prevails much, and hence beloved lusts find
          harbor, and escape the axe.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) What is wanting as to your compliance with known duties, whether
          you make conscience of all you know or not. Do you find that you pray,
          but do not meditate nor examine yourselves? then fill up that want. Do
          you pray, but neglect to watch? then fill up this want also; and so
          on.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) What is wanting in the duties you perform? For many times these
          are but the half of duties, the outward part only, wanting that faith,
          love, zeal, and liveliness, that should be in all our
          duties.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) What is wanting in your bearing the cross. Every one has his
          daily cross. Consider how you bear it, with what meekness and patience
          you walk under it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) Consider what is wanting in your graces, if you have any; and
          unto what you have you should be still adding: 2 Peter 1:5, "Add to
          your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge temperance, and
          to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness
          brotherly love and charity."—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (6.) What is wanting in your relative conversation. A man is really
          what he is relatively. Consider how you Answer the duties of a
          husband, wife, parent, child, master, or servant.—Having carefully
          observed all these wants and defects, be conscientious in filling them
          up; follow the Lord only, universally, uprightly, constantly, and
          resolutely. Follow him fully.—To constrain you to this, I would
          mention the following motives—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. All is full which is set before you in the way of following the
          Lord. God deals not by halves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) We have a full law for our rule to walk by: Psalm 119:96, "Your
          commandment is exceeding broad." It is extended to all the parts of
          our walk; it reaches heart, lip, and life; requires not only duty to
          be done, but done aright. And unless we have respect to all God's
          commandments, our obedience is not acceptable.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) We have a full word for our light in our walk, by which we may
          take up what is sin, and what is duty, see how to steer our course in
          times of the greatest darkness: Psalm 119:105, "Your word is a lamp
          unto my feet, and a light unto my path." It is the star that is given
          to guide us through this world, and we should be much conversant with
          it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) We have a full covenant for provision in our way. It is an
          everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure," 2 Samuel 23:5.
          Whatever be our case, there is suitable provision in the covenant for
          it. There are in it precious promises to the saints in all conditions
          of life. Whatever storms and tempests may blow in the world, the
          saints may find something in the covenant to shelter them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) We have a full Christ to loan to. He is mighty to save. In him
          there is both righteousness and strength.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) There is a full weight of glory for reward; such as will fill
          soul and body even those of the most enlarged capacities. Shall we not
          then follow him fully?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The Lord Christ, our leader, did not do the work of our salvation
          by halves, but fully. He obeyed the law fully, none of its
          commandments wanted their full due of him, He suffered and paid the
          debt fully, its threats and curses fell on him in full measure. And
          what would have become of us, if Christ had halved the work of our
          salvation? Who would have done the rest? Who would have satisfied for
          any of our sins, or made up for any deficiencies in our services?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Our not following the Lord fully, makes the following him in any
          instance so difficult; and to follow him fully would be the high way
          to make religion easy. When the Christian has one foot fixed to the
          earth, it is no wonder than that he with difficulty mount upward. One
          lust unmortified is enough to mar all our duties, and make our
          progress in religion very irregular, and therefore difficult; whereas
          it would be a great ease if all came away together, Luke 9:59.
        </p>

          4. If we do not follow him fully, we will lose the reward of following
          him at all, in respect of eternal salvation, 2 John 8. Look to
          yourselves, that we lose not these things which we have wrought, but
          that we receive a full reward: otherwise we will lose all the pains we
          have been at in religion. That in which we follow him not, will draw a
          black stroke through all in which we have followed him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Another motive is, if we follow him not fully, we will share
          with them that have not followed him at all, in a fullness of wrath:
          Psalm 125:5, "As for such as turn aside onto their crooked ways, the
          Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity." God will
          fill them with the wine of his wrath. He will "cut them in sunder, and
          appoint them their portion with unbelievers," Luke 12:46, as those who
          divided themselves between the Lord and their own lusts.

        <p align="justify">I NOW proceed to the consideration of:</p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. II. That they who would follow the Lord fully, must have
          another spirit; another than the spirit of the world, another than
          their own spirit naturally is.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In attending to which, I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. Shortly point out, that it is another spirit.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Show what that spirit is, which they who follow the Lord fully
          have, and must possess.—Illustrating, at the same time, the nature and
          necessity of such a spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Make some practical improvement.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I am shortly to point out, that it is another spirit which such
          possess.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This other spirit, which is so necessary to following the Lord fully,
          is understood, either of the Holy Spirit of God, who dwells in all the
          saints, Romans 8:9, or rather of a spirit sanctified by the Holy
          Spirit, and raised above its natural spirit by the power of grace.
          Thus it seems here to be understood, though both amount to the same
          thing. Such a spirit may well be called another spirit. For,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is another spirit than that which the world is possessed of,
          which is a mean and base spirit, influencing them to grovel on this
          earth. The world has what it calls a fine spirit. But even that does
          but grasp at shadows, while the most excellent things are out of its
          view. Bat this is a spirit truly noble.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is another spirit than the most refined hypocrites have. By the
          common operations of the Spirit, the spirit of hypocrites may be
          raised to act more nobly than before, but these change not the nature
          of a man's spirit, but only help it to act in a natural way to a
          better purpose; whereas this spirit raises it to gracious actings.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is another spirit than what the saints had before they were
          sanctified. Another, not in substance, but in qualities. How does this
          other spirit make a man differ from himself? How does it advance him
          to a higher sphere? It made a preaching Paul of a persecuting Saul. It
          endows a man with quite new principles, motions, ends, and aims, and
          elevates him to new measures for attaining the same.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I go on to show what that other spirit is which these who follow
          the Lord fully have and must possess.—Illustrating, at the same time,
          its nature and necessity.—This spirit is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A noble elevated spirit, aiming at high things, and is not
          satisfied with these with which the common herd of mankind are
          satisfied. Thus Caleb aimed at Canaan, Numbers 13:30, while the rest
          were for Egypt again, chapter 14:4. Such another spirit have the
          saints, Philippians 3:14, "They press forward toward the mark, for the
          prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." Were a beggar's
          child adopted by a prince, he would change his spirit with his lot,
          and aim at things suitable to his new quality. Thus the children of
          God rise in their aims and designs, will not be content with the
          creatures, but with God himself; not with earth, but Heaven, not the
          favor of men, but of God, not with gold, but grace; for they have
          another spirit, which can be content with nothing less. They have high
          projects, not bounded within the limits of this narrow world, but
          aiming at a greater conquest. Now, such a spirit they must have that
          would follow the Lord fully.—For, if less can satisfy, they will be
          content to take their portion on this side Jordan; they will exchange
          Heaven for earth, and keep their grand prospect within the bounds of
          this world: Philippians 3:19, "Their God is their belly, and they mind
          earthly things;" and so will never follow the Lord fully, nay, they
          will leave him where they cannot get their carnal interest along with
          them, as Demas did.—Again, if they have not such a spirit, they will
          continue creeping on the earth, to get their food, as the beasts among
          their feet, and never follow the Lord in the way to true happiness.
          They will fall down before these three that are in the world: "The
          lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life," 1 John
          2:16. They will wrap themselves up in the world's profits, or drench
          themselves in its pleasures, and, like beggars, take care of their
          cottages, having no eye to a palace. Finally, if they have not such a
          spirit, they will never use means and endeavors suitable to such high
          aims. Noble spirits will proportion their endeavors to their high
          designs, while the mean spirit will go heartlessly about them. Gold is
          not got, like stones, beside every brook; nor is grace and glory got,
          but in the way of hearty exertions: Proverbs 2:3–5, "Yes, if you cry
          after knowledge, and lift up your voice for understanding, if you Seek
          for her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures, then
          shall you understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of
          God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a spirit of faith, as the apostle speaks, 2 Corinthians 4:13,
          "We having the same spirit of faith." Such a spirit had Caleb, another
          than that of the rest, who could not enter because of unbelief. Such
          another spirit have the saints, while the rest of the world remain
          under the power of unbelief, and if they had it not, could never
          follow the Lord fully; for unbelief will soon trip up a man's heels in
          following the Lord: Hebrews 3:12, "Take heed, brethren, lest there be
          in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living
          God." Now, Caleb's other spirit of faith thus discovered itself
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) It took part with the promise, and hung by it, while the
          unbelieving spirits of the rest sided with sense in opposition to it.
          Thus, while the unbelieving world, whatever they pretend, do never
          solidly venture their happiness on the promise, but seek it rather
          among those things which are the objects of sense—the saints have
          another spirit, which rejects these, and by faith rolls the weight of
          its eternal happiness on the promise; which spirit of faith realizes
          to them the things which are not seen, Hebrews 11:1, affords a view of
          them, as matters of the greatest realities, and of the word of promise
          as sufficient security. Without this, none will ever follow the Lord
          fully;—for, if that which is held out in the promise be not realized
          unto men, it will never make sensible things, the reality of which men
          certainly know, to yield and give place to it; for men will not quit
          certainty for hope. Were men as much persuaded of the reality of the
          things contained in the promise, as they are of gold, and other metals
          in the earth, think you they would slight the promise and take up with
          the objects of their senses as their happiness? No. The truth is, all
          the glorious promises are to the world but fair words about
          fancies.—Again, if men cannot trust the promise as sufficient
          security, they will never venture their all upon it, but our all must
          be ventured upon it if we follow the Lord fully: 2 Samuel 23:5, "This
          is all my salvation, and all my desire." We must glorify him by faith,
          hanging by his bare word. All for another world must be laid upon it,
          and often it comes to this, that all for this world must also be laid
          upon it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) This spirit of faith took up the land of promise, as a land well
          worth all the pains, toil, and hardships, which the conquering it
          would incur: Numbers 14:7, "It is an exceeding good land." Thus, while
          unbelievers cannot see Heaven worth the pains and toil that must be at
          the work, like the false spies, chapter 13:32, "they bring up an evil
          report of it." But the saints have another spirit of faith, which
          makes them see the glory of that land to be such as to deserve their
          utmost efforts and endeavors. "Let us therefore labor," say they,
          Hebrews 4:11, "to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the
          same example of unbelief." Now, without such a spirit, men can never
          follow the Lord fully; because to work for nothing makes us extremely
          averse to engage. If the recompense of reward be not seen as
          sufficient to counterbalance all the pains, persons will never strive
          to enter into God's rest, nor take Heaven by force, Hebrews 11:26.
          Whence do we see, that men will strain every nerve for a little of the
          world, which they think worth the pains, who will not bow a knee to
          God for Heaven? They will work eagerly, who pray very heavily and
          carelessly, because they think the one worth their pains, the other
          not.—Again, men are naturally very averse to spiritual endeavors, and
          if they see not something that will provoke the sluggard to run, they
          will not follow the Lord fully. There must be a glory seen by an eye
          of faith, to overcome this aversion. Thus Christ proposed the treasure
          to the man, Mark 10:21, but he saw it not, therefore he went
          away.—Farther, no man can reach Heaven with ease, the way to it lies
          up-hill. It will cost striving, wrestling, using violence, and the
          like. There are right eyes to be plucked out, that is hard; there are
          giant-like lusts to be mortified, who will adventure upon that? there
          is a combat, a fight to be maintained, in which the person must be a
          conqueror. Will ever men, then, follow the Lord fully, without such a
          spirit as by faith discerns Heaven as worth all that pains? Most men
          see it not: they think less may serve, for they want that other
          spirit, which accounts nothing too much here; and so, with Judas, they
          say, Why all this waste?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) This faith penetrates through all the difficulties which the
          unfaithful spies could not see through. Caleb's other spirit took the
          glass of the word of promise, and saw thereby how their numerous
          armies might be beaten, their high walls thrown down, the Anakim laid
          as low as ever they were high: Numbers 14:9, "Only rebel you not
          against the Lord, neither fear you the people of the land, for they
          are bread for us; their defense is departed from them, and the Lord is
          with us; fear them not." Such another spirit have all the saints in a
          greater or less measure. The carnal professor, like the sluggard,
          cries," There is a lion in the way, I shall be slain in the streets."
          There is no meddling with such a duty, no mortifying such a lust; thus
          he gives over the attempt. But the saints have another spirit, which
          by faith discovers how impossibilities may be surmounted, how hills
          may be made to skip like lambs: and therefore falls a-blowing his
          ram's horns, in hopes that the walls of Jericho shall fall down; and,
          like another David, with his sling, he sets upon Goliath, and attacks
          even the children of Anak. I do not say but this faith sometimes may
          be very weak, it may be very low; but it is such as makes them venture
          on duty and difficulty, though trembling. Now, without such a spirit
          none will follow the Lord full.—For the want of it cuts the sinews of
          resolute endeavors after universal holiness. It is the hope of victory
          that makes the soldier to fight; and when he loses, he turns his back:
          1 Thessalonians 5:8, "But let us, who are of the day, be sober,
          putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for an helmet the
          hope of salvation." Faith must go before and see through difficulties,
          before a person can come up and break through them.—Again, the want of
          it makes men, like Issachar, to couch under the burden, or as one who
          is upon an unruly horse, and finding there is no mastering of him, he
          lays the reins on his neck. This is the reason why people, after some
          struggle against sin, turn worse than ever. They find difficulties in
          the way of duty, they have no hope to surmount these, and therefore
          give it over. But how can any reach the promised land, without the
          promise in their eye? How shall they go through in the spiritual
          battle, while they throw away the sword of the Spirit, the Word of
          God, the word of promise, and leave themselves destitute of the shield
          of faith? Without this they cannot go out in the name of the Lord
          against their enemies, and so must turn their back as foiled.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) Caleb's spirit of faith looked to the Lord, as sufficient to bear
          him over all difficulties. He saw the Anakim as well as the rest, and
          had as little confidence in himself as they had; but he had confidence
          in the Lord, and so would go against them in the strength of the Lord.
          Such a spirit have all the saints: Psalm 71:16, "I will go in the
          strength of the Lord." Isaiah 45:24, "Surely shall one say, In the
          Lord have I righteousness and strength." This carries them to the Lord
          as the fountain of strength; while as to the rest of the world, their
          spirit is as a pipe laid short of the fountain, by which no water can
          be conveyed. Without such a spirit, none can follow the Lord
          fully.—For, there are difficulties in the way to Heaven, which none
          can overcome, but by divine strength: 2 Corinthians 12:9, "My grace is
          sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness."
          Unmortified corruptions will be as heavy as a giant upon a child,
          until God himself take part with the soul, and give the victory. They
          may lie under them and groan, but who shall roll away the stone, if
          the angel come not from Heaven for that purpose? Wo to him that is
          alone when he falls! without the Lord, the least work of religion is
          above us. "Without me," says he, John 15:5, "you can do nothing." The
          slenderest temptation will be found a wind from Hell sufficient to
          blow over the man that is not supported; the least duty, a task which
          they cannot perform acceptably. Where the Spirit of the Lord does not
          draw, we never will follow. Thus that spirit of dependence upon the
          Lord is necessary.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. This spirit is a spirit of holy courage and resolution, Numbers
          14:9. Such a spirit, in some measure, have all the saints: Proverbs
          28:1, "The wicked flee when no man pursues, but the righteous is bold
          as a lion." Their spirit is peremptory and resolute for following the
          Lord wherever he goes, not to be diverted by any means from their
          great interest. And though the godly may be naturally fearful and
          unsteady, yet this spirit in the things of God will prevail, seeing
          that their all lies at the stake; without such a spirit, none can
          follow the Lord fully, for the following, among other
          reasons.—Because,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The work of religion is a great work, for which we had need of
          courage and resolution. The outward work of religion is great work,
          the inward work is still greater: Prov 16:32, "He who is slow to anger
          is better than the mighty: and he who rules his spirit, than he who
          takes a city." The labor of the hand is hard, the labor of the head is
          harder, but the labor of the heart hardest of all; and religion is
          work of that sort. To work out our own salvation, to serve our
          generation, to get heart, lip, and life cleansed, is work sufficient
          to fear cowards who have not another spirit.—Again, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) That our own strength is small. O how weak is man at best for the
          work! What a vast disproportion there is between our strength and the
          least duty, if done aright! 2 Corinthians 3:5, "Not that we are
          sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our
          sufficiency is of God." When we view our work, how far it is above us,
          we may say, "Who is sufficient for these things?" 2 Corinthians 2:16.
          Here is need of another spirit to influence men, in attempting to roll
          away the stone, that is so far above their strength. But holy courage,
          through faith in Christ, will do it: Phil 4:13, "I can do all things
          through Christ that strengthens me."—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) That our opposition is great. If you have a desire for the
          heavenly Canaan, you must fight your way thither over much opposition,
          and so have need of another spirit. He who overcomes shall be crowned.
          If you have a desire to follow the Lord fully, you must follow him
          over much opposition.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. From the devil: Ephesians 6:12, "For we wrestle not against flesh
          and blood, but against principalities and powers, against spiritual
          wickednesses in high places." No sooner was man set up in the world,
          than the devil attacked and overcame him: and as soon as a soul begins
          to set heaven-ward again, the devil then will be on his top. O it is
          much to stand, when Hell is in arms against us, when the black bands
          of temptations make an attack! Satan is a powerful and subtle enemy.
          He will be sure to attack you on your weak side, and suit his
          temptations to your circumstances. Thus he did with our Savior; for
          when he had fasted forty days, the devil said to him, If you be the
          Son of God, command that these stones may be made bread," Matthew 4:3.
          He has his temptations for the poor and for the rich. He tempts the
          poor to steal, and the rich to deny God. Hence said Agar, "Give me
          neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me; lest
          I be full, and deny you, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor,
          and steal, and take the name of my God in vain," Proverbs 30:8, 9. He
          has temptations for youth and for age, for the joyful and for the
          mournful Christian. Sometimes he appears as a fox transforming himself
          into a lamb. Sometimes he roars as a lion. There is thus need of a
          spirit of courage to oppose him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">2. We have great opposition from the world.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) From the things of the world. They collect their bands to
          encounter those who would follow the Lord, to turn them back.—There is
          the white band of the world's smiles, stained already with the blood
          of thousands. Many have been wounded, and many slain by these:
          Proverbs 1:32, "For the turning away of the simple shall slay them,
          and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them." Many a soul has died
          by the embraces of a smiling world, for it does with men as the
          panther with other beasts, who draws them after him with the sweet
          smell of his breath, hiding his head, while he afterwards devours
          them. Its profits and pleasures are syren songs, which end in bitter
          lamentations. They are silken cords, which afterwards grow as iron
          fetters, which may cost a flood of tears to get them off. Here is a
          trial for true courage of spirit. O it is a great spirit that rises
          above the world when it courts us! while our own spirit naturally
          loves it, even when it gives us gall to drink.—There is next the black
          band of the world's frowns. The world often puts on the lion's skin,
          and brings a train of crosses against the followers of the Lord: Acts
          14:22, "We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of
          God." The world often turns stepmother to the godly, who may have
          enough ado to get their bread, while plenty flows to its own darlings.
          We see how the world's sun went down at noon with Job. There is need
          of another spirit to carry a man above these, to give him another joy
          when that of the world fails, and to make him sing as the nightingale
          when the very storm is at his back. Thus did Habakkuk when the world
          failed: chapter 3:18, "Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the
          God of my salvation." Again, there is the mixed band of the world's
          cares. These are the world's thorn-hedge, which the Christian must
          break through, or else they will choke the seed of the word in his
          heart, Matthew 13:22. This is the thorny crown it sets upon our heads
          so soon as we set out into the world. How hard is it to keep our
          ground here! The care of a family, the care of the body, is that which
          has rendered many careless of eternity. Yes, and care we must: our
          meat will not be found among our feet, as that of the beasts, nor will
          it drop into our mouths without care. But O what need of another
          spirit to use these things as if we used them not! But,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) We have great opposition from the men of the world. The devil has
          his agents in the world, factors for Hell, that will give much ado to
          those who would follow the Lord fully. And people may lay their
          account to be attacked with their tongues. They are not for Heaven who
          cannot digest the mockings of a graceless generation; nor are they
          meet for it that will pass over their duty, only for the virulent
          reproaches they may meet with in their way. These sting severely, but
          there must be a resoluteness against them, to please God. Let a
          generation of embittered spirits say what they will; let Christians
          strive to have the testimony of God and their own conscience, which
          will be a secret support, condemn them who will.—They will attack them
          with their feet. The example of an unholy life: Matthew 18:7, "Woe
          unto the world, because of offences! for it must be that offences
          come; but woe to that man by whom the offence comes." The world lies
          in wickedness; it is hard to bear out against the stream of example
          set before us. To be righteous as Noah in his generation, to keep
          clean garments in Sardis, is not easy: Matthew 24:12, "Because
          iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." Example ruins
          many, who like sheep, when one gets into the water, the rest readily
          follow.—They will attack them with their hands. The bands of
          persecutors are sometimes bound up; the Lord seems now to be loosing
          them; and some are already finding the smart of that. And it is like
          it will not be so easy to follow the Lord as it has been for some time
          past. But they who will follow the Lord fully, must have another
          spirit, which may urge them on to lose all, rather than lose their
          soul by leaving off to follow the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, The Christian has great opposition from his own lusts. He
          will not only find a war without, but also a war within him: Galatians
          5:17, "For the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against
          the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other; so that you
          cannot do the things that you would." Our greatest enemies are within
          our own bosoms.—First, there is the general of this army, indwelling
          sin, the corrupt nature, the old man, flesh, called sin by way of
          eminence: Romans 6:12, "Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal
          body, that you should obey it in the lust thereof." The plague of the
          heart: 1 Kings 8:38. This is the cursed ground, bringing forth briars
          and thorns. There must be another spirit to draw this to the cross:
          Galatians 5:24, "And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh,
          with the affections and lusts."—Next, there is a swarm of hellish
          soldiers under him, particular lusts, as pride, covetousness, envy,
          malice, and the like, that dog the man wherever he goes, and will give
          him enough ado to resist: Romans 7:21, "I find then a law, that when I
          would do good, evil is present with me." If you ask their name, it may
          be Legion, for they are many: Titus 3:3, "Serving divers lusts and
          pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one
          another." All sins are radically even in the best Look through the
          world, and see what appears there; these swine, who are running on
          others, show that corruption which is within the whole. Who are their
          allies? These are the devil, John 8:44; the world, Titus 2:12. All the
          snares and temptations in the world are allied to someone or other
          lusts within us, that suits them as tinder to fire.—There is, their
          quarters, the heart. "Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,
          murders," etc; and the nearer to us, the more dangerous. The heart is
          as a common inn, so often thronged with these, that the master is kept
          out.—There is, their qualities. They are deceitful: Ephesians 4:22,
          "The old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts."
          Hurtful: 1 Timothy 6:9, "But they that will be rich, fall into
          temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts,
          which drown men in destruction and perdition."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. I now proceed to make some improvement of the subject.—And this,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">1. In the use of information.—From this we see,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The great spring of defection and apostasy from the good ways of
          the Lord. How is it that so many make such a bad account of religion?
          They have not another spirit. Many, at their first taking up of
          religion, have great vigor and briskness of spirit; but it is only
          like a blaze of straw, their oil fails, and their lamps go out. Such
          appearances denote only awakening, and not changing grace, which they
          have got; therefore it lasts not. There is no spring of grace in the
          soul, only some showers from the clouds, watering the old ground of
          their natural spirits, which is soon dried up. They who thus drink,
          shall soon thirst again, John 4:13; it decays by little and little, as
          the light after sunset, until it be quite dark. Again, because they
          have not another spirit, that frame of their souls is not fed by
          nourishment from Christ, as the sincere soul is, who receives out of
          the fullness of Christ. Hence, for want of nourishment, it dies, and
          they wither as branches cut off from the trunk, John 15:6. A branch
          newly out off from its stock, and engrafted into another, may keep a
          short time green; but if it do not take with the stock, it will
          wither. Now, they cannot take with the stock, because they have not
          another spirit: John 1:12, 13, "He came to his own, and his own
          received him not. But as many as received him to them gave he power to
          become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which
          were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
          of man, but of God." Farther, it is the newness of the thing, not the
          newness of their nature, that makes that stir among their affections.
          Hence, when they have a little accustomed themselves to religion, and
          the duties of it, the newness is gone, and so their delight is gone,
          their affections settle, for they have not another spirit, to which
          religion would be its element: John 5:35, "He was a burning and a
          shining light, and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his
          light." Hence old truths turn stale with many, and nothing relishes
          with them but some new thing. They are sprightly for a while, but at
          length their metal is gone, their hearts are deadened, their
          affections withered, and their consciences seared. Hence, a spirit of
          reigning sloth, which was only covered, not subdued, rises again, as
          weeds in the spring, which, though nipped with winter frosts, yet were
          not plucked up by the roots: Psalm 78:37, "For their heart was not
          right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant." They are
          awakened as with noise a little while, but, because they have not
          another spirit they fall asleep again.—Finally, hence a spirit of
          profanity succeeds in many: 2 Pet 2:22, "But it is happened unto them
          according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit
          again, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."
          Their lusts, which were forcibly restrained before, break out again
          with greater violence than ever. The devil returns with seven spirits
          worse than the first; and not being able to follow the Lord fully,
          they turn back with the greater violence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) This instructs us as to the great spring of a divided religion,
          where there is still one thing or more lacking, Mark 10:21. They have
          not another spirit: the old spirit may follow the Lord in many steps,
          but it will never carry a man through with it. There are difficulties
          in the way to Heaven, which it is impossible to pass without another
          spirit. These are such as,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a difficult step to advance into the heart and life of duties,
          spiritual worship, and the like. Bodily exercise is the farthest the
          old spirit can carry a man. A bird may as soon fly without wings, or a
          beast reason, as one that has not another spirit can worship God in
          spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Another difficult step is, to be denied to duties: Matthew 5:3,
          "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven."
          The old spirit is a selfish spirit, that does all from and for self.
          It knows not to strip itself of its own robes, spun out of its own
          affections, and to go naked to Christ for a covering. A man shall as
          soon rend out his own affections, pluck out his own heart, and east it
          from him, as one without another spirit will lay the stress of his
          salvation on Christ alone, counting as if he had done nothing, when he
          has done all he can.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A third difficult step is, to give up with bosom idols. Jesus laid the
          treasure in Heaven, on the other side, to that man, Mark 10:21, and
          directed him to step over his idols, and he should have it; but he was
          sad, and went away grieved, for he had great possessions. Fire, sword,
          and gibbet, will not affright some people from following the Lord, who
          will yet start back, when Christ offers them the knife of
          mortification, to cut off the offending right hand: 1 Corinthians
          13:3, "And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
          give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profited me
          nothing." You have a hand, it is a right hand, it must be cut off, it
          must be done with your own consent, nay, you must put your own hand to
          the knife, and you must labor to carry it through. This is language
          that will never go down with a man that has not another spirit.—Hence,
          men have a heart aversion to encounter heart difficulties in religion.
          Few see Heaven, Why? Heaven's gate is strait, ease is sweet. They are
          like the rich man in Hell, see Heaven afar off, but there is a great
          gulf fixed between them and it. Their base spirit from within, when
          the man is looking over the gulf, cries, Man, spare yourself, and then
          the heart starts back. They love the gold but they do not dig for it.
          And they have not another spirit, a new spirit, as Caleb had, to put
          them forward.—Hence any attempts they make that way are faint, and
          therefore fruitless: Luke 13:24, "Strive to enter in at the strait
          gate: For many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not
          be able." Like a cowardly man, offering to cut off his own hand, which
          threatens the ruin of his whole body, he takes up the knife, lays it
          to the skin, but always the heart misgives, and be pulls it back.
          Whereas a man of another spirit, will do it resolutely, because he is
          resolved not to die. Hence such tampering with idols, in the way of
          mortification. Then finding the fruitlessness of these faint attempts,
          they even give over, losing all courage. They see it will not do that
          way, and they despair of getting any more power over them: Jeremiah
          2:25, "Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from
          thirst, but you said, There is no hope; no; for I have loved
          strangers, and after them will I go." Lusts are like an unmanageable
          horse, which therefore gets the reins on his own neck. They have tried
          to roll the stone away, but it comes down on them again, and therefore
          they even let it die, and leave it.—Finally, their endeavors then are
          turned to the soothing of conscience for peace. For this cause the man
          pretends he can do nothing, but Christ must do all. What is left is
          but an infirmity, from which the best cannot be freed on this side of
          the grave; he will look for pardon, and so makes the blood of Christ a
          defense for his bosom lust. For as great an enmity as the natural man
          has to Christ, the devil will preach Christ to serve a turn; and thus
          the grace of God is turned into lasciviousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) This subject points out to us, that the righteous is more
          excellent than his neighbor. He has another spirit. O what a glorious
          difference does this other spirit make between one man and another! I
          will instance this in a few things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How is it that one man contemns the world, with all that is in it, the
          lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, while
          another man adores the world, and drives after it as his chief good
          and happiness? He drives a trade with another world, looking beyond
          others. What is it but that he has another spirit, a finer spirit, a
          spirit of a greater elevation and compass than others, which cannot
          take up with the little views of time.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How is it that a serious holy Christian, appearing in his own colors,
          strikes a damp upon the profane, and even on the formal hypocrite? Is
          it not that another spirit shines out of him, which compels them to
          fear him, though they hate him, to give him a secret testimony, though
          openly they reproach him? Is it not because greater is that spirit
          which is in the saints, than that which is in the world?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How is it that when many are carried away with the strong tide of an
          evil time, keeping but one principle, which is to save themselves on
          any terms, others do resolutely row against the stream, keeping one
          principle, which is to please God, to follow the Lord, from which they
          will not be diverted, whatever they meet with in the way? No worldly
          advantage, the preventing of no worldly loss, do they think worth
          their going out of their way to attain it. O! is it not another
          spirit?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How is it that one man enjoys such serenity and tranquility of mind,
          among the swelling waves of outward trouble, which carry others quite
          off their feet? That one stands as an immoveable rock, before the
          temptations which carry others hither and thither, as the chaff before
          the whirlwind? Is it anything but another spirit, fixed on the Lord,
          his word, his promise, which are better things than what the world
          has, and the tempter offers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) Hence we may see, the ground and rise of the spiritual combat
          which is in the saints. They have another spirit. They have a spirit
          in them, naturally as the rest of the world, which ordinarily takes
          the first word; but then they have another spirit, that contradicts
          and corrects it: Galatians 5:17, "For the flesh lusts against the
          spirit, and the spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the
          one to the other." The natural man has one spirit, which is corrupt,
          and not another; therefore he is wholly corrupt, in heart, lip, and
          life. The saints in glory have one spirit, which is holy, and not
          another; therefore they are perfectly holy. But the saints on earth
          have one spirit that is corrupt; but they have another spirit also;
          and therefore their heart becomes a field of battle.—Hence we see how
          it comes to pass that the saints are at war with these lusts, with
          which the natural man cannot but be at peace. He has another spirit,
          which is contrary to them, while the natural man's lusts and his
          spirit are of the same nature, and he has not another spirit contrary
          to them. If a man have a father, a brother, or son, in the opposite
          army, how can he find in his heart to lift up a sword against him? The
          natural man's spirit, in the faint mortification which he makes, says
          to him, as David said to his three generals, "Deal gently for my sake
          with the young man, even with Absalom." The man that has a wooden leg
          can take it off, and cast it from him, but how can one do so with his
          limbs? A man that has meat on his stomach, which loathes and disorders
          it, can vomit it up, but how can a man do this with a dainty morsel
          which he loves.—Hence we see also how there comes to be such
          difficulty in dealing with these lusts; there is a made resistance by
          one spirit, which is opposed to another. Lasts have a friend within
          the bosom of the saints, which takes part with them, and gives that
          other spirit so much work. You will see in them, as it were, the
          company of two armies,—twins straggling within them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) Hence we may see the ground of that enmity that is between the
          seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent. There is a holy amity
          among the saints as people of one spirit, which is a most close
          knitting thing. They cleave to one Christ: they pursue one object;
          they point towards one place; because they have all one spirit. And
          what jars are among them, flow from their own spirits not being
          sufficiently subdued by that other spirit. But between the godly and
          the wicked, how can there be but great enmity, seeing the godly have
          another spirit than they? Those of different spirits and tempers are
          ill-yoked. This makes that enmity.—It is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) A spiritual enmity, it breeds a natural antipathy between them,
          for they have not only other actions, but another spirit. Hence the
          man whom the world caressed, and embraced, while of the same spirit
          with itself, when once he becomes truly serious, and gets another
          spirit, he is quickly turned out of the world's favor, he loathes
          them, and they loathe him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) It is a most diffusive enmity; the spirit of the world is carried
          out after these things which savor of the flesh, that other spirit is
          carried out after the things which savor of the spirit. The spirit of
          the world has things which it loves, and hates these which the other
          spirit loves. Hence such an enmity against holiness of life, against
          divine ordinances, preaching the word, and other duties of religion;
          but trace all these to their fountain, they will be found to meet in
          that of their other spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) It is a most violent enmity; for the two spirits strike like two
          flints against one another, to raise the fire. No enmity like that
          which obtains on account of religion; it breaks over all bounds of
          humanity, while no other reason can be given for it but religion. It
          sets the daughter against the mother, the son against the father, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) It is a most rooted and fixed enmity. This quarrel began sooner
          than any in the world; Cain and Abel were thus enemies. Many other
          quarrels have begun since this one, which have been long since rooted
          out. But no length of time can root out this; the wicked children
          continue the quarrel, though they have seen the fathers fall in it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (6.) This subject directs us to the great object towards which such as
          would follow the Lord fully are to look, it is to their spirits. If
          our spirit be right, we will be carried through; if not, we will fall
          off. The great work of religion lies inward. Take heed, therefore, to
          your spirits; see that these be of the right kind, that your hearts be
          right with God, and sound in his statutes.—I shall have done with,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. An use of exhortation. Labor then to get another spirit, earnestly
          seek it, aim at, and pursue after it To obtain your compliance with
          this exhortation, I would lay before you the following motives,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The prevailing spirit among us is a spirit which is our plague,
          and therefore we have great need to labor for another spirit: Luke
          9:55, "You know not what manner of spirit you are of." This is among
          the rest of our plagues. Men are little at home, weigh not their
          spirits in the balance of the sanctuary; but their spirit of self-love
          makes all of high importance, and to appear well, which is their own.
          There is a sixfold spirit that is our plague this day.—There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) A carnal worldly spirit: Philippians 3:19, "They mind earthly
          things." Our spirits are sunk in the thick clay of a present world,
          and have got into an earthly constitution, as if, with our bodies,
          they were only sprung of earth. From communion and converse with God,
          our spirits are greatly estranged, but the world gets our first,
          middle, and last thoughts; so that there seems need of some terrible
          alarm to make us lift up our heads off that pillow.—There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) A private narrow spirit: Philippians 2:21, "For all seek their
          own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's." O what a rare thing is
          a public spirit among us this day, a kindly concern for the kingdom
          and interest of Christ in the world, men naturally caring for these
          things as their father's concerns. Sirs, our wide mouths will not
          absolve us from the crime of a narrow spirit in God's matters, more
          than Jehu's bravado, "Come, see my zeal:" Proverbs 26:23, "Burning
          lips and a wicked heart, are like a potsherd covered with silver
          dross." The Protestant religion is in hazard abroad and at home; is
          there anything of the care of the churches lying upon you? This church
          is in hazard of falling into the enemy's hands; are your hearts, like
          good old Eli's, "trembling for the ark?" 1 Samuel 4:13. Nay, do not
          many look upon our present privileges with such a despising eye, that
          it is all one to them whether they sink or swim. Have the attempts of
          our enemies ever made you go alone to wrestle with God against them?
          You profess you would have ministers to keep honest; but are we
          obliged to your wrestlings with God for us on that account? Have we
          any larger share in your prayers than we were accustomed to have? Will
          the loss of our honesty be to you the loss of many prayers for us in a
          difficult time! Psalm 132:9, "Let your priests be clothed with
          righteousness, and let your saints shout aloud for joy." It is a time
          of much sinning; are you sighing and crying for all the abominations
          that are in the midst of the land? Ezekiel 9:4. Are you putting to
          your hand, as you have access, to stop the stream of abounding
          sin?—There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) A stout, sturdy, fearless spirit. I fear, if God look to none but
          to those who are poor, of a contrite spirit, and who tremble at his
          word, Isaiah 66:2, there will be few among us that will get a look of
          him. How little are we affected with the word, the dispensations of
          the day, and the signs of the times! Is not the word like a ball
          thrown against a wall? The custom of hearing it has lessened the value
          of it. Who is hearkening for the time to come? Does that question lie
          near your heart, How shall I be carried through in the evil day? Are
          you putting matters in order between God and you, and preparing an ark
          for your safety?—There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) A proud fiery spirit, while the humble, meek, and lowly spirit
          does rarely appear. People are so puffed up with conceit of
          themselves, there is no dealing with them. If they make themselves
          vile, they will rather be more vile than submit to admonition or
          reproof. And if they be in the least ruffled, they are ready to cast
          all ordinances behind their backs. If the whole be not exactly
          according to their mind, they will contemptuously reject all. Witness
          the contempt poured by some upon the last fast. Humiliation of heart,
          and self-denial would cure us of this irreligious heart, which is the
          bane and ruin of religion among us, and would kindle in us a more
          kindly warmth of heart towards God and the things that bear his
          stamp.—There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) A formal spirit: 2 Timothy 3:5, "Having a form of godliness, but
          denying the power thereof." The bodily exercise of religion is much
          among many of us, but for exercise unto godliness among us, it appears
          to be very rare, 1 Timothy 4:7, 8. And many proclaim themselves utter
          strangers to it. In the eyes of any discerning Christian, they have so
          little sense of the vitals of practical godliness, that these things
          are an absolute mystery to them. It would fare the better with many of
          us, that we would begin again and lay 'the foundation of our religion,
          and follow it out in the great mysteries of the Christian life,
          mortification of heart corruptions, the life of faith, and communion
          with God.—There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (6.) A profane spirit, where the works of the flesh are manifest.
          There is a lying spirit, which so possesses many, that they make no
          conscience of speaking truth, but lend their tongues for lies. There
          is a bitter spirit of cursing and swearing, railing and reproaching,
          among us, so that sober persons may say, as in Psalm 57:4, "My soul is
          among lions; and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the
          sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a
          sharp sword." See also Psalm 64:3–7. A base, sneaking, dishonest
          spirit, lodges in the breast of many, whose covetous, unrighteous
          ways, in undermining, deceiving, and wronging their neighbors, will
          bring a vengeance from Heaven on their heads.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The case of our day requires another spirit than we have. God
          seems to be speaking to the carnal worldly generation this day, as in
          Haggai 1:4; Jeremiah 44:4, 5. To the formal and profane, as in Matthew
          3:10. To the private-spirited, as in Amos 6:1. And to all, as in Amos
          4:12. But O how unsuitable are our spirits to the case of the day! How
          unfit are our spirits to act for God! They are too mean to do anything
          great and honorable for God and his glory. And doubtless, if we get
          not another spirit, we will never be honored of God to perform
          anything that is great for him. Our work as Christians is at all times
          difficult, but we are likely to have a special difficulty in our time.
          Is the mean and base spirit with which we are plagued, meet to set us
          to oppose the stream and tide of sin that is going through the
          generation? Is our careless carnal spirit meet to wrestle with God, to
          keep him still in our land?—Again, how unfit are our spirits for
          suffering? The soft and carnal spirit which prevails, suits very ill
          with a time in which the Lord seems to be about to pluck up and
          destroy. That spirit of formality and profanity answers very ill with
          a time in which people's religion may be put to the utmost trial:
          Isaiah 33:14, "The sinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulness has
          surprised the hypocrites." Truly, if we get not another spirit, a time
          of trial will make a dreadful discovery among the professed followers
          of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Does not our own particular case, with respect to eternity,
          require another spirit? Eternity is no dream, the wrath to come is no
          scare-crow; these are the greatest of realities, and certainly require
          our utmost efforts. Does the prevailing temper of our spirits look
          like the eternal weight of glory that is abiding those who strive,
          run, wrestle, and fight the good fight of faith? Alas! our spirits are
          as unlike the attaining it, as the sluggard, who will not plow his
          field, is like to attain a good crop. They who look for a treasure,
          dig for it; and they who wish for the prize, run for it; but it is a
          loitering not a laboring spirit with which most of us are possessed,
          who have small probability of seeing Heaven, unless it will drop down
          into our mouths.—Again, does our spirit look like flying from the
          wrath to come, that infinite load of wrath which is abiding a
          perishing generation? We seem to be creeping from it rather than
          fleeing; and therefore it is ready to overtake us. O how would our
          spirits stir within us, if we were duly affected with eternity, and
          the danger that our souls are in of the wrath to come!—But farther,
          how unlike is our spirit to the subduing of strong corruptions within
          our own breasts! How soft are our spirits against these our deadliest
          enemies! We must have another spirit, or our spirits will soon be
          devoured by them.—Lastly, There is no following of the Lord fully, and
          so no Heaven, without another spirit; and therefore, as ever we would
          be found Christians indeed, and safe through eternity, let us labor
          for that other spirit: "Create in us, O Lord, a clean heart, and renew
          a right spirit within us."—I shall now very briefly attend to
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE III. That those who, by following the Lord fully in the time
          of general declining, distinguish themselves, God will distinguish
          them from others, by special marks of favor in the time of general
          calamity.—The scriptures afford many instances in proof of this, as
          Noah, Lot, Jeremiah, and many others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">For illustrating this doctrine, we shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Show how those must distinguish themselves from others in the time
          of general declining, who would have the Lord to distinguish them from
          others in the time of general calamity.—We shall point out,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The marks of favor by which, in times of great calamity, God uses
          to distinguish such.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. We shall subjoin some reasons of the point, to confirm it.—And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Make some improvement.</p>
        <p align="justify">We are then,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show how those must distinguish themselves from others in the
          time of general declining, who would have the Lord to distinguish them
          from others in time of general calamity.—Here we observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That they must be best, when others are worst: Genesis 6:9, "Noah
          was a just man, and perfect in his generation; and Noah walked with
          God." Their candle must shine brightest, when that of others is dying
          out. It is the property of holy zeal for God and his way, to become
          more vehement by opposition; so that the declining of others is as oil
          to their flame. It was better with Lot when he dwelt among the
          Sodomites, than when with his own children in the cave: 2 Peter
          2:7–10, "And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of
          the wicked, (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and
          hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful
          deeds)." The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations,
          and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment, to be punished."
          "It is time for you, Lord, to work; for they have made void your law.
          Therefore I love your commandments above gold, yes, above fine gold."
          If religion be dying out among others, this will the more kindle a
          holy fire of seal, and increase it in their own breasts.—We observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That they must cleave to God, especially in that article in which
          others are leaving him, as in Caleb's case; that is to say, they must
          be careful that they be not led away with the sins of the time, that
          they do not enter into the general conspiracy of the generation
          against the Lord and his way, whether it be against truth or holiness.
          Thus the promise was to those who kept the life and power of godliness
          in Sardis, where there was a great general declining, a deadness and
          formality, and the bare carcass of religion: Revelation 3:4, "You have
          a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments; and
          they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy."—We observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That they must witness against every declining, according to their
          stations, and as they have access, for the exoneration of their own
          consciences, and the honor of God. Thus did Noah, that preacher of
          righteousness, to that unrighteous world. These must give a real
          testimony by their contrary practice, and, as they may have access,
          labor to withdraw others from sinful courses.—Thus did Caleb.—We
          observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. That they must be mourners over the sins of others, lamenting them
          before the Lord; sighing and crying for all the abominations which are
          done in the midst of the land, Ezekiel 9:4. They must mourn for those
          who cannot mourn for themselves. When the glory of God is impaired by
          the sins of an apostatizing generation, their love to the persons of
          the sinners, and hatred of their sins, must draw tears of godly sorrow
          from their eyes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Let us now,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Point out the marks of favor by which, in times of general
          calamity, God uses to distinguish such.—There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Liberal furniture for duty, in a large communication of the spirit,
          when the Spirit is withdrawn from others: Matthew 10:19, "But when
          they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak, for
          it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak." The
          Lord calls not his people to serve him for nothing; he even rewards
          the will to his work, with strength for it. If they be resolute to
          bear his burden, God will strengthen the back for it. Hence it comes
          to pass, that God's people never make better speed, than when rowing
          against the stream of opposition.—There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Intimations of his special love to their souls. Thus had Caleb in
          the text, the saints of God have often golden days in the dregs of
          time upon this account. When the deluge of public calamity carries
          incorrigible sinners before it, with their burden of guilt upon their
          back, the saints are then made to rest in the evil day, by virtue of
          that peace which they have with God and their own conscience, Habakkuk
          3:16.—There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Special provision in a time of calamity: Psalm 37:19, "They shall
          not be ashamed in the evil time, and in the days of famine they shall
          be satisfied." God rises often to see well to the provision of those
          whose work it is to cleave to their duty, and rely on the Lord for
          their provision: Psalm 37:3, "Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shall
          you dwell in the land, and truly you shall be fed." So that their
          faces are fatter and fairer than those who eat of the defiled
          meat.—There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Special protection in an evil day. God sets a mark on their
          foreheads: Ezekiel 9:4. "And the Lord said unto him, Go through the
          midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon
          the foreheads of the men that sigh, and that cry for all the
          abominations that be done in the midst thereof." They are always
          protected from the evil of trouble; but God sometimes, besides this,
          affords them special protection from trouble, by some surprising
          providence removing them out of the way of it; sometimes by making
          them find favor in the eyes of their enemies: Jeremiah 15:11, "The
          Lord said, truly, it shall be well with your remnant; truly, I will
          cause the enemy to entreat you well in the time of evil, and in the
          time of affliction." And sometimes by hiding them in the grave before
          the calamity come on: Isaiah 57:1, 2, "The righteous man perishes, and
          no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none
          considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. He
          shall enter into peace, they shall rest in their beds, each one
          walking in his uprightness."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, He gives them the crown of glory: Revelation 2:10, "Fear none
          of these things which you shall suffer; behold, the devil shall cast
          some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have
          tribulation ten days: Be you faithful unto the death, and I will give
          you a crown of life." He brings them into Canaan above, and crowns
          them, while others, who forsook God, are forever forsaken of him; and
          they who sinned with the multitude, suffer with them forever: Luke
          22:28, 29, 30, "You are they which have continued with me in my
          temptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my father has
          appointed unto me; that you may eat and drink at my table in my
          kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."—We
          now proceed very shortly,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To subjoin the reasons of the point, to confirm it.—Here we offer
          the following, namely,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is hard work to follow fully in a declining time, to strive
          against the stream which is so ready to carry people away: Matthew
          24:12, "And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
          cold." Hard to keep warm in cold Sardis, Revelation 3:4. To keep up
          the flame of religion, when a deluge of sin comes on, is very hard
          work. But hard work has always the greatest reward from the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a piece of special honor to God; and those who honor him he
          will honor. It is not so much to follow Christ when he has a great
          backing, as to cleave to him when many are dropping off from him on
          every hand.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The Lord orders it so for the encouragement of his people, to
          follow him fully. He gives them the view of the recompense of reward,
          to encourage and animate them in pressing forward towards the mark for
          the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. We are now to make some brief improvement of the whole; and,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. In an use of information.—We see,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) That none shall be losers at God's hand. They that cleave to him,
          when others leave him, God will cleave to them when he forsakes
          others. Our errand will come in his way, and he will show himself
          mindful of any respect and love shown him by them that walk
          uprightly.—We see,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) That he who walks uprightly walks surely, come what will come.
          Whoever wanders from God's way, and follows the multitude to do evil,
          their feet will slide. But the best preparation and security for a
          time of general calamity, is to walk with God in a declining time.—We
          shall only add,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">2. An use of exhortation,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          We exhort you, then, to follow the Lord fully now. Our time is a
          declining time. There is a declining from the purity of gospel
          doctrine and gospel ordinances. There is a horrid declining in
          practice; the veil is falling off many faces, and the mask of
          religion. There is a general declining from holiness, and the power of
          godliness, on the spirits of professors in our day. It is a day of
          approaching calamity. Would you be safe? Return now, and set your face
          against the stream; and the more you see others going off from God,
          cleave the more to him. If you do so, you will be distinguished by
          special marks of favor in a day of public calamity; but if you also go
          away, your sin will afterwards find you out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Remember, now you have heard your duty; it is the duty of
          communicants, and also of others. Remember that it is not enough to
          set fair off. It is only he who follows fully who will be brought
          safely to the promised land. It is only he who endures to the end who
          will be saved. Be not, therefore, "weary in this well-doing, for in
          due time you shall reap, if you faint not."
