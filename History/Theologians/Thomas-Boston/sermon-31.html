        <p align="justify">Philippians 1:21, "For me to live is Christ."</p>
        <p align="justify">
          IN a day of converting grace, in Christ's marriage-day, there is a
          glorious transmigration of souls between Christ and believers. Christ
          loves the believer, and the believer loves Christ. The believer has
          Christ's heart, Song 4:9, "You have ravished my heart, my sister, my
          spouse." Some render it, "You have knit my heart to your;" as if they
          had no more two hearts, but one. The Septuagint renders it, unhearts
          me. And Christ has the believer's heart. "Whom have I in the Heaven
          but you; and there is none in all the earth that I desire besides
          you." The believer desires nothing beside him, nothing like him,
          nothing after him. As the lady at Cyrus' feast, who said she saw none
          but her husband. Christ lives in the believer, Galatians 5:20. Christ
          is his life, Colossians 3:4. Alas! that there should be so many
          Christless Christians, who never have discovered the beauty of this
          plant of renown. Paul was none of these, as appears in these words,
          wherein we are to consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The sum of Paul's practice: "To me to live is Christ." Some render
          it, "for Christ is gain to me in life and in death;" as if the sense
          were, whether I live or die, Christ is always my gain. But this is a
          force upon the text which, in the original, runs word for word, as in
          our translation. The words bear another sense. The phrase, indeed, is
          something unusual; but love burning in the heart to Christ, is not
          easily satisfied with expression. When Hezekiah is wondering at the
          Lord's love, he says, "you have in love to my soul delivered it from
          the pit of corruption:" or, you have loved my soul from the pit. When
          David was intent on prayer, he tells us, but, "I prayer," Psalm 109:4.
          When on peace, "I peace," Psalm 120:7. Now Christ is all to the
          believer, "To me to live is Christ." I endeavor to live Christ, to
          think Christ, to speak Christ. As all the lines drawn from the
          circumference to the center meet in one point; so all my preaching,
          all my suffering, yes, all my life, has a tendency to Christ, to
          please him, and to glorify him. Christ was the great scope of his
          life. To the unrenewed man, to live is himself. He acts from, for, and
          to himself. Christ gets self's room in the believer. He acts from him,
          to him, and for him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In the verse there is the sum of his hopes: "To die is gain."
          Death, that is the great enemy of mankind, shall be gainful to me. If
          I lose a temporal life, I will find an eternal. I will make a good
          exchange of trouble, for eternal rest; of a miserable world, for
          Heaven; and then shall I fully enjoy this Christ for whom I live; and
          shall also glorify him in death, whom I glorify by life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The connection of a holy life, and a happy death. To live is
          Christ, before to die be gain. These God has joined, and no man can
          put asunder; though if wishes would do, they would be often disjoined;
          as many are of Balaam's mind, in desiring to die the death of the
          righteous. They must glorify him here, who shall be glorified by him
          hereafter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The dependence of these words on the preceding. They are a reason
          of what he said before, verse 20. He had said, that he hoped, (being
          now prisoner at Rome), to magnify Christ in his body; this he might do
          either by his life or by his death. In life he would preach Christ, by
          death he would confirm his preaching. He was not solicitous which of
          the two ways Christ should glorify himself in him, so that he were
          glorified by him; and the reason was, because his heart was bent on
          glorifying Christ in life; so if he lived, he would live in his
          element, and if he died it should be gain both to himself and others,
          and he should glorify Christ that way also.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. Christ is the sum and scope of the believer's life. We shall
          show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. What is supposed in this.</p>
        <p align="justify">II. What is imported in it.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Why is it so with the believer. We are then to show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. What is supposed in this. It supposes that the believer has seen
          Christ in his beauty. "Your eyes shall see the King in his beauty."
          There is an interesting question, John 14:22, "Lord, how is it that
          you will manifest yourself unto us, and not unto the world?" There is
          an illumination in the knowledge of Christ, given in the day of
          Christ's power, to the elect; that the world, even the most refined
          hypocrites, attain not unto; that determines them to make Christ their
          all. The illumination of the Arminians, that leaves the will in
          suspense, is often the attainment of castaways. But the elect get one
          of another sort, John 4:10. They who are thus brought to know his
          name, will put their trust in him. Hypocrites see him, as it were, but
          in his ordinary clothes, hence they see no beauty in him, that they
          should desire him; and hence such unmannerly treatment of him at his
          table, for had they known him, they would not have thus crucified the
          Lord of glory. The believer sees him in his royal robes, clothed with
          glory, and altogether lovely. There are two things which every
          believer has seen in Christ, but no hypocrite has seen them:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. His transcendent excellency, Matthew 13:45, 46. They have seen that
          in him that has darkened all created excellency. As when the sun
          arises, the stars hide their heads, the candles are blown out. The sun
          serves instead of candles, moon, and stars. If others see this, why do
          they prefer a lust to Christ; why is not to them to live Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. His fullness, his all-sufficiency, John 1:16; Luke 15:17. An ass's
          head gave a great price at Samaria, in time of famine; and so the
          doings of the world appear bulky, when the fullness of the Mediator is
          not discovered. The treasure may be concealed, hidden under the
          beggar's feet, hence he goes from door to door; but if it were seen,
          he would leave off his old trade and live upon his own. With Peter, he
          would say to Christ, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of
          eternal life;" and from him he would receive that water, which would
          be in him a well of living water, springing up to everlasting life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. We are to show what is imported in it.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It imports that the believer's life is bound up in Christ's. "You
          are dead," says Paul, "and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
          When Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then shall we also appear
          with him in glory." This he himself tells us, "Because I live, you
          shall live also." What was David's encouragement against all distress?
          it was, "the Lord lives;" and of his joy, and that made him that he
          could lay down his body with confidence in a grave? it was, "you will
          not leave my soul in Hell, neither will you suffer your holy one to
          see corruption." The believer's hopes are all in Christ, and should he
          die, they and their all would die with him. The apostle, in the text,
          lets us know his judgment, that life is not worth the having, without
          Christ. What is life but a vapor? Our days are few and evil; desirable
          not for their own sake, but for Christ's sake.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Christ is the object of the believer's life: (allow me to term it
          so). As the tradesman is taken up about his employment, so is the
          believer about Christ: "For I determine," says lie, "not to know
          anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified." The actions
          of his life do habitually center in him, though in themselves they be
          divers. I shall instance in some particulars:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Christ is the believer's study, Philip. 3:8, 10. He is the main
          thing which they desire to know. The mysteries of nature only, are
          prized by some; but the mystery of Christ is chiefly prized by
          believers. Here all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are; not
          only subjectively, but objectively. O what a roundabout way do men
          ordinarily take to gain knowledge! Paul took the shortest way, when he
          determined to hold by Christ crucified; for that is the body of
          divinity taught to the scholars of the Spirit of God. "He shines in
          our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
          the face of Jesus." Look to him in his natures and offices; in what he
          did, and what he suffered, from his conception, to his sitting at
          God's right hand, and you will see a complete system. Would you know
          what God is; what man is by nature, and what by grace—all may be
          learned there.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, concerning this study of the believer, I would remark, that
          sometimes his book falls by-hand. They lose their sight of Christ, the
          face of Jesus is veiled to them. Like Job, they cannot perceive him on
          either side. This makes their faces gather blackness, and makes them
          go about with Job's cry in their month, "O that I knew where I might
          find him, that I might come, even to his seat." For why, if he be
          gone, what have we more? for comfort, life, God, and guide, are gone.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, when the believer would know the nature of God, and what he is
          to him, he reads all through the veil of the flesh of Christ, for it
          is in him only that God is well pleased, Hebrews 10:19, 20. God out of
          Christ is a terrible sight, to those who know what sin is, as the
          believer does. He looks to his mercies through Christ, and that makes
          the least of them appear very great. He takes a cup of cold water as
          sent to him by the sea of Christ's blood, and sees Christ in every
          mercy. But finally, whatever he sees in Christ, there is always
          something beyond what he has attained, Ephesians 3:18, 19. There are
          new jewels still to come out of this treasure. The desire is kindled
          to know more of him; like Moses, show me your glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Christ is the believer's choice, Psalm 73:25. The believer's choice
          is far different from the world, Psalm 4:6, 7. He chooses Christ above
          all. He sees him as the best among ten thousand, and altogether
          lovely. These eagle-eyed ones can see defects in all created
          enjoyments, but none in Christ. There are two defects which they see
          in all others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
             1. Uncertainty. They see honor but like a windy bubble, that
          children blow up, presently gone. Riches to be the name of nothing;
          like a flock of birds that light upon a man's ground, that presently
          take wing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
             2. Insufficiency. They are no way commensurable to the desires of
          an immortal soul. "I have seen," says he, "an end of all perfection."
          Now he sees Christ to be a certain and a sufficient good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He also chooses Christ instead of all, and takes him for all. The
          godly man knows he is all-sufficient. This is a wise choice. It is but
          a choosing of the fountain instead of the streams. Whatever
          perfections are in the creature scattered up and down, he has them
          concentered in him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Christ has the believer's affections. Christ is his treasure, and
          therefore his heart is upon him. The affections that were sometimes
          scattered and misplaced, are now gathered together; and as all the
          rivers run into the sea, so they all run to Christ. His love is set on
          that lovely one, and he will neither be driven, nor bribed from it.
          "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it."
          Their desires are toward him, Isaiah 26:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His hope is in him. His joy is in Jesus, Philippians 3:3. His delight
          is in him; and if any person or thing has any of his love, it is for
          Christ's sake. This is the habitual bent of the soul. His sorrow is
          for offending him. He mourns most bitterly for having pierced him. His
          hatred is against sin, as the abominable thing that Christ hates. His
          fear is also lest he provoke him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Even the believer's body is devoted to Christ. It is the temple of the
          Holy Spirit. Their members are instruments of righteousness. The
          tongue is the instrument of his glory, and they respect their bodies
          for that very cause, that they are Christ's. Hence, if he call them to
          suffer for his sake, their bodies and lives are at his service.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Christ is the end of the believer's life. He lives to Christ,
          Romans 14:8. He endeavors to please him. Men-pleasers, and those who
          please Christ, divide the whole world. "If I yet pleased men," says
          Paul, "I should not be the servant of Christ." The true Christian has
          renounced his own will, and taken Christ's will for his. He has
          learned to submit to his perceptive and providential will, that in all
          things he may please him to whom he owes himself. He endeavors to
          glorify Christ. His life is a burden to him, if he conceive he can do
          nothing for Christ. He is ready to think that day a lost day, in which
          Christ's glory has not been advanced by him in some measure. It is his
          work, and therefore he lives to pull down Satan's kingdom, and to
          advance the kingdom of Christ. The honor of his Lord is dear to him,
          and therefore he would be content, with the Psalmist, "to make his
          name to be remembered in all generations." Hence, he is one that will
          speak for Christ, and will not be ashamed of him before men. If his
          glory be impaired by others, he will strive to repair it, testifying
          against sin. He is one that will commend Christ, and sound forth his
          praises to engage others to fall in love with him. His life will also
          be such, as may bring glory to Christ. He will labor to write after
          the blessed copy which Christ has set before him. If he be called to
          suffer for Christ, he will not refuse it, to glorify his Lord. We
          proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. To show why it is so with the believer:</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because Christ lives in him, Galatians 2:20. The same Spirit that
          dwells in Christ, dwells in the believer; and as the same soul
          actuates both the head and the members, the oil poured on the head of
          our high priest runs down to the skirts of his garments.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They are, by the Spirit of Christ, made partakers of the divine
          nature; united to Jesus Christ, and how can the members but live to
          the holy head?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They had their life by the death of Christ, he bought them with the
          price of his own blood; no wonder, then, that to them to live be
          Christ. As Eve was made of a rib taken out of Adam, and thus was his
          own, so they are Christ's. They are his by right of redemption, why
          then should he not have their all? He gets nothing from them, but what
          was bought at a dear rate. It was for this end he died, that they
          which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him
          which died for them, and rose again." If one should buy a thief from
          the gallows, would he not be obliged, in gratitude, to be wholly his,
          to whom he owes his life. Christ bought us from death, and that by his
          own death. How can the believer reflect on the price paid, but he must
          say to him, to live is Christ? O! says the believer, if the foot
          sinned, and God drew blood of the head; I contracted the debt, and my
          husband paid it, and shall I not be for him. There are five things
          that weigh much with the believer here:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The vastness of the price which Christ paid for his life, namely,
          his own precious blood, 1 Peter 1:19. This price was the blood of God,
          Acts 20:28. Had a world been crumbled to nothing, had all the angels
          been loaded with the wrath of God, and died each of them ten thousand
          deaths for our life; what had all this been to God dying. Believers
          live to him, because they see his glory as the only begotten of the
          Father, hence they stand and wonder, Isaiah 63:1, 2. They wonder at
          the Son of God suffering death to purchase their life; they are placed
          here as the iron in the fire, until it be all fire.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That Christ lived for them, and died for them. What brought him out
          of the Father's bosom, but his love to them? Why could not the
          hallelujahs of angels keep him at court, but because the cries of the
          perishing elect pierced his heart? Therefore he came down. Father,
          said he, they shall not perish; if they owe anything, lay it to my
          account, take payment of me; I will take their place. They cannot
          live, unless the law be satisfied by obedience, and justice satisfied
          for the sin committed. I will do both. So he came, and lived a life of
          perfect obedience for them, and died a death satisfactory for their
          sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The continuance of his sufferings, which was from his birth to his
          death, from the cradle to the grave. It was not a part of Christ's
          life that was for them, but it was the whole; and how can they but
          give him the whole of theirs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Anything they have to give to Christ, anything they have with which
          to entertain him, or with which to do anything for him, they owe it
          all to him. That they have a soul out of Hell, they owe it to Christ,
          and shall it not be his temple? That they have a heart not filled with
          horror and eternal despair, they owe it to him; and shall he not have
          it? That they have a tongue that is not burning in Hell, they owe it
          to him, and shall not they act for him?—feet that are not standing in
          fire and brimstone, and shall they not run his errands?—eyes not
          blinded with the smoke of the pit; and in a word, a body that is out
          of Hell; and shall not all be his and for him?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. The proportion that was between the seat of sin in them, and the
          seat of suffering in Christ. They sinned in their bodies, and Christ
          suffered in his body. His head was pierced with the thorny crown, his
          eyes were denied the light of the sun, his tongue was made to cleave
          to the roof of his mouth, he gave his back to the smiters, and his
          cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; his fair face was defiled
          with spittle; his heart was melted like wax, in the midst of his
          affections; his side was pierced with a spear; his hands and feet
          nailed to the cross; his strength dried like a potsherd; and wherefore
          all this, but that the body and all its members had been instruments
          of sin in men? And because their souls were the chief seat of all,
          therefore Christ's soul was the chief scat of wrath, sorrowful even
          unto death. Their souls had forsaken God, therefore he is forsaken of
          God. Pride and all mischief dwelt in their souls; therefore he put him
          to shame, and laid him low indeed. Is it any wonder, then, that they
          live not as they lived before? any wonder that to them to live is
          Christ?

        <p align="justify">
          USE. Then show yourselves true Christians, by making Christ the sum
          and scope of your life, and that you may do so, I recommend these few
          things to you:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Abhor all doctrines that tend to the lessening of the glory of
          Christ. He made the gospel covenant for himself, and Woe to them that
          turn it against him. But most, if not all the heretics stumble upon
          this stone, so that we may say, "Blessed is he whoever shall not be
          offended in him." The cursed Socinians lessen his glory, making him
          but a nominal and official God. The Papists, many ways—by their
          masses, indulgences, invocations, and merit of good works. The
          Arminians make his grace lacquey it, at the foot of free will. Others
          put our faith and obedience in the room of Christ's righteousness.
          God's great design in the gospel is to exalt Christ; and the devil's
          great design is to depress him, and to raise up men for that purpose,
          to object against his nature, his offices, and the like. Some will not
          allow him, by his Spirit, to be the interpreter of his Father's will,
          but set up their own corrupt reason in the chair. Some rob him of the
          glory of his priestly office, and some will have no king but Caesar.
          These things show that they are Christ's enemies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Appear for him and his cause. Remember that whoever shall be
          ashamed of him, to act for him and speak for him, of them he will also
          be ashamed. Be always then on his side, labor to propagate his
          kingdom. Recommend him to others, that they may fall in love with him.
          Recommend him to your neighbors, and especially, like Abraham, to your
          families, Genesis 18:19. Reprove and discountenance the dishonor done
          to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Beware of him, obey his voice, and provoke him not, Exodus 23:21.
          Close with all the duties he lays upon you, and have respect to all
          his commandments. They that baulk any of them, he is not the sum and
          scope of their lives. Christ's word is a band strong enough to a
          gracious soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Be not satisfied with duties, unless you find Christ in them;
          unless "you behold the beauty of the Lord." Mary came to the
          sepulcher, but finding no Christ there, she wept; because she
          apprehended they had taken away her Lord, and she knew not where they
          had laid him. Duties are but empty husks without Christ. He is the
          marrow and life of all duties. They are but handmaids to lead you to
          Christ. Sit not down to make love to them, but go forward until you
          find him whom your soul loves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Perform religious duties, and love them for Christ's sake. It is
          but heathen morality to be virtuous for virtue's sake. No wonder that
          was their highest motive, for their gods generally were as bad as
          themselves, and therefore they pitched upon the dead idol of virtue,
          that had no relation to God. But be you godly for God's sake, holy for
          Christ's sake. To be holy for holiness' sake, without respect to
          Christ, is to make an idol of a created quality.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Engage in no duty, but in his strength. Flee on borrowed wings. The
          fire that was put to the incense, on the altar of incense, was brought
          from the altar of burnt-offering; teaching us, that from Christ the
          influences of grace must come into our souls freely.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Draw motives and helps for duty, from Christ's sufferings, 2
          Corinthians 5:14, 15; Zechariah 12:10. The law may break and bruise,
          and so may be useful in its own place to lead us to Christ; but surely
          it is the gospel alone that kindly melts the soul. The Christian's
          labor is a labor of love; because where the labor is right, love
          predominates.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Lay the weight of the acceptance of all your duties, and all
          the good you do, only upon Jesus Christ. God is only pleased in him.
          Venture not to look on God, but through the veil of his flesh. Alas!
          many, if they attain to any good frame in duties, they are apt to lay
          the weight upon it, and say, now I know God will bless me. As if a
          beggar would assure himself of his alms, because he has a tongue to
          cry, and a hand open to receive them. But remember a good frame is not
          Christ, and cursed "be the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his
          arm, and whose heart departs from the Lord." Calves offered on the
          altar of Bethel were rejected, when turtle doves offered on the altar
          at Jerusalem were accepted. Amen.
