<p align="justify">"Then He shall say unto those on the left hand--<b>Depart 

    from me, you cursed ones, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and 

    his angels!</b>" Matthew 25:41</p>
<p align="justify"><b>INTRODUCTION<br/>
</b>Were there no other place of eternal lodging but heaven, I should here 

    have closed my discourse of man's eternal state; but as in the other world 

    there is a prison for the wicked, as well as a palace for saints, we must 

    also inquire into that state of everlasting misery; which the worst of men 

    may well bear with, without crying– 'Are you come to torment us before the 

    time?' since there is yet access to flee from the wrath to come; and all 

    that can be said of it comes short of what the dammed will feel; for 'who 

    knows the power of God's anger?'</p>
<p align="justify">The last thing which our Lord did, before He left the 

    earth, was, 'He lifted up his hands, and blessed his disciples' (Luke, 

    24:50,51). But the last thing He will do, before He leaves the throne, is to 

    curse and condemn His enemies; as we learn from the text which contains the 

    dreadful sentence wherein the everlasting misery of the wicked is declared. 

    In which, three things may be taken notice of–</p>
<p align="justify">1. The 'quality' of the condemned– 'you cursed.' The 

    Judge finds the 'curse of the law' upon them as transgressors, and sends 

    them away with it, from His presence, into hell, there to be fully executed 

    upon them.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The 'punishment' which they are sentenced to, and to 

    which they were always bound over by virtue of the curse. And it is twofold– 

    the punishment of 'loss', in separation from God and Christ– 'Depart from 

    Me;' And the punishment of 'sense'– in most poignant and extreme torments– 

    Depart from Me 'into fire.'</p>
<p align="justify">3. The 'aggravations' of their torments–<br/>

    a. They are ready for them, they are not to expect a moment's respite. The 

    fire is prepared and ready to catch hold of those who are thrown into it.</p>
<p align="justify">b. They will have the society of devils in their 

    torments, being shut up with them in hell. They must depart into the same 

    fire, prepared for Beelzebub, the prince of devils, and his angels; namely, 

    other reprobate angels who fell with him, and became devils. It is said to 

    be prepared for them; because the demons sinned and were condemned to hell 

    before man sinned.</p>
<p align="justify">This speaks further terror to the damned, that they must 

    go into the same torments, and place of torment, with the devil and his 

    angels. They hearkened to his temptations, and they must partake in his 

    torments– his works they would do, and they must receive the wages, which is 

    death.</p>
<p align="justify">In this life they joined with devils, in malice against 

    God and Christ, and the way of holiness. And in eternity, they must lodge 

    with them.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus all the goats shall be shut up together– for that 

    name is common to devils and wicked men, in Scripture (Lev 17:7), where the 

    word rendered devils properly signifies hairy ones, or goats, in the shape 

    of which creatures, devils delighted much to appear to their worshipers.</p>
<p align="justify">c. The last aggravation of their torment is the eternal 

    duration thereof; they must depart into 'everlasting' fire. This is what 

    puts the top-stone upon their misery, namely, that it shall never have an 

    end.<br/>

     </p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE–<font color="#ff0000"> <b>THE WICKED SHALL BE 

    SHUT UP UNDER THE CURSE OF GOD, IN EVERLASTING MISERY, WITH THE DEVILS IN 

    HELL!</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">After having proved that there shall be a resurrection of 

    the body and a general judgment, I think it is not needful to insist on 

    proving the truth of future punishment. The same conscience there is in men 

    of a future judgment, bears witness also of the truth of future punishment. 

    (And that the punishment of the damned shall not be annihilation, or a 

    reducing them to nothing, will be clear in the progress of our discourse.) 

    In treating of this awful subject I shall inquire into these four things–<br/>

    I. The <b>curse</b> under which the damned shall be shut up. <br/>

    II. Their <b>misery</b> under that curse. <br/>

    III. Their <b>society</b> with devils in this miserable state. <br/>

    IV. The <b>eternity</b> of the whole.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>I. THE "CURSE" UNDER WHICH THE 

    DAMMED SHALL BE SHUT UP IN HELL–<br/>
</b></font>It is the terrible sentence of the law by which they are bound 

    over to the wrath of God, as transgressors. This curse does not first come 

    upon them when standing before the tribunal to receive their sentence; but 

    they were born under it, they led their lives under it in this world, they 

    died under it, and rose with it out of their graves. And the Judge finding 

    the curse upon them, sends them away with it into the pit, where it shall 

    lie on them through all the ages of eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">By nature all men are under the curse. But it is removed 

    from the elect by virtue of their union with Christ. It abides on the rest 

    of sinful mankind, and by it they are devoted to destruction, and separated 

    to evil.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus shall the damned forever be persons devoted to 

    destruction! separate and set apart from the rest of mankind, unto evil, as 

    vessels of wrath! set up as marks for the arrows of divine wrath! and made 

    the common receptacle and shore of eternal vengeance!</p>
<p align="justify">This curse has its first-fruits on earth, which are a 

    pledge of the whole lump that is to follow. Hence it is, that temporal and 

    eternal miseries on the enemies of God, are sometimes included under one and 

    the same expression in the threatening. What is that judicial blindness to 

    which many are given up, 'whom the god of this world has blinded' (2 Cor 

    4:4), but the first fruits of hell and of the curse? Their sun is going down 

    at noon-day, their darkness increasing, as if it would not stop until it 

    issue in utter darkness.</p>
<p align="justify">Many a lash in the dark, does conscience give the wicked, 

    which the world does not hear of– and what is that but the never-dying worm 

    already begun to gnaw them? And there is not one of these but they may call 

    it Joseph, for 'the Lord shall add another'; or rather Gad, for 'a troop 

    comes.'</p>
<p align="justify">These drops of wrath are terrible forebodings of the full 

    shower which is to follow. Sometimes they are given up to their vile 

    affections, that they have no more command over them (Rom 1:26). So their 

    lusts grow up more and more towards perfection, if I may so speak.</p>
<p align="justify">As in heaven grace comes to its perfection, so in hell 

    sin arrives at its highest pitch; and as sin is thus advancing upon the man, 

    he is the nearer and likelier to hell.</p>
<p align="justify">There are three things that have a fearful aspect here–<br/>

    1. When everything that might do good to men's souls, is blasted to them; so 

    that their blessings are cursed– sermons, prayers, admonitions, and 

    reproofs, which are powerful towards others, are quite ineffectual to them.</p>
<p align="justify">2. When men go on in sinning still, in the face of plain 

    rebukes from the Lord, in ordinances and providences. God meets them with 

    rods in the way of their sin, as it were striking them back; yet they rush 

    forward. What can be more like hell, where the Lord is always smiting and 

    the damned always sinning against Him?</p>
<p align="justify">3. When everything in one's lot is turned into fuel for 

    one's lusts. Thus, adversity and prosperity, poverty and wealth, the lack of 

    ordinances and the enjoyment of them, do all but nourish the corruptions of 

    many. Their vicious stomachs corrupt whatever they receive, and all does but 

    increase noxious humors.</p>
<p align="justify">But the full harvest follows, in that misery which they 

    shall forever lie under in hell; that wrath which, by virtue of the curse, 

    shall come upon them to the uttermost– which is the curse fully executed. 

    This black cloud opens upon them, and the terrible thunderbolt strikes them, 

    by that dreadful voice from the throne, 'Depart from me, you cursed', which 

    will give the whole wicked world a dismal view of what is in the bosom of 

    the curse.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a voice of extreme indignation and wrath, a 

    furious rebuke from the Lion of the tribe of Judah! His looks will be most 

    terrible to them; His eyes will cast flames of fire on them; and His words 

    will pierce their hearts, like envenomed arrows! When He will thus speak 

    them out of His presence for ever, and by His word chase them away from 

    before the throne, they will see how keenly wrath burns in His heart, 

    against them for their sins!</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a voice of extreme disdain and contempt from the 

    Lord. Time was when they were pitied, admonished to pity themselves, and to 

    be the Lord's; yet they despised Him, they would have none of Him– but now 

    they shall be buried out of His sight, under everlasting contempt!</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a voice of extreme hatred. Hereby the Lord shuts 

    them out of His affections of love and mercy. 'Depart, you cursed.' I cannot 

    endure to look at you; there is not one purpose of good to you in My heart; 

    nor shall you ever hear one word more of hope from Me.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is a voice of eternal rejection from the Lord. He 

    commands them to be gone and so casts them off forever. Thus the doors of 

    heaven are shut against them; the gulf is fixed between them and it, and 

    they are driven to the pit.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, were they to cry with all possible earnestness– 

    'Lord, Lord, open to us;' they will hear nothing but– 'Depart, depart you 

    cursed ones.' Thus shall the dammed be shut up under the curse.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Application– </b>Let all those who being yet in their 

    natural state, are under the curse, consider this, and flee to Jesus Christ 

    in time, that they may be delivered from it. How can you sleep in that 

    state, being under the curse!</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus Christ is 'now' saying unto you– 'Come you cursed, 

    I will take the curse from off you, and give you the blessing.' The waters 

    of the sanctuary are now running, to heal the cursed ground; take heed to 

    improve them for that end to your own souls, and fear it as hell to get no 

    spiritual advantage thereby.</p>
<p align="justify">Remember that 'the miry places,' which are neither sea 

    nor dry land, are a fit emblem of hypocrites; 'and the marshes,' that 

    neither breed fish, nor bear trees, but the waters of the sanctuary leave 

    them, as they find them, in their barrenness, 'shall not be healed,' seeing 

    they spurn the only remedy. 'They shall be given to salt,' –left under 

    eternal barrenness, set up for the monuments of the wrath of God, and 

    concluded forever under the curse! (Ezek 47:11).</p>
<p align="justify">Let all CURSERS consider this, whose mouths are filled 

    with cursing themselves and others. He who 'clothes himself with cursing,' 

    shall find the curse 'come into his affections like water, and oil into his 

    bones' (Ps.109:18), if repentance prevent it not. He shall get all his 

    imprecations against himself fully answered, in the day wherein he stands 

    before the tribunal of God– and shall find the killing weight of the curse 

    of God, which he now makes light of.<br/>

     </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>II. THE MISERY OF THE DAMNED</b></font>, 

    under that curse–<br/>

    It is a misery which the tongues of men and angels cannot sufficiently 

    express. God always acts like Himself– as no favors can be compared to His, 

    so also His wrath and terrors are without a parallel.</p>
<p align="justify">As the saints in heaven are advanced to the highest pitch 

    of happiness, so the damned in hell arrive at the height of misery.</p>
<p align="justify">Two things here I shall soberly inquire into– the 

    punishment of 'loss', and the punishment of 'sense', in hell. But since 

    these also are such things as eye has not seen, nor ear heard, we must, as 

    geographers do, leave a large void for the unknown land, which that day will 

    discover.</p>
<p align="justify">A. THE PUNISHMENT OF 'LOSS' WHICH THE DAMNED SHALL 

    UNDERGO IS SEPARATION FROM THE LORD. 'Depart from me, you cursed.' This will 

    be a stone upon their grave's mouth, as 'the talent of lead' (Zech 5:7,8), 

    that will hold them down forever.</p>
<p align="justify">They shall be eternally separated from God and Christ. 

    Christ is the way to the Father– but the way, as for them, shall be 

    everlastingly blocked up. The bridge shall be drawn, and the great gulf 

    fixed; so shall they be shut up in a state of eternal separation from God 

    the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">They will be 'locally' separated from the man Christ and 

    shall never come into the seat of the blessed, where He appears in His 

    glory; but they will be cast out into outer darkness (Mt 22:13).</p>
<p align="justify">They cannot indeed be locally separated from God, they 

    cannot be in a place where He is not; since He is, and will be present 

    everywhere– 'If I make my bed in hell,' says the psalmist, 'behold you are 

    there' (Psalm 139:8). But they shall be miserable beyond expression, in a 

    'relative' separation from God. Though He will be present in the very center 

    of their souls, (if I may so express it), while they are wrapped up in fiery 

    flames, in utter darkness– it shall only be to feed them with the vinegar of 

    His wrath, and to punish them with the emanations of His revenging justice.</p>
<p align="justify">They shall never more taste of His goodness and bounty, 

    nor have the least glimpse of hope from Him. They will see His heart to be 

    absolutely alienated from them, and that it cannot be favorable towards 

    them; that they are the party against whom the Lord will have indignation 

    forever. They shall be deprived of the glorious presence and enjoyment of 

    God– they shall have no part in the beatific vision; nor see anything in God 

    towards them but one wave of wrath rolling after another! This will bring 

    upon them overwhelming floods of sorrow for evermore.</p>
<p align="justify">They shall never taste of the rivers of pleasures which 

    the saints in heaven enjoy; but shall have an everlasting winter and a 

    perpetual night, because the Sun of Righteousness has departed from them and 

    so they are left in utter darkness. So great as heaven's happiness is, so 

    great will their loss be– for they can have none of it forever.</p>
<p align="justify">1. This separation will be AN <b>INVOLUNTARY</b> 

    SEPARATION. 'Now' they depart from Him. They will not come to Him, though 

    they are called and entreated to come.</p>
<p align="justify">But 'then' they shall be driven away from Him, when they 

    would gladly abide with Him. Although the question 'What is your beloved 

    more than another beloved?' is frequent now among the despisers of the 

    Gospel, there will be no such question among all the damned; for then they 

    will see that man's happiness is only to be found in the enjoyment of God, 

    and that the loss of Him is a loss that can never be balanced.</p>
<p align="justify">2. IT WILL BE A TOTAL AND <b>UTTER</b> SEPARATION. Though 

    the wicked are, in this life, separated from God, yet there is a kind of 

    interchange between them– He gives them many good gifts, and they give Him, 

    at least, some good words; so that the peace is not altogether hopeless.</p>
<p align="justify">But 'then' there shall be a total separation, the damned 

    being cast into utter darkness, where there will not be the least gleam of 

    light or favor from the Lord; which will put an end to all their fair words 

    to Him.</p>
<p align="justify">3. IT WILL BE A <b>FINAL</b> SEPARATION. They will part 

    with Him, never more to meet, being shut up under everlasting horror and 

    despair. The match between Jesus Christ and unbelievers, which has so often 

    been carried forward, and put back again, shall then be broken up forever; 

    and never shall one message of favor or goodwill go between the parties 

    anymore.</p>
<p align="justify">This punishment of loss, in a total and final separation 

    from God, is a misery beyond what mortals can conceive, and which the 

    dreadful experience of the damned can only sufficiently unfold. But that we 

    may have some conception of the horror of it, let these following things be 

    considered–<br/>

    (1) God is the chief good; therefore, to be separated from Him, must be the 

    chief evil. Our native country, our relations, and our life, are good, and 

    therefore to be deprived of them we reckon a great evil; and the better 

    anything is, so much the greater evil, is the loss of it. Wherefore, God 

    being the chief good, and no good comparable to Him, there can be no loss so 

    great as the loss of God.</p>
<p align="justify">The full enjoyment of Him is the highest pinnacle of 

    happiness the creature is capable of arriving at. To be fully and finally 

    separated from Him, must then be the lowest step of misery which the 

    rational creature can be reduced to. To be cast off by men, by good men, is 

    distressing; what must it then be, to be rejected of God, of goodness 

    itself?</p>
<p align="justify">(2) God is the fountain of all goodness, from which all 

    goodness flows to the creatures and by which it is continued in them, and to 

    them. Whatever goodness or perfection, natural as well as moral, is in any 

    creature– it is from God, and depends upon Him, as the light is from, and 

    depends on, the sun. For every created being, as such, is a dependent one.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, a total separation from God, wherein all 

    comfortable communication between God and a rational creature is absolutely 

    blocked up, must of necessity bring along with it a total eclipse of all 

    light of comfort and ease whatever. If there is but one window, or open 

    place, in a house, and that be totally shut up, it is evident there can be 

    nothing but darkness in that house.</p>
<p align="justify">Our Lord tells us (Matt 19:17), 'There is none good but 

    one, that is, God.' Nothing good or comfortable is originally from the 

    creature– whatever good or comfortable thing one finds in one's self, as 

    health of body, peace of mind– whatever sweetness, rest, pleasure, or 

    delight, one finds in other creatures, as in food, drink, arts and sciences– 

    all these are but some faint rays of Divine perfections, communicated from 

    God unto the creature, and depending on a constant influence from Him for 

    their being; which failing, they would immediately be gone– for it is 

    impossible that any created thing can be to us more or better than what God 

    makes it to be.</p>
<p align="justify">All the rivulets of comfort we drink of, within or 

    outside of ourselves, come from God as their spring-head. If the course of 

    which towards us being stopped, of necessity they must all dry up. So that 

    when God goes, all that is good and comfortable goes with Him, all ease and 

    quiet of body and mind (Hos 9:12), 'Woe also to them, when I depart from 

    them.'</p>
<p align="justify">When the wicked are totally and finally separated from 

    Him, all that is comfortable in them, or about them, returns to its 

    fountain– as the light goes away with the sun, and darkness succeeds in the 

    room thereof. Thus, in their separation from God, all peace is removed far 

    away from them, and pain in body and anguish of soul, succeed to it.</p>
<p align="justify">All joy goes, and unmixed sorrow settles in them. All 

    quiet and rest separate from them and they are filled with horror and rage. 

    Hope flies away, and despair seizes them. Common operations of the Spirit, 

    which now restrain them, are withdrawn forever, and sin comes to its utmost 

    height. Thus we have a dismal view of the horrible spectacle of sin and 

    misery, which a creature proves when totally separated from God and left to 

    itself; and we may see this separation from God to be the very hell of hell.</p>
<p align="justify">Being separated from God, they are deprived of all good. 

    The good things which they set their hearts upon in this world are beyond 

    their reach there. The covetous man cannot enjoy his wealth there; nor the 

    ambitious man his honors; nor the sensual man his pleasures– no, not a drop 

    of water to cool his tongue (Luke 16:24,25).</p>
<p align="justify">No food or drink there to strengthen the faint; no sleep 

    to refresh the weary– and no music, or pleasant company, to comfort and 

    cheer up the sorrowful. And as for those holy things they despised in the 

    world, they shall never more hear of them, nor see them.</p>
<p align="justify">No offer of Christ there, no pardon, no peace; no wells 

    of salvation in the pit of destruction. In one word, they shall be deprived 

    of whatever might comfort them, being totally and finally separated from 

    God, the fountain of all goodness and comfort.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Man naturally desires to be happy, being conscious to 

    himself that be is not self-sufficient. He forever has a desire of something 

    outside of himself, to make him happy; and the soul being, by its natural 

    make and constitution, capable of enjoying God, and nothing else being 

    commensurable to its desires, it can never have true and solid rest until it 

    rests in the enjoyment of God. This desire of happiness the rational 

    creature can never lay aside, no, not even in hell.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, while the wicked are on earth, they seek their 

    satisfaction in the creature. And when one thing fails, they go to another– 

    thus they spend their time in the world, deceiving their own souls with vain 

    hopes.</p>
<p align="justify">But, in the next world, all comfort in the creatures 

    failing, and the shadows which they are now pursuing having all vanished in 

    a moment, they shall be totally and finally separated from God, and see they 

    have thus lost Him.</p>
<p align="justify">So the doors of earth and heaven both are shut against 

    them at once. This will create them unspeakable anguish, while they shall 

    live under an eternal gnawing hunger after happiness, which they certainly 

    know shall never be in the least measure satisfied, all doors being closed 

    on them.</p>
<p align="justify">Who then can imagine how this separation from God shall 

    cut the damned to the heart! How they will roar and rage under it! How it 

    will sting and gnaw them through the ages of eternity!</p>
<p align="justify">(4) The damned shall know that some are perfectly happy, 

    in the enjoyment of that God from whom they themselves are separated; and 

    this will aggravate the sense of their loss– that they can never have any 

    share with those happy ones.</p>
<p align="justify">Being separated from God, they are separated from the 

    society of the glorified saints and angels. They may see Abraham afar off, 

    and Lazarus in his bosom, but can never come into their company; being, as 

    unclean lepers, thrust outside of the camp, and excommunicated from the 

    presence of the Lord, and of all His holy ones.</p>
<p align="justify">It is the opinion of some, that every person in heaven or 

    hell shall hear and see all that passes in either state. Whatever is to be 

    said for this, we have ground from the Word to conclude that the damned 

    shall have a very accurate knowledge of the happiness of the saints in 

    heaven; for what else can be meant of the rich man in hell seeing Lazarus in 

    Abraham's bosom?</p>
<p align="justify">One thing is plain in this case, that their own torments 

    will give them such notions of the happiness of the saints, as a sick man 

    has of health, or a prisoner has of liberty. And as they cannot fail of 

    reflecting on the happiness of those in heaven, without any hope of 

    attaining to contentment with their own lot, so every thought of that 

    happiness will aggravate their loss.</p>
<p align="justify">It would be a mighty torment to a hungry man, to see 

    others liberally feasting, while he is so chained up as not to have one 

    crumb to stop his gnawing appetite.</p>
<p align="justify">To bring music and dancing before a man laboring under 

    extreme pains, would but increase his anguish. How then will the songs of 

    the blessed, in their enjoyment of God, make the damned mourn under their 

    separation from Him!</p>
<p align="justify">(5) They will remember that time was when they might have 

    been made partakers of the blessed company of saints, in their enjoyment of 

    God– and this will aggravate their sense of the loss. All will remember that 

    there was once a possibility of it; that they were once in the world, in 

    some corners of which the way of salvation was laid open to men's view– and 

    may wish they had gone round the world, until they had found it out.</p>
<p align="justify">Despisers of the Gospel will remember, with bitterness, 

    that Jesus Christ, with all His benefits, was offered to them– that they 

    were exhorted, entreated, and pressed to accept, but would not; and that 

    they were warned of the misery they now feel, and exhorted to flee from the 

    wrath to come, but they would not hearken.</p>
<p align="justify">The Gospel offer slighted will make a hot hell, and the 

    loss of an offered heaven, will be a sinking weight on the spirits of 

    unbelievers in the pit.</p>
<p align="justify">Some will remember that there was a probability of their 

    being eternally happy; that once they seemed to stand fair for it, and were 

    not far from the kingdom of God; that they had once almost consented to the 

    blessed bargain– the pen was in their hand, as it were, to sign the marriage 

    contract between Christ and their souls; but unhappily they dropped it, and 

    turned away from the Lord, to their lusts again.</p>
<p align="justify">Others will remember that they thought themselves sure of 

    heaven, but, being blinded with pride and self-conceit, they were above 

    ordinances, and beyond instruction, and would not examine their state– which 

    was their ruin. But then they will in vain wish that they had reputed 

    themselves the worst of the congregation, and curse the fond conceit they 

    had of themselves, and that others had of them too.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus it will sting the damned, that they might have 

    escaped this loss.</p>
<p align="justify">(6) They will see the loss to be irrecoverable– that they 

    must eternally lie under it, never, never to be repaired.</p>
<p align="justify">Might the damned, after millions of ages in hell, regain 

    what they have lost, it would be some ground of hope; but the prize is gone, 

    and never can be recovered.</p>
<p align="justify">There are two things which will pierce them to the heart–<br/>

    1. That they never knew the worth of it, until it was irrecoverably lost– 

    Should a man give away an earthen pot full of gold for a trifle, not knowing 

    what was in it until it was quite gone from him, and past recovery, how 

    would this foolish action gall him, upon the discovery of the riches in it!</p>
<p align="justify">Such a one's case may be a faint resemblance of the case 

    of despisers of the Gospel, when in hell they lift up their eyes, and behold 

    that to their torment, that which they will not see now to their salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That they have lost it for dross and dung– sold their 

    part of heaven, and not enriched themselves with the price. They have lost 

    heaven for earthly profits and pleasures, and now both are gone together 

    from them.</p>
<p align="justify">The drunkard's cups are gone, the covetous man's gain, 

    the voluptuous man's carnal delights, and the sluggard's ease are gone– 

    nothing is left to comfort them now. The happiness they lost remains indeed, 

    but they can have no part in it forever.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Application– </b>Sinners! be persuaded to come to God 

    through Jesus Christ, uniting with Him through the Mediator; that you may be 

    preserved from this fearful separation from Him. Oh, be afraid to live in a 

    state of separation from God, lest that which you now make your choice 

    become your eternal punishment hereafter.</p>
<p align="justify">Do not reject communion with God, cast not off the 

    communion of saints, for it will be the misery of the damned to be driven 

    out from that communion.</p>
<p align="justify">Cease to build up the wall of separation between God and 

    yourself, by continuing in your sinful courses. Repent rather, in the 

    present time, and so pull the wall down, lest the topstone be laid upon it, 

    and it stand forever between you and happiness.</p>
<p align="justify">Tremble at the thought of rejection and separation from 

    God. By whomsoever men are rejected upon earth, they ordinarily find some 

    pity; but, if you be thus separated from God, you will find all doors shut 

    against you.</p>
<p align="justify">You will find no pity from any in heaven; neither saints 

    nor angels will pity those whom God has utterly cast off. None will pity you 

    in hell, where there is no love, but only loathing– all being loathed of 

    God, loathing Him, and loathing one another.</p>
<p align="justify">This is a day of losses and fears. I show you a loss you 

    would do well to fear in time– be afraid lest you lose God; for if you do, 

    eternity will be spent in roaring out lamentations for this loss.</p>
<p align="justify">Oh horrid stupidity! Men are in a mighty care and concern 

    to prevent worldly losses; but they are in danger of losing the enjoyment of 

    God forever and ever; in danger of losing heaven, the communion of the 

    blessed, and all good things for soul and body in another world; yet they 

    are as careless in that matter as if they were incapable of thought!</p>
<p align="justify">Oh compare this present day with the day our text aims 

    at. Today heaven is opened for those who hitherto have rejected Christ; and 

    yet there is room, if they will come. But in that day the doors shall be 

    shut.</p>
<p align="justify">'Now' Christ is saying unto you, 'Come!' 'Then' be will 

    say– 'Depart!' seeing you would not come when you were invited. 'Now' pity 

    is shown; the Lord pities you, His servants pity you, and tell you that the 

    pit is before you, and cry to you, that you do yourselves no harm. But 

    'then' you shall have no pity from God or man.</p>
<p align="justify">B. THE DAMNED SHALL BE PUNISHED IN HELL WITH THE 

    PUNISHMENT OF <b>'SENSE'</b> AS THEY MUST DEPART FROM GOD INTO EVERLASTING 

    FIRE.</p>
<p align="justify">I am not disposed to dispute what kind of fire it is into 

    which they shall depart, to be tormented forever, whether a material fire or 

    not. Experience will more than satisfy the curiosity of those who are 

    disposed rather to dispute about it, than to seek how to escape it.</p>
<p align="justify">Neither will I meddle with the question, <b>Where</b> is 

    it? It is enough that the worm that never dies, and the fire that is never 

    quenched, will be found somewhere by impenitent sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">1. But, first, I shall prove that, whatever kind of fire 

    it is– it is more vehement and terrible than any fire we on earth are 

    acquainted with.</p>
<p align="justify">Burning is the most terrible punishment, and brings the 

    most intense pain and torment with it. By what reward could a man be induced 

    to hold but his hand in the flame of a candle for one hour?</p>
<p align="justify">All imaginable pleasures on earth will never prevail with 

    the most voluptuous man, to venture to lodge but one half hour in a burning 

    fiery furnace!</p>
<p align="justify">Nor would all the wealth in the world prevail with the 

    most covetous man to do it. Yet, on much lower terms do most men, in effect, 

    expose themselves to everlasting fire in hell, which is more vehement and 

    terrible than any fire we on earth are acquainted with; as will appear by 

    the following considerations–</p>
<p align="justify">(a) As in heaven, grace being brought to its perfection, 

    profit and pleasure also arrive at their height there. So sin, being come to 

    its height in hell, the punishment of evil also arrives at its perfection 

    there.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, as the joys of heaven are far greater than any 

    joys which the saints obtain on earth, so the punishments of hell must be 

    greater than any earthly torments whatever– not only in respect of the 

    continuance of them, but also in respect of vehemence and intenseness.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Why are the things of another world represented to us 

    in an earthly dress, in the Word, but because the weakness of our capacities 

    in such matters, which the Lord is pleased to condescend unto, requires it. 

    It being always supposed, that the things of the other world are in their 

    kind more perfect than those by which they are represented.</p>
<p align="justify">When heaven is represented to us under the notion of a 

    city, with gates of pearl and the street of gold, we do not expect to find 

    gold and pearls there, which are so mightily prized on earth, but something 

    more excellent than the finest and most precious things in this world.</p>
<p align="justify">When therefore, we hear of hell-fire, it is necessary we 

    understand by it something more vehement, piercing, and tormenting, than any 

    fire ever seen by our eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">And here it is worth considering, that the torments of 

    hell are held forth under several other notions than that of fire alone. And 

    the reason of it is plain– namely, that hereby what of horror is lacking in 

    one notion of hell, is supplied by another.</p>
<p align="justify">Why is heaven's happiness represented under the various 

    notions of a treasure, a paradise, a feast, a rest, and so forth; but that 

    there is not one of these things sufficient to express it?</p>
<p align="justify">Even so, hell-torments are represented under the notion 

    of 'fire' which the damned are cast into. A dreadful representation indeed, 

    yet not sufficient to express the misery of the state of sinners in them!

    </p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, we hear also of 'the second death', for the 

    damned in hell shall be ever dying.</p>
<p align="justify">And the 'wine-press of the wrath of God', wherein they 

    will be trodden in anger, trampled in the Lord's fury, pressed, broken and 

    bruised, without end.</p>
<p align="justify">And 'the worm that does not die', which shall eternally 

    gnaw them.</p>
<p align="justify">And 'a bottomless pit,' where they will be ever sinking.</p>
<p align="justify">It is not simply called 'a fire,' but the 'lake' of fire 

    and brimstone, 'a lake of fire burning with brimstone'– which one can 

    imagine nothing more dreadful.</p>
<p align="justify">Yet, because fire gives light; and light, as Solomon 

    observes (Ecc.11:7), is sweet; there is no light there, but only darkness, 

    utter darkness!</p>
<p align="justify">For they must have an everlasting night, since nothing 

    can be there which is in any measure comfortable or refreshing.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Our fire cannot affect a spirit, but by way of 

    sympathy with the body to which it is united. But hell-fire will not only 

    pierce into the bodies, but also go directly into the souls of the damned, 

    for it is 'prepared for the devil and his angels,' those wicked spirits, 

    whom no fire on earth can hurt.</p>
<p align="justify">Job complains heavily, under the chastisements of God's 

    fatherly hand, saying, 'The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison 

    whereof drinks up my spirit' (Job 6:4).</p>
<p align="justify">But how will the spirits of the damned be pierced with 

    the arrows of revenging justice! How will they be drunk up with the poison 

    of the curse of these arrows!</p>
<p align="justify">How vehement must that fire be which pierces directly 

    into the soul, and makes an everlasting burning in the spirit, the most 

    lively and tender part of a man, wherein wounds or pains are most 

    intolerable!</p>
<p align="justify">(d) The preparation of this fire proves the inexpressible 

    vehemency and dreadfulness of it. The text calls it, 'prepared' yes, 'the 

    prepared fire,' by way of eminence.</p>
<p align="justify">As the three children were not cast into ordinary fire, 

    but a fire prepared for a particular purpose which therefore was exceeding 

    hot, the furnace being heated seven times more than ordinary, so the damned 

    shall find in hell a prepared fire, the like to which was never prepared by 

    human are.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a fire of God's own preparing– the product of 

    infinite wisdom, with a particular purpose– to demonstrate the most strict 

    and severe divine justice against sin; which may sufficiently evidence to us 

    the inconceivably intenseness thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">God always acts in a peculiar way, becoming His infinite 

    greatness, whether for or against the creature– therefore, as the things He 

    has prepared for them that love Him are great and good beyond expression or 

    conception, so one may conclude that the things He has prepared against 

    those who hate Him are great and terrible beyond what men can either say or 

    think of them!</p>
<p align="justify">The pile of Tophet is 'fire and much wood;' the coals of 

    that fire are 'coals of juniper,' a kind of wood which, set on fire, burns 

    most fiercely (Psalm 120:4); 'and the breath of the Lord, like a stream of 

    brimstone, does kindle it' (Isa 30:33).</p>
<p align="justify">Fire is more or less violent, according to the substance 

    of it, and the breath by which it is blown. What heart, then, can fully 

    conceive the horror of coals of juniper, blown up with the breath of the 

    Lord?</p>
<p align="justify">No, God Himself will be a consuming fire (Deut 4:24) to 

    the damned; intimately present, as a devouring fire, in their souls and 

    bodies.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a fearful thing to fall into a fire, or to be shut 

    up in a fiery furnace, on earth! But the terror of these vanishes, when we 

    consider how fearful it is to fall into the hands of the living God, which 

    is the lot of the damned! For 'Who shall dwell with devouring fire? Who 

    shall dwell with everlasting burnings?' (Isa 33:14).</p>
<p align="justify">2. As to the second point proposed, namely, the 

    properties of the fiery torments in hell–<br/>

    (a) They will be universal torments, every part of the creature being 

    tormented in that flame. When one is cast into a fiery furnace, the fire 

    makes its way into the very heart, and leaves no member untouched.</p>
<p align="justify">What part, then, can have ease, when the damned 'swim' in 

    a lake of fire, burning with brimstone? There will their bodies be tormented 

    and scorched forever.</p>
<p align="justify">And as they sinned, so shall they be tormented, in all 

    the parts thereof, that they shall have no sound side to turn to– for what 

    soundness or ease can there be to any part of that body, which being 

    separated from God, and all refreshment from Him, is still in the pangs of 

    the second death, ever dying, but never dead?</p>
<p align="justify">But as the soul was chief in sinning, it will be chief in 

    suffering too, being filled quite full of the wrath of a sin-avenging God.</p>
<p align="justify">The damned shall be forever under the deepest impressions 

    of God's vindictive justice against them– and this fire will melt their 

    souls within them, like wax.</p>
<p align="justify">Who knows the power of that wrath which had such an 

    effect on the Mediator standing in the room of sinners (Psalm 22:14)– 'My 

    heart is like wax, it is melted in the midst of me.'</p>
<p align="justify">Their minds shall be filled with the terrible 

    apprehensions of God's implacable wrath– and whatever they can think upon, 

    past, present, or to come, will aggravate their torment and anguish.</p>
<p align="justify">Their will shall be crossed in all things for evermore. 

    As their will was ever contrary to the will of God's precepts, so God, in 

    His dealing with them in the other world, shall have war with their will 

    forever. What they would like to have, they shall not in the least obtain. 

    But what they do not want, shall be bound upon them without remedy.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence, no pleasant affection shall ever spring up in 

    their hearts any more; their love of comfort, joy, and delight, in any 

    object whatever, shall be plucked up by the root. They will be filled with 

    hatred, fury, and rage against God, themselves, and their fellow-creatures, 

    whether happy in heaven, or miserable in hell, as they themselves are.</p>
<p align="justify">They will be sunk in sorrow, racked with anxiety, filled 

    with horror, galled to the heart with fretting, and continually darted with 

    despair– which will make them weep, gnash their teeth, and blaspheme 

    forever.</p>
<p align="justify">'Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him 

    into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth' (Matt 

    22:13). 'And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone 

    about the weight of a talent– and men blasphemed God because of the hail; 

    for the plague thereof was exceeding great,.' (Rev 16:21).</p>
<p align="justify">Conscience will be a worm to gnaw and prey upon them; 

    remorse for their sins shall seize them and torment them forever, and they 

    shall not be able to shake it off, as once they did; for 'in hell their worm 

    does not die.' (Mark 9:44,46).</p>
<p align="justify">Their memory will serve but to aggravate their torment 

    and every new reflection will bring another pang of anguish (Luke 16:25), 

    'But Abraham said,' to the rich man in hell, 'Son, remember that you in your 

    lifetime received your good things.'</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The torments in hell are manifold. Imagine the case 

    that a man were, at one and the same time, under the violence of the gout, 

    stone, and whatever diseases and pains have ever met together in one body– 

    the torment of such a one would be but light in comparison to the torments 

    of the dammed.</p>
<p align="justify">For, as in hell there is an absence of all that is good 

    and desirable, so there is the convergence of all evils there; since all the 

    effects of sin and of the curse take their place in it, after the last 

    judgment. (Rev 20:14), 'And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.'</p>
<p align="justify">There they will find a prison they can never escape out 

    of; a lake of fire, where they will be ever swimming and burning; a pit, of 

    which they will never find a bottom. The worm that does not die shall feed 

    on them, as on bodies which are interred. The fire that is not quenched 

    shall devour them, as dead bodies which are burned. Their eyes shall be kept 

    in blackness of darkness, without the least comfortable gleam of light. 

    Their ears shall be filled with frightful yellings of the infernal crew. 

    They shall taste nothing but the sharpness of God's wrath, the dregs of the 

    cup of His fury! The stench of the burning lake of brimstone will be the 

    smell there. And they shall feel extreme pains for evermore.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) They will be most intense and vehement torments, 

    causing 'weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth' (Matt 13:42, 22:13). They 

    are represented to us under the notion of pangs in childbirth, which are 

    very sharp and acute.</p>
<p align="justify">So says the rich man in hell (Luke 16:24), 'I am 

    tormented,' that is, as one in the pangs of child-bearing, 'in this flame.' 

    Ah! dreadful pangs! Horrible travail, in which both soul and body are in 

    pangs together! Helpless anguish, hopeless and endless!</p>
<p align="justify">The word used for hell (Matt 5:22), and in various other 

    places of the New Testament, properly denotes the valley of Hinnom, the name 

    being taken from the valley of the children of Hinnom, in which was Tophet 

    (2 Kings 23:10), where idolaters offered their children to Moloch. This is 

    said to have been a great bronze idol, with arms like a man's– which being 

    heated by fire within it, the child was set in the burning arms of the idol. 

    And, that the parent might not hear the shrieks of the child burning to 

    death, they beat drums in the time of the horrible sacrifice; whence the 

    place had the name of Tophet.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus th<b>e intenseness of the torments</b> in hell are 

    pointed out to us.</p>
<p align="justify">Some have endured grievous tortures on earth with 

    surprising obstinacy and undaunted courage. But men's courage will fail them 

    there, when they find themselves fallen into the hands of the living God– 

    and no escape to be expected forever.</p>
<p align="justify">It is true, there will be degrees of torments in hell– 

    'It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for Chorazin and 

    Bethsaida' (Matt 11:21,22). But the least load of wrath there will be 

    insupportable; for how can the heart of the creature endure, or his hands be 

    strong, when God Himself is a consuming fire to him?</p>
<p align="justify">When the tares are bound in bundles for the fire, there 

    will be "bundles" of covetous persons, of drunkards, profane sweaters, 

    unclean persons, formal hypocrites, unbelievers, and despisers of the 

    Gospel, and the like.</p>
<p align="justify">The several "bundles" being cast into hell-fire, some 

    will burn more vehemently than others, according as their sins have been 

    more heinous than those of others– a fiercer flame shall seize the bundle of 

    the profane, than the bundle of unsanctified moralists.</p>
<p align="justify">The furnace will be hotter to those who have sinned 

    against light, than to those who lived in darkness (Luke 12:47,48), "That 

    servant which knew his lord's will, and did not do it, shall be beaten with 

    many stripes. But he who knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, 

    shall be beaten with few stripes.'</p>
<p align="justify">But the sentence common to them all– (Matt 13:30), 'Bind 

    them in bundles to burn them,' speaks of the great vehemency and fierceness 

    of the lowest degree of torment in hell.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) The torments will be uninterrupted. There is no 

    intermission there– no ease, no, not for a moment. They 'shall be tormented 

    day and night forever and ever'. Few are so troubled in this world, but 

    sometimes they get rest. But the damned shall get none. They took their rest 

    in the time appointed of God for their labor.</p>
<p align="justify">Storms are rarely seen, without some space between the 

    showers. But there is no intermission in the storm that falls on the wicked 

    in hell. There, deep will be calling unto deep, and the waves of wrath 

    continually rolling over them. There, the heavens will be always black to 

    them, and they shall have a perpetual night, but no rest (Rev 14:11), "They 

    have no rest day nor night.'</p>
<p align="justify">(e) They will be unpitied. The punishments inflicted on 

    the greatest malefactors on earth draw forth some compassion from the 

    spectators. But the damned shall have none to pity them.</p>
<p align="justify">God will not pity them, but laugh at their calamity (Prov 

    1:26). The blessed company in heaven shall rejoice in the execution of God's 

    righteous judgment, and sing while their smoke rises up forever and ever 

    (Rev 19:3), 'And again they said, Hallelujah! And her smoke rose up forever 

    and ever.'</p>
<p align="justify">No compassion can be expected from the devil and his 

    angels, who delight in the ruin of the children of men, and are and will be 

    forever void of pity. Neither will one person pity another there, where 

    every one is weeping and gnashing his teeth, under his own insupportable 

    anguish and pain.</p>
<p align="justify">There, natural affection will be extinguished– parents 

    will not love their children, nor children their parents; the mother will 

    not pity the daughter in these flames, nor will the daughter pity the 

    mother; the son will show no regard to his father there, nor the servant to 

    his master, where every one will be groaning under his own torment.</p>
<p align="justify">(f) To complete their misery, their torments shall be 

    eternal! 'And the smoke of their torments ascends up forever and ever.' Ah! 

    what a frightful case is this– to be tormented in the whole body and soul, 

    and that not with one kind of torment, but many; all of these most acute, 

    and all this without any intermission, and without pity from any!</p>
<p align="justify">What heart can conceive those things without horror? 

    Nevertheless, if this most miserable case were at length to have an end, 

    that would afford some comfort.</p>
<p align="justify">But the torments of the damned will have no end!</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Application–<br/>
</b>1. Learn from this the evil of sin. It is a stream that will carry down 

    the sinner, until he is swallowed up in the ocean of wrath!</p>
<p align="justify">The pleasures of sin are bought too dear, at the rate of 

    everlasting burnings. What did the rich man's purple clothing and sumptuous 

    food avail him, when in hell he was encircled by purple flames, and could 

    not have a drop of water to cool his tongue?</p>
<p align="justify">Alas! that men should indulge themselves in sin which 

    will bring such bitterness in the end! That they should drink so greedily of 

    the poisonous cup, and hug that serpent in their bosom that will sting them 

    to the heart!</p>
<p align="justify">2. What a God He is with whom we have to do! What hatred 

    He bears to sin, and how severely He punishes it!</p>
<p align="justify">Know that the Lord is most just, as well as most 

    merciful, but do not think that He is such an one as you are! Away with the 

    fatal mistake before it be too late (Ps 50:21-2), "You thought that I was 

    altogether such an one as yourself– but I will reprove you, and set them in 

    order before your eyes. Now consider this, you that forget God, lest I tear 

    you in pieces, and there be none to deliver."</p>
<p align="justify">The fire prepared for the devil and his angels, dark as 

    it is, will discover God to be a severe revenger of sin. See the absolute 

    necessity of fleeing to the Lord Jesus Christ by faith; and also the same 

    necessity of repentance, and holiness of heart and life.</p>
<p align="justify">The avenger of blood is pursuing you, O sinner! Haste and 

    escape to the city of refuge! Wash now in the fountain of the Mediator's 

    blood, that you may not perish in the lake of fire! Open your heart to Him, 

    lest the pit close its mouth on you! Leave your sins, else they will ruin 

    you; kill them, else they will be your death forever!</p>
<p align="justify">Let not the terror of hell-fire put you upon hardening 

    your heart more, as it may do, if you entertain that wicked thought, 'There 

    is no hope' (Jer 2:25), which, perhaps, is more common among the hearers of 

    the gospel than many are aware of. But there is hope for the worst of 

    sinners, who will come to Jesus Christ!</p>
<p align="justify">If there are no good qualifications in you, as certainly 

    there can be none in a sinful man, none in any man but what are received 

    from Christ; know that He has not suspended your welcome on any good 

    qualifications– take Him and His salvation freely offered to all to whom the 

    Gospel comes. 'Whoever will, let him take the water of life freely' (Rev 

    22:17). 'Him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out' (John 6:37).</p>
<p align="justify">It is true, you are a sinful creature, and cannot repent; 

    you are unholy, and cannot make yourself holy. No, you have attempted to 

    repent, to forsake sin, and to be holy, but still failed of repentance, 

    reformation, and holiness; and therefore, you said– 'There is no hope. No, 

    for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.' Truly, no wonder that 

    the success has not answered your expectation, since you have always begun 

    your work amiss. But first of all honor God, by believing the testimony He 

    has given of His Son, namely, that eternal life is in Him– and honor the Son 

    of God, by believing in Him, that is– embracing and falling in with the free 

    offer of Christ, and of His salvation from sin and from wrath, made to you 

    in the Gospel; trusting in Him confidently for righteousness to your 

    justification, and also for sanctification; seeing 'of God he is made unto 

    us' both 'righteousness and sanctification' (1 Cor 1:30). Then, if you have 

    as much credit to give to the Word of God, as you would allow to the word of 

    an honest man, offering you a gift, and saying, 'Take it, and it is yours'; 

    you may believe that God is your God, Christ is yours, His salvation is 

    yours, your sins are pardoned, you have strength in Him for repentance and 

    for holiness; for all these are made over to you in the free offer of the 

    gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">Believing on the Son of God, you are justified, the curse 

    is removed. But while it lies upon you, how is it possible you should bring 

    forth the fruits of holiness? But, if the curse is removed, that death which 

    seized on you with the first Adam, according to the threatening (Gen 2:17), 

    is taken away. In consequence of which, you will find the bands of 

    wickedness, now holding you fast in impenitence, broken asunder, as also the 

    bands of death. So as you will be able to repent indeed from the heart– you 

    will find the spirit of life returned to your soul, on whose departure that 

    death ensued, so as thenceforth you will be enabled to live unto 

    righteousness.</p>
<p align="justify">No man's case is so bad, but it may be mended this way, 

    in time, to be perfectly right in eternity. And no man's case is so good, 

    but, another way being taken, it will be ruined for time and eternity too.<br/>

<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>III. THE DAMNED SHALL HAVE THE 

    SOCIETY OF DEVILS IN THEIR MISERABLE STATE IN HELL–<br/>
</b></font>For they must depart into "fire prepared for the devil and his 

    angels." O horrible company! O frightful association! Who would choose to 

    dwell in a palace haunted by devils? To be confined to the most pleasant 

    spot of earth, with the devil and his infernal furies, would be a most 

    terrible confinement. How would men's hearts fail them, and their hair stand 

    up, finding themselves environed with the hellish crew!</p>
<p align="justify">But, ah! how much more terrible must it be, to be cast 

    with the devils into one fire, locked up with them in one dungeon, shut up 

    with them in one pit!</p>
<p align="justify">To be closed up in a den of roaring lions, girded about 

    with serpents, surrounded with venomous asps, and to have the heart eaten 

    out by vipers, altogether and at once, is a comparison too low to show the 

    misery of the damned, shut up in hell with the devil and his angels!</p>
<p align="justify">They go about now as roaring lions, seeking whom they may 

    devour. But then they shall be confined in their den with their prey. They 

    shall be filled with the wrath of God, and receive the full torment (Matt 

    8:29), which they tremble in expectation of (James 2:19), being cast into 

    the fire prepared for them.</p>
<p align="justify">How will these lions roar and tear! How will these 

    serpents hiss! These dragons cast out fire! What horrible anguish will seize 

    the damned, finding themselves in the lake of fire with the devil who 

    deceived them! drawn there with the silken cords of temptation by these 

    wicked spirits! and bound with them in everlasting chains under darkness!</p>
<p align="justify">'And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake 

    of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall 

    be tormented day and night forever and ever.' (Rev 20:10)</p>
<p align="justify">O that men would consider this in time, renounce the 

    devil and his lusts, and join themselves to the Lord in faith and holiness! 

    Why should men choose such company in this world, and delight in such 

    society, as they would not desire to associate with in the next world? Those 

    who like not the company of the saints on earth will get none of it in 

    eternity; but, as godless company is their delight now, they will afterwards 

    get enough of it, when they have eternity to pass in the roaring and 

    blaspheming society of devils and reprobates in hell! Let those who use to 

    invocate the devil to take them, soberly consider that the company so often 

    invited will be terrible at last, when come.<br/>

     </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>IV. THE ETERNITY OF THE WHOLE–<br/>
</b></font>And, Lastly, Let us consider the eternity of the whole, the 

    everlasting continuance of the miserable state of the damned in hell.</p>
<p align="justify">A. If I could, I would show WHAT ETERNITY IS, I mean, the 

    creature's eternity. But who can measure the waters of the ocean? Or who can 

    tell you the days, years, and ages of eternity, which are infinitely more 

    than the drops of the ocean?</p>
<p align="justify">None can comprehend eternity but the eternal God. 

    Eternity is an ocean whereof we shall never see the shore; it is a deep 

    where we can find no bottom; a labyrinth from whence we cannot extricate 

    ourselves, and where we shall ever lose the door. There are two things we 

    may say of it–<br/>

    1. It has a beginning. God's eternity has no beginning, but the creature's 

    has. Once there was no lake of fire; and those who have been there for some 

    hundreds of years, were once in time, as we now are.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It shall never have an end. The first who entered into 

    the eternity of woe is as far from the end of it as the last who shall go 

    there will be at his entry. They who have launched out furthest into that 

    ocean are as far from land as they were the first moment they went into it– 

    and, thousands of ages after this they will be as far from it as ever. 

    Wherefore eternity, which is before us, is a duration that has a beginning 

    but no end.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a beginning without a middle, a beginning without 

    an end. After millions of years passed in it, still it is beginning! God's 

    wrath in hell will ever be the wrath to come! There is no middle in 

    eternity! When millions of ages are past in eternity, what is past bears no 

    proportion to what is to come– no, not so much as one drop of water, falling 

    from the tip of one's finger, as compared to all the waters of the ocean.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no end of it– while God is, it shall be. It is 

    an entry without an end to it, a continual succession of ages, a glass 

    always running, which shall never run out.</p>
<p align="justify">Observe the continual succession of hours, days, months, 

    and years, how one still follows upon another; and think of eternity, 

    wherein there is a continual succession without end. When you go out at 

    night and behold the stars of heaven, how they cannot be numbered for 

    multitude, think of the ages of eternity; consider also, there is a certain 

    definite number of stars, but no number of the ages of eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">When you see water running in a river, think how vain a 

    thing it would be to sit down by it, and wait until it should run out, that 

    you may pass over; observe how new water still succeeds to that which passes 

    by you– and therein you have an image of eternity, which is a river that 

    never dries up.</p>
<p align="justify">They who wear rings have an image of eternity on their 

    fingers; and they who handle the wheel have an emblem of eternity before 

    them– for to whichever part of the ring or wheel we look, one will still see 

    another part beyond it; and on whatever moment of eternity you meditate, 

    there is still another beyond it.</p>
<p align="justify">When you are abroad in the fields, and behold the blades 

    of grass on the earth, which no man can reckon, think with yourselves, that, 

    were as many thousands of years to come, as there are blades of grass on the 

    ground, even those would have an end at length; but eternity will have none.</p>
<p align="justify">When you look to a mountain, imagine in your hearts how 

    long would it be before that mountain should be removed by a little bird 

    coming but once every thousand years, and carrying away but one grain of the 

    dust of it– the mountain would at length be removed that way, and brought to 

    an end; but eternity will never end.</p>
<p align="justify">Suppose this with respect to all the mountains of the 

    earth, no, with respect to the whole globe itself– the grains of dust of 

    which the whole of it is made up are not infinite; and therefore the last 

    grain would, at length, come to be carried away, as seen above– yet eternity 

    would be, in effect, but beginning.</p>
<p align="justify">These are some crude emblems of eternity! And now add 

    misery and woe to this eternity, what tongue can express it? What heart can 

    conceive it? In what balance can that misery and that woe be weighed?</p>
<p align="justify">B. Let us take A VIEW OF WHAT IS ETERNAL, IN THE STATE OF 

    THE DAMNED IN HELL– Whatever is included in the fearful torments of their 

    state, is everlasting– therefore all the doleful ingredients of their 

    miserable state will be everlasting–they will never end.</p>
<p align="justify">The text expressly declares the fire, into which they 

    must depart, to be everlasting fire. And our Lord elsewhere tells us, that 

    in hell, the fire never shall be quenched (Mark 9:43). He had an eye to the 

    valley of Hinnom, in which, besides the before mentioned fire for burning 

    the children to Molech, there was also another fire burning continually, to 

    consume the dead carcasses and filth of Jerusalem– so the Scripture, 

    representing hell-fire by the fire of that valley, speaks of it not only to 

    be most intense, but also everlasting. Seeing, then, the damned must depart, 

    as cursed ones, into everlasting fire, it is evident that–</p>
<p align="justify">(1) The damned themselves shall be eternal; they will 

    have a being for ever, and will never be substantially destroyed or 

    annihilated.</p>
<p align="justify">To what end is the fire eternal, if those who are cast 

    into it be not eternally in it? It is plain, the everlasting continuance of 

    the fire is an aggravation of the misery of the damned. But, surely, if they 

    be annihilated, or substantially destroyed, it would be all the same to 

    them, whether the fire be everlasting or not. No, but they depart into 

    everlasting fire, to be everlastingly punished in it. (Matt 25:46), 'These 

    shall go away into everlasting punishment.' Thus the execution of the 

    sentence is a certain discovery of the meaning of it.</p>
<p align="justify">The worm, that dies not, must have a subject to live in– 

    they, who shall have no rest, day nor night (Rev 14:11), but shall be 

    'tormented day and night forever and ever' (Rev 20:10). They will certainly 

    have a being for ever and ever, and not be brought into a state of eternal 

    rest in annihilation.</p>
<p align="justify">Destroyed indeed they shall be– but their destruction 

    will be an everlasting destruction (2 Thess 1:9); a destruction of their 

    well-being, but not of their being. What is destroyed is not therefore 

    annihilated– 'Are you come to destroy us?' said the devil unto Jesus Christ 

    (Luke 4:34). The devils are afraid of torment, not of annihilation (Matt 

    8:29), 'Are you come here to torment us before the time?'</p>
<p align="justify">The state of the damned is indeed a state of death; but 

    such a death it is as is opposite only to a happy life, as is clear from 

    other notions of their state, which necessarily include eternal existence. 

    As they who are dead in sin are dead to God and holiness, yet alive to sin– 

    so dying in hell they live, but separated from God and His favor, in which 

    is life (Psalm 30:5). They shall ever be under the pangs of death; ever 

    dying, but never dead, or absolutely void of life.</p>
<p align="justify">How desirable would such a death be to them! But it will 

    flee from them forever. Could they kill one another there, or could they, 

    with their own hands, tear themselves into lifeless pieces, their misery 

    would quickly be at an end. But there they must live, whom chose death and 

    refused life; for there death lives, and the end ever begins.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) The curse shall lie upon them eternally, as the 

    everlasting chain to hold them in the everlasting fire– a chain that shall 

    never be loosed, being fixed forever about them by the dreadful sentence of 

    the eternal judgment. This chain, which spurns the united force of devils 

    held fast by it, is too strong to be broken by men, who being solemnly 

    anathematized and devoted to destruction., can never be recovered to any 

    other use.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Their punishment shall be eternal. 'These shall go 

    away into everlasting punishment.' They will be forever separated from God 

    and Christ, and from the society of the holy angels and saints, between them 

    an impassable gulf will be fixed– 'And besides all this, between us and you 

    a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you 

    cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'</p>
<p align="justify">They shall forever have the horrible society of the devil 

    and his angels. There will be no change of company forever in that region of 

    darkness. Their torment in the fire will be everlasting– they must live 

    forever in it.</p>
<p align="justify">Several authors, both ancient and modern, tell us of 

    earth-flax, or salamander's hairs, that cloth made of it, being cast into 

    the fire, is so far from being burnt or consumed, that it is only made clean 

    thereby, as other things are by washing. But however that is, it is certain 

    the damned shall be tormented forever and ever in hell-fire, and not 

    substantially destroyed (Rev 20:10). And indeed nothing is annihilated by 

    fire, but only dissolved. Of whatever nature hell-fire is, no question, the 

    same God who kept the bodies of the three children from burning in 

    Nebuchadnezzar's fiery furnace, can also keep the bodies of the damned from 

    any such dissolution by hell-fire as may infer privation of life.</p>
<p align="justify">(4) Their knowledge and 'sense' of their misery shall be 

    eternal, and they shall assuredly know that it will be eternal. How 

    desirable would it be to them to have their 'sense' forever locked up, and 

    to lose the consciousness of their own misery–as one may rationally suppose 

    it to fare at length with some, in the punishment of death inflicted on them 

    on earth, and as it is with some insane people; but that agrees not with the 

    notion of torment forever and ever, nor the worm that dies not.</p>
<p align="justify">No, they will ever have a lively feeling of their misery, 

    and strongest impressions of the wrath of God against them. And that 

    dreadful intimation of the eternity of their punishment, made to them by 

    their Judge, in their sentence, will fix such impressions of the 'eternity 

    of their miserable state' upon their minds, as they will never be able to 

    lay it aside; but will continue with them evermore, to complete their 

    misery.</p>
<p align="justify">This will fill them with everlasting despair; a most 

    tormenting passion, which will continually rend their hearts, as it were, in 

    a thousand pieces.</p>
<p align="justify">To see floods of wrath ever coming, and never to cease; 

    to be forever in torment, and to know that there shall never, never be a 

    release, will be the topstone put on the misery of the damned!</p>
<p align="justify">If hope deferred makes the heart sick' (Prov 13:12), how 

    killing will it be for hope to be rooted up, slain outright, and buried 

    forever out of the creature's sight!</p>
<p align="justify">This will fill them with hatred and rage against God, 

    their known irreconcilable enemy; and under it, they will roar forever, like 

    wild bulls in a net, and fill the pit with blasphemies evermore.</p>
<p align="justify">I might here show the reasonableness of the eternity of 

    the punishment of the damned– but, having already spoken of it, in 

    vindicating the justice of God, in His subjecting men in their natural state 

    to eternal wrath, I only remind you of three things–<br/>

    1. The infinite dignity of the party offended by sin requires an infinite 

    punishment to be inflicted for the vindication of His honor, since the 

    demerit of sin rises according to the dignity and excellence of the person 

    against whom it is committed.</p>
<p align="justify">The party offended is the great God, the chief good– the 

    offender a vile worm; in respect to perfection, infinitely distant from God, 

    to whom he is indebted for all the good that he ever had. This then requires 

    an infinite punishment to be inflicted on the sinner; which, since it cannot 

    in him be infinite in value, must needs be infinite in duration, that is to 

    say, eternal.</p>
<p align="justify">Sin is a kind of infinite evil, as it wrongs an infinite 

    God; and the guilt and defilement of it is never taken away, but endures 

    forever, unless the Lord Himself in mercy remove it.</p>
<p align="justify">God, who is offended, is eternal; His being never comes 

    to an end– the sinful soul is immortal, and the man shall live forever. The 

    sinner, being without strength (Rom 5:6) to expiate his guilt, can never put 

    away the offence; therefore it ever remains, unless the Lord put it away 

    Himself, as in the elect, by His Son's blood.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore the party offended, the offender, and the 

    offence, forever remaining, the punishment cannot but be eternal!</p>
<p align="justify">2. The sinner would have continued the course of his 

    provocations against God forever without end, if God had not put a check to 

    it by death. As long as they were capable of acting against Him in this 

    world, they did it– and therefore justly will He act against them, while He 

    is; that is, forever.</p>
<p align="justify">God, who judges of the will, intents, and inclinations of 

    the heart, may justly do against sinners, in punishing, as they would have 

    done against Him in sinning.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Though I put not the stress of the matter here, yet it 

    is just and reasonable that the damned suffer eternally, since they will sin 

    eternally in hell, gnashing their teeth (Matt 8:12), under their pain, in 

    rage, envy, and grudge (compare Acts 7:54; Psalm 112:10; Luke 13:28), and 

    blaspheming God there (Rev 16:21) while they are driven away in their 

    wickedness (Prov 14:32).</p>
<p align="justify">That the wicked be punished for their wickedness is just, 

    and it is in no way inconsistent with justice that the being of the creature 

    be continued forever– wherefore it is just that the damned, continuing 

    wicked eternally, do suffer eternally for their wickedness.</p>
<p align="justify">The misery, under which they sin, can neither free them 

    from the debt of obedience, nor excuse their sinning and make it blameless. 

    The creature, as a creature, is bound unto obedience to his Creator; and no 

    punishment inflicted on him can free him from it, any more than the 

    malefactor's prison, irons, whipping, and the like, set him at liberty 

    again, to commit the crimes for which he is imprisoned or whipped.</p>
<p align="justify">Neither can the torments of the dammed excuse, or make 

    blameless, their horrible sinning under them, any more than exquisite pains, 

    inflicted upon men on earth, can excuse their murmuring, fretting, and 

    blaspheming against God under them.</p>
<p align="justify">It is not the wrath of God, but their own wicked nature, 

    that is the true cause of their sinning under it; for the holy Jesus bore 

    the wrath of God without so much as one unbecoming thought of God, and far 

    less any one unbecoming word.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Application</b> <br/>

    1. Here is a measuring rod– O that men would apply it! Apply it to your own 

    time in this world, and you will find your time to be very short. A prospect 

    of much time to come, proves the ruin of many souls. Men will be reckoning 

    their time by 'years', like that rich man (Luke 12:19-20), when, it may be, 

    there are not many 'hours' of it to run. But reckon as you will, laying your 

    time to the measuring reed of eternity, you will see your age is as nothing. 

    What a small and inconsiderable point is sixty, eighty, or a hundred years, 

    in respect of eternity! Compared with eternity, there is a greater 

    disproportion than between a hair's breadth and the circumference of the 

    whole earth.</p>
<p align="justify">Why do we then sleep in such a short day, while we are in 

    danger of losing rest through the long night of eternity?</p>
<p align="justify">Apply it to your endeavors for salvation, and they will 

    be found very scanty. When men are pressed to diligence in their salvation 

    work, they are ready to say, 'To what purpose is this waste?'</p>
<p align="justify">Alas! if it were to be judged by our diligence, what end 

    it is that we have in view; as to the most part of us, no man could thereby 

    conjecture that we have eternity in view. If we duly considered eternity, we 

    could not but conclude, that, to leave no appointed means of God untried 

    until we get our salvation secured– to refuse rest or comfort in anything, 

    until we are sheltered under the wings of the Mediator– to pursue our great 

    interest with the utmost vigor to cut off lusts dear as right hands and 

    right eyes– to set our faces resolutely against all difficulties– and fight 

    our way through all opposition made by the devil, the world, and the flesh. 

    These are, all of them together, little enough for eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Here is a balance of the sanctuary, by which we may 

    understand the lightness of what is falsely thought weighty; and the weight 

    of some things, by many reckoned to be very light.</p>
<p align="justify">Some things seem very weighty, which, weighed in this 

    balance, will be found very light–<br/>

    (a) Weigh the world, and all that is in it, the lust of the flesh, the lust 

    of the eyes, and the pride of life, and the whole will be found light in the 

    balance of eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">Weigh herein all worldly profits, gains, and advantages; 

    and you will quickly see, that a thousand worlds will not compensate for an 

    eternity of woe! 'For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole 

    world, and lose his own soul?' (Matt 16:26). Weigh the pleasures of sin, 

    which are but for a season, with the fire that is everlasting, and you show 

    yourself to be fools and madmen, to run the hazard of losing the one for the 

    other.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Weigh your afflictions in this balance, and you will 

    find the heaviest of them very light, in respect of the weight of eternal 

    anguish. Impatience under affliction, especially when worldly troubles so 

    embitter men's spirits that they cannot relish the glad tidings of the 

    Gospel, speaks great regardlessness of eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">As a small and inconsiderable loss will be very little at 

    heart with him who sees himself in danger of losing his whole estate; so 

    troubles in the world will appear but light to him who has a lively view of 

    eternity. Such a one will stoop and take up his cross, whatever it be, 

    thinking it enough to escape eternal wrath.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Weigh the most difficult and uneasy duties of 

    religion here, and you will no more reckon the yoke of Christ insupportable.</p>
<p align="justify">Repentance and bitter mourning for sin, on earth, are 

    very light in comparison of eternal weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth 

    in hell! To wrestle with God in prayer, weeping and making supplication for 

    the blessing in time, is far easier than to lie under the curse through all 

    eternity! Mortification of the most beloved lust is a light thing in 

    comparison with the second death in hell!</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Weigh your convictions in this balance. O how heavy 

    do those lie upon many until they get them shaken off! They are not disposed 

    to continue with them, but strive to get clear of them as of a mighty 

    burden. But the worm of a bad conscience will neither die nor sleep in hell, 

    though we may now lull it asleep for a time.</p>
<p align="justify">And certainly it is easier to entertain the sharpest 

    convictions in this life, so that they lead us to Christ, than to have them 

    fixed forever in the conscience, and to be in hell totally and finally 

    separated from Him.</p>
<p align="justify">But, on the other hand, weigh sin in this balance, and, 

    though now it seems but a light thing to you, you will find it a weight 

    sufficient to turn up an eternal weight of wrath upon you.</p>
<p align="justify">Even idle words, vain thoughts, and unprofitable actions, 

    weighed in this balance, and considered as following the sinner into 

    eternity, will each of them be heavier than the sand of the sea! Time idly 

    spent will make a weary eternity!</p>
<p align="justify">Now is your seedtime; thoughts, words, and actions, are 

    the seed sown, eternity is the harvest. Though the seed now lies under the 

    clod, disregarded by most men, even the least grain shall spring up at 

    length; and the fruit will be according to the seed (Gal 6:8), 'For he that 

    sows to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption, (that is, 

    destruction), but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life 

    everlasting.'</p>
<p align="justify">Weigh in this balance your time and opportunities of 

    grace and salvation, and you will find them very weighty. Precious time and 

    seasons of grace, Sabbaths, communions, prayers, sermons, and the like, are 

    by many, now-a-days made light of; but the day is coming when one of these 

    will be reckoned more valuable than a thousand worlds by those who now have 

    the least value for them! When they are gone forever, and the loss cannot be 

    retrieved, those will see the worth of them who will not now see it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Be warned and stirred up to flee from the wrath to 

    come! Mind eternity, and closely ply the work of your salvation. What are 

    you doing, while you are not so doing? Is heaven a fable, or hell a false 

    alarm? Must we live eternally, and shall we be at no more pains to escape 

    everlasting misery? Will faint wishes take the kingdom of heaven by force? 

    Will such drowsy endeavors as most men satisfy themselves with, be accounted 

    fleeing from the wrath to come?</p>
<p align="justify">You who have already fled to Christ, up, and be doing. 

    You who have begun the work, go on and loiter not, but 'work out your 

    salvation with fear and trembling'. 'Fear him which is able to destroy both 

    soul and body in hell'. Remember you are not yet ascended into heaven; you 

    are but in your middle state.</p>
<p align="justify">The everlasting arms have drawn you out of the gulf of 

    wrath you were plunged into, in your natural state; they are still 

    underneath you, that you can never fall down into it again. Nevertheless, 

    you have not yet got up to the top of the rock; the deep below you is 

    frightful– look at it, and hasten your ascent.</p>
<p align="justify">You who are yet in your sinful state, lift up your eyes 

    and take a view of the eternal state. Arise, you profane persons, you 

    ignorant ones, you formal hypocrites, strangers to the power of godliness, 

    and flee from the wrath to come!</p>
<p align="justify">Let not the young venture to delay a moment longer, nor 

    the old put off this work any more– 'Today if you will hear his voice, 

    harden not your hearts;' lest He swear in His wrath that you shall never 

    enter into His rest.</p>
<p align="justify">It is no time to linger in a state of sin, as in Sodom, 

    when fire and brimstone are coming down on it from the Lord. Take warning in 

    time. They who are in hell are not troubled with such warnings, but are 

    enraged against themselves, because they slighted the warning when they had 

    it.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider, I beg you, how uneasy it is to lie one whole 

    night on a soft bed in perfect health, when we gladly would have sleep but 

    cannot get it, sleep being departed from us. How often do we in that case, 

    wish for rest! how full of tossings to and fro!</p>
<p align="justify">But ah! how dreadful must it be to lie in sorrow, wrapped 

    up in scorching flames throughout eternity, in that place where they have no 

    rest day nor night!</p>
<p align="justify">How terrible would it be to live under violent pains of 

    the cholic or stone for forty or sixty years together without any 

    intermission! Yet that is but a very small thing compared with eternal 

    separation from God, the worm that never dies, and the fire that is never 

    quenched!</p>
<p align="justify">Eternity is an awful thought! O long, long endless 

    eternity! But will not every moment in eternity of woe seem a month, and 

    every hour a year, in that most wretched and desperate condition? Hence, 

    'ever and ever', as it were, a double eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">The sick man in the night, tossing to and fro on his bed, 

    says it will never be day, and complains that his pain ever continues– it 

    never, never abates. Are these 'petty time-eternities', which men form to 

    themselves in their own imaginations, so very grievous? Alas! then, how 

    grievous, how utterly insupportable, must a real eternity of woe, and all 

    manner of miseries, be!</p>
<p align="justify">There will be space enough there to reflect on all the 

    ills of our heart and life, which we cannot get time to think of now; and to 

    see that all that was said of the impenitent sinner's hazard was true, and 

    that the half was not told. There will be space enough in eternity to carry 

    on delayed repentance, to lament one's follies when it is too late; and in a 

    state past remedy to speak forth these fruitless wishes– O that I had never 

    been born! that the womb had been my grave, and I had never seen the sun!</p>
<p align="justify">O that I had taken warning in time, and fled from this 

    wrath while the door of mercy was standing open to me! O that I had never 

    heard the Gospel, that I had lived in some corner of the world where a 

    Savior and the great salvation were not once named!</p>
<p align="justify">But all in vain. What is done cannot be undone; the 

    opportunity is lost, and can never be retrieved; time is gone, and can never 

    be recalled. Therefore, improve time while you have it, and do not willfully 

    ruin yourself by stopping your ear to the Gospel call.</p>
<p align="justify">And now, if you would be saved from the wrath to come, 

    and never go into this place of torment, take no rest in your natural state; 

    believe the sinfulness and misery of it, and labor to get out of it quickly, 

    fleeing unto Jesus Christ by faith.</p>
<p align="justify">Sin in you is the seed of hell– and if the guilt and 

    reigning power of it be not removed in time, they will bring you to the 

    second death in eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no way to get them removed, but by receiving 

    Christ as He is offered in the Gospel, for justification and sanctification– 

    and He is now offered to you with all His salvation (Rev 22:12,17), 'And 

    behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every man 

    according as his work shall be. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come; and 

    let him that hears say, Come; and let him that is thirsty come. And whoever 

    will, let him take the water of life freely.'</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus Christ is the Mediator of peace, and the fountain 

    of holiness– He it is who delivers us from the wrath to come. 'There is no 

    condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, 

    but after the Spirit' (Rom 8:1).</p>
<p align="justify">The terrors of hell, as well as the joys of heaven, are 

    set before you, to stir you up to a cordial receiving of Him, with all His 

    salvation; and to incline you to the way of faith and holiness, in which 

    alone you can escape the everlasting fire.</p>
<p align="justify">May the Lord Himself make them effectual to that end!</p>
