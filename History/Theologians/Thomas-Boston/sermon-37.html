          Psalm 4:4, "Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IN these words, we have David's friendly advice to his enemies, for
          the good of their souls. In this particular advice, there is, 1. The
          duty itself, "Commune with your own heart." By the heart is meant the
          conscience. In this sense it is used by the apostle John: "If our
          heart condemn us," says he, "God is greater than our heart, and knows
          all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we
          confidence towards God." It is also said, that David's heart smote
          him, after that he had numbered the people. There is next a special
          season of the duty, upon your beds, in the night season. There is also
          the connection of it with the other duties here recommended. It looks
          backward and forward, and is here prescribed as an excellent mean to
          keep us from sin, and to be still from wicked practices.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. As it is a necessary duty to commune with our own
          consciences, so it is an excellent mean to a holy life. In prosecuting
          this subject, I shall,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. Show in what the duty consists.</p>
        <p align="justify">II. The manner in which it should be performed.</p>
        <p align="justify">III. The special seasons for engaging in it.</p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Give the reasons for the duty; and,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          V. Show that it is an excellent mean to a holy life. We are then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show what it is to commune with our conscience. This duty
          consists in two things:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. We must speak to our consciences. This is easily performed, for
          they can hear without a voice. Our tongues need not weary in this
          exercise; for in the deepest silence we speak best, and commune with
          our hearts to the greatest purpose. Thus David spoke to his heart, "O
          my soul," said he, "you have said unto the Lord, you are my Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. We must hear our heart and conscience speak to us. "When you said,
          seek you my face, my heart," says David, "said unto you, (namely, to,
          or within me), your face, Lord, will I seek." Conscience can speak to
          us, so as to make its voice be heard through all parts of the soul. It
          roused David himself out of his sleep, and put Judas to his wits end.
          It is God's voice, and therefore must be majestic.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show the manner in which this duty should be performed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. We should commune with our hearts willingly. It is a work of
          righteousness; "and the Lord meets him that rejoices, and works
          righteousness." We should be willing to enter on the conference, and
          even seek this communing. "Isaac went out to meditate at the
          even-tide." It is sad when conscience speaks only unbidden. We should
          also continue the communing, and not, like Felix, break it off
          violently, saying, "when I have a convenient season I will call for
          you."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Friendly. That which most injures this communing, is people's
          looking on conscience as their enemy, and therefore they cannot endure
          it. But conscience may say to you, "Am I therefore become your enemy,
          because I tell you the truth?" It argues a person to be of little
          judgment to look on the surgeon as his enemy, though he come with his
          lance or knife in his hand to open his sores. If conscience speak
          roughly, it is but to make way for a sound peace. "When I heard," says
          Habakkuk, "my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice,
          rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I
          might rest in the day of trouble."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We should do it freely. We must have no reserve, no sweet morsel
          under the tongue. It is grieving to think how averse people are to
          come upon some points with their conscience, and at what pains they
          will be to divert or change that discourse. Some sins they love, some
          they hate; accordingly they are content to commune, so as the
          conscience will but hold of these points the right eye, the right
          hand.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Honestly and uprightly, not refusing conviction, but admitting what
          conscience offers according to the Word of God. Conscience, indeed, is
          but a subordinate judge, and therefore the appeal is to be made to the
          Scriptures. "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not
          according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." But
          alas! many refuse the very light which conscience offers from the
          Scriptures, and are at much pains to cheat conscience into a belief of
          their mistaken apprehension, as the foolish virgins deceived
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Frequently. There is no acquaintance more difficult to be obtained,
          and more easily lost, than that with ourselves. The soul of man is an
          unfathomable deep. "The heart is deceitful above all things, and
          desperately wicked, who can know it?" There is still occasion for new
          discoveries, therefore this exercise should be habitual to us. It is
          one to a thousand, if we find our hearts as we left them. We are now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To attend to the special seasons for communing with our hearts.
          It is a duty at all times, but for the more solemn performance of it,
          the Scripture points out the following seasons—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The morning. "Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation.
          My voice shall you hear in the morning." The first fruits belong to
          God. The devil and the world will strive to rob him of them, as a
          pledge for the whole day; and alas! they often succeed. David was
          careful to give his first thoughts to God. "When I awake," says he, "I
          am still with you." The pious women who followed our Lord, "came very
          early in the morning to his sepulcher." The want of this early
          devotion is the source of great disorders. Possession is much. It is
          easier to hold out, than to put out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The evening. "Isaac went out to meditate at the even-tide." This is
          to close the day with God. There is great reason to begin and end with
          God. In the morning, we are to go out amidst many snares; in the
          evening, we have a whole day's course to examine and judge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The night season, upon our beds; so says the text. And says David
          for himself, "when I remember you on my bed, and meditate on you in
          the night watches." Men should not go to sleep with their hearts bound
          to the world, as the horse to the manger. The night is especially
          proper for this duty, for then a man is at the end of the day's
          progress, and it is most meet he should then look back upon it, and
          observe how matters have gone that day. Again, a man is now out of the
          noise of the world, his converse with others is at an end, and he may,
          therefore, the better take a word with himself, and recollect himself
          freely. Besides, the bed and sleep bear a resemblance to death and the
          grave, and so calls upon a man to remember his latter end. The night
          has a kind of awful majesty with it; and seeing we know not of an
          awakening, we should compose ourselves to sleep, as we would do to
          death.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. A time of affliction. Says Asaph, "I call to remembrance my song in
          the night; I commune with mine own heart, and my spirit made diligent
          search." God sends afflictions to bring sinners back again to himself,
          Hosea 2:6, 7. But when we run away from God, we run away from
          ourselves; and the first turning is, to turn to ourselves, to come to
          serious consideration, Luke 15:17; then is it time to pose our
          conscience with that question, What have I done?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Before we go to religious duties. That this was David's practice,
          we may learn from his calling his prayer his meditation, Psalm 5:1.
          This duty of self-communing before prayer and other duties, is as the
          plough before the sower, to prepare the heart. That soul that takes a
          view of its sins, before it pray for the pardon of them, is likely to
          make profit, Exodus 32:26, compare 30:31.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, After we are come from duties. It is as the harrow after the
          sower, to cover the seed. The beasts that did not chew the cud were
          unclean; and the persons who do not meditate on what they hear, and on
          what they do, are not likely to reap much benefit, or to reform their
          lives. How natural is it to a man, when he has been about a worldly
          business of importance, to reflect on it. Much more need is there
          here. We are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. To give reasons why we should thus commune with ourselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because our conscience is witness to all our actions, and keeps a
          record of our conversation. Our conscience also bears witness, and our
          thoughts the meanwhile accusing, or else excusing one another. Would
          we flee from our consciences, we must flee from ourselves. Yet alas!
          many will do that in secret, which they would not do before a little
          child. Conscience is a thousand witnesses. Good reason, then, that we
          commune with it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is God's deputy in the soul. If God should send one out of
          Heaven to lodge in your family as his deputy, would you not be often
          communing with him. Conscience is so. "The spirit of man is the candle
          of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly." It is our
          schoolmaster and household preacher, God's spy and man's overseer; as
          Moses was to Aaron instead of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because its approbation is necessary for our actions. Its
          antecedent approbation is necessary to make our actions lawful, "for
          whatever is not of faith is sin;" so that it is even sin to go against
          the conscience, though in an error; its consequent approbation is
          necessary to our peace. "Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then
          have we confidence towards God." This is the oracle, then, within our
          breasts, which we must always consult.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Excepting only God himself, our consciences are our best friends or
          worst enemies. A good conscience will clear and support a man under
          the greatest hardships, 2 Corinthians 1:12; and even in the hour of
          death, Isaiah 38:3. Observe of king Josiah, he was slain in war, yet
          died in peace with God and his conscience, 2 Kings 22:20, compare
          23:29. An ill conscience will deprive us of the comfort of all other
          enjoyments, and fill the mind with horrible dismay, as in the case of
          Belshazzar. It remains,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          V. To show that this duty is an excellent mean to a holy life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. This appears, if we consider that the want of it is that which
          makes people go on securely in their sins. "I hearkened and heard,
          says the Lord; but they spoke not aright, no man repented him of his
          wickedness, saying, What have I done? Every one turns to his course,
          as the horse rushes into the battle." Sin is a work of darkness, and
          therefore goes on best in the dark; for to him that is in love with
          his sin, the morning is as the shadow of death. Therefore Satan keeps
          all fast, as long as he gets conscience and the man kept asunder.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. As soon as people give ear to their consciences, they are obliged
          to begin a new course; "therefore, thus says the Lord God, consider
          your ways." This was exemplified in the prodigal. David also says, "I
          thought upon my ways, and turned my feet unto your testimonies."
          Conscience is ever a friend to holiness, even in the worst of men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Conscience discovers our defects, errors, and wanderings out of
          God's way. To know the disease is a considerable step to the cure.
          When a man books his accounts, and compares his expenses with his
          income, it will make him spend less.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Conscience will point out duty, and spur a man on to it. When men
          are pricked in their hearts, they will cry, what shall we do. A little
          thinking sometimes would set resolutions in practice, and make good
          purposes bring forth abundantly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. For information. We need not weary for want of company. We have
          a companion within us, able to hold up in profitable discourse.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is great wickedness to refuse to commune with our consciences,
          when they offer to speak. Sometimes it speaks undesired; but men often
          entertain it, as did Cain, Felix, and others. Some do like these
          idolatrous heathens, who beat drums and raise shouts, when their
          children are consuming on Moloch's altar, to drown their cries.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. They are careless souls indeed, whose religion never reaches to
          their beds, farther than to desire God to have a care of them, when
          they wrap the clothes about them; as if their beds were sleeping
          places for their souls as well as bodies; hence Satan has their
          hearts, sleeping and waking.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. See here why the devil is such an enemy to this duty. Why, if this
          conference takes place between a man and his heart, Satan's kingdom is
          in danger. But men sin and stand not in awe, for they commune not with
          their heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. Of exhortation. Make this your daily work. Commune with your
          hearts respecting what concerns your souls. The subject is very large.
          You need not want matter, as commune with your heart respecting your
          state. "Examine yourselves whether you be in the faith; prove your own
          selves." Ask your souls whether or not you are born again? It is
          certain you were once children of wrath and of the devil. The voice
          may be Jacob's and the hands Esau's. Perhaps no inward change has yet
          taken place. Commune respecting the frame and case of your soul,
          whether you be sleeping or waking, growing or declining, grace in
          exercise or not. Commune respecting your sins. It is very unsafe to be
          still running on in the score, contracting debts, but never casting up
          your accounts. Commune where you are like to take up your eternal
          lodging, in Heaven or Hell. It is a serious question. Sit not down
          with an uncertainty, a mere maybe upon it, but ponder what evidences
          you nave for Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the morning commune with your hearts on what has passed in the
          night; on the goodness of God in preserving and refreshing you; what
          good or sinful motions have been stirred up in your sleep; on the
          danger on which you are when you are going out to the world, and the
          need you have of grace to keep you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          At night commune on what has passed through the day, looking through
          your hearts, lips, and lives. Ask yourselves whether you be a day's
          journey nearer Heaven, or Hell; what providences you have met with,
          what temptations, and the like.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Before you engage in duty, commune with your hearts respecting the
          majesty and greatness of God, before whom you are to appear;
          respecting your sins, that you may know what you have to confess;
          respecting your wants, that you may know what to ask; and respecting
          your mercies, in order to give thanks.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When you come from duties, commune respecting your behavior in them;
          what success you have had; whether you have had access to God or not,
          whether you have received any blessings of grace or not. And rush not
          rashly on any project or business; but commune with your own hearts,
          and consult your conscience what is sin, and what is duty in
          particular cases. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That the habitual neglect of this exercise is a chief engine of
          Satan, to make men sleep the sleep of death. In Hell, the
          inconsiderate rich man lift up his eyes. It is next to a desperate
          case which the prophet Isaiah describes: "He feeds on ashes; a
          deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul,
          nor say, is there not a lie in my right hand."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The neglecting of this duty so much, is the reason why Christians
          are like Pharaoh's lean kine, so ill favored. He who would keep a
          clean face, should often look into the glass.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Sooner or later we must reckon with conscience, and the longer
          in doing it, the worse. Death and judgment are posting on. It is very
          dismal, indeed, to be hurried out of the world, are we have got a
          serious discourse with our hearts, respecting our state and frame. Be
          not afraid at the difficulty of the work. If Satan be such an enemy to
          it, that says that it is most advantageous for the soul. Want of
          frequency in it makes us so averse to it, and the love to sin which
          must be put away. Study tenderness in your conduct and it will be
          sweet to you, and often wash your consciences in the blood of Christ.
          "This will purge your consciences from dead works to serve the living
          God." Amen.
