          Luke 13:7 "Cut it down, why does it cumber the ground?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          WE have here the doom of the unfruitful fig tree, and in it the doom
          of all such as are utterly barren, under the enjoyment of the gospel.
          And here let us consider, that the fig tree is the Jews, to them it
          first looks; though no doubt it is designed for hearers of the gospel
          in all ages. The vineyard is not mankind in general; for the far
          greater part of mankind were, and yet are, left without the inclosure;
          but it is the church as having the means of grace. See Isaiah chapter
          5. The owner of the vineyard is Christ himself. He is the heir of all
          things, the head of the church in particular, and he came seeking the
          fruit. The coming and seeking the fruit imports the Lord's taking
          notice what use sinners make of the means of grace; how they answer
          the design of the pains and cost bestowed on them. The finding none,
          imports the barrenness of sinners, particularly of the Jews, under the
          means of grace; not brought to faith and repentance. The dress of the
          vineyard is his apostles and ministers. The three years mentioned, may
          refer to the three years of Christ's ministry: or if that does not so
          well agree, since they were after that spared, not one year only, but
          forty, it may be taken more generally for the whole time of the Jewish
          church under the prophets, John the Baptist, and Christ himself; fig
          trees if they are not hopeless, bringing forth in three years' time at
          least. So it denotes the great patience exercised towards the Jews,
          and the hopelessness of their case, notwithstanding all the means and
          time which they have enjoyed. In the text we have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The orders given respecting it, Cut it down. The case is hopeless.
          The pruning knife prevails not, take the axe and hew it down. This was
          accomplished in the destruction of Jerusalem, when the people were
          unchurched and destroyed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The reason of this severity. It cumbers the ground. The ground in
          which it stands is rendered useless. It draws to it the sap that might
          nourish other plants, and its shade is hurtful to men. So the barren
          Jews were to be removed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine. The unfruitful under the means of grace do but cumber the
          ground in God's vineyard, and therefore however they may be spared a
          while, they will be cut down at length. Here I shall show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Who are the unfruitful in God's vineyard to be cut down.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. How and in what respects do these cumber the ground.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Why the cumberers of the ground are so long spared.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. The import of cutting down. We are then,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show who are the unfruitful in God's vineyard, to be cut down.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Dead trees. They being still in their natural state, are
          spiritually dead in trespasses and sins. The gospel is the mean of
          life to a dead world, called therefore the word of life, Philippians
          2:16. It is by it that the Spirit of life is conveyed into the dead
          soul. This Spirit is received by the hearing of faith. Thereby faith
          comes whereby the soul is united to Christ the fountain of life. So
          then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. But alas!
          many continue dead under quickening means, destitute of the Spirit and
          of faith. So they cannot bring forth the fruits of holiness, they can
          do nothing that is truly good, more than a dead man can move and act.
          There is none that does good, no not one. They are not brought to
          union with Christ, so death reigns in them. Thus there are dead
          persons, dead families.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Rotten trees. Dead souls are spiritually rotten also. "They are
          altogether become filthy." This speaks reigning vanity and
          worthlessness, as the rotten tree is light. How many such are in God's
          vineyard, whose mind is vain. "Having the understanding darkened,
          being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in
          them, because of the blindness of their heart: who being past feeling,
          have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all impurity
          with greediness." Their conversation is vain, 1 Peter 1:18. They savor
          nothing, seek nothing in earnest, but the vain things of a present
          world. This also speaks vileness. They are loathsome to God, and to
          good men, and useless. Good for nothing but the fire. These will be
          cut down.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Withered trees. When the tree has lost all sap and is withered
          away, it cannot bring forth fruit, but must be cut down. Many that
          sometimes looked green and promising under the means of grace, have
          lost all now. Their convictions are stifled, their affection to the
          things of God is gone, and the gospel is become tasteless to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Barren trees, that have leaves but no fruit. "And now also the axe
          is laid unto the root of the trees; therefore every tree that bears
          not fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire." Many have the leaves
          of a profession, but no conversation agreeable thereto. A form of
          godliness but nothing of the power. As Naphtali, giving goodly words,
          but not as Joseph, fruitful boughs. But it is fruit, and not leaves
          that will save from the axe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Degenerate trees bringing forth evil and noxious fruit. To
          such God says, "Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right
          seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange
          vine unto me?" These bring forth the fruits of the flesh in abundance,
          that are deadly like the wild gourds of the wild vine. For those that
          are barren to God, are always fruitful to the devil. So may it be said
          of very many hearers of the gospel. "For their vine is of the vine of
          Sodom; and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall;
          their clusters are bitter. Their wine is the poison of dragons, and
          the cruel venom of asps." We are now to show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. How and in what respects do these cumber the ground in the
          vineyard.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. They take up room, precious room, that might be better occupied. If
          Tyre and Sidon had enjoyed the room of Chorazin and Bethsaida, they
          would have made a profitable use of it, Matthew 11:21. A place in
          God's vineyard is very precious. It is more valuable than ten thousand
          times as much without it. "For says David, a day in your courts is
          better than a thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of
          my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness." But this desirable
          and valuable situation often falls into the hands of many, who know no
          more to improve it, than the rooster in the fable to improve the
          Jewel. "Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get
          wisdom, seeing he has no heart to it." All they do with it at best, is
          but unprofitably to fill up a space.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There is no advantage to the owner from that part of the ground
          which they occupy. But surely from it as well as from the other parts,
          he might raise advantage to himself, if they were removed from it.
          They are together become unprofitable. They are useless for God, they
          contribute nothing for his declarative glory in the world, they do
          nothing to advance the Mediator's kingdom. When he cut down the Jews,
          and planted the Gentiles in their room; he showed what great gain was
          to be made of that place in his vineyard, which the Jews occupied to
          no purpose. "From the uttermost part of the earth; have we heard
          songs, even glory to the righteous: but I said my leanness, my
          leanness, woe unto me." So God might raise glory to himself, which he
          has not from us, by giving to others our places and privileges, if we
          were turned out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. There is no comfort to the vine-dressers from that part of the
          ground such occupy, though otherwise much might arise from it, if it
          was planted with other trees. The pains of the laborers is lost upon
          such trees. In vain is all their toil, sweat, and strength bestowed on
          them; "for say they, who has believed our report, and to whom is the
          arm of our Lord revealed." They have all the sorrow and pain of
          disappointment and lost labor: though their labor might have come to a
          comfortable and profitable account if it had been bestowed on others.
          Thus said God to Ezekiel, "I have not sent you to many people of a
          strange speech, and of an hard language, whose words you can not
          understand: surely had I sent you to them, they would have harkened
          unto you. But the house of Israel will not hearken unto you; for they
          will not hearken unto me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and
          hard hearted." Thus we see that Jonah's mission to Nineveh was
          successful.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The sap of the ground which barren trees draw to them, of which
          they are yet nothing the better, might nourish fruitful trees if they
          had their room. Sodom's ruin might have been prevented by Caparnaum's
          privileges; but they were lost on Capernaum, Matthew 11:23. Many
          hungry persons might be refreshed with the meat and drink which the
          glutton and the drunkard devour, and from which they derive no good
          but evil to themselves: and many a poor soul would feed sweetly on
          these means of grace, that others have and despise, having no heart
          for them. The salvation of many might be advanced by those very means
          of grace which others having yet got no good of them, but an
          aggravating of their condemnation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, They hinder the fruitfulness of other trees in the vineyard;
          drawing the sap from them. So they are not only not profitable, but
          hurtful. Look how a barren tree in a garden spoils the undergrowth,
          and is hurtful to the fruit trees. So unprofitable hearers of the
          gospel, scatter their malignant influence to all that are about them.
          One sinner destroys much good. Their example and influence will pull
          down, what the means of grace are for building up in others. Let us
          now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Inquire why cumberers of the ground are spared so long.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. For to try if they will mend. "The Lord is long suffering to us
          ward, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to
          repentance. Or Despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance
          and long suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to
          repentance." A tree that is barren one year may be fruitful another
          year. The soul that has long refused to obey the call of Christ, may
          afterwards, with the son in the parable, repent and obey, Matthew
          21:29. And therefore the Lord will give them time, exercise patience,
          and wait on a while.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. For the prayers of the godly. This barren tree was spared another
          year, upon the entreaty made for it by the vine-dresser, verse 8. So
          was the intercession made by Moses prevalent for the sparing of
          Israel, Exodus 32:10–14. and Lot's intercession for Zoar. The godly
          are the pillars of the land.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. For the sake of their seed designed for vessels of mercy. Though a
          barren tree brings not forth fruit, yet it brings forth seed for
          propagating its kind. And many a time sinners, vessels of wrath, are
          spared, for the sake of the vessels of mercy that may be in their
          loins; as it was with the generation that came out of Egypt, and the
          remnant of the Jewish unbelievers, Matthew 24:22.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, That impenitent sinners may be wholly inexcusable. There is a
          measure of iniquity to be filled up, and so long the Lord will bear
          with sinners, and no longer, Romans 2:5. Genesis 15:16. It remains,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. To consider the import of cutting down. It denotes,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Patience at a end. "And the Lord said, my Spirit shall not always
          strive with men." God may wait long on barren trees in his vineyard,
          but the time will come that he will wait no longer. He will no longer
          expect fruit; it must be cut down. I have long time, says he, held my
          peace, I have been still and refrained myself, now will I cry like a
          travailing woman; "I will destroy and devour at once." His honor lies
          at stake, the honor of his holy and just providence, which suffers by
          sinners continuing impenitent. But he will retrieve his honor at the
          sinner's cost.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Never fruit more to grow upon them. When our Lord said to the
          barren tree, "Let not fruit grow upon you henceforward forever." It is
          added, "And presently the fig tree withered away." While the tree
          stands there is some hope, but when it is cut down all hope of fruit
          is removed from it forever. Men delay repentance now, but this stroke
          will put them out of the reach of repentance, beyond the line of
          mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It denotes the sharpness of the stroke. The stroke of wrath against
          barren trees in God's vineyard will be very cutting. The dead soul
          will be made to feel it in the most tender part. Whom the word cannot
          pierce, the sword of wrath will out asunder and appoint them their
          portion with the hypocrites; "there shall be weeping and gnashing of
          teeth."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The suddenness of the stroke. "The Lord of the slothful servant
          shall come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an hour when he
          is not aware; and shall cut him asunder." Of all persons those who
          have most pains taken on them in vain, by the preaching of the gospel,
          are the most liable to sudden destruction. "He who being often
          reproved hardens his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that
          without remedy."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. The destructiveness of it. "You shall break them with a rod of
          iron, you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." The Lord
          cuts in mercy that he may heal; but his cutting down makes an end of
          the barren tree. So will death be to impenitent sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. The casting of it out of the vineyard. The tree being cut down, is
          next cast over the hedge. They that improve not their room in God's
          vineyard, will before long lose their room in it, and their souls at
          once.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, That the barren tree is to be cast into the fire. "If a man
          abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and
          men gather them, and they are cast into the fire, and they are
          burned." Impenitent sinners cast out of God's vineyard, will be cast
          into Hell, where they will forever lament their misimproving of the
          means of grace when it will be out of time.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Uses.—1. The unfruitfulness under the gospel prevailing in our land,
          forbodes a time of hewing and cutting down. Our privileges have been
          signal ones, our misimprovement signal; so will our stroke be
          likewise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Impenitent sinners have a dangerous station in God's vineyard. A
          barren tree may be much safer in the wood than in the garden. Tyre and
          Sidon will have a cheaper bargain of their lusts, than Chorazin and
          Bethsaida; and they that never heard the gospel, than we.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Take heed what part you act in God's vineyard. Be concerned to know
          for what use you are in it. Beware of being cumberers of the ground.
          Many such there are, but he will at length free his vineyard of the
          burden of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lay no more weight upon external church privileges, than they will
          bear. Happy are they that dwell in God's house, if they learn the true
          manners of the house. But if in God's house they live ungodly lives,
          it had been better for them they never had known it. "The children of
          the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness, there shall be
          weeping and gnashing of teeth."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Consider what fruit you bring forth under the means of grace;
          and do not overlook the privileges which you enjoy. Ministers sow the
          seed, Christ himself will look after the fruit, and will notice who
          bring forth the fruit of a preached gospel, and who cumber the ground.
          "And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees; therefore
          every tree which brings not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast
          into the fire. Amen.
