          Hosea 6:4 "For your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early
          dew it goes away."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THE case of many at our communions this day is such, that when they
          are at them, it seems pity they should ever go from them until they
          sit down at the table above; and when they are from them a little
          while, it seems pity they should ever go to them again.—When they are
          at them, the smell of their communion frame is as the smell of a field
          which the Lord has blessed. When they are from them, the smell of
          their ordinary walk is as the smell of a field which the Lord has
          cursed; smelling rank of the root of bitterness.—Men know not what to
          make of them. No wonder, (with reverence be it spoken,) seeing God
          knows not what to do with them. "O Ephraim, what shall I do unto you?
          O Judah, what shall I do unto you?" As if a Physician despairing of
          his patient should say, I have tried many remedies, but none avail to
          perfect the cure. You still again cast yourself into the disease.
          Ephraim and Judah were neither made better by promises nor
          threatenings, so that their case was very hopeless, and nothing seemed
          to remain but that the Lord should leave them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the text we have that which made their case so very hopeless. They
          had at times some goodness.—Hebrew, Kindness. They had at times some
          kindness for God and his way; some warmth of affections towards good,
          that they seemed to be believing on Christ, and entirely to give up
          their idols: so that they were sometimes almost gained. Yet it was but
          sometimes. They remained not long in that frame. Their half kindness
          did not last; they even turned back again to their old bias. Their
          goodness was passing goodness. This instability of theirs is held
          forth by the similitude, first, of a morning cloud. A cloud which out
          of the remains of the night appears in the morning promising a heavy
          shower, to make the ground fruitful; but whenever the sun rises the
          cloud vanishes away, and disappoints the expectation of the gardener.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Next this transitory goodness is represented by the early dew. The dew
          which falls in the morning upon the fields, and seems to be in a fair
          way to bring forward the increase of the earth. But as soon as the sun
          is up, and beats upon it with its beams, it evaporates and is gone. He
          seems to allude to the morning sacrifices of both these people; at
          which they appeared very serious and devout; but when the sacrifices
          were over, and they went home, they even returned to their old trade
          of sin. Now if they had had no goodness at any time, their sin would
          have been more easily charged home upon them, and the arrows of God's
          threatenings would have more easily pierced their breasts. But now
          they had so much goodness as made them proof against threatenings, but
          yet not so much as could wrap them up in the promises.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine. Such is the instability of many in the good way of the Lord,
          that the goodness at which they sometimes arrive, passes away as a
          morning cloud, and as the early dew.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall show in what respects the goodness of many passes away as
          the morning cloud, and as the early dew.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I shall give the reasons of the point. And then add some
          improvement. We are then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show in what respects the goodness of many passes away as the
          morning cloud, and as the early dew.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is certain that the goodness of the saints cannot pass away
          totally, nor finally. "For whoever is born of God does not commit sin;
          for his seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of
          God." But even the saints may lose much of the degrees of grace; and
          as for others they may totally lose all that they have. In one sense
          the point holds with respect to both.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Men's goodness often goes away very quickly as the morning cloud
          which appears only a very short while. "Then believed they his words;
          they sang his praise. They soon forgot his works; they waited not for
          his counsel." Many a time a dark cloud quickly comes over men, so that
          their sun seems to go down at noon-day; and their leaking vessels
          sometimes full are speedily run out. Their goodness is like the moon
          in a cloudy night, that sometimes shines forth brightly, but anon
          deserts the traveler: so that the strong man becomes weak as Samson
          without his hair. And it may be observed, That men's goodness often
          goes quickly away, after they have solemnly engaged themselves to the
          Lord. "When Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord,
          and all his judgments, then all the people answered with one voice and
          said, All the words which the Lord has said will we do." Yet in a very
          short time after this it is recorded; "They have turned aside quickly
          out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten
          calf and have worshiped it." This was not peculiar to them. How
          quickly after the first communion was the edge of the spirit of the
          disciples blunted. Mark 14:37. They could not watch with their master
          one hour. Their resolutions vanished into smoke whenever the
          temptation appeared. The mighty men that would die with their master
          could not find their hands in the day of battle, though they found
          their feet to forsake him and flee away; and one of them found his
          tongue to deny him. At such a time Satan is most busy, for then they
          are better worth the catching than before. Now their sins will bring
          more dishonor to God and to religion, and how often do they then fall
          as ripe fruit into the mouth of the devourer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The same thing also often happens, after some more than ordinary
          enjoyments. Immediately after the most delightful fellowship with
          Christ, we hear the spouse saying, I sleep: and in this frame refuses
          to open to her beloved. Satan envies the happiness of men, and tries
          to rob them of it: even as the pirate attacks the ship that is most
          richly laden. The hearts of the disciples were melted with the sight
          of Christ's miracle. Mark 6. But a hard frost quickly seized them.
          Verse 52. "They considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their
          heart was hardened." Our hearts are as stones, in point of receiving
          impressions, but as the sand for retaining them. The wind of
          temptation quickly obliterates them. Even then the heart is ready to
          swell with pride, and when it begins to rise, it will quickly, like
          Jordan, overflow its banks. Even Paul himself needed a thorn in the
          flesh to keep him from being exalted above measure by his high
          enjoyments.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In like manner, goodness often passes quickly away after deliverance
          from trouble. In a time of affliction the goodness of many is
          apparently great, yet it quickly vanishes when the deliverance comes.
          In the time of a heavy rain every pool is filled to the brim, but in
          fair weather they soon dry up. Afflictions drive men to God as winter
          storms oblige them to keep the house. But, O! it is hard to keep at
          home when the earth's decayed face is renewed, and all nature again
          flourishes. While the excitement is at the nightingale's breast, it
          awakes and sings in the night, but when it is away it sleeps in the
          day. This was sadly exemplified in the case of Noah, Genesis 9:20. Of
          Lot, Genesis 19:31. Hezekiah, Chronicles 32:25. And of the Israelites,
          Psalm 78:34. and downwards. This is the reason why the Lord so often
          makes the clouds return after the rain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Men's goodness often goes away very easily, even as the morning
          clouds will pass away without the blustering noise of wind, and the
          warm beams of the sun easily exhale the early dew; but not more easily
          than men's goodness goes off their spirits. The devil does not always
          act the part of a roaring lion when he intends to strip people of
          their attained goodness, but in this work advances with a soft pace.
          We may observe that men's goodness ordinarily goes away by degrees,
          almost imperceptibly. Few all of a sudden become apostates. Carnal
          security creeps on leisurely on men, until by it they are taken off
          their feet. Their goodness, like the light of day after the setting of
          the sun, goes away by little and little. It goes away also on very
          slender occasions. The voice of a maid makes Peter's goodness pass
          away, and instead of holding by his good resolutions, he sins
          grievously by denying his master. It is a piece of Satan's policy to
          attack people with slender temptations at first, when he designs to
          rob them; for then they think they are strong enough for them,
          therefore they grapple with them on their own strength and are foiled.
          A small temptation will take off the chariot wheels of the soul. An
          unseasonable thought has sometimes proved a wide door, by which a good
          frame has escaped. How great a matter does a little fire kindle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Men's goodness goes off as the morning cloud, when there is most
          need for it to stay. The morning cloud goes away most readily in time
          of drought, when the earth stands most in need of it. And though the
          goodness of men may last while they meet not with temptations, yet
          when temptation comes it is often a-missing. Demas held on until the
          present world was laid in his way, but his goodness could not carry
          him over it. It is much to be feared, that if the sound of the
          communion sermons were once out of the heads of some of you, and you
          meet with your old companions, and with new temptations, you will be
          just where you were.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It has often been seen, that the goodness of many passes away in a
          time of persecution for the gospel.—"Because they have no root they
          wither away." As the heat of summer produces many insects which are
          not to be seen in the frost of winter; so the time of peace in the
          church produces many false friends who will never stand the shock of
          trouble for the gospel.—There are many fair birds that can stay with
          us in the summer, but depart at the approach of winter.—When Christ is
          riding in triumph the streets of Jerusalem will be crowded with
          persons crying, Hosanna; but when the scene changes they will be found
          on the other side, crying, crucify him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again our goodness is ready to pass away when we are called to duty.
          Paul himself found "that when he would do good, evil was present with
          him." The hearts of men are never more apt to misgive than when they
          have most to do with them; and never more ready to be abroad than when
          they should be at home, to meet with the Lord in duties. How often
          when the sacrifice is offered is the heart a wanting, and this
          presages sad things. The public assemblies are witnesses of this. What
          a chill cold then often benumbs men's spiritual senses! What
          distractions, wandering, wearying, and deadness often seize them. The
          preacher often speaks to the deaf. And our churches are filled with
          idols which have eyes, but see not, and ears, but hear not. The word
          often makes stones of Abraham's children, instead of raising up of
          them children to Abraham. In our secret duties this appears; woeful
          dryness suddenly unfits us for them. When the man is on the mount of
          God, the heart falls a roving, and with the fool's eyes, goes through
          the ends of the earth. Though the eyes be closed, the goodness
          escapes, and they see a thousand vanities. The heart leaves the
          tongue, and there is so little vital heat within that the word dies in
          our mouths. We now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To give the reasons of the point. The goodness of many thus passes
          away. Because,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Many, for all their goodness, have not the living Spirit of Christ
          dwelling in them. They have received only some common operations of
          the Spirit, which, like a slight shower of rain, wets only the surface
          of the earth but never goes deep, and so is quickly dried up. They do
          not, like Caleb, follow the Lord fully, because they have not the
          spirit which he had. They have only awakening, not changing, and
          sanctifying grace; therefore it decays by little and little until it
          sets in darkness. Their reigning sloth is only covered, not subdued,
          the root of it is not struck at, hence it rises again as weeds do in
          the spring. Thus it is said of the stony ground hearers, "that when
          the sun was up, they were scorched: and because they had no root, they
          withered away."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because the souls of many do not unite with Christ, who is the only
          head of influence. "If a man, says Jesus, abide not in me, he is cast
          forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them
          into the fire and they are burned." Take a branch and ingraft it, bind
          it up; it will keep green for a time indeed; but if it take not with
          the stock, it will undoubtedly soon wither. And thus, though there may
          be a sacramental engrafting into Christ, and the man be bound up with
          these holy bands about him; yet if he unite not with Christ by a
          lively faith, he can draw no nourishment from him; and if so, his
          goodness must certainly go away. Hence the goodness of many goes and
          is never recovered.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because with many, religion is not their proper element. It is a
          forced matter with them, that they have any at all; either by the
          power of credit, or a restless conscience. In a word, self-love is
          their highest principle, Psalm 78 and downwards. They have no real
          love to the Lord, nor does the intrinsic beauty of holiness recommend
          it to them. Though a stone may abide a while in the air, by the
          strength of the person who throws it, yet its natural weight will
          bring it down again. And thus men, though brought into Christ's
          palace, yet still retaining their swinish nature, will return to their
          wallowing in the mire.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because they have no spirit for difficulties and disappointments.
          Many will knock at heaven's gate that cannot endure to use violence
          and take it by force. "Strive, says Jesus, to enter in at the strait
          gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in and shall not be
          able." They see Heaven afar off, and would gladly be there, but they
          shrink back when they see the gulf which they have no heart to sail
          over. They go forward cheerfully while things are laid to their hand;
          but disappointments take heart and hand from them, and they are
          knocked in the head. "He who overcomes shall inherit all things; but
          the fearful and unbelieving," as well as gross sinners of every class,
          "shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and
          brimstone: which is the second death." They cannot wait on at Christ's
          gate. They know not what it is to have their appetite sharpened with
          disappointments; but as soon as they feel not that sweetness in
          religion which they imagined, they go directly to their old lusts; and
          find in them what they could not find in religion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Another reason is, the entertaining of unmortified lusts, which are
          like the suckers that draw the sap from the tree and make it barren.
          It is hard to get wet wood to take fire, but harder to get it to keep
          in the fire, but hardest of all, to get a heart polluted with, and
          enslaved to vile affections, to retain any attained goodness. They
          that have many friends in the enemy's camp will find their hands sore
          bound up in the day of battle. It is with many as with David in the
          battle against Absalom. Upon the one hand it was hard to lose a
          kingdom: on the other, to lose a son: "therefore," said he, "deal
          gently with the young man for my sake." That heart will not abide with
          God that has secret filthy lusts to nourish.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. The world has a great hand in this. The profits and pleasures of
          the world soon charm away men's goodness. Like the thorny ground
          hearers, when many have heard, "they go forth, and are choked with
          cares, and riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to
          perfection." If the earth once get in between us and the Sun of
          Righteousness, there will be a dreadful eclipse in our goodness. Cares
          of the world have their name from dividing and rending the mind
          asunder, whereby men's goodness has a wide gate to go out at. They are
          tent hooks of the soul, the black devils that draw men from God, and
          from that sweetness that is in the enjoyment of him, and drive them
          like the demoniac among the tombs in the region of the dead. They are
          the wasps and flies that buzz about and sting the soul when it should
          rest in the bosom of God. And for the pleasures of the world, when
          they once get a hold of the heart, they quickly run away with it.
          "Whoredom, wine, and new wine," says the Prophet, "take away the
          heart." Sensuality is a deep gulf, in which people's goodness will
          quickly drown. Sensual pleasures are waters that will soon put out the
          holy fire. But alas! many are like those amphibious birds that both
          fly and swim, and if they mount at any time towards Heaven, they are
          quickly swimming again in the waters of sensuality that drown their
          goodness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly. Unwatchfulness over the heart and life. Our goodness is a
          tender bud that will easily be blasted if we do not take all possible
          care of it. "Keep your heart," says the wise man, "with all diligence;
          for out of it are the issues of life." The heart is no more to be
          trusted to itself than a wild donkey used to the wilderness. Therefore
          keep it as a prison—as a besieged city; as the priests and Levites
          kept the holy things entrusted to their care. He who has no rule over
          his own spirit, is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
          Such a city can restrain none that would depart, and prevent none that
          would enter. What wonder then, if in such a case our goodness goes
          away, when there is no watching; for such a soul is like a great fair,
          where some are going out, some entering, and those within are all in
          confusion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use.—I would exhort you then, that have attained to anything of
          goodness or kindness to the Lord in his way, that you would set
          yourselves to hold it fast. O leave it not here! O let it not pass
          away with this communion. Carry it home with you and cherish it there;
          and let it appear in your future conversation. I hope there may be
          some that are going away crying, they have seen the King in his
          beauty; and they know that they have seen him; their eyes have beheld
          his beauty; they have heard his voice in the inmost parts of their
          souls. Perhaps they came in bonds, and the Lord has given orders, and
          the prisoner is loosed. Their chains of soul distress have been taken
          away, by a fair view of the righteousness of the Mediator, the great
          interpreter of the Father's mind. Job 33:23, 24, 25. God has looked
          their unbelief out of countenance and given them joy in believing.
          Well, brethren, hold fast. The highest enjoyment is liable to changes.
          Be thankful. Let the high praises of God be in your mouths. Walk
          humbly. Though you be adorned with shining feathers, yet look to your
          black feet and walk softly like Hezekiah. Walk also watchfully. Watch
          and pray that you enter not into temptation. Glory more in the giver
          than in the gifts. If you would have your comfort to last, then draw
          your comfort more from the grace of Christ without you, than from the
          grace of Christ within you. "We are to rejoice in Christ Jesus, but to
          have no confidence in the flesh." Only beware that you do not so much
          fear the loss of the enjoyment, as to bind up your hands from
          improving this golden spot of your time. Sometimes Satan prevails so
          to fill the heart with fear in this case, that persons fear themselves
          out of ease and never cease to be jealous of Christ, until that which
          they fear come upon them. Rather do as Moses. "He made haste and bowed
          his head and worshiped. And he said, if now I have found grace in your
          sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray you, go among us, (for it is a
          stiff necked people,) and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us
          for your inheritance." Some will say, alas! we have nothing to lose.
          Indeed it is likely there are some that will go away as empty of
          goodness as they came. They looked for nothing, and they have got as
          little. They are the devil's obedient captives that will neither stir
          hand nor foot to get out of his chains. "If our gospel be hid, it is
          hidden to them that are lost. In whom the God of this world has
          blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the
          glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
          them." Such persons as these will not complain of a grieved heart.
          Therefore I say, if your hearts be affected with a sense of your
          wants; if you have any of the desires of God's children after the
          Lord; if you see more of your own vileness of heart and life, and have
          formed resolutions to be for God and none else; if it were but a
          conviction, it is worth your pains to keep it. And I exhort you not to
          overlook it, lest it pass away as a morning cloud.

          1. Consider Satan will think it worth his pains to rob you of it,
          however little there be of it. The prince of darkness will set himself
          against the least ray of light. His experience tells him, that it is
          easiest to crush people's goodness in the bud, and not to let the
          flame spread.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Our Lord is very tender of small beginnings, where there is some
          good thing found in a person toward himself. "A bruised reed he will
          not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench." Be not you
          careless of that, of which he is so tender. Though you have not felt a
          full shower of influences, but only a few drops, yet let not these go
          away.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Great things may arise from small beginnings. The cloud like a
          man's hand, may soon darken the heavens if cherished. The grain of
          mustard seed may soon become a tree; and a little leaven will leaven
          the whole lump. "And then shall we know, if we follow on to know the
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly. The less you have, you had need take the more care not to lose
          it, and be the more diligent to improve it.—If you be set any way with
          a small stock, then double your diligence, and keep closely to your
          work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Advices 1. Do not sit down contented with any measure that you have
          attained. Alas! little satisfies people in religion. He who does not
          exert himself to grow, will assuredly decay. "Do not think that you
          have already attained, or are already perfect; but follow after, if
          that you may apprehend that for which also you are apprehended of
          Christ Jesus." Labor to make two talents of your one by industry. The
          fire will be extinguished by withholding fuel, as well as by throwing
          water upon it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Keep up a holy jealousy over your own hearts. You hear that the
          goodness of some is as the early cloud, and the morning dew, it passes
          away. This should make us say, each for himself, Lord is it I? "He who
          trusts in his own heart is a fool." If you be saying with Hazael, "Am
          I a dog, that I should do this?" Look that you be not the dog, that
          will be among the first to do it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Put what you have in the Lord's hand. Depend upon him and wait
          about his hand for more influences. For this purpose be much in
          prayer. You may come to get that in secret, which you have not got at
          the table.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, And what I say to one I say to all, watch. The time is short.
          Watch, and before long you shall be in that place, where the gates are
          not shut by day, and there is no night there. But if any man draw
          back, the Lord's Spirit will have no pleasure in him. Amen.
