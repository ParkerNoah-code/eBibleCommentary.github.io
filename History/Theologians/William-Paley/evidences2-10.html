        <h2>SECTION II.</h2>
        <p>REFLECTIONS UPON THE PRECEDING ACCOUNT.</p>
        <p>
          In viewing the progress of Christianity, our first attention is due to
          the number of converts at Jerusalem, immediately after its
          Founder&#x27;s death; because this success was a success at the time,
          and upon the spot, when and where the chief part of the history had
          been transacted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are, in the next place, called upon to attend to the early
          establishment of numerous Christian societies in Judea and Galilee;
          which countries had been the scene of Christ&#x27;s miracles and
          ministry, and where the memory of what had passed, and the knowledge
          of what was alleged, must have yet been fresh and certain.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are, thirdly, invited to recollect the success of the apostles and
          of their companions, at the several places to which they came, both
          within and without Judea; because it was the credit given to original
          witnesses, appealing for the truth of their accounts to what
          themselves had seen and heard. The effect also of their preaching
          strongly confirms the truth of what our history positively and
          circumstantially relates, that they were able to exhibit to their
          hearers supernatural attestations of their mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are, lastly, to consider the subsequent growth and spread of the
          religion, of which we receive successive intimations, and
          satisfactory, though general and occasional, accounts, until its full
          and final establishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all these several stages, the history is without a parallel for it
          must be observed, that we have not now been tracing the progress, and
          describing the prevalency, of an opinion founded upon philosophical or
          critical arguments, upon mere of reason, or the construction of
          ancient writing; (of which are the several theories which have, at
          different times, possession of the public mind in various departments
          of science and literature; and of one or other of which kind are the
          tenets also which divide the various sects of Christianity;) but that
          we speak of a system, the very basis and postulatum of which was a
          supernatural character ascribed to a particular person; of a doctrine,
          the truth whereof depends entirely upon the truth of a matter of fact
          then recent. &quot;To establish a new religion, even amongst a few
          people, or in one single nation, is a thing in itself exceedingly
          difficult. To reform some corruptions which may have spread in a
          religion, or to make new regulations in it, is not perhaps so hard,
          when the main and principal part of that religion is preserved entire
          and unshaken; and yet this very often cannot be accomplished without
          an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances, and may be attempted a
          thousand times without success. But to introduce a new faith, a new
          way of thinking and acting, and to persuade many nations to quit the
          religion in which their ancestors have lived and died, which had been
          delivered down to them from time immemorial; to make them forsake and
          despise the deities which they had been accustomed to reverence and
          worship; this is a work of still greater difficulty.&quot;
          (Jortin&#x27;s Dis. on the Christ. Rel. p. 107, 4th edit.) The
          resistance of education, worldly policy, and superstition, is almost
          invincible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If men, in these days, be Christians in consequence of their
          education, in submission to authority, or in compliance with fashion,
          let us recollect that the very contrary of this, at the beginning, was
          the case. The first race of Christians, as wall as millions who
          succeeded them, became such in formal opposition to all these motives,
          to the whole power and strength of this influence. Every argument,
          therefore, and every instance, which sets forth the prejudice of
          education, and the almost irresistible effects of that prejudice (and
          no persons are more fond of expatiating upon this subject than
          deistical writers), in fact confirms the evidence of Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, in order to judge of the argument which is drawn from the early
          propagation of Christianity, I know no fairer way of proceeding than
          to compare what we have seen on the subject with the success of
          Christian missions in modern ages. In the East India mission,
          supported by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, we hear
          sometimes of thirty, sometimes of forty, being baptized in the course
          of a year, and these principally children. Of converts properly so
          called, that is, of adults voluntarily embracing Christianity, the
          number is extremely small. &quot;Notwithstanding the labour of
          missionaries for upwards of two hundred years, and the establishments
          of different Christian nations who support them, there are not twelve
          thousand Indian Christians, and those almost entirely outcasts.&quot;
          (Sketches relating to the history, learning, and manners of the
          Hindoos, p. 48; quoted by Dr. Robertson, Hist. Dis. concerning Ancient
          India, p. 236.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I lament as much as any man the little progress which Christianity has
          made in these countries, and the inconsiderable effect that has
          followed the labours of its missionaries; but I see in it a strong
          proof of the Divine origin of the religion. What had the apostles to
          assist them in propagating Christianity which the missionaries have
          not? If piety and zeal had been sufficient, I doubt not but that our
          missionaries possess these qualities in a high degree: for nothing
          except piety and zeal could engage them in the undertaking. If
          sanctity of life and manners was the allurement, the conduct of these
          men is unblameable. If the advantage of education and learning be
          looked to, there is not one of the modern missionaries who is not, in
          this respect, superior to all the apostles; and that not only
          absolutely, but, what is of more importance, relatively, in
          comparison, that is, with those amongst whom they exercise their
          office. If the intrinsic excellency of the religion, the perfection of
          its morality, the purity of its precepts, the eloquence, or
          tenderness, or sublimity, of various parts of its writings, were the
          recommendations by which it made its way, these remain the same. If
          the character and circumstances under which the preachers were
          introduced to the countries in which they taught be accounted of
          importance, this advantage is all on the side of the modern
          missionaries. They come from a country and a people to which the
          Indian world look up with sentiments of deference. The apostles came
          forth amongst the Gentiles under no other name than that of Jews,
          which was precisely the character they despised and derided. If it be
          disgraceful in India to become a Christian, it could not be much less
          so to be enrolled amongst those &quot;quos, per flagitia invisos,
          vulgus Christianos appellabat.&quot; If the religion which they had to
          encounter be considered, the difference, I apprehend, will not be
          great. The theology of both was nearly the same: &quot;what is
          supposed to be performed by the power of Jupiter, Neptune, of Aeolus,
          of Mars, of Venus, according to the mythology of the West, is
          ascribed, in the East, to the agency Agrio the god of fire, Varoon the
          god of oceans, Vayoo god of wind, Cama the god of love.&quot; (Baghvat
          Gets, p. 94, quoted by Dr. Robertson, Ind. Dis. p. 306.) The sacred
          rites of the Western Polytheism were gay, festive, and licentious; the
          rites of the public religion in the East partake of the same
          character, with a more avowed indecency. &quot;In every function
          performed in the pagodas, as well as in every public procession, it is
          the office of these women (i. e. of women prepared by the Brahmins for
          the purpose) to dance before the idol, and to sing hymns in his
          praise; and it is difficult to say whether they trespass most against
          decency by the gestures they exhibit, or by the verses which they
          recite. The walls of the pagodas were covered with paintings in a
          style no less indelicate.&quot; (Others of the deities of the East are
          of an austere and gloomy character, to be propitiated by victims,
          sometimes by human sacrifices, and by voluntary torments of the most
          excruciating kind. Voyage de Gentil. vol. i. p. 244—260. Preface to
          the Code of Gentoo Laws, p. 57; quoted by Dr. Robertson, p. 320.)
        </p>
        <p>
          On both sides of the comparison, the popular religion had a strong
          establishment. In ancient Greece and Rome it was strictly incorporated
          with the state. The magistrate was the priest. The highest officers of
          government bore the most distinguished part in the celebration of the
          public rites. In India, a powerful and numerous caste possesses
          exclusively the administration of the established worship; and are, of
          consequence, devoted to its service, and attached to its interest. In
          both, the prevailing mythology was destitute of any proper evidence:
          or rather, in both, the origin of the tradition is run up into ages
          long anterior to the existence of credible history, or of written
          language. The Indian chronology computes eras by millions of years,
          and the life of man by thousands &quot;The Suffec Jogue, or age of
          purity, is said to have lasted three million two hundred thousand
          years; and they hold that the life of man was extended in that age to
          one hundred thousand years; but there is a difference amongst the
          Indian writers of six millions of years in the computation of this
          era.&quot; (Voyage de Gentil. vol. i. p. 244—260. Preface to the Code
          of Gentoo Laws, p. 57; quoted by Dr. Robertson, p. 320.) and in these,
          or prior to these, is placed the history of their divinities. In both,
          the established superstition held the same place in the public
          opinion; that is to say, in both it was credited by the bulk of the
          people, but by the learned and philosophical part of the community
          either derided, or regarded by them as only fit to be upholden for the
          sake of its political uses.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * &quot;How absurd soever the articles of faith may be which
          superstition has adopted, or how unhallowed the rites which it
          prescribes, the former are received, in every age and country with
          unhesitating assent, by the great body of the people, and the latter
          observed with scrupulous exactness. In our reasonings concerning
          opinions and practices which differ widely from our own, we are
          extremely apt to err. Having been instructed ourselves in the
          principles of a religion worthy in every respect of that Divine wisdom
          by which they were dictated, we frequently express wonder at the
          credulity of nations, in embracing systems of belief which appear to
          us so directly repugnant to right reason; and sometimes suspect that
          tenets so wild and extravagant do not really gain credit with them.
          But experience may satisfy us, that neither our wonder nor suspicions
          are well founded. No article of the public religion was called in
          question by those people of ancient Europe with whose history we are
          best acquainted; and no practice which it enjoined appeared improper
          to them. On the other hand, every opinion that tended to diminish the
          reverence of men for the gods of their country, or to alienate them
          from their worship, excited, among the Greeks and Romans, that
          indignant zeal which is natural to every people attached to their
          religion by a firm persuasion of its truth.&quot; Ind. Dis. p. 321.
          That the learned Brahmins of the East are rational Theists, and
          secretly reject the established theory, and contemn the rites that
          were founded upon them, or rather consider them as contrivances to be
          supported for their political uses, see Dr. Robertson&#x27;s Ind. Dis.
          p. 324-334. _________

        <p>
          Or if it should be allowed, that the ancient heathens believed in
          their religion less generally than the present Indians do, I am far
          from thinking that this circumstance would afford any facility to the
          work of the apostles, above that of the modern missionaries. To me it
          appears, and I think it material to be remarked, that a disbelief of
          the established religion of their country has no tendency to dispose
          men for the reception of another; but that, on the contrary, it
          generates a settled contempt of all religious pretensions whatever.
          General infidelity is the hardest soil which the propagators of a new
          religion can have to work upon. Could a Methodist or Moravian promise
          himself a better chance of success with a French esprit fort, who had
          been accustomed to laugh at the popery of his country, than with a
          believing Mahometan or Hindoo? Or are our modern unbelievers in
          Christianity, for that reason, in danger of becoming Mahometans or
          Hindoos? It does not appear that the Jews, who had a body of
          historical evidence to offer for their religion, and who at that time
          undoubtedly entertained and held forth the expectation of a future
          state, derived any great advantage, as to the extension of their
          system, from the discredit into which the popular religion had fallen
          with many of their heathen neighbours.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have particularly directed our observations to the state and
          progress of Christianity amongst the inhabitants of India: but the
          history of the Christian mission in other countries, where the
          efficacy of the mission is left solely to the conviction wrought by
          the preaching of strangers, presents the same idea as the Indian
          mission does of the feebleness and inadequacy of human means. About
          twenty-five years ago was published, in England, a translation from
          the Dutch of a History of Greenland and a relation of the mission for
          above thirty years carried on in that country by the Unitas Fratrum,
          or Moravians. Every part of that relation confirms the opinion we have
          stated. Nothing could surpass, or hardly equal, the zeal and patience
          of the missionaries. Yet their historian, in the conclusion of his
          narrative, could find place for no reflections more encouraging than
          the following:—&quot;A person that had known the heathen, that had
          seen the little benefit from the great pains hitherto taken with them,
          and considered that one after another had abandoned all hopes of the
          conversion of these infidels (and some thought they would never be
          converted, till they saw miracles wrought as in the apostles&#x27;
          days, and this the Greenlanders expected and demanded of their
          instructors); one that considered this, I say, would not so much
          wonder at the past unfruitfulness of these young beginners, as at
          their steadfast perseverance in the midst of nothing but distress,
          difficulties, and impediments, internally and externally: and that
          they never desponded of the conversion of those poor creatures amidst
          all seeming impossibilities.&quot; (History of Greenland, vol. ii. p.
          376.)
        </p>
        <p>
          From the widely disproportionate effects which attend the preaching of
          modern missionaries of Christianity, compared with what followed the
          ministry of Christ and his apostles under circumstances either alike,
          or not so unlike as to account for the difference, a conclusion is
          fairly drawn in support of what our histories deliver concerning them,
          viz. that they possessed means of conviction which we have not; that
          they had proofs to appeal to which we want.
