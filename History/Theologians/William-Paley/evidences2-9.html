        <h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
        <p>THE PROPAGATION OF CHRISTIANITY.</p>
        <p>
          In this argument, the first consideration is the factâ€”in what degree,
          within what time, and to what extent, Christianity actually was
          propagated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accounts of the matter which can be collected from our books are
          as follow: A few days after Christ&#x27;s disappearance out of the
          world, we find an assembly of disciples at Jerusalem, to the number of
          &quot;about one hundred and twenty;&quot; (Acts i. 15.) which hundred
          and twenty were probably a little association of believers, met
          together not merely as believers in Christ, but as personally
          connected with the apostles, and with one another. Whatever was the
          number of believers then in Jerusalem, we have no reason to be
          surprised that so small a company should assemble: for there is no
          proof that the followers of Christ were yet formed into a society;
          that the society was reduced into any order; that it was at this time
          even understood that a new religion (in the sense which that term
          conveys to us) was to be set up in the world, or how the professors of
          that religion were to be distinguished from the rest of mankind. The
          death of Christ had left, we may suppose, the generality of his
          disciples in great doubt, both as to what they were to do, and
          concerning what was to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          This meeting was holden, as we have already said, a few days after
          Christ&#x27;s ascension: for ten days after that event was the day of
          Pentecost, when, as our history relates, (Acts ii. 1.) upon a signal
          display of divine agency attending the persons of the apostles, there
          were added to the society &quot;about three thousand souls.&quot;
          (Acts ii. 41.) But here, it is not, I think, to be taken, that these
          three thousand were all converted by this single miracle; but rather
          that many who before were believers in Christ became now professors of
          Christianity; that is to say, when they found that a religion was to
          be established, a society formed and set up in the name of Christ,
          governed by his laws, avowing their belief in his mission, united
          amongst themselves, and separated from the rest of the world by
          visible distinctions; in pursuance of their former conviction, and by
          virtue of what they had heard and seen, and known of Christ&#x27;s
          history, they publicly became members of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We read in the fourth chapter (verse 4) of the Acts, that soon after
          this, &quot;the number of the men,&quot; i. e. the society openly
          professing their belief in Christ, &quot;was about five
          thousand.&quot; So that here is an increase of two thousand within a
          very short time. And it is probable that there were many, both now and
          afterwards, who, although they believed in Christ, did not think it
          necessary to join themselves to this society; or who waited to see
          what was likely to become of it. Gamaliel, whose advice to the Jewish
          council is recorded Acts v. 34, appears to have been of this
          description; perhaps Nicodemus, and perhaps also Joseph of Arimathea.
          This class of men, their character and their rank, are likewise
          pointed out by Saint John, in the twelfth chapter of his Gospel:
          &quot;Nevertheless, among the chief rulers also many believed on him,
          but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they
          should be put out of the synagogue, for they loved the praise of men
          more than the praise of God.&quot; Persons such as these might admit
          the miracles of Christ, without being immediately convinced that they
          were under obligation to make a public profession of Christianity at
          the risk of all that was dear to them in life, and even of life
          itself.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * &quot;Beside those who professed, and those who rejected and
          opposed, Christianity, there were in all probability multitudes
          between both, neither perfect Christians nor yet unbelievers. They had
          a favourable opinion of the Gospel, but worldly considerations made
          them unwilling to own it. There were many circumstances which inclined
          them to think that Christianity was a divine revelation, but there
          were many inconveniences which attended the open profession of it; and
          they could not find in themselves courage enough to bear them to
          disoblige their friends and family, to ruin their fortunes, to lose
          their reputation, their liberty, and their life, for the sake of the
          new religion. Therefore they were willing to hope, that if they
          endeavoured to observe the great principles of morality which Christ
          had represented as the principal part, the sum and substance of
          religion; if they thought honourably of the Gospel; if they offered no
          injury to the Christians; if they did them all the services that they
          could safely perform, they were willing to hope that God would accept
          this, and that He would excuse and forgive the rest.&quot;
          Jortin&#x27;s Dis. on the Christ. Rel. p. 91, ed. 4. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          Christianity, however, proceeded to increase in Jerusalem by a
          progress equally rapid with its first success; for in the next chapter
          of our history, we read that &quot;believers were the more added to
          the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.&quot; And this enlargement
          of the new society appears in the first verse of the succeeding
          chapter, wherein we are told, that &quot;when the number of the
          disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians
          against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected;&quot; (Acts
          v. 14; vi. 1) and afterwards, in the same chapter, it is declared
          expressly, that &quot;the number of the disciples multiplied in
          Jerusalem greatly, and that a great company of the priests were
          obedient to the faith.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This I call the first period in the propagation of Christianity. It
          commences with the ascension of Christ, and extends, as may be
          collected from incidental notes of time, (Vide Pearson&#x27;s Antiq.
          1. xviii. c. 7. Benson&#x27;s History of Christ, b. i. p. 148.) to
          something more than one year after that event. During which term, the
          preaching of Christianity, so far as our documents inform us, was
          confined to the single city of Jerusalem. And how did it succeed
          there? The first assembly which we meet with of Christ&#x27;s
          disciples, and that a few days after his removal from the world,
          consisted of &quot;one hundred and twenty.&quot; About a week after
          this, &quot;three thousand were added in one day;&quot; and the number
          of Christians publicly baptized, and publicly associating together,
          was very soon increased to &quot;five thousand.&quot; &quot;Multitudes
          both of men and women continued to be added;&quot; &quot;disciples
          multiplied greatly,&quot; and &quot;many of the Jewish priesthood as
          well as others, became obedient to the faith;&quot; and this within a
          space of less than two years from the commencement of the institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          By reason of a persecution raised against the church at Jerusalem, the
          converts were driven from that city, and dispersed throughout the
          regions of Judea and Samaria. (Acts viii. l.) Wherever they came, they
          brought their religion with them: for our historian informs us, (Acts
          viii. 4.) that &quot;they that were scattered abroad went everywhere
          preaching the word.&quot; The effect of this preaching comes
          afterwards to be noticed, where the historian is led, in the course of
          his narrative, to observe that then (i. e. about three years posterior
          to this, [Benson, b. i. p. 207.]) the churches had rest throughout all
          Judea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified, and walking in the
          fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were
          multiplied. This was the work of the second period, which comprises
          about four years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitherto the preaching of the Gospel had been confined to Jews, to
          Jewish proselytes, and to Samaritans. And I cannot forbear from
          setting down in this place an observation of Mr. Bryant, which appears
          to me to be perfectly well founded;â€”&quot;The Jews still remain: but
          how seldom is it that we can make a single proselyte! There is reason
          to think, that there were more converted by the apostles in one day
          than have since been won over in the last thousand years.&quot;
          (Bryant on the Truth of the Christian Religion, p. 112.) It was not
          yet known to the apostles that they were at liberty to propose the
          religion to mankind at large. That &quot;mystery,&quot; as Saint Paul
          calls it, (Eph. iii. 3â€”6.) and as it then was, was revealed to Peter
          by an especial miracle. It appears to have been (Benson, book ii. p.
          236.) about seven years after Christ&#x27;s ascension that the Gospel
          was preached to the Gentiles of Cesarea. A year after this a great
          multitude of Gentiles were converted at Antioch in Syria. The
          expressions employed by the historian are these:â€”&quot;A great number
          believed, and turned to the Lord;&quot; &quot;much people was added
          unto the Lord;&quot; &quot;the apostles Barnabas and Paul taught much
          people.&quot; (Acts xi. 21, 24, 26.) Upon Herod&#x27;s death, which
          happened in the next year, (Benson, book ii, p. 289.) it is observed,
          that &quot;the word of God grew and multiplied.&quot; (Acts xii. 24.)
          Three years from this time, upon the preaching of Paul at Iconium, the
          metropolis of Lycaonia, &quot;a great multitude both of Jews and
          Greeks believed:&quot; (Acts xiv. 1.) and afterwards, in the course of
          this very progress, he is represented as &quot;making many
          disciples&quot; at Derbe, a principal city in the same district. Three
          years (Benson&#x27;s History of Christ, book iii. p. 50.) after this,
          which brings us to sixteen after the ascension, the apostles wrote a
          public letter from Jerusalem to the Gentile converts in Antioch,
          Syria, and Cilicia, with which letter Paul travelled through these
          countries, and found the churches &quot;established in the faith, and
          increasing in number daily.&quot; (Acts xvi. 5.) From Asia the apostle
          proceeded into Greece, where, soon after his arrival in Macedonia, we
          find him at Thessalonica: in which city, &quot;some of the Jews
          believed, and of the devout Greeks a great multitude.&quot; (Acts
          xvii. 4.) We meet also here with an accidental hint of the general
          progress of the Christian mission, in the exclamation of the
          tumultuous Jews of Thessalonica, &quot;that they who had turned the
          world upside down were come thither also.&quot; (Acts xvii. 6.) At
          Berea, the next city at which Saint Paul arrives, the historian, who
          was present, inform us that &quot;many of the Jews believed.&quot;
          (Acts xvii. 12.) The next year and a half of Saint Paul&#x27;s
          ministry was spent at Corinth. Of his success in that city we receive
          the following intimations; &quot;that many of the Corinthians believed
          and were baptized;&quot; and &quot;that it was revealed to the Apostle
          by Christ, that be had much people in that city.&quot; (Acts xviii,
          8â€”10.) Within less than a year after his departure from Corinth, and
          twenty-five (Benson, book iii. p, 160.) years after the ascension,
          Saint Paul fixed his station at Ephesus for the space of two years
          (Acts xix. 10.) and something more. The effect of his ministry in that
          city and neighbourhood drew from the historian a reflection how
          &quot;mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.&quot; (Acts xix.
          20.) And at the conclusion of this period we find Demetrius at the
          head of a party, who were alarmed by the progress of the religion,
          complaining, that &quot;not only at Ephesus, but also throughout all
          Asia (i. e. the province of Lydia, and the country adjoining to
          Ephesus), this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people.&quot;
          (Acts xix. 26.) Beside these accounts, there occurs, incidentally,
          mention of converts at Rome, Alexandria, Athens, Cyprus, Cyrene,
          Macedonia, Philippi.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the third period in the propagation of Christianity, setting
          off in the seventh year after the ascension, and ending at the
          twenty-eighth. Now, lay these three periods together, and observe how
          the progress of the religion by these accounts is represented. The
          institution, which properly began only after its Author&#x27;s removal
          from the world, before the end of thirty years, had spread itself
          through Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, almost all the numerous districts
          of the Lesser Asia, through Greece, and the islands of the Aegean Sea,
          the seacoast of Africa, and had extended itself to Rome, and into
          Italy. At Antioch, in Syria, at Joppa, Ephesus, Corinth, Thessalonica,
          Berea, Iconium, Derbe, Antioch in Pisidia, at Lydda, Saron, the number
          of converts is intimated by the expressions, &quot;a great
          number,&quot; &quot;great multitudes,&quot; &quot;much people.&quot;
          Converts are mentioned, without any designation of their number,* at
          Tyre, Cesarea, Troas, Athens, Philippi, Lystra, Damascus. During all
          this time Jerusalem continued not only the centre of the mission, but
          a principal seat of the religion; for when Saint Paul returned thither
          at the conclusion of the period of which we are now considering the
          accounts, the other apostles pointed out to him, as a reason for his
          compliance with their advice, &quot;how many thousands (myriads, ten
          thousands) there were in that city who believed.&quot;+
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Considering the extreme conciseness of many parts of the history,
          the silence about the number of converts is no proof of their paucity;
          for at Philippi, no mention whatever is made of the number, yet Saint
          Paul addressed an epistle to that church. The churches of Galatia, and
          the affairs of those churches, were considerable enough to be the
          subject of another letter, and of much of Saint Paul&#x27;s
          solicitude; yet no account is preserved in the history of his success,
          or even of his preaching in that country, except the slight notice
          which these words convey:â€”&quot;When they had gone throughout Phrygia,
          and the region of Galatia, they assayed to go into Bithynia.&quot;
          Acts xvi. 6.
        </p>
        <p>+ Acts xxi. 20. _________</p>
        <p>
          Upon this abstract, and the writing from which it is drawn, the
          following observations seem material to be made:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That the account comes from a person who was himself concerned in a
          portion of what he relates, and was contemporary with the whole of it;
          who visited Jerusalem, and frequented the society of those who had
          acted, and were acting the chief parts in the transaction. I lay down
          this point positively; for had the ancient attestations to this
          valuable record been less satisfactory than they are, the
          unaffectedness and simplicity with which the author notes his presence
          upon certain occasions, and the entire absence of art and design from
          these notices, would have been sufficient to persuade my mind that,
          whoever he was, he actually lived in the times, and occupied the
          situation, in which he represents himself to be. When I say,
          &quot;whoever he was,&quot; I do not mean to cast a doubt upon the
          name to which antiquity hath ascribed the Acts of the Apostles (for
          there is no cause, that I am acquainted with, for questioning it), but
          to observe that, in such a case as this, the time and situation of the
          author are of more importance than his name; and that these appear
          from the work itself, and in the most unsuspicious form.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That this account is a very incomplete account of the preaching
          and propagation of Christianity; I mean, that if what we read in the
          history be true, much more than what the history contains must be true
          also. For, although the narrative from which our information is
          derived has been entitled the Acts of the Apostles, it is, in fact, a
          history of the twelve apostles only during a short time of their
          continuing together at Jerusalem; and even of this period the account
          is very concise. The work afterwards consists of a few important
          passages of Peter&#x27;s ministry, of the speech and death of Stephen,
          of the preaching of Philip the deacon; and the sequel of the volume,
          that is, two thirds of the whole, is taken up with the conversion, the
          travels, the discourses, and history of the new apostle, Paul; in
          which history, also, large portions of time are often passed over with
          very scanty notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. That the account, so far as it goes, is for this very reason more
          credible. Had it been the author&#x27;s design to have displayed the
          early progress of Christianity, he would undoubtedly have collected,
          or at least have set forth, accounts of the preaching of the rest of
          the apostles, who cannot without extreme improbability be supposed to
          have remained silent and inactive, or not to have met with a share of
          that success which attended their colleagues.
        </p>
        <p>To which may be added, as an observation of the same kind,</p>
        <p>
          IV. That the intimations of the number of converts, and of the success
          of the preaching of the apostles, come out for the most part
          incidentally: are drawn from the historian by the occasion, such as
          the murmuring of the Grecian converts; the rest from persecution;
          Herod&#x27;s death; the sending of Barnabas to Antioch, and Barnabas
          calling Paul to his assistance; Paul coming to a place and finding
          there disciples; the clamour of the Jews; the complaint of artificers
          interested in the support of the popular religion; the reason assigned
          to induce Paul to give satisfaction to the Christians of Jerusalem.
          Had it not been for these occasions it is probable that no notice
          whatever would have been taken of the number of converts in several of
          the passages in which that notice now appears. All this tends to
          remove the suspicion of a design to exaggerate or deceive.
        </p>
        <p>
          PARALLEL TESTIMONIES with the history are the letters of Saint Paul,
          and of the other apostles, which have come down to us. Those of Saint
          Paul are addressed to the churches of Corinth, Philippi, Thessalonica,
          the church of Galatia, and, if the inscription be right, of Ephesus;
          his ministry at all which places is recorded in the history: to the
          church of Colosse, or rather to the churches of Colosse and Laodicea
          jointly, which he had not then visited. They recognise by reference
          the churches of Judea, the churches of Asia, and &quot;all the
          churches of the Gentiles.&quot; (Thess ii. 14.) In the Epistle to the
          Romans (Rom. xv. 18, 19.) the author is led to deliver a remarkable
          declaration concerning the extent of his preaching, its efficacy, and
          the cause to which he ascribes it,â€”&quot;to make the Gentiles obedient
          by word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of
          the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto
          Illyricum, I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ.&quot; In the
          epistle to the Colossians, (Col. i. 23.) we find an oblique but very
          strong signification of the then general state of the Christian
          mission, at least as it appeared to Saint Paul:â€”&quot;If ye continue
          in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the
          hope of the Gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to
          every creature which is under heaven;&quot; which Gospel, he had
          reminded them near the beginning of his letter (Col. i. 6.), &quot;was
          present with them, as it was in all the world.&quot; The expressions
          are hyperbolical; but they are hyperboles which could only be used by
          a writer who entertained a strong sense of the subject. The first
          epistle of Peter accosts the Christians dispersed throughout Pontus,
          Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
        </p>
        <p>
          It comes next to be considered how far these accounts are confirmed or
          followed up by other evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tacitus, in delivering a relation, which has already been laid before
          the reader, of the fire which happened at Rome in the tenth year of
          Nero (which coincides with the thirtieth year after Christ&#x27;s
          ascension), asserts that the emperor, in order to suppress the rumours
          of having been himself the author of the mischief, procured the
          Christians to be accused. Of which Christians, thus brought into his
          narrative, the following is so much of the historian&#x27;s account as
          belongs to our present purpose: &quot;They had their denomination from
          Christus, who, in the reign of Tiberius, was put to death as a
          criminal by the procurator Pontius Pilate. This pernicious
          superstition, though checked for a while, broke out again, and spread
          not only over Judea, but reached the city also. At first they only
          were apprehended who confessed themselves of that sect; afterwards
          vast multitude were discovered by them.&quot; This testimony to the
          early propagation of Christianity is extremely material. It is from an
          historian of great reputation, living near the time; from a stranger
          and an enemy to the religion; and it joins immediately with the period
          through which the Scripture accounts extend. It establishes these
          points: that the religion began at Jerusalem; that it spread
          throughout Judea; that it had reached Rome, and not only so, but that
          it had there obtained a great number of converts. This was about six
          years after the time that Saint Paul wrote his Epistle to the Romans,
          and something more than two years after he arrived there himself. The
          converts to the religion were then so numerous at Rome, that of those
          who were betrayed by the information of the persons first persecuted,
          a great multitude (multitudo ingens) were discovered and seized.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems probable, that the temporary check which Tacitus represents
          Christianity to have received (repressa in praesens) referred to the
          persecution of Jerusalem which followed the death of Stephen (Acts
          viii.); and which, by dispersing the converts, caused the institution,
          in some measure, to disappear. Its second eruption at the same place,
          and within a short time, has much in it of the character of truth. It
          was the firmness and perseverance of men who knew what they relied
          upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next in order of time, and perhaps superior in importance is the
          testimony of Pliny the Younger. Pliny was the Roman governor of Pontus
          and Bithynia, two considerable districts in the northern part of Asia
          Minor. The situation in which he found his province led him to apply
          to the emperor (Trajan) for his direction as to the conduct he was to
          hold towards the Christians. The letter in which this application is
          contained was written not quite eighty years after Christ&#x27;s
          ascension. The president, in this letter, states the measures he had
          already pursued, and then adds, as his reason for resorting to the
          emperor&#x27;s counsel and authority, the following
          words:â€”&quot;Suspending all judicial proceedings, I have recourse to
          you for advice; for it has appeared to me a matter highly deserving
          consideration, especially on account of the great number of persons
          who are in danger of suffering: for many of all ages, and of every
          rank, of both sexes likewise, are accused, and will be accused. Nor
          has the contagion of this superstition seized cities only, but the
          lesser towns also, and the open country. Nevertheless it seemed to me
          that it may be restrained and corrected. It is certain that the
          temples, which were almost forsaken, begin to be more frequented; and
          the sacred solemnities, after a long intermission, are revived.
          Victims, likewise, are everywhere (passim) bought up; whereas, for
          some time, there were few to purchase them. Whence it is easy to
          imagine that numbers of men might be reclaimed if pardon were granted
          to those that shall repent.&quot; (C. Plin. Trajano Imp. lib. x. ep.
          xcvii.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is obvious to observe, that the passage of Pliny&#x27;s letter here
          quoted, proves, not only that the Christians in Pontus and Bithynia
          were now numerous, but that they had subsisted there for some
          considerable time. &quot;It is certain,&quot; he says, &quot;that the
          temples, which were almost forsaken (plainly ascribing this desertion
          of the popular worship to the prevalency of Christianity), begin to be
          more frequented; and the sacred solemnities, after a long
          intermission, are revived.&quot; There are also two clauses in the
          former part of the letter which indicate the same thing; one, in which
          he declares that he had &quot;never been present at any trials of
          Christians, and therefore knew not what was the usual subject of
          inquiry and punishment, or how far either was wont to be urged.&quot;
          The second clause is the following: &quot;Others were named by an
          informer, who, at first, confessed themselves Christians, and
          afterwards denied it; the rest said they had been Christians some
          three years ago, some longer, and some about twenty years.&quot; It is
          also apparent, that Pliny speaks of the Christians as a description of
          men well known to the person to whom he writes. His first sentence
          concerning them is, &quot;I have never been present at the trials of
          Christians.&quot; This mention of the name of Christians, without any
          preparatory explanation, shows that it was a term familiar both to the
          writer of the letter and the person to whom it was addressed. Had it
          not been so, Pliny would naturally have begun his letter by informing
          the emperor that he had met with a certain set of men in the province
          called Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here then is a very singular evidence of the progress of the Christian
          religion in a short space. It was not fourscore years after the
          crucifixion of Jesus when Pliny wrote this letter; nor seventy years
          since the apostles of Jesus began to mention his name to the Gentile
          world. Bithynia and Pontus were at a great distance from Judea, the
          centre from which the religion spread; yet in these provinces
          Christianity had long subsisted, and Christians were now in such
          numbers as to lead the Roman governor to report to the emperor that
          they were found not only in cities, but in villages and in open
          countries; of all ages, of every rank and condition; that they
          abounded so much as to have produced a visible desertion of the
          temples; that beasts brought to market for victims had few purchasers;
          that the sacred solemnities were much neglected:â€”circumstances noted
          by Pliny for the express purpose of showing to the emperor the effect
          and prevalency of the new institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          No evidence remains by which it can be proved that the Christians were
          more numerous in Pontus and Bithynia than in other parts of the Roman
          empire; nor has any reason been offered to show why they should be so.
          Christianity did not begin in these countries, nor near them. I do not
          know, therefore, that we ought to confine the description in
          Pliny&#x27;s letter to the state of Christianity in these provinces,
          even if no other account of the same subject had come down to us; but,
          certainly, this letter may fairly be applied in aid and confirmation
          of the representations given of the general state of Christianity in
          the world, by Christian writers of that and the next succeeding age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Justin Martyr, who wrote about thirty years after Pliny, and one
          hundred and six after the ascension, has these remarkable words:
          &quot;There is not a nation, either of Greek or barbarian, or of any
          other name, even of those who wander in tribes, and live in tents,
          amongst whom prayers and thanksgivings are not offered to the Father
          and Creator of the universe by the name of the crucified Jesus.&quot;
          (Dial cum Tryph.) Tertullian, who comes about fifty years after
          Justin, appeals to the governors of the Roman empire in these terms:
          &quot;We were but of yesterday, and we have filled your cities,
          islands, towns, and boroughs, the camp, the senate, and the forum.
          They (the heathen adversaries of Christianity) lament that every sex,
          age, and condition, and persons of every rank also, are converts to
          that name.&quot; (Tertull. Apol. c. 37.) I do allow that these
          expressions are loose, and may be called declamatory. But even
          declamation hath its bounds; this public boasting upon a subject which
          must be known to every reader was not only useless but unnatural,
          unless the truth of the case, in a considerable degree, corresponded
          with the description; at least, unless it had been both true and
          notorious, that great multitudes of Christians, of all ranks and
          orders, were to be found in most parts of the Roman empire. The same
          Tertullian, in another passage, by way of setting forth the extensive
          diffusion of Christianity, enumerates as belonging to Christ, beside
          many other countries, the &quot;Moors and Gaetulians of Africa, the
          borders of Spain, several nations of France, and parts of Britain
          inaccessible to the Romans, the Sarmatians, Daci, Germans, and
          Scythians;&quot; (Ad Jud. c. 7.) and, which is more material than the
          extent of the institution, the number of Christians in the several
          countries in which it prevailed is thus expressed by him:
          &quot;Although so great a multitude, that in almost every city we form
          the greater part, we pass our time modestly and in silence.&quot; (Ad
          Scap. c. iii.) A Clemens Alexandrinus, who preceded Tertullian by a
          few years, introduced a comparison between the success of Christianity
          and that of the most celebrated philosophical institutions: &quot;The
          philosophers were confined to Greece, and to their particular
          retainers; but the doctrine of the Master of Christianity not remain
          in Judea, as philosophy did in Greece, but is throughout the whole
          world, in every nation, and village, and city, both of Greeks and
          barbarians, converting both whole houses and separate individuals,
          having already brought over to the truth not a few of the philosophers
          themselves. If the Greek philosophy he prohibited, it immediately
          vanishes; whereas, from the first preaching of our doctrine, kings and
          tyrants, governors and presidents, with their whole train, and with
          the populace on their side, have endeavoured with their whole might to
          exterminate it, yet doth it flourish more and more.&quot; (Clem. AI.
          Strora. lib. vi. ad fin.) Origen, who follows Tertullian at the
          distance of only thirty years, delivers nearly the same account:
          &quot;In every part of the world,&quot; says he, &quot;throughout all
          Greece, and in all other nations, there are innumerable and immense
          multitudes, who, having left the laws of their country, and those whom
          they esteemed gods, have given themselves up to the law of Moses, and
          the religion of Christ: and this not without the bitterest resentment
          from the idolaters, by whom they were frequently put to torture, and
          sometimes to death: and it is wonderful to observe how, in so short a
          time, the religion has increased, amidst punishment and death, and
          every kind of torture.&quot; (Orig. in Cels. lib. i.) In another
          passage, Origen draws the following candid comparison between the
          state of Christianity in his time and the condition of its more
          primitive ages: &quot;By the good providence of God, the Christian
          religion has so flourished and increased continually that it is now
          preached freely without molestation, although there were a thousand
          obstacles to the spreading of the doctrine of Jesus in the world. But
          as it was the will of God that the Gentiles should have the benefit of
          it, all the counsels of men against the Christians were defeated: and
          by how much the more emperors and governors of provinces, and the
          people everywhere strove to depress them, so much the more have they
          increased and prevailed exceedingly.&quot; (Orig. cont. Cels. lib
          vii.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is well known that, within less than eighty years after this, the
          Roman empire became Christian under Constantine: and it is probable
          that Constantine declared himself on the side of the Christians
          because they were the powerful party: for Arnobius, who wrote
          immediately before Constantine&#x27;s accession, speaks of &quot;the
          whole world as filled with Christ&#x27;s doctrine, of its diffusion
          throughout all countries, of an innumerable body of Christians in
          distant provinces, of the strange revolution of opinion of men of the
          greatest genius,â€”orators, grammarians, rhetoricians, lawyers,
          physicians having come over to the institution, and that also in the
          face of threats, executions and tortures.&quot; (Arnob. in Genres, 1.
          i. pp. 27, 9, 24, 42, 41. edit. Lug. Bat. 1650.)
        </p>
        <p>
          And not more than twenty years after Constantine&#x27;s entire
          possession of the empire, Julius Firmiens Maternus calls upon the
          emperors Constantius and Constans to extirpate the relics of the
          ancient religion; the reduced and fallen condition of which is
          described by our author in the following words: &quot;Licet adhue in
          quibusdam regionibus idololatriae morientia palpitont membra; tamen in
          eo res est, ut a Christianis omnibus terris pestiferum hoc malum
          funditus amputetur:&quot; and in another place, &quot;Modicum tautum
          superest, ut legibus vestrisâ€”extincta idololatriae pereat funesta
          contagio.&quot; (De Error. Profan. Relig. c. xxi. p. 172, quoted by
          Lardner, vol. viii. p. 262.) It will not be thought that we quote this
          writer in order to recommend his temper or his judgment, but to show
          the comparative state of Christianity and of Heathenism at this
          period. Fifty years afterwards, Jerome represents the decline of
          Paganism, in language which conveys the same idea of its approaching
          extinction: &quot;Solitudinem patitur et in urbe gentilitas. Dii
          quondam nationum, cum bubonibus et noctuis, in solis culminibus
          remanserunt.&quot; (Jer. ad Lect. ep. 5, 7.) Jerome here indulges a
          triumph, natural and allowable in a zealous friend of the cause, but
          which could only be suggested to his mind by the consent and
          universality with which he saw; the religion received. &quot;But
          now,&quot; says he, &quot;the passion and resurrection of Christ are
          celebrated in the discourses and writings of all nations. I need not
          mention Jews, Greeks, and Latins. The Indians, Persians, Goths, and
          Egyptians philosophise, and firmly believe the immortality of the
          soul, and future recompenses, which, before, the greatest philosophers
          had denied, or doubted of, or perplexed with their disputes. The
          fierceness of Thracians and Scythians is now softened by the gentle
          sound of the Gospel; and everywhere Christ is all in all.&quot; (Jer.
          ad Lect. ep. 8, ad Heliod.) Were, therefore, the motives of
          Constantine&#x27;s conversion ever so problematical, the easy
          establishment of Christianity, and the ruin of Heathenism, under him
          and his immediate successors, is of itself a proof of the progress
          which had made in the preceding period. It may be added also,
          &quot;that Maxentius, the rival of Constantine, had shown himself
          friendly to the Christians. Therefore of those who were contending for
          worldly power and empire, one actually favoured and flattered them,
          and another may be suspected to have joined himself to them partly
          from consideration of interest: so considerable were they become,
          under external disadvantages of all sorts.&quot; (Lardner, vol. vii.
          p. 380.) This at least is certain, that, throughout the whole
          transaction hitherto, the great seemed to follow, not to lead, the
          public opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may help to convey to us some notion of the extent and progress of
          Christianity, or rather of the character and quality of many early
          Christians, of their learning and their labours, to notice the number
          of Christian writers who flourished in these ages. Saint Jerome&#x27;s
          catalogue contains sixty-six writers within the first three centuries,
          and the first six years of the fourth; and fifty-four between that
          time and his own, viz. A. D. 392. Jerome introduces his catalogue with
          the following just remonstrance:â€”&quot;Let those who say the church
          has had no philosophers, nor eloquent and learned men, observe who and
          what they were who founded, established, and adorned it; let them
          cease to accuse our faith of rusticity, and confess their
          mistake.&quot; (Jer. Prol. in Lib. de Ser. Eccl.) Of these writers,
          several, as Justin, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian,
          Origen, Bardesanes, Hippolitus, Eusebius, were voluminous writers.
          Christian writers abounded particularly about the year 178. Alexander,
          bishop of Jerusalem, founded a library in that city, A.D. 212.
          Pamphilus, the friend of Origen, founded a library at Cesarea, A.D.
          294. Public defences were also set forth, by various advocates of the
          religion, in the course of its first three centuries. Within one
          hundred years after Christ&#x27;s ascension, Quadratus and Aristides,
          whose works, except some few fragments of the first, are lost; and,
          about twenty years afterwards, Justin Martyr, whose works remain,
          presented apologies for the Christian religion to the Roman emperors;
          Quadratus and Aristides to Adrian, Justin to Antoninus Pins, and a
          second to Marcus Antoninus. Melito, bishop of Sardis, and Apollinaris,
          bishop of Hierapolis, and Miltiades, men of great reputation, did the
          same to Marcus Antoninus, twenty years afterwards; (Euseb. Hist. lib.
          iv. c. 26. See also Lardner, vol. ii. p. 666.) and ten years after
          this, Apollonius, who suffered martyrdom under the emperor Commodus,
          composed an apology for his faith which he read in the senate, and
          which was afterwards published. (Lardner, vol. ii. p. 687.) Fourteen
          years after the apology of Apollonius, Tertullian addressed the work
          which now remains under that name to the governors of provinces in the
          Roman empire; and, about the same time, Minucius Felix composed a
          defence of the Christian religion, which is still extant; and, shortly
          after the conclusion of this century, copious defences of Christianity
          were published by Arnobius and Lactantius.
