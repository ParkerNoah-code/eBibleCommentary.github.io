        <h2>PREPARATORY CONSIDERATIONS.</h2>
        <p>
          I deem it unnecessary to prove that mankind stood in need of a
          revelation because I have met with no serious person who thinks that,
          even under the Christian revelation, we have too much light, or any
          degree of assurance which is superfluous. I desire, moreover, that in
          judging of Christianity, it may be remembered that the question lies
          between this religion and none: for, if the Christian religion be not
          credible, no one, with whom we have to do, will support the
          pretensions of any other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose, then, the world we live in to have had a Creator; suppose it
          to appear, from the predominant aim and tendency of the provisions and
          contrivances observable in the universe, that the Deity, when he
          formed it, consulted for the happiness of his sensitive creation;
          suppose the disposition which dictated this counsel to continue;
          suppose a part of the creation to have received faculties from their
          Maker, by which they are capable of rendering a moral obedience to his
          will, and of voluntarily pursuing any end for which he has designed
          them; suppose the Creator to intend for these, his rational and
          accountable agents, a second state of existence, in which their
          situation will be by their behaviour in the first state, by which
          suppose (and by no other) the objection to the divine government in
          not putting a difference between the good and the bad, and the
          inconsistency of this confusion with the care and benevolence
          discoverable in the works of the Deity is done away; suppose it to be
          of the utmost importance to the subjects of this dispensation to know
          what is intended for them, that is, suppose the knowledge of it to be
          highly conducive to the happiness of the species, a purpose which so
          many provisions of nature are calculated to promote: Suppose,
          nevertheless, almost the whole race, either by the imperfection of
          their faculties, the misfortune of their situation, or by the loss of
          some prior revelation, to want this knowledge, and not to be likely,
          without the aid of a new revelation, to attain it; under these
          circumstances, is it improbable that a revelation should be made? Is
          it incredible that God should interpose for such a purpose? Suppose
          him to design for mankind a future state; is it unlikely that he
          should acquaint him with it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now in what way can a revelation be made, but by miracles? In none
          which we are able to conceive. Consequently, in whatever degree it is
          probable, or not very improbable, that a revelation should be
          communicated to mankind at all: in the same degree is it probable, or
          not very improbable, that miracles should be wrought. Therefore, when
          miracles are related to have been wrought in the promulgating of a
          revelation manifestly wanted, and, if true, of inestimable value, the
          improbability which arises from the miraculous nature of the things
          related is not greater than the original improbability that such a
          revelation should be imparted by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish it, however, to be correctly understood, in what manner, and to
          what extent, this argument is alleged. We do not assume the attributes
          of the Deity, or the existence of a future state, in order to prove
          the reality of miracles. That reality always must be proved by
          evidence. We assert only, that in miracles adduced in support of
          revelation there is not any such antecedent improbability as no
          testimony can surmount. And for the purpose of maintaining this
          assertion, we contend, that the incredibility of miracles related to
          have been wrought in attestation of a message from God, conveying
          intelligence of a future state of rewards and punishments, and
          teaching mankind how to prepare themselves for that state, is not in
          itself greater than the event, call it either probable or improbable,
          of the two following propositions being true: namely, first, that a
          future state of existence should be destined by God for his human
          creation; and, secondly, that, being so destined, he should acquaint
          them with it. It is not necessary for our purpose, that these
          propositions be capable of proof, or even that, by arguments drawn
          from the light of nature, they can be made out to be probable; it is
          enough that we are able to say concerning them, that they are not so
          violently improbable, so contradictory to what we already believe of
          the divine power and character, that either the propositions
          themselves, or facts strictly connected with the propositions (and
          therefore no further improbable than they are improbable), ought to be
          rejected at first sight, and to be rejected by whatever strength or
          complication of evidence they be attested.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the prejudication we would resist. For to this length does a
          modern objection to miracles go, viz., that no human testimony can in
          any case render them credible. I think the reflection above stated,
          that, if there be a revelation, there must be miracles, and that,
          under the circumstances in which the human species are placed, a
          revelation is not improbable, or not to any great degree, to be a fair
          answer to the whole objection.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since it is an objection which stands in the very threshold our
          argument, and, if admitted, is a bar to every proof, and to all future
          reasoning upon the subject, it may be necessary, before we proceed
          further, to examine the principle upon which it professes to be
          founded; which principle is concisely this, That it is contrary to
          experience that a miracle should be true, but not contrary to
          experience that testimony should be false.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there appears a small ambiguity in the term
          &quot;experience,&quot; and in the phrases, &quot;contrary to
          experience,&quot; or &quot;contradicting experience,&quot; which it
          may be necessary to remove in the first place. Strictly speaking, the
          narrative of a fact is then only contrary to experience, when the fact
          is related to have existed at a time and place, at which time and
          place we being present did not perceive it to exist; as if it should
          be asserted, that in a particular room, and at a particular hour of a
          certain day, a man was raised from the dead, in which room, and at the
          time specified, we, being present and looking on, perceived no such
          event to have taken place. Here the assertion is contrary to
          experience properly so called; and this is a contrariety which no
          evidence can surmount. It matters nothing, whether the fact be of a
          miraculous nature, or not. But although this be the experience, and
          the contrariety, which Archbishop Tillotson alleged in the quotation
          with which Mr. Hume opens his Essay, it is certainly not that
          experience, nor that contrariety, which Mr. Hume himself intended to
          object. And short of this I know no intelligible signification which
          can be affixed to the term &quot;contrary to experience,&quot; but
          one, viz., that of not having ourselves experienced anything similar
          to the thing related, or such things not being generally experienced
          by others. I say &quot;not generally&quot; for to state concerning the
          fact in question, that no such thing was ever experienced, or that
          universal experience is against it, is to assume the subject of the
          controversy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the improbability which arises from the want (for this properly is
          a want, not a contradiction) of experience, is only equal to the
          probability there is, that, if the thing were true, we should
          experience things similar to it, or that such things would be
          generally experienced. Suppose it then to be true that miracles were
          wrought on the first promulgation of Christianity, when nothing but
          miracles could decide its authority, is it certain that such miracles
          would be repeated so often, and in so many places, as to become
          objects of general experience? Is it a probability approaching to
          certainty? Is it a probability of any great strength or force? Is it
          such as no evidence can encounter? And yet this probability is the
          exact converse, and therefore the exact measure, of the improbability
          which arises from the want of experience, and which Mr. Hume
          represents as invincible by human testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not like alleging a new law of nature, or a new experiment in
          natural philosophy; because, when these are related, it is expected
          that, under the same circumstances, the same effect will follow
          universally; and in proportion as this expectation is justly
          entertained, the want of a corresponding experience negatives the
          history. But to expect concerning a miracle, that it should succeed
          upon a repetition, is to expect that which would make it cease to be a
          miracle, which is contrary to its nature as such, and would totally
          destroy the use and purpose for which it was wrought.
        </p>
        <p>
          The force of experience as an objection to miracles is founded in the
          presumption, either that the course of nature is invariable, or that,
          if it be ever varied, variations will be frequent and general. Has the
          necessity of this alternative been demonstrated? Permit us to call the
          course of nature the agency of an intelligent Being, and is there any
          good reason for judging this state of the case to be probable? Ought
          we not rather to expect that such a Being, on occasions of peculiar
          importance, may interrupt the order which he had appointed, yet, that
          such occasions should return seldom; that these interruptions
          consequently should be confined to the experience of a few; that the
          want of it, therefore, in many, should be matter neither of surprise
          nor objection?
        </p>
        <p>
          But, as a continuation of the argument from experience, it is said
          that, when we advance accounts of miracles, we assign effects without
          causes, or we attribute effects to causes inadequate to the purpose,
          or to causes of the operation of which we have no experience of what
          causes, we may ask, and of what effects, does the objection speak? If
          it be answered that, when we ascribe the cure of the palsy to a touch,
          of blindness to the anointing of the eyes with clay, or the raising of
          the dead to a word, we lay ourselves open to this imputation; we reply
          that we ascribe no such effects to such causes. We perceive no virtue
          or energy in these things more than in other things of the same kind.
          They are merely signs to connect the miracle with its end. The effect
          we ascribe simply to the volition of Deity; of whose existence and
          power, not to say of whose Presence and agency, we have previous and
          independent proof. We have, therefore, all we seek for in the works of
          rational agents—a sufficient power and an adequate motive. In a word,
          once believe that there is a God, and miracles are not incredible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Hume states the ease of miracles to be a contest of opposite
          improbabilities, that is to say, a question whether it be more
          improbable that the miracle should be true, or the testimony false:
          and this I think a fair account of the controversy. But herein I
          remark a want of argumentative justice, that, in describing the
          improbability of miracles, he suppresses all those circumstances of
          extenuation, which result from our knowledge of the existence, power,
          and disposition of the Deity; his concern in the creation, the end
          answered by the miracle, the importance of that end, and its
          subserviency to the plan pursued in the work of nature. As Mr. Hume
          has represented the question, miracles are alike incredible to him who
          is previously assured of the constant agency of a Divine Being, and to
          him who believes that no such Being exists in the universe. They are
          equally incredible, whether related to have been wrought upon occasion
          the most deserving, and for purposes the most beneficial, or for no
          assignable end whatever, or for an end confessedly trifling or
          pernicious. This surely cannot be a correct statement. In adjusting
          also the other side of the balance, the strength and weight of
          testimony, this author has provided an answer to every possible
          accumulation of historical proof by telling us that we are not obliged
          to explain how the story of the evidence arose. Now I think that we
          are obliged; not, perhaps, to show by positive accounts how it did,
          but by a probable hypothesis how it might so happen. The existence of
          the testimony is a phenomenon; the truth of the fact solves the
          phenomenon. If we reject this solution, we ought to have some other to
          rest in; and none, even by our adversaries, can be admired, which is
          not inconsistent with the principles that regulate human affairs and
          human conduct at present, or which makes men then to have been a
          different kind of beings from what they are now.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the short consideration which, independently of every other,
          convinces me that there is no solid foundation in Mr. Hume&#x27;s
          conclusion, is the following. When a theorem is proposed to a
          mathematician, the first thing he does with it is to try it upon a
          simple case, and if it produce a false result, he is sure that there
          must be some mistake in the demonstration. Now to proceed in this way
          with what may be called Mr. Hume&#x27;s theorem. If twelve men, whose
          probity and good sense I had long known, should seriously and
          circumstantially relate to me an account of a miracle wrought before
          their eyes, and in which it was impossible that they should be
          deceived: if the governor of the country, hearing a rumour of this
          account, should call these men into his presence, and offer them a
          short proposal, either to confess the imposture, or submit to be tied
          up to a gibbet; if they should refuse with one voice to acknowledge
          that there existed any falsehood or imposture in the case: if this
          threat were communicated to them separately, yet with no different
          effect; if it was at last executed; if I myself saw them, one after
          another, consenting to be racked, burnt, or strangled, rather than
          live up the truth of their account;—still if Mr. Hume&#x27;s rule be
          my guide, I am not to believe them. Now I undertake to say that there
          exists not a sceptic in the world who would not believe them, or who
          would defend such incredulity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instances of spurious miracles supported by strong apparent testimony
          undoubtedly demand examination; Mr. Hume has endeavoured to fortify
          his argument by some examples of this kind. I hope in a proper place
          to show that none of them reach the strength or circumstances of the
          Christian evidence. In these, however, consists the weight of his
          objection; in the principle itself, I am persuaded, there is none.
