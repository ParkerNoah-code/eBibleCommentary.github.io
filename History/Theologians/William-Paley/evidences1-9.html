        <h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
        <p>
          There is satisfactory evidence that many, professing to be original
          witnesses of the Christian miracles, passed their lives in labours,
          dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation of the
          accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of their
          belief of those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the same
          motives, to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>OF THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE SCRIPTURES.</p>
        <p>
          Not forgetting, therefore, what credit is due to the evangelical
          history, supposing even any one of the four Gospels to be genuine;
          what credit is due to the Gospels, even supposing nothing to be known
          concerning them but that they were written by early disciples of the
          religion, and received with deference by early Christian churches;
          more especially not forgetting what credit is due to the New Testament
          in its capacity of cumulative evidence; we now proceed to state the
          proper and distinct proofs, which show not only the general value of
          these records, but their specific authority, and the high probability
          there is that they actually came from the persons whose names they
          bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are, however, a few preliminary reflections, by which we may
          draw up with more regularity to the propositions upon which the close
          and particular discussion of the subject depends. Of which nature are
          the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We are able to produce a great number of ancient manuscripts, found
          in many different countries, and in countries widely distant from each
          other, all of them anterior to the art of printing, some Certainly
          seven or eight hundred years old, and some which have been preserved
          probably above a thousand years.* We have also many ancient versions
          of these books, and some of them into languages which are not at
          present, nor for many ages have been, spoken in any part of the world.
          The existence of these manuscripts and versions proves that the
          Scriptures were not the production of any modern contrivance. It does
          away also the uncertainty which hangs over such publications as the
          works, real or pretended, of Ossian and Rowley, in which the editors
          are challenged to produce their manuscripts and to show where they
          obtained their copies. The number of manuscripts, far exceeding those
          of any other book, and their wide dispersion, afford an argument, in
          some measure to the senses, that the Scriptures anciently, in like
          manner as at this day, were more read and sought after than any other
          books, and that also in many different countries. The greatest part of
          spurious Christian writings are utterly lost, the rest preserved by
          some single manuscript. There is weight also in Dr. Bentley&#x27;s
          observation, that the New Testament has suffered less injury by the
          errors of transcribers than the works of any profane author of the
          same size and antiquity; that is, there never was any writing, in the
          preservation and purity of which the world was so interested or so
          careful.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * The Alexandrian manuscript, now in the British Museum, was written
          probably in the fourth or fifth century. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          II. An argument of great weight with those who are judges of the
          proofs upon which it is founded, and capable, through their testimony,
          of being addressed to every understanding, is that which arises from
          the style and language of the New Testament. It is just such a
          language as might be expected from the apostles, from persons of their
          age and in their situation, and from no other persons. It is the style
          neither of classic authors, nor of the ancient Christian fathers, but
          Greek coming from men of Hebrew origin; abounding, that is, with
          Hebraic and Syriac idioms, such as would naturally be found in the
          writings of men who used a language spoken indeed where they lived,
          but not the common dialect of the country. This happy peculiarity is a
          strong proof of the genuineness of these writings: for who should
          forge them? The Christian fathers were for the most part totally
          ignorant of Hebrew, and therefore were not likely to insert Hebraisms
          and Syriasms into their writings. The few who had a knowledge of the
          Hebrew, as Justin Martyr, Origen, and Epiphanius, wrote in a language
          which hears no resemblance to that of the New Testament. The
          Nazarenes, who understood Hebrew, used chiefly, perhaps almost
          entirely, the Gospel of Saint Matthew, and therefore cannot be
          suspected of forging the rest of the sacred writings. The argument, at
          any rate, proves the antiquity of these books; that they belonged to
          the age of the apostles; that they could be composed, indeed, in no
          other.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * See this argument stated more at large in Michaelis&#x27;s
          Introduction,
        </p>
        <p>
          (Marsh&#x27;s translation,) vol. i. c. ii. sect. 10, from which these
        </p>
        <p>observations are taken.</p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          III. Why should we question the genuineness of these books? Is it for
          that they contain accounts of supernatural events? I apprehend that
          this, at the bottom, is the real, though secret, cause of our
          hesitation about them: for had the writings inscribed with the names
          of Matthew and John related nothing but ordinary history, there would
          have been no more doubt whether these writings were theirs than there
          is concerning the acknowledged works of Josephus or Philo; that is,
          there would have been no doubt at all. Now it ought to be considered
          that this reason, however it may apply to the credit which is given to
          a writer&#x27;s judgment or veracity, affects the question of
          genuineness very indirectly. The works of Bede exhibit many wonderful
          relations: but who, for that reason, doubts that they were written by
          Bede? The same of a multitude of other authors. To which may be added
          that we ask no more for our books than what we allow to other books in
          some sort similar to ours: we do not deny the genuineness of the
          Koran; we admit that the history of Apollonius Tyanaeus, purporting to
          be written by Philostratus, was really written by Philostratus.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. If it had been an easy thing in the early times of the institution
          to have forged Christian writings, and to have obtained currency and
          reception to the forgeries, we should have had many appearing in the
          name of Christ himself. No writings would have been received with so
          much avidity and respect as these: consequently none afforded so great
          a temptation to forgery. Yet have we heard but of one attempt of this
          sort, deserving of the smallest notice, that in a piece of a very few
          lines, and so far from succeeding, I mean, from obtaining acceptance
          and reputation, or an acceptance an reputation in anywise similar to
          that which can be proved to have attended the books of the New
          Testament, that it is not so much as mentioned by any writer of the
          first three centuries. The learned reader need not be informed that I
          mean the epistle of Christ to Abgarus, king of Edessa, found at
          present in the work of Eusebius,* as a piece acknowledged by him,
          though not without considerable doubt whether the whole passage be not
          an interpolation, as it is most certain, that, after the publication
          of Eusebius&#x27;s work, this epistle was universally rejected.+
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Hist. Eccl. lib. i. c. 15. + Augustin, A.D. 895 (De Consens. Evan.
          c. 34), had heard that the Pagans pretended to be possessed of an
          epistle of Christ to Peter and Paul; but he had never seen it, and
          appears to doubt of the existence of any such piece either genuine or
          spurious. No other ancient writer mentions it. He also, and he alone,
          notices, and that in order to condemn it, an epistle ascribed to
          Christ by the Manichees, A.D. 270, and a short hymn attributed to him
          by the Priscillianists, A.D. 378 (cont. Faust. Man. Lib xxviii, c,4).
          The lateness of the writer who notices these things, the manner in
          which he notices them, and above all, the silence of every preceding
          writer, render them unworthy on of consideration. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          V. If the ascription of the Gospels to their respective authors had
          been arbitrary or conjectural, they would have been ascribed to more
          eminent men. This observation holds concerning the first three
          Gospels, the reputed authors of which were enabled, by their
          situation, to obtain true intelligence, and were likely to deliver an
          honest account of what they knew, but were persons not distinguished
          in the history by extraordinary marks of notice or commendation. Of
          the apostles, I hardly know any one of whom less is said than of
          Matthew, or of whom the little that is said is less calculated to
          magnify his character. Of Mark, nothing is said in the Gospels; and
          what is said of any person of that name in the Acts, and in the
          epistles, in no part bestows praise or eminence upon him. The name of
          Luke is mentioned only in St Paul&#x27;s epistles,* and that very
          transiently. The judgment, therefore, which assigned these writings to
          these authors proceeded, it may be presumed, upon proper knowledge and
          evidence, and not upon a voluntary choice of names.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Christian writers and Christian churches appear to have soon
          arrived at a very general agreement upon the subject, and that without
          the interposition of any public authority. When the diversity of
          opinion which prevailed, and prevails among Christians in other
          points, is considered, their concurrence in the canon of Scripture is
          remarkable, and of great weight, especially as it seems to have been
          the result of private and free inquiry. We have no knowledge of any
          interference of authority in the question before the council of
          Laodicea in the year 363. Probably the decree of this council rather
          declared than regulated the public judgment, or, more properly
          speaking, the judgment of some neighbouring churches; the council
          itself consisting of no more than thirty or forty bishops of Lydia and
          the adjoining countries.+ Nor does its authority seem to have extended
          further; for we find numerous Christian writers, after this time,
          discussing the question, &quot;What books were entitled to be received
          as Scripture,&quot; with great freedom, upon proper grounds of
          evidence, and without any reference to the decision at Laodicea.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Col. iv. 14. 2Tim. iv. 11. Philem. 24. + Lardner, Cred. vol. viii.
          P.291, et seq. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          These considerations are not to be neglected: but of an argument
          concerning the genuineness of ancient writings, the substance,
          undoubtedly, and strength, is ancient testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          This testimony it is necessary to exhibit somewhat in detail; for when
          Christian advocates merely tell us that we have the same reason for
          believing the Gospels to be written by the evangelists whose names
          they bear as we have for believing the Commentaries to be
          Caesar&#x27;s, the Aeneid Virgil&#x27;s, or the Orations
          Cicero&#x27;s, they content themselves with an imperfect
          representation. They state nothing more than what is true, but they do
          not state the truth correctly. In the number, variety, and early date
          of our testimonies, we far exceed all other ancient books. For one
          which the most celebrated work of the most celebrated Greek or Roman
          writer can allege, we produce many. But then it is more requisite in
          our books than in theirs to separate and distinguish them from
          spurious competitors. The result, I am convinced, will be satisfactory
          to every fair inquirer: but this circumstance renders an inquiry
          necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a work, however, like the present, there is a difficulty in finding
          a place for evidence of this kind. To pursue the details of proof
          throughout, would be to transcribe a great part of Dr. Lardner&#x27;s
          eleven octavo volumes: to leave the argument without proofs is to
          leave it without effect; for the persuasion produced by this species
          of evidence depends upon a view and induction of the particulars which
          compose it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method which I propose to myself is, first, to place before the
          reader, in one view, the propositions which comprise the several heads
          of our testimony, and afterwards to repeat the same propositions in so
          many distinct sections, with the necessary authorities subjoined to
          each.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * The reader, when he has the propositions before him, will observe
          that the argument, if he should omit the sections, proceeds
          connectedly from this point. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          The following, then, are the allegations upon the subject which are
          capable of being established by proof:—
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That the historical books of the New Testament, meaning thereby the
          four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, are quoted, or alluded to,
          by a series of Christian writers, beginning with those who were
          contemporary with the apostles, or who immediately followed them, and
          proceeding in close and regular succession from their time to the
          present.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That when they are quoted, or alluded to, they are quoted or
          alluded to with peculiar respect, as books &#x27;sui generis&#x27;; as
          possessing an authority which belonged to no other books, and as
          conclusive in all questions and controversies amongst Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. That they were, in very early times, collected into a distinct
          volume.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. That they were distinguished by appropriate names and titles of
          respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. That they were publicly read and expounded in the religious
          assemblies of the early Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. That commentaries were written upon them, harmonies formed out of
          them, different copies carefully collated, and versions of them made
          into different languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. That they were received by Christians of different sects, by many
          heretics as well as Catholics, and usually appealed to by both sides
          in the controversies which arose in those days.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. That the four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, thirteen
          Epistles of Saint Paul, the first epistle of John, and the first
          of-Peter, were received without doubt by those who doubted concerning
          the other books which are included in our present canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. That the Gospels were attacked by the early adversaries of
          Christianity, as books containing the accounts upon which the religion
          was founded.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. That formal catalogues of authentic Scriptures were published; in
          all which our present sacred histories were included.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. That these propositions cannot be affirmed of any other books
          claiming to be books of Scripture; by which are meant those books
          which are commonly called apocryphal books of the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I.</p>
        <p>
          The historical books of the New Testament, meaning thereby the four
          Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, are quoted, or alluded to, by a
          series of Christian writers, beginning with those who were
          contemporary with the apostles, or who immediately followed them, and
          proceeding in close and regular succession from their time to the
          present.
        </p>
        <p>
          The medium of proof stated in this proposition is, of all others, the
          most unquestionable, the least liable to any practices of fraud, and
          is not diminished by the lapse of ages. Bishop Burnet, in the History
          of his Own Times, inserts various extracts from Lord Clarendon&#x27;s
          History. One such insertion is a proof that Lord Clarendon&#x27;s
          History was extant at the time when Bishop Burnet wrote, that it had
          been read by Bishop Burnet, that it was received by Bishop Burnet as a
          work of Lord Clarendon, and also regarded by him as an authentic
          account of the transactions which it relates; and it will be a proof
          of these points a thousand years hence, or as long as the books exist.
          Quintilian having quoted as Cicero&#x27;s, (Quint, lib. xl. c. l.)
          that well known trait of dissembled vanity:—&quot;Si quid est in me
          ingenii, Judices, quod sentio quam sit exiguum;&quot;—the quotation
          would be strong evidence, were there any doubt, that the oration,
          which opens with this address, actually came from Cicero&#x27;s pen.
          These instances, however simple, may serve to point out to a reader
          who is little accustomed to such researches the nature and value of
          the argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          The testimonies which we have to bring forward under this proposition
          are the following:—
        </p>
        <p>
          I. There is extant an epistle ascribed to Barnabas,* the companion of
          Paul. It is quoted as the epistle of Barnabas, by Clement of
          Alexandria, A.D. CXCIV; by Origen, A.D. CCXXX. It is mentioned by
          Eusebius, A.D. CCCXV, and by Jerome, A.D. CCCXCII, as an ancient work
          in their time, bearing the name of Barnabas, and as well known and
          read amongst Christians, though not accounted a part of Scripture. It
          purports to have been written soon after the destruction of Jerusalem,
          during the calamities which followed that disaster; and it bears the
          character of the age to which it professes to belong.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Lardner, Cred. edit. 1755, vol. i. p. 23, et seq. The reader will
          observe from the references, that the materials of these sections are
          almost entirely extracted from Dr. Lardner&#x27;s work; my office
          consisted in arrangement and selection. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          In this epistle appears the following remarkable passage:—&quot;Let
          us, therefore, beware lest it come upon us, as it is written; There
          are many called, few chosen.&quot; From the expression, &quot;as it is
          written,&quot; we infer with certainty, that at the time when the
          author of this epistle lived, there was a book extant, well known to
          Christians, and of authority amongst them, containing these
          words:—&quot;Many are called, few chosen.&quot; Such a book is our
          present Gospel of Saint Matthew, in which this text is twice found,
          (Matt xx. 16; xxii. 14.) and is found in no other book now known.
          There is a further observation to be made upon the terms of the
          quotation. The writer of the epistle was a Jew. The phrase &quot;it is
          written&quot; was the very form in which the Jews quoted their
          Scriptures. It is not probable, therefore, that he would have used
          this phrase, and without qualification, of any book but what had
          acquired a kind of Scriptural authority. If the passage remarked in
          this ancient writing had been found in one of Saint Paul&#x27;s
          Epistles, it would have been esteemed by every one a high testimony to
          Saint Matthew&#x27;s Gospel. It ought, therefore, to be remembered,
          that the writing in which it is found was probably by very few years
          posterior to those of Saint Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside this passage, there are also in the epistle before us several
          others, in which the sentiment is the same with what we meet with in
          Saint Matthew&#x27;s Gospel, and two or three in which we recognize
          the same words. In particular, the author of the epistle repeats the
          precept, &quot;Give to every one that asketh thee;&quot; (Matt. v.
          42.) and saith that Christ chose as his apostles, who were to preach
          the Gospel, men who were great sinners, that he might show that he
          came &quot;not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.&quot;
          (Matt. Ix. 13.)
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We are in possession of an epistle written by Clement, bishop of
          Rome, (Lardner, Cred. vol. p. 62, et seq.) whom ancient writers,
          without any doubt or scruple, assert to have been the Clement whom
          Saint Paul mentions, Phil. iv. 3; &quot;with Clement also, and other
          my fellow-labourers, whose names are in the book of life.&quot; This
          epistle is spoken of by the ancients as an epistle acknowledged by
          all; and, as Irenaeus well represents its value, &quot;written by
          Clement, who had seen the blessed apostles, and conversed with them;
          who had the preaching of the apostles still sounding in his ears, and
          their traditions before his eyes.&quot; It is addressed to the church
          of Corinth; and what alone may seem almost decisive of its
          authenticity, Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, about the year 170, i. e.
          about eighty or ninety years after the epistle was written, bears
          witness, &quot;that it had been wont to be read in that church from
          ancient times.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This epistle affords, amongst others, the following valuable
          passages:—&quot;Especially remembering the words of the Lord Jesus,
          which he spake teaching gentleness and long-suffering: for thus he
          said:* Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; forgive, that it my
          be forgiven unto you; as you do, so shall it be done unto you; as you
          give, so shall it be given unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye be
          judged; as ye show kindness, so shall kindness be shown unto you; with
          what measure ye mete, with the same shall it be measured to you. By
          this command, and by these rules, let us establish ourselves, that we
          may always walk obediently to his holy words.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * &quot;Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.&quot;
          Matt. v. 7.—&quot;Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it
          shall be given unto you.&quot; Luke vi. 37, 38.—&quot;Judge not, that
          ye be not judged; for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged;
          and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you
          again.&quot; Matt. vii. 1, 2. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          Again; &quot;Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, for he said, Woe to
          that man by whom offences come; it were better for him that he had not
          been born, than that he should offend one of my elect; it were better
          for him that a millstone should be tied about his neck, and that he
          should be drowned in the sea, than that he should offend one of my
          little ones.&quot;*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Matt. xviii. 6. &quot;But whoso shall offend one of these little
          ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a mill-stone
          were hanged about his neck, and that he were cast into the sea.&quot;
          The latter part of the passage in Clement agrees exactly with Luke
          xvii. 2; &quot;It were better for him that a mill-stone were hanged
          about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend
          one of these little ones.&quot; _________
        </p>
        <p>
          In both these passages we perceive the high respect paid to the words
          of Christ as recorded by the evangelists; &quot;Remember the words of
          the Lord Jesus;—by this command, and by these rules, let us establish
          ourselves, that we may always walk obediently to his holy words.&quot;
          We perceive also in Clement a total unconsciousness of doubt whether
          these were the real words of Christ, which are read as such in the
          Gospels. This observation indeed belongs to the whole series of
          testimony, and especially to the most ancient part of it. Whenever
          anything now read in the Gospels is met with in an early Christian
          writing, it is always observed to stand there as acknowledged truth,
          i. e. to be introduced without hesitation, doubt, or apology. It is to
          be observed also, that, as this epistle was written in the name of the
          church of Rome, and addressed to the church of Corinth, it ought to be
          taken as exhibiting the judgment not only of Clement, who drew up the
          letter, but of these churches themselves, at least as to the authority
          of the books referred to.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be said that, as Clement has not used words of quotation, it is
          not certain that he refers to any book whatever. The words of Christ
          which he has put down, he might himself have heard from the apostles,
          or might have received through the ordinary medium of oral tradition.
          This has been said: but that no such inference can be drawn from the
          absence of words of quotation, is proved by the three following
          considerations:—First, that Clement, in the very same manner, namely,
          without any mark of reference, uses a passage now found in the epistle
          to the Romans; (Rom. i. 29.) which passage, from the peculiarity of
          the words which compose it, and from their order, it is manifest that
          he must have taken from the book. The same remark may be repeated of
          some very singular sentiments in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Secondly,
          that there are many sentences of Saint Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to
          the Corinthians standing in Clement&#x27;s epistle without any sign of
          quotation, which yet certainly are quotations; because it appears that
          Clement had Saint Paul&#x27;s epistle before him, inasmuch as in one
          place he mentions it in terms too express to leave us in any
          doubt:—&quot;Take into your hands the epistle of the blessed apostle
          Paul.&quot; Thirdly, that this method of adopting words of Scripture
          without reference or acknowledgment was, as will appear in the sequel,
          a method in general use amongst the most ancient Christian
          writers.—These analogies not only repel the objection, but cast the
          presumption on the other side, and afford a considerable degree of
          positive proof, that the words in question have been borrowed from the
          places of Scripture in which we now find them. But take it if you will
          the other way, that Clement had heard these words from the apostles or
          first teachers of Christianity; with respect to the precise point of
          our argument, viz. that the Scriptures contain what the apostles
          taught, this supposition may serve almost as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Near the conclusion of the epistle to the Romans, Saint Paul,
          amongst others, sends the following salutation: &quot;Salute
          Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which
          are with them.&quot; Of Hermas, who appears in this catalogue of Roman
          Christians as contemporary with Saint Paul, a book bearing the name,
          and it is most probably rightly, is still remaining. It is called the
          Shepherd, (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 111.) or pastor of Hermas. Its
          antiquity is incontestable, from the quotations of it in Irenaeus,
          A.D. 178; Clement of Alexandria, A.D. 194; Tertullian, A.D. 200;
          Origen, A.D. 230. The notes of time extant in the epistle itself agree
          with its title, and with the testimonies concerning it, for it
          purports to have been written during the life-time of Clement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this place are tacit allusions to Saint Matthew&#x27;s, Saint
          Luke&#x27;s, and Saint John&#x27;s Gospels; that is to say, there are
          applications of thoughts and expressions found in these Gospels,
          without citing the place or writer from which they were taken. In this
          form appear in Hermas the confessing and denying of Christ; (Matt. x.
          :i2, 33, or, Luke xli. 8, 9.) the parable of the seed sown (Matt.
          xiii. 3, or, Luke viii. 5); the comparison of Christ&#x27;s disciples
          to little children; the saying &quot;he that putteth away his wife,
          and marrieth another, committeth adultery&quot; (Luke xvi. 18.); The
          singular expression, &quot;having received all power from his
          Father,&quot; in probable allusion to Matt. xxviii. 18; and Christ
          being the &quot;gate,&quot; or only way of coming &quot;to God,&quot;
          in plain allusion to John xiv. 6; x. 7, 9. There is also a probable
          allusion to Acts v. 32.
        </p>
        <p>
          This piece is the representation of a vision, and has by many been
          accounted a weak and fanciful performance. I therefore observe, that
          the character of the writing has little to do with the purpose for
          which we adduce it. It is the age in which it was composed that gives
          the value to its testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Ignatius, as it is testified by ancient Christian writers, became
          bishop of Antioch about thirty-seven years after Christ&#x27;s
          ascension; and, therefore, from his time, and place, and station, it
          is probable that he had known and conversed with many of the apostles.
          Epistles of Ignatius are referred to by Polycarp, his contemporary.
          Passages found in the epistles now extant under his name are quoted by
          Irenaeus, A.D. 178; by Origen, A.D. 230; and the occasion of writing
          the epistles is given at large by Eusebius and Jerome. What are called
          the smaller epistles of Ignatius are generally deemed to be those
          which were read by Irenaeus, Origen, and Eusebius (Lardner, Cred. vol.
          i. p. 147.).
        </p>
        <p>
          In these epistles are various undoubted allusions to the Gospels of
          Saint Matthew and Saint John; yet so far of the same form with those
          in the preceding articles, that, like them, they are not accompanied
          with marks of quotation.
        </p>
        <p>Of these allusions the following are clear specimens:</p>
        <p>
          Matt.*: &quot;Christ was baptized of John, that all righteousness
          might be fulfilled by him.&quot; &quot;Be ye wise as serpents in all
          things, and harmless as a dove.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          John+: &quot;Yet the Spirit is not deceived, being from God: for it
          knows whence it comes and whither it goes.&quot; &quot;He (Christ) is
          the door of the Father, by which enter in Abraham and Isaac, and
          Jacob, and the apostles, and the church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Chap. iii. 15. &quot;For thus it becometh us to fulfil all
          righteousness.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Chap. x. 16. &quot;Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as
          doves.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          + Chap. iii. 8. &quot;The wind bloweth where it listeth and thou
          hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and
          whither it goeth; so is everyone that is born of the Spirit.&quot;
          Chap. x. 9. &quot;I am the door; by me if any man enter in he shall be
          saved.&quot; _________
        </p>
        <p>
          As to the manner of quotation, this is observable;—Ignatius, in one
          place, speaks of St. Paul in terms of high respect, and quotes his
          Epistle to the Ephesians by name; yet, in several other places, he
          borrows words and sentiments from the same epistle without mentioning
          it; which shows that this was his general manner of using and applying
          writings then extant, and then of high authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Polycarp (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. 192.) had been taught by the
          apostles; had conversed with many who had seen Christ; was also by the
          apostles appointed bishop of Smyrna. This testimony concerning
          Polycarp is given by Irenaeus, who in his youth had seen him:—&quot;I
          can tell the place,&quot; saith Irenaeus, &quot;in which the blessed
          Polycarp sat and taught, and his going out and coming in, and the
          manner of his life, and the form of his person, and the discourses he
          made to the people, and how he related his conversation with John, and
          others who had seen the Lord, and how he related their sayings, and
          what he had heard concerning the Lord, both concerning his miracles
          and his doctrine, as he had received them from the eyewitnesses of the
          word of life: all which Polycarp related agreeable to the
          Scriptures.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Of Polycarp, whose proximity to the age and country and persons of the
          apostles is thus attested, we have one undoubted epistle remaining.
          And this, though a short letter, contains nearly forty clear allusions
          to books of the New Testament; which is strong evidence of the respect
          which Christians of that age bore for these books.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amongst these, although the writings of St. Paul are more frequently
          used by Polycarp than any other parts of Scripture, there are copious
          allusions to the Gospel of St. Matthew, some to passages found in the
          Gospels both of Matthew and Luke, and some which more nearly resemble
          the words in Luke.
        </p>
        <p>
          I select the following as fixing the authority of the Lord&#x27;s
          prayer, and the use of it amongst the primitive Christians: &quot;If
          therefore we pray the Lord, that he will forgive us, we ought also to
          forgive.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;With supplication beseeching the all-seeing God not to lead us
          into temptation.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And the following, for the sake of repeating an observation already
          made, that words of our Lord found in our Gospels were at this early
          day quoted as spoken by him; and not only so, but quoted with so
          little question or consciousness of doubt about their being really his
          words, as not even to mention, much less to canvass, the authority
          from which they were taken:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;But remembering what the Lord said, teaching, Judge not, that ye
          be not judged; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; be ye merciful, that
          ye may obtain mercy; with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured
          to you again.&quot; (Matt. vii. 1, 2; v. 7; Luke vi. 37, 38.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Supposing Polycarp to have had these words from the books in which we
          now find them, it is manifest that these books were considered by him,
          and, as he thought, considered by his readers, us authentic accounts
          of Christ&#x27;s discourses; and that that point was incontestible
          [sic].
        </p>
        <p>
          The following is a decisive, though what we call a tacit reference to
          St. Peter&#x27;s speech in the Acts of the Apostles:—&quot;whom God
          hath raised, having loosed the pains of death.&quot; (Acts ii. 24.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Papias, (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 239.) a hearer of John, and
          companion of Polycarp, as Irenaeus attests, and of that age, as all
          agree, in a passage quoted by Eusebius, from a work now lost,
          expressly ascribes the respective Gospels to Matthew and Mark; and in
          a manner which proves that these Gospels must have publicly borne the
          names of these authors at that time, and probably long before; for
          Papias does not say that one Gospel was written by Matthew, and
          another by Mark; but, assuming this as perfectly well known, he tells
          us from what materials Mark collected his account, viz. from
          Peter&#x27;s preaching, and in what language Matthew wrote, viz. in
          Hebrew. Whether Papias was well informed in this statement, or not; to
          the point for which I produce this testimony, namely, that these books
          bore these names at this time, his authority is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          The writers hitherto alleged had all lived and conversed with some of
          the apostles. The works of theirs which remain are in general very
          short pieces, yet rendered extremely valuable by their antiquity; and
          none, short as they are, but what contain some important testimony to
          our historical Scriptures.*

          * That the quotations are more thinly strewn in these than in the
          writings of the next and of succeeding ages, is in a good measure
          accounted for by the observation, that the Scriptures of the New
          Testament had not yet, nor by their recency hardly could have, become
          a general part of Christian education; read as the Old Testament was
          by Jews and Christians from their childhood, and thereby intimately
          mixing, as that had long done, with all their religious ideas, and
          with their language upon religious subjects. In process of time, and
          as soon perhaps as could be expected, this came to be the case. And
          then we perceive the effect, in a proportionably greater frequency, as
          well as copiousness of allusion.—Mich. Introd. c. ii. sect. vi.

          VII. Not long after these, that is, not much more than twenty years
          after the last, follows Justin Martyr (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p.
          258.). His remaining works are much larger than any that have yet been
          noticed. Although the nature of his two principal writings, one of
          which was addressed to heathens, and the other was a conference with a
          Jew, did not lead him to such frequent appeals to Christian books as
          would have appeared in a discourse intended for Christian readers; we
          nevertheless reckon up in them between twenty and thirty quotations of
          the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, certain, distinct, and copious:
          if each verse be counted separately, a much greater number; if each
          expression, a very great one.*

          We meet with quotations of three of the Gospels within the compass of
          half a page: &quot;And in other words he says, Depart from me into
          outer darkness, which the Father hath prepared for Satan and his
          angels,&quot; (which is from Matthew xxv. 41.) &quot;And again he
          said, in other words, I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and
          scorpions, and venomous beasts, and upon all the power of the
          enemy.&quot; (This from Luke x. 19.) &quot;And before he was
          crucified, he said, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be
          rejected of the Scribes and Pharisees, and be crucified, and rise
          again the third day.&quot; (This from Mark viii. 31.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In another place Justin quotes a passage in the history of
          Christ&#x27;s birth, as delivered by Matthew and John, and fortifies
          his quotation by this remarkable testimony: &quot;As they have taught,
          who have written the history of all things concerning our Saviour
          Jesus Christ; and we believe them.&quot; Quotations are also found
          from the Gospel of Saint John. What moreover seems extremely material
          to be observed is, that in all Justin&#x27;s works, from which might
          be extracted almost a complete life of Christ, there are but two
          instances in which he refers to anything as said or done by Christ,
          which is not related concerning him in our present Gospels: which
          shows, that these Gospels, and these, we may say, alone, were the
          authorities from which the Christians of that day drew the information
          upon which they depended. One of these instances is of a saying of
          Christ, not met with in any book now extant.+

        <p>
          + &quot;Wherefore also our Lord Jesus Christ has said, In whatsoever I
          shall find you, in the same I will also judge you.&quot; Possibly
          Justin designed not to quote any text, but to represent the sense of
          many of our Lord&#x27;s sayings. Fabrieius has observed, that this
          saying has been quoted by many writers, and that Justin is the only
          one who ascribes it to our Lord, and that perhaps by a slip of his
          memory. Words resembling these are read repeatedly in Ezekiel; &quot;I
          will judge them according to their ways;&quot; (chap. vii. 3; xxxiii.
          20.) It is remarkable that Justin had just before expressly quoted
          Ezekiel. Mr. Jones upon this circumstance founded a conjecture, that
          Justin wrote only &quot;the Lord hath said,&quot; intending to quote
          the words of God, or rather the sense of those words in Ezekiel; and
          that some transcriber, imagining these to be the words of Christ,
          inserted in his copy the addition &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot; Vol. 1. p.
          539. _________

        <p>
          The other of a circumstance in Christ&#x27;s baptism, namely, a fiery
          or luminous appearance upon the water, which, according to Epiphanius,
          is noticed in the Gospel of the Hebrews: and which might be true: but
          which, whether true or false, is mentioned by Justin, with a plain
          mark of diminution when compared with what he quotes as resting upon
          Scripture authority. The reader will advert to this distinction:
          &quot;and then, when Jesus came to the river Jordan, where John was
          baptizing, as Jesus descended into the water, a fire also was kindled
          in Jordan: and when he came up out of the water, (the apostles of this
          our Christ have written), that the Holy Ghost lighted upon him as a
          dove.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          All the references in Justin are made without mentioning the author;
          which proves that these books were perfectly notorious, and that there
          were no other accounts of Christ then extant, or, at least, no other
          so received and credited as to make it necessary to distinguish these
          from the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          But although Justin mentions not the author&#x27;s name, he calls the
          books, &quot;Memoirs composed by the Apostles;&quot; &quot;Memoirs
          composed by the Apostles and their Companions;&quot; which
          descriptions, the latter especially, exactly suit with the titles
          which the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles now bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Hegesippus (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 314.) came about thirty
          years after Justin. His testimony is remarkable only for this
          particular; that he relates of himself that, travelling from Palestine
          to Rome, he visited, on his journey, many bishops; and that, &quot;in
          every succession, and in every city, the same doctrine is taught,
          which the Law and the Prophets, and the Lord teacheth.&quot; This is
          an important attestation, from good authority, and of high antiquity.
          It is generally understood that by the word &quot;Lord,&quot;
          Hegesippus intended some writing or writings, containing the teaching
          of Christ; in which sense alone the term combines with the other term
          &quot;Law and Prophets,&quot; which denote writings; and together with
          them admit of the verb &quot;teacheth&quot; in the present tense.
          Then, that these writings were some or all of the books of the New
          Testament, is rendered probable from hence, that in the fragments of
          his works, which are preserved in Eusebius, and in a writer of the
          ninth century, enough, though it be little, is left to show, that
          Hegesippus expressed divers thing in the style of the Gospels, and of
          the Acts of the Apostles; that he referred to the history in the
          second chapter of Matthew, and recited a text of that Gospel as spoken
          by our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. At this time, viz. about the year 170, the churches of Lyons and
          Vienne, in France, sent a relation of the sufferings of their martyrs
          to the churches of Asia and Phrygia. (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 332.)
          The epistle is preserved entire by Eusebius. And what carries in some
          measure the testimony of these churches to a higher age, is, that they
          had now for their bishop, Pothinus, who was ninety years old, and
          whose early life consequently must have immediately joined on with the
          times of the apostles. In this epistle are exact references to the
          Gospels of Luke and John, and to the Acts of the Apostles; the form of
          reference the same as in all the preceding articles. That from Saint
          John is in these words: &quot;Then was fulfilled that which was spoken
          by the Lord, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doeth God
          service.&quot; (John xvi. 2.)
        </p>
        <p>
          X. The evidence now opens upon us full and clear. Irenaeus (Lardner,
          vol. i. p. 344.) succeeded Pothinus as bishop of Lyons. In his youth
          he had been a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of John. In the
          time in which he lived, he was distant not much more than a century
          from the publication of the Gospels; in his instruction only by one
          step separated from the persons of the apostles. He asserts of himself
          and his contemporaries, that they were able to reckon up, in all the
          principal churches, the succession of bishops from the first. (Adv.
          Haeres. 1. iii. c. 3.) I remark these particulars concerning Irenaeus
          with more formality than usual, because the testimony which this
          writer affords to the historical books of the New Testament, to their
          authority, and to the titles which they bear, is express, positive,
          and exclusive. One principal passage, in which this testimony is
          contained, opens with a precise assertion of the point which we have
          laid down as the foundation of our argument, viz., that the story
          which the Gospels exhibit is the story which the apostles told.
          &quot;We have not received,&quot; saith Irenaeus, &quot;the knowledge
          of the way of our salvation by any others than those by whom the
          Gospel has been brought to us. Which Gospel they first preached, and
          afterwards, by the will of God, committed to writing, that it might be
          for time to come the foundation and pillar of our faith.—For after
          that our Lord arose from the dead, and they (the apostles) were
          endowed from above with the power of the Holy Ghost coming down upon
          them, they received a perfect knowledge of all things. They then went
          forth to all the ends of the earth, declaring to men the Message of
          heavenly peace, having all of them, and every one, alike the Gospel of
          God. Matthew then, among the Jews, wrote a Gospel in their own
          language, while Peter and Paul were preaching the Gospel at Rome, and
          founding a church there: and after their exit, Mark also, the disciple
          and interpreter of Peter, delivered to us in writing the things that
          had been preached by Peter and Luke, the companion of Paul, put down
          in a book the Gospel preached by him (Paul). Afterwards John, the
          disciple of the Lord, who also leaned upon his breast, he likewise
          published a Gospel while he dwelt at Ephesus in Asia.&quot; If any
          modern divine should write a book upon the genuineness of the Gospels,
          he could not assert it more expressly, or state their original more
          distinctly, than Irenaeus hath done within little more than a hundred
          years after they were published.
        </p>
        <p>
          The correspondency, in the days of Irenaeus, of the oral and written
          tradition, and the deduction of the oral tradition through various
          channels from the age of the apostles, which was then lately passed,
          and, by consequence, the probability that the books truly delivered
          what the apostles taught, is inferred also with strict regularity from
          another passage of his works. &quot;The tradition of the
          apostles,&quot; this father saith, &quot;hath spread itself over the
          whole universe; and all they who search after the sources of truth
          will find this tradition to be held sacred in every church, We might
          enumerate all those who have been appointed bishops to these churches
          by the apostles, and all their successors, up to our days. It is by
          this uninterrupted succession that we have received the tradition
          which actually exists in the church, as also the doctrines of truth,
          as it was preached by the apostles.&quot; (Iren. in Haer. I. iii. c.
          3.) The reader will observe upon this, that the same Irenaeus, who is
          now stating the strength and uniformity of the tradition, we have
          before seen recognizing, in the fullest manner, the authority of the
          written records; from which we are entitled to conclude, that they
          were then conformable to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have said that the testimony of Irenaeus in favour of our Gospels is
          exclusive of all others. I allude to a remarkable passage in his
          works, in which, for some reasons sufficiently fanciful, he endeavours
          to show that there could he neither more nor fewer Gospels than four.
          With his argument we have no concern. The position itself proves that
          four, and only four, Gospels were at that time publicly read and
          acknowledged. That these were our Gospels, and in the state in which
          we now have them, is shown from many other places of this writer
          beside that which we have already alleged. He mentions how Matthew
          begins his Gospel, bow Mark begins and ends his, and their supposed
          reasons for so doing. He enumerates at length the several passages of
          Christ&#x27;s history in Luke, which are not found in any of the other
          evangelists. He states the particular design with which Saint John
          composed his Gospel, and accounts for the doctrinal declarations which
          precede the narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the book of the Acts of the Apostles, its author, and credit, the
          testimony of Irenaeus is no less explicit. Referring to the account of
          Saint Paul&#x27;s conversion and vocation, in the ninth chapter of
          that book, &quot;Nor can they,&quot; says he, meaning the parties with
          whom he argues, &quot;show that he is not to be credited, who has
          related to us the truth with the greatest exactness.&quot; In another
          place, he has actually collected the several texts, in which the
          writer of the history is represented as accompanying Saint Paul; which
          leads him to deliver a summary of almost the whole of the last twelve
          chapters of the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an author thus abounding with references and allusions to the
          Scriptures, there is not one to any apocryphal Christian writing
          whatever. This is a broad line of distinction between our sacred books
          and the pretensions of all others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The force of the testimony of the period which we have considered is
          greatly strengthened by the observation, that it is the testimony, and
          the concurring testimony, of writers who lived in countries remote
          from one another. Clement flourished at Rome, Ignatius at Antioch,
          Polycarp at Smyrna, Justin Martyr in Syria, and Irenaeus in France.

          XI. Omitting Athenagoras and Theophilus, who lived about this time;
          (Lardner, vol. i. p. 400 &amp; 422.) in the remaining works of the
          former of whom are clear references to Mark and Luke; and in the works
          of the latter, who was bishop of Antioch, the sixth in succession from
          the apostles, evident allusions to Matthew and John, and probable
          allusions to Luke (which, considering the nature of the compositions,
          that they were addressed to heathen readers, is as much as could be
          expected); observing also, that the works of two learned Christian
          writers of the same age, Miltiades and Pantaenus, (Lardner, vol. i.
          p.413, 450.) are now lost: of which Miltiades Eusebius records, that
          his writings &quot;were monuments of zeal for the Divine
          Oracles;&quot; and which Pantaenus, as Jerome testifies, was a man of
          prudence and learning, both in the Divine Scriptures and secular
          literature, and had left many commentaries upon the Holy Scriptures
          then extant. Passing by these without further remark, we come to one
          of the most voluminous of ancient Christian writers, Clement of
          Alexandria (Lardner, vol. ii. p. 469.). Clement followed Irenaeus at
          the distance of only sixteen years, and therefore may be said to
          maintain the series of testimony in an uninterrupted continuation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In certain of Clement&#x27;s works, now lost, but of which various
          parts are recited by Eusebius, there is given a distinct account of
          the order in which the four Gospels were written. The Gospels which
          contain the genealogies were (he says) written first; Mark&#x27;s
          next, at the instance of Peter&#x27;s followers; and John&#x27;s the
          last; and this account he tells us that he had received from
          presbyters of more ancient times. This testimony proves the following
          points; that these Gospels were the histories of Christ then publicly
          received and relied upon; and that the dates, occasions, and
          circumstances, of their publication were at that time subjects of
          attention and inquiry amongst Christians. In the works of Clement
          which remain, the four Gospels are repeatedly quoted by the names of
          their authors, and the Acts of the Apostles is expressly ascribed to
          Luke. In one place, after mentioning a particular circumstance, he
          adds these remarkable words: &quot;We have not this passage in the
          four Gospels delivered to us, but in that according to the
          Egyptians;&quot; which puts a marked distinction between the four
          Gospels and all other histories, or pretended histories, of Christ. In
          another part of his works, the perfect confidence with which he
          received the Gospels is signified by him in these words: &quot;That
          this is true appears from hence, that it is written in the Gospel
          according to Saint Luke;&quot; and again, &quot;I need not use many
          words, but only to allege the evangelic voice of the Lord.&quot; His
          quotations are numerous. The sayings of Christ, of which he alleges
          many, are all taken from our Gospels; the single exception to this
          observation appearing to be a loose quotation of a passage in Saint
          Matthew&#x27;s Gospel.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * &quot;Ask great things and the small shall be added unto you.&quot;
          Clement rather chose to expound the words of Matthew (chap. vi. 33),
          than literally to cite them; and this is most undeniably proved by
          another place in the same Clement, where he both produces the text and
          these words am an exposition:—&quot;Seek ye first the kingdom of
          heaven and its righteousness, for these are the great things; but the
          small things, and things relating to this life, shall be added unto
          you.&quot; Jones&#x27;s New and Full Method, vol. i. p. 553. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. In the age in which they lived, (Lardner, vol. ii. p. 561.)
          Tertullian joins on with Clement. The number of the Gospels then
          received, the names of the evangelists, and their proper descriptions,
          are exhibited by this writer in one short sentence:—&quot;Among the
          apostles John and Matthew teach us the faith; among apostolical men,
          Luke and Mark refresh it.&quot; The next passage to be taken from
          Tertullian affords as complete an attestation to the authenticity of
          our books as can be well imagined. After enumerating the churches
          which had been founded by Paul at Corinth, in Galatia, at Philippi,
          Thessalonica, and Ephesus; the church of Rome established by Peter and
          Paul, and other churches derived from John; he proceeds thus:—&quot;I
          say, then, that with them, but not with them only which are
          apostolical, but with all who have fellowship with them in the same
          faith, is that Gospel of Luke received from its first publication,
          which we so zealously maintain:&quot; and presently afterwards adds,
          &quot;The same authority of the apostolical churches will support the
          other Gospels which we have from them and according to them, I mean
          John&#x27;s and Matthew&#x27;s; although that likewise which Mark
          published may be said to be Peter&#x27;s, whose interpreter Mark
          was.&quot; In another place Tertullian affirms, that the three other
          Gospels were in the hands of the churches from the beginning, as well
          as Luke&#x27;s. This noble testimony fixes the universality with which
          the Gospels were received and their antiquity; that they were in the
          hands of all, and had been so from the first. And this evidence
          appears not more than one hundred and fifty years after the
          publication of the books. The reader must be given to understand that,
          when Tertullian speaks of maintaining or defending (tuendi) the Gospel
          of Saint Luke, he only means maintaining or defending the integrity of
          the copies of Luke received by Christian churches, in opposition to
          certain curtailed copies used by Marcion, against whom he writes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This author frequently cites the Acts of the Apostles under that
          title, once calls it Luke&#x27;s Commentary, and observes how Saint
          Paul&#x27;s epistles confirm it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this general evidence, it is unnecessary to add particular
          quotations. These, however, are so numerous and ample as to have led
          Dr. Lardner to observe, &quot;that there are more and larger
          quotations of the small volume of the New Testament in this one
          Christian author, than there are of all the works of Cicero in writers
          of all characters for several ages.&quot; (Lardner, vol ii. p. 647.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Tertullian quotes no Christian writing as of equal authority with the
          Scriptures, and no spurious books at all; a broad line of distinction,
          we may once more observe, between our sacred books and all others.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may again likewise remark the wide extent through which the
          reputation of the Gospels, and of the Acts of the Apostles had spread,
          and the perfect consent, in this point, of distant and independent
          societies. It is now only about one hundred and fifty years since
          Christ was crucified; and within this period, to say nothing of the
          apostolical fathers who have been noticed already, we have Justin
          Martyr at Neapolis, Theophilus at Antioch, Irenaeus in France, Clement
          at Alexandria, Tertullian at Carthage, quoting the same books of
          historical Scriptures, and I may say, quoting these alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. An interval of only thirty years, and that occupied by no small
          number of Christian writers, (Minucius Felix, Apollonius, Caius,
          Asterius Urbanus Alexander bishop of Jerusalem, Hippolytus, Ammonius
          Julius Africanus) whose works only remain in fragments and quotations,
          and in every one of which is some reference or other to the Gospels
          (and in one of them, Hippolytus, as preserved in Theodoret, is an
          abstract of the whole Gospel history), brings us to a name of great
          celebrity in Christian antiquity, Origen (Lardner, vol. iii. p. 234.)
          of Alexandria, who in the quantity of his writings exceeded the most
          laborious of the Greek and Latin authors. Nothing can be more
          peremptory upon the subject now under consideration, and, from a
          writer of his learning and information, more satisfactory, than the
          declaration of Origen, preserved, in an extract from his works, by
          Eusebius; &quot;That the four Gospels alone are received without
          dispute by the whole church of God under heaven:&quot; to which
          declaration is immediately subjoined a brief history of the respective
          authors to whom they were then, as they are now, ascribed. The
          language holden concerning the Gospels, throughout the works of Origen
          which remain, entirely corresponds with the testimony here cited. His
          attestation to the Acts of the Apostles is no less Positive: &quot;And
          Luke also once more sounds the trumpet, relating the acts of the
          apostles.&quot; The universality with which the Scriptures were then
          read is well signified by this writer in a passage in which he has
          occasion to observe against Celsus, &quot;That it is not in any
          private books, or such as are read by a few only, and those studious
          persons, but in books read by everybody, That it is written, The
          invisible things of God from the creation of the world are clearly
          seen, being understood by things that are made.&quot; It is to no
          purpose to single out quotations of Scripture from such a writer as
          this. We might as well make a selection of the quotations of Scripture
          in Dr. Clarke&#x27;s Sermons. They are so thickly sown in the works of
          Origen, that Dr. Mill says, &quot;If we had all his works remaining,
          we should have before us almost the whole text of the Bible.&quot;
          (Mill, Proleg. esp. vi. p. 66.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Origen notices, in order to censure, certain apocryphal Gospels. He
          also uses four writings of this sort; that is, throughout his large
          works he once or twice, at the most, quotes each of the four; but
          always with some mark, either of direct reprobation or of caution to
          his readers, manifestly esteeming them of little or no authority.

          XIV. Gregory, bishop of Neocaesaea, and Dionysius of Alexandria, were
          scholars of Origen. Their testimony, therefore, though full and
          particular, may be reckoned a repetition only of his. The series,
          however, of evidence is continued by Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, who
          flourished within twenty years after Origen. &quot;The church,&quot;
          said this father, &quot;is watered, like Paradise, by four rivers,
          that is, by four Gospels.&quot; The Acts of the Apostles is also
          frequently quoted by Cyprian under that name, and under the name of
          the &quot;Divine Scriptures.&quot; In his various writings are such
          constant and copious citations of Scripture, as to place this part of
          the testimony beyond controversy. Nor is there, in the works of this
          eminent African bishop, one quotation of a spurious or apocryphal
          Christian writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. Passing over a crowd* of writers following Cyprian at different
          distances, but all within forty years of his time; and who all, in the
          perfect remains of their works, either cite the historical Scriptures
          of the New Testament, or speak of them in terms of profound respect: I
          single out Victorin, bishop of Pettaw, in Germany, merely on account
          of the remoteness of his situation from that of Origen and Cyprian,
          who were Africans; by which circumstance his testimony, taken in
          conjunction with theirs, proves that the Scripture histories, and the
          same histories, were known and received from one side of the Christian
          world to the other. This bishop (Lardner, vol. v. p. 214.) lived about
          the year 290: and in a commentary upon this text of the Revelation,
          &quot;The first was like a lion, the second was like a calf, the third
          like a man, and the fourth like a flying eagle,&quot; he makes out
          that by the four creatures are intended the four Gospels; and, to show
          the propriety of the symbols, he recites the subject with which each
          evangelist opens his history. The explication is fanciful, but the
          testimony positive. He also expressly cites the Acts of the Apostles.

          XVI. Arnobius and Lactantius (Lardner, vol. viii. p. 43, 201.), about
          the year 300, composed formal arguments upon the credibility of the
          Christian religion. As these arguments were addressed to Gentiles, the
          authors abstain from quoting Christian books by name, one of them
          giving this very reason for his reserve; but when they came to state,
          for the information of their readers, the outlines of Christ&#x27;s
          history, it is apparent that they draw their accounts from our
          Gospels, and from no other sources; for these statements exhibit a
          summary of almost everything which is related of Christ&#x27;s actions
          and miracles by the four evangelists. Arnobius vindicates, without
          mentioning their names, the credit of these historians; observing that
          they were eye-witnesses of the facts which they relate, and that their
          ignorance of the arts of composition was rather a confirmation of
          their testimony, than an objection to it. Lactantius also argues in
          defence of the religion, from the consistency, simplicity,
          disinterestedness, and sufferings of the Christian historians, meaning
          by that term our evangelists.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. We close the series of testimonies with that of Eusebius,
          (Lardner, vol. viii. p. 33.) bishop of Caesarea who flourished in the
          year 315, contemporary with, or posterior only by fifteen years to,
          the authors last cited. This voluminous writer, and most diligent
          collector of the writings of others, beside a variety of large works,
          composed a history of the affairs of Christianity from its origin to
          his own time. His testimony to the Scriptures is the testimony of a
          man much conversant in the works of Christian authors, written during
          the first three centuries of its era, and who had read many which are
          now lost. In a passage of his Evangelical Demonstration, Eusebius
          remarks, with great nicety, the delicacy of two of the evangelists, in
          their manner of noticing any circumstance which regarded themselves;
          and of Mark, as writing under Peter&#x27;s direction, in the
          circumstances which regarded him. The illustration of this remark
          leads him to bring together long quotations from each of the
          evangelists: and the whole passage is a proof that Eusebius, and the
          Christians of those days, not only read the Gospels, but studied them
          with attention and exactness. In a passage of his ecclesiastical
          History, he treats, in form, and at large, of the occasions of writing
          the four Gospels, and of the order in which they were written. The
          title of the chapter is, &quot;Of the Order of the Gospels;&quot; and
          it begins thus: &quot;Let us observe the writings of this apostle
          John, which are not contradicted by any: and, first of all, must be
          mentioned, as acknowledged by all, the Gospel according to him,
          well-known to all the churches under heaven; and that it has been
          justly placed by the ancients the fourth in order, and after the other
          three, may be made evident in this manner.&quot;—Eusebius then
          proceeds to show that John wrote the last of the four, and that his
          Gospel was intended to supply the omissions of the others; especially
          in the part of our Lord&#x27;s ministry which took place before the
          imprisonment of John the Baptist. He observes, &quot;that the apostles
          of Christ were not studious of the ornaments of composition, nor
          indeed forward to write at all, being wholly occupied with their
          ministry.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This learned author makes no use at all of Christian writings, forged
          with the names of Christ&#x27;s apostle, or their companions. We close
          this branch of our evidence here, because, after Eusebius, there is no
          room for any question upon the subject; the works of Christian writers
          being as full of texts of Scripture, and of references to Scripture,
          as the discourses of modern divines. Future testimonies to the books
          of Scripture could only prove that they never lost their character or
          authority.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II.</p>
        <p>
          When the Scriptures are quoted, or alluded to, they are quoted with
          peculiar respect, as books sui generis; as possessing an authority
          which belonged to no other books, and as conclusive in all questions
          and controversies amongst Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside the general strain of reference and quotation, which uniformly
          and strongly indicates this distinction, the following may be regarded
          as specific testimonies:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Theophilus, (Lardner, Cred. part ii. vol. i. p. 429.) bishop of
          Antioch, the sixth in succession from the apostles, and who flourished
          little more than a century after the books of the New Testament were
          written, having occasion to quote one of our Gospels, writes thus:
          &quot;These things the Holy Scriptures teach us, and all who were
          moved by the Holy Spirit, among whom John says, In the beginning was
          the Word, and the Word was with God.&quot; Again: &quot;Concerning the
          righteousness which the law teaches, the like things are to be found
          in the prophets and the Gospels, because that all, being inspired,
          spoke by one and the same Spirit of God.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. part
          ii. vol. i. p. 448.) No words can testify more strongly than these do,
          the high and peculiar respect in which these books were holden.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. A writer against Artemon, (Lardner, Cred. part ii. vol. iii. p.
          40.) who may be supposed to come about one hundred and fifty-eight
          years after the publication of the Scripture, in a passage quoted by
          Eusebius, uses these expressions: &quot;Possibly what they (our
          adversaries) say, might have been credited, if first of all the Divine
          Scriptures did not contradict them; and then the writings of certain
          brethren more ancient than the times of Victor.&quot; The brethren
          mentioned by name are Justin, Miltiades, Tatian, Clement, Irenaeus,
          Melito, with a general appeal to many more not named. This passage
          proves, first, that there was at that time a collection called Divine
          Scriptures; secondly, that these Scriptures were esteemed of higher
          authority than the writings of the most early and celebrated
          Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In a piece ascribed to Hippolytus, (Lardner, Cred. vol. iii. p.
          112.) who lived near the same time, the author professes, in giving
          his correspondent instruction in the things about which he inquires,
          &quot;to draw out of the sacred-fountain, and to set before him from
          the Sacred Scriptures what may afford him satisfaction.&quot; He then
          quotes immediately Paul&#x27;s epistles to Timothy, and afterwards
          many books of the New Testament. This preface to the quotations
          carries in it a marked distinction between the Scriptures and other
          books.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. &quot;Our assertions and discourses,&quot; saith Origen, (Lardner,
          Cred. vol. iii. pp. 287-289.) &quot;are unworthy of credit; we must
          receive the Scriptures as witnesses.&quot; After treating of the duty
          of prayer, he proceeds with his argument thus: &quot;What we have
          said, may be proved from the Divine Scriptures.&quot; In his books
          against Celsus we find this passage: &quot;That our religion teaches
          us to seek after wisdom, shall be shown, both out of the ancient
          Jewish Scriptures which we also use, and out of those written since
          Jesus, which are believed in the churches to be divine.&quot; These
          expressions afford abundant evidence of the peculiar and exclusive
          authority which the Scriptures possessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, (Lardner, Cred. vol. vi. p. 840.)
          whose age lies close to that of Origen, earnestly exhorts Christian
          teachers, in all doubtful cases, &quot;to go back to the fountain;
          and, if the truth has in any case been shaken, to recur to the Gospels
          and apostolic writings.&quot;—&quot;The precepts of the Gospel,&quot;
          says he in another place, &quot;are nothing less than authoritative
          divine lessons, the foundations of our hope, the supports of our
          faith, the guides of our way, the safeguards of our course to
          heaven.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Novatus, (Lardner, Cred. vol. v. p. 102.) a Roman contemporary
          with Cyprian, appeals to the Scriptures, as the authority by which all
          errors were to be repelled, and disputes decided. &quot;That Christ is
          not only man, but God also, is proved by the sacred authority of the
          Divine Writings.&quot;—&quot;The Divine Scripture easily detects and
          confutes the frauds of heretics.&quot;—&quot;It is not by the fault of
          the heavenly Scriptures, which never deceive.&quot; Stronger
          assertions than these could not be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. At the distance of twenty years from the writer last cited,
          Anatolius (Lardner, Cred. vol. v. p. 146.), a learned Alexandrian, and
          bishop of Laedicea, speaking of the rule for keeping Easter, a
          question at that day agitated with much earnestness, says of those
          whom he opposed, &quot;They can by no means prove their point by the
          authority of the Divine Scripture.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. The Arians, who sprung up about fifty years after this, argued
          strenuously against the use of the words consubstantial, and essence,
          and like phrases; &quot;because they were not in Scripture.&quot;
          (Lardner, Cred. vol. vii. pp. 283-284.) And in the same strain one of
          their advocates opens a conference with Augustine, after the following
          manner: &quot;If you say what is reasonable, I must submit. If you
          allege anything from the Divine Scriptures which are common to both, I
          must hear. But unscriptural expressions (quae extra Scripturam sunt)
          deserve no regard.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Athanasius, the great antagonist of Arianism, after having enumerated
          the books of the Old and New Testament, adds, &quot;These are the
          fountain of salvation, that he who thirsts may be satisfied with the
          oracles contained in them. In these alone the doctrine of salvation is
          proclaimed. Let no man add to them, or take anything from them.&quot;
          (Lardner, Cred. vol. xii. p. 182.)
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem (Lardner, Cred. vol. viii. p. 276.),
          who wrote about twenty years after the appearance of Arianism, uses
          these remarkable words: &quot;Concerning the divine and holy mysteries
          of faith, not the least article ought to be delivered without the
          Divine Scriptures.&quot; We are assured that Cyril&#x27;s Scriptures
          were the same as ours, for he has left us a catalogue of the books
          included under that name.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Epiphanius, (Lardner, Cred. vol. viii. p. 314.) twenty years after
          Cyril, challenges the Arians, and the followers of Origen, &quot;to
          produce any passage of the Old and New Testament favouring their
          sentiments.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Poebadius, a Gallic bishop, who lived about thirty years after the
          council of Nice, testifies, that &quot;the bishops of that council
          first consulted the sacred volumes, and then declared their
          faith.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. ix. p. 52.)
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Basil, bishop of Caesarea, in Cappadocia, contemporary with
          Epiphanius, says, that &quot;hearers instructed in the Scriptures
          ought to examine what is said by their teachers, and to embrace what
          is agreeable to the Scriptures, and to reject what is otherwise.&quot;
          (Lardner, Cred. vol. ix. p. 124.)
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Ephraim, the Syrian, a celebrated writer of the same times,
          bears this conclusive testimony to the proposition which forms the
          subject of our present chapter: &quot;the truth written in the Sacred
          Volume of the Gospel is a perfect rule. Nothing can be taken from it
          nor added to it, without great guilt.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. ix.
          p. 202.)
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. If we add Jerome to these, it is only for the evidence which he
          affords of the judgment of preceding ages. Jerome observes, concerning
          the quotations of ancient Christian writers, that is, of writers who
          were ancient in the year 400, that they made a distinction between
          books; some they quoted as of authority, and others not: which
          observation relates to the books of Scripture, compared with other
          writings, apocryphal or heathen. (Lardner, Cred. vol. x. pp. 123-124.)
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III.</p>
        <p>
          The Scriptures were in very early times collected into a distinct
          volume.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignatius, who was bishop of Antioch within forty years after the
          Ascension, and who had lived and conversed with the apostles, speaks
          of the Gospel and of the apostles in terms which render it very
          probable that he meant by the Gospel the book or volume of the
          Gospels, and by the apostles the book or volume of their Epistles. His
          words in one place are, (Lardner, Cred. part ii. vol. i. p. 180.)
          &quot;Fleeing to the Gospel as the flesh of Jesus, and to the apostles
          as the presbytery of the church;&quot; that is, as Le Clere interprets
          them, &quot;in order to understand the will of God, he fled to the
          Gospels, which he believed no less than if Christ in the flesh had
          been speaking to him; and to the writings of the apostles, whom he
          esteemed as the presbytery of the whole Christian church.&quot; It
          must be observed, that about eighty years after this we have direct
          proof, in the writings of Clement of Alexandria, (Lardner, Cred. part
          ii. vol. ii. p. 516.) that these two names, &quot;Gospel,&quot; and
          &quot;Apostles,&quot; were the names by which the writings of the New
          Testament, and the division of these writings, were usually expressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another passage from Ignatius is the following:—&quot;But the Gospel
          has somewhat in it more excellent, the appearance of our Lord Jesus
          Christ, his passion and resurrection.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. part ii.
          vol. ii. p. 182.)
        </p>
        <p>
          And a third: &quot;Ye ought to hearken to the Prophets, but especially
          to the gospel, in which the passion has been manifested to us, and the
          resurrection perfected.&quot; In this last passage, the Prophets and
          the Gospel are put in conjunction; and as Ignatius undoubtedly meant
          by the prophets a collection of writings, it is probable that he meant
          the same by the Gospel, the two terms standing in evident parallelism
          with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          This interpretation of the word &quot;Gospel,&quot; in the passages
          above quoted from Ignatius, is confirmed by a piece of nearly equal
          antiquity, the relation of the martyrdom of Polycarp by the church of
          Smyrna. &quot;All things,&quot; say they, &quot;that went before, were
          done, that the Lord might show us a martyrdom according to the Gospel,
          for he expected to be delivered up as the Lord also did.&quot; (Ignat.
          Ep. c.i.) And in another place, &quot;We do not commend those who
          offer themselves, forasmuch as the Gospel, teaches us no such
          thing.&quot; (Ignat. Ep. c. iv.) In both these places, what is called
          the Gospel seems to be the history of Jesus Christ, and of his
          doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this be the true sense of the passages, they are not only evidences
          of our proposition, by strong and very ancient proofs of the high
          esteem in which the books of the New Testament were holden.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Eusebius relates, that Quadratus and some others, who were the
          immediate successors of the apostles, travelling abroad to preach
          Christ, carried the Gospels with them, and delivered them to their
          converts. The words of Eusebius are: &quot;Then travelling abroad,
          they performed the work of evangelists, being ambitious to preach
          Christ, and deliver the Scripture of the divine Gospels.&quot;
          (Lardner, Cred. part ii. vol. i. p. 236.) Eusebius had before him the
          writings both of Quadratus himself, and of many others of that age,
          which are now lost. It is reasonable, therefore to believe that he had
          good grounds for his assertion. What is thus recorded of the Gospels
          took place within sixty, or at the most seventy, years after they were
          published: and it is evident that they must, before this time (and, it
          is probable, long before this time), have been in general use and in
          high esteem in the churches planted by the apostles, inasmuch as they
          were now, we find, collected into a volume: and the immediate
          successors of the apostles, they who preached the religion of Christ
          to those who had not already heard it, carried the volume with them,
          and delivered it to their converts.

          III. Irenaeus, in the year 178, (Lardner, Cred. part ii. vol. i. p.
          383.) puts the evangelic and apostolic writings in connexion with the
          Law and the Prophets, manifestly intending by the one a code or
          collection of Christian sacred writings, as the other expressed the
          code or collection of Jewish sacred writings. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Melito, at this time bishop of Sardis, writing to one Onesimus,
          tells his correspondent, (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 331.) that he had
          procured an accurate account of the books of the Old Testament. The
          occurrence in this message of the term Old Testament has been brought
          to prove, and it certainly does prove, that there was then a volume or
          collection of writings called the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. In the time of Clement of Alexandria, about fifteen years after the
          last quoted testimony, it is apparent that the Christian Scriptures
          were divided into two parts, under the general titles of the Gospels
          and Apostles; and that both these were regarded as of the highest
          authority. One out of many expressions of Clement, alluding to this
          distribution, is the following: &quot;There is a consent and harmony
          between the Law and the Prophets, the Apostles and the Gospel.&quot;
          (Lardner, Cred. vol. ii. p. 516.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The same division, &quot;Prophets, Gospels, and Apostles,&quot;
          appears in Tertullian, the contemporary of Clement. The collection of
          the Gospels is likewise called by this writer the &quot;Evangelic
          Instrument;&quot; the whole volume the &quot;New Testament;&quot; and
          the two parts, the &quot;Gospels and Apostles.&quot; (Lardner, Cred.
          vol. ii. pp. 631,574 &amp; 632.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. From many writers also of the third century, and especially from
        </p>
        <p>Cyprian, who lived in the middle of it, it is collected that the</p>
        <p>
          Christian Scriptures were divided into two cedes or volumes, one
          called
        </p>
        <p>
          the &quot;Gospels or Scriptures of the Lord,&quot; the other the
          &quot;Apostles, or
        </p>
        <p>Epistles of the Apostles&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. iv. p. 846.)</p>
        <p>
          VIII. Eusebius, as we have already seen, takes some pains to show that
          the Gospel of Saint John had been justly placed by the ancients,
          &quot;the fourth in order, and after the other three.&quot; (Lardner,
          Cred. vol. viii. p. 90.) These are the terms of his proposition: and
          the very introduction of such an argument proves incontestably, that
          the four Gospels had been collected into a volume, to the exclusion of
          every other: that their order in the volume had been adjusted with
          much consideration; and that this had been done by those who were
          called ancients in the time of Eusebius.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Diocletian persecution, in the year 303, the Scriptures were
          sought out and burnt:(Lardner, Cred. vol. vii. pp. 214 et seq.) many
          suffered death rather than deliver them up; and those who betrayed
          them to the persecutors were accounted as lapsed and apostate. On the
          other hand, Constantine, after his conversion, gave directions for
          multiplying copies of the Divine Oracles, and for magnificently
          adorning them at the expense of the imperial treasury. (Lardner, Cred.
          vol. vii. p. 432.) What the Christians of that age so richly
          embellished in their prosperity, and, which is more, so tenaciously
          preserved under persecution, was the very volume of the New Testament
          which we now read.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV.</p>
        <p>
          Our present Sacred Writings were soon distinguished by appropriate
          names and titles of respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Polycarp. &quot;I trust that ye are well exercised in the Holy
          Scriptures;—as in these Scriptures it is said, Be ye angry and sin
          not, and let not the sun go down upon your wrath.&quot; (Lardner,
          Cred. vol. i. p. 203.) This passage is extremely important; because it
          proves that, in the time of Polycarp, who had lived with the apostles,
          there were Christian writings distinguished by the name of &quot;Holy
          Scriptures,&quot; or Sacred Writings. Moreover, the text quoted by
          Polycarp is a text found in the collection at this day. What also the
          same Polycarp hath elsewhere quoted in the same manner, may be
          considered as proved to belong to the collection; and this comprehends
          Saint Matthew&#x27;s and, probably, Saint Luke&#x27;s Gospel, the Acts
          of the Apostles, ten epistles of Paul, the First Epistle of Peter, and
          the First of John. (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 223.) In another place,
          Polycarp has these words: &quot;Whoever perverts the Oracles of the
          Lord to his own lusts, and says there is neither resurrection nor
          judgment, he is the first born of Satan.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. i.
          p. 223.)—It does not appear what else Polycarp could mean by the
          &quot;Oracles of the Lord,&quot; but those same &quot;Holy
          Scriptures,&quot; or Sacred Writings, of which he had spoken before.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Justin Martyr, whose apology was written about thirty years after
          Polycarp&#x27;s epistle, expressly cites some of our present histories
          under the title of Gospel, and that not as a name by him first
          ascribed to them, but as the name by which they were generally known
          in his time. His words are these:—&quot;For the apostles in the
          memoirs composed by them, which are called Gospels, have thus
          delivered it, that Jesus commanded them to take bread, and give
          thanks.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 271.) There exists no doubt,
          but that, by the memoirs above-mentioned, Justin meant our present
          historical Scriptures; for throughout his works he quotes these and no
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, who came thirty years after Justin,
          in a passage preserved in Eusebius (for his works are lost), speaks
          &quot;of the Scriptures of the Lord.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p.
          298.)
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And at the same time, or very nearly so, by Irenaeus, bishop of
          Lyons in France, (The reader will observe the remoteness of these two
          writers in country and situation) they are called &quot;Divine
          Scriptures,&quot;—&quot;Divine Oracles,&quot;—&quot;Scriptures of the
          Lord,&quot;—&quot;Evangelic and Apostolic writings.&quot; (Lardner,
          Cred. vol. i. p. 343, et seq.) The quotations of Irenaeus prove
          decidedly, that our present Gospels, and these alone, together with
          the Acts of the Apostles, were the historical books comprehended by
          him under these appellations.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Saint Matthew&#x27;s Gospel is quoted by Theophilus, bishop of
          Antioch,
        </p>
        <p>
          contemporary with Irenaeus, under the title of the &quot;Evangelic
          voice;&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 427.) and the copious works of Clement of
        </p>
        <p>
          Alexandria, published within fifteen years of the same time, ascribe
        </p>
        <p>
          to the books of the New Testament the various titles of &quot;Sacred
        </p>
        <p>
          Books,&quot;—&quot;Divine Scriptures,&quot;—&quot;Divinely inspired
          Scriptures,&quot;—
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Scriptures of the Lord,&quot;—&quot;the true Evangelical
          Canon.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>(Lardner, Cred. vol. ii. p. 515.)</p>
        <p>
          VI. Tertullian, who joins on with Clement, beside adopting most of the
          names and epithets above noticed, calls the Gospels &quot;our
          Digesta,&quot; in allusion, as it should seem, to some collection of
          Roman laws then extant. (Lardner, Cred. vol. ii. p. 630.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. By Origen, who came thirty years after Tertullian, the same, and
          other no less strong titles, are applied to the Christian Scriptures:
          and, in addition thereunto, this writer frequently speaks of the
          &quot;Old and New Testament,&quot;—&quot;the Ancient and New
          Scriptures,&quot;—&quot;the Ancient and New Oracles.&quot; (Lardner,
          Cred. vol. iii. p. 230.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. In Cyprian, who was not twenty years later, they are &quot;Books
          of the
        </p>
        <p>
          Spirit,&quot;—&quot;Divine Fountains,&quot;—&quot;Fountains of the
          Divine Fulness.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>(Lardner, Cred. vol. iv. p. 844.)</p>
        <p>
          The expressions we have thus quoted are evidences of high and peculiar
          respect. They all occur within two centuries from the publication of
          the books. Some of them commence with the companions of the apostles;
          and they increase in number and variety, through a series of writers
          touching upon one another, and deduced from the first age of the
          religion.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION V.</p>
        <p>
          Our Scriptures were publicly read and expounded in the religious
          assemblies of the early Christians. Justin MARTYR, who wrote in the
          year 140, which was seventy or eighty years after some, and less,
          probably, after others of the Gospels were published, giving, in his
          first apology an account, to the Emperor, of the Christian worship has
          this remarkable passage:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;The Memoirs of the Apostles, or the Writings of the Prophets,
          are read according as the time allows: and, when the reader has ended,
          the president makes a discourse, exhorting to the imitation of so
          excellent things.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 273.)
        </p>
        <p>A few short observations will show the value of this testimony.</p>
        <p>
          1. The &quot;Memoirs of the Apostles,&quot; Justin in another place
          expressly tells us, are what are called &quot;Gospels:&quot; and that
          they were the Gospels which we now use, is made certain by
          Justin&#x27;s numerous quotations of them, and his silence about any
          others.
        </p>
        <p>2. Justin describes the general usage of the Christian church.</p>
        <p>
          3. Justin does not speak of it as recent or newly instituted, but in
          the terms in which men speak of established customs.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Tertullian, who followed Justin at the distance of about fifty
          years, in his account of the religious assemblies of Christians as
          they were conducted in his time, says, &quot;We come together to
          recollect the Divine Scriptures; we nourish our faith, raise our hope,
          confirm our trust, by the Sacred Word.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. ii.
          p. 628.)
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Eusebius records of Origen, and cites for his authority the
          letters of bishops contemporary with Origen, that when he went into
          Palestine about the year 216, which was only sixteen years after the
          date of Tertullian&#x27;s testimony, he was desired by the bishops of
          that country to discourse and expound the Scriptures publicly in the
          church, though he was not yet ordained a presbyter. (Lardner, Cred.
          vol. iii. p. 68.) This anecdote recognises the usage, not only of
          reading, but of expounding the Scriptures; and both as subsisting in
          full force. Origen also himself bears witness to the same practice:
          &quot;This,&quot; says he, &quot;we do, when the Scriptures are read
          in the church, and when the discourse for explication is delivered to
          the people.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. iii. p. 302.) And what is a
          still more ample testimony, many homilies of his upon the Scriptures
          of the New Testament, delivered by him in the assemblies of the
          church, are still extant.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Cyprian, whose age was not twenty years lower than that of Origen,
          gives his people an account of having ordained two persons, who were
          before confessors, to be readers; and what they were to read appears
          by the reason which he gives for his choice; &quot;Nothing,&quot; says
          Cyprian, &quot;can be more fit than that he who has made a glorious
          confession of the Lord should read publicly in the church; that he who
          has shown himself willing to die a martyr should read the Gospel of
          Christ by which martyrs are made.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. iv. p.
          842.)
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Intimations of the same custom may be traced in a great number of
          writers in the beginning and throughout the whole of the fourth
          century. Of these testimonies I will only use one, as being, of
          itself, express and full. Augustine, who appeared near the conclusion
          of the century, displays the benefit of the Christian religion on this
          very account, the public reading of the Scriptures in the churches,
          &quot;where,&quot; says he, &quot;is a consequence of all sorts of
          people of both sexes; and where they hear how they ought to live well
          in this world, that they may deserve to live happily and eternally in
          another.&quot; And this custom he declares to be universal: &quot;The
          canonical books of Scripture being read every where, the miracles
          therein recorded are well known to all people.&quot; (Lardner, Cred.
          vol. x. p. 276, et seq.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It does not appear that any books, other than our present Scriptures
          were thus publicly read, except that the epistle of Clement was read
          in the church of Corinth, to which it had been addressed, and in some
          others; and that the Shepherd of Hennas was read in many churches. Nor
          does it subtract much from the value of the argument, that these two
          writings partly come within it, because we allow them to be the
          genuine writings of apostolical men. There is not the least evidence,
          that any other Gospel than the four which we receive was ever admitted
          to this distinction.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VI.</p>
        <p>
          Commentaries were anciently written upon the Scriptures; harmonies
          formed out of them; different copies carefully collated; and versions
          made of them into different languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          No greater proof can be given of the esteem in which these books were
          holden by the ancient Christians, or of the sense then entertained of
          their value and importance, than the industry bestowed upon them. And
          it ought to be observed that the value and importance of these books
          consisted entirely in their genuineness and truth. There was nothing
          in them, as works of taste or as compositions, which could have
          induced any one to have written a note upon them. Moreover, it shows
          that they were even then considered as ancient books. Men do not write
          comments upon publications of their own times: therefore the
          testimonies cited under this head afford an evidence which carries up
          the evangelic writings much beyond the age of the testimonies
          themselves, and to that of their reputed authors.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Tatian, a follower of Justin Martyr, and who flourished about the
          year 170, composed a harmony, or collation of the Gospels, which he
          called Diatessaron, of the four. The title, as well as the work, is
          remarkable; because it shows that then, as now, there were four, and
          only four, Gospels in general use with Christians. And this was little
          more than a hundred years after the publication of some of them.
          (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 307.)
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Pantaenus, of the Alexandrian school, a man of great reputation
          and learning, who came twenty years after Tatian, wrote many
          commentaries upon the Holy Scriptures, which, as Jerome testifies,
          were extant in his time. (Lardner, Cred. vol. i. p. 455.)
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Clement of Alexandria wrote short explications of many books of
          the
        </p>
        <p>Old and New Testament. (Lardner, Cred. vol. ii. p. 462.)</p>
        <p>
          IV. Tertullian appeals from the authority of a later version, then in
          use, to the authentic Greek. (Lardner, Cred. vol. ii. p. 638.)
        </p>
        <p>
          V. An anonymous author, quoted by Eusebius, and who appears to have
          written about the year 212, appeals to the ancient copies of the
          Scriptures, in refutation of some corrupt readings alleged by the
          followers of Artemon. (Lardner, Cred. vol. iii. p. 46.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The same Eusebius, mentioning by name several writers of the
          church who lived at this time, and concerning whom he says,
          &quot;There still remain divers monuments of the laudable industry of
          those ancient and ecclesiastical men,&quot; (i. e. of Christian
          writers who were considered as ancient in the year 300,) adds,
          &quot;There are, besides, treatises of many others, whose names we
          have not been able to learn, orthodox and ecclesiastical men, as the
          interpretations of the Divine Scriptures given by each of them
          show.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. ii. p. 551.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. The last five testimonies may be referred to the year 200;
          immediately after which, a period of thirty years gives us Julius
          Africanus, who wrote an epistle upon the apparent difference in the
          genealogies in Matthew and Luke, which he endeavours to reconcile by
          the distinction of natural and legal descent, and conducts his
          hypothesis with great industry through the whole series of
          generations. (Lardner, Cred. vol. iii. p. 170.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Ammonius, a learned Alexandrian, who composed, as Tatian had done, a
          harmony of the four Gospels, which proves, as Tatian&#x27;s work did,
          that there were four Gospels, and no more, at this time in use in the
          church. It affords also on instance of the zeal of Christians for
          those writings, and of their solicitude about them. (Lardner, Cred.
          vol. iii. p. 122.)

          And, above both these, Origen, who wrote commentaries, or homilies,
          upon most of the books included in the New Testament, and upon no
          other books but these. In particular, he wrote upon Saint John&#x27;s
          Gospel, very largely upon Saint Matthew&#x27;s, and commentaries, or
          homilies, upon the Acts of the Apostles. (Lardner, Cred. vol. iii. pp.
          352, 192, 202 &amp; 245.)

          VIII. In addition to these, the third century likewise
          contains—Dionysius of Alexandria, a very learned man, who compared,
          with great accuracy, the accounts in the four Gospels of the time of
          Christ&#x27;s resurrection, adding a reflection which showed his
          opinion of their authority: &quot;Let us not think that the
          evangelists disagree or contradict each other, although there be some
          small difference; but let us honestly and faithfully endeavour to
          reconcile what we read.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. iv. p. 166.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Victorin, bishop of Pettaw, in Germany, who wrote comments upon Saint
        </p>
        <p>Matthew&#x27;s Gospel. (Lardner, Cred. vol. iv. p. 195.)</p>
        <p>
          Lucian, a presbyter of Antioch; and Hesychius, an Egyptian bishop, who
          put forth editions of the New Testament.

          IX. The fourth century supplies a catalogue* of fourteen writers, who
          expended their labours upon the books of the New Testament, and whose
          works or names are come down to our times; amongst which number it may
          be sufficient, for the purpose of showing the sentiments and studies
          of learned Christians of that age, to notice the following:
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>* Eusebius …… A.D. 315</p>
        <p>Juvencus, Spain ….. 330</p>
        <p>Theodore, Thrace …. 334</p>

        <p>Chrysostom …… 398</p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          Eusebius, in the very beginning of the century, wrote expressly upon
          the discrepancies observable in the Gospels, and likewise a treatise,
          in which he pointed out what things are related by four, what by
          three, what by two, and what by one evangelist. (Lardner, Cred. vol.
          viii. p. 46.) This author also testifies what is certainly a material
          piece of evidence, &quot;that the writings of the apostles had
          obtained such an esteem as to be translated into every language both
          of Greeks and Barbarians, and to be diligently studied by all
          nations.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. viii. p. 201.) This testimony was
          given about the year 300; how long before that date these translations
          were made does not appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damasus, bishop of Rome, corresponded with Saint Jerome upon the
          exposition of difficult texts of Scripture; and, in a letter still
          remaining, desires Jerome to give him a clear explanation of the word
          Hosanna, found in the New Testament; &quot;He (Damasus) having met
          with very different interpretations of it in the Greek and Latin
          commentaries of Catholic writers which he had read.&quot; (Lardner,
          Cred. vol. ix. P. 108) This last clause shows the number and variety
          of commentaries then extant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gregory of Nyssen, at one time, appeals to the most exact copies of
          Saint Mark&#x27;s Gospel; at another time, compares together, and
          proposes to reconcile, the several accounts of the Resurrection given
          by the four Evangelists; which limitation proves that there were no
          other histories of Christ deemed authentic beside these, or included
          in the same character with these. This writer observes, acutely
          enough, that &quot;the disposition of the clothes in the sepulchre,
          the napkin that was about our Saviour&#x27;s head, not lying with the
          linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself, did not
          bespeak the terror and hurry of thieves, and therefore refutes the
          story of the body being stolen.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. ix. p.
          163.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Ambrose, bishop of Milan, remarked various readings in the Latin
          copies of the New Testament, and appeals to the original Greek;
        </p>
        <p>
          And Jerome, towards the conclusion of this century, put forth an
          edition of the New Testament in Latin, corrected, at least as to the
          Gospels, by Greek copies, and &quot;those (he says) ancient.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, Chrysostom, it is well known, delivered and published a great
          many homilies, or sermons, upon the Gospels and the Acts of the
          Apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is needless to bring down this article lower, but it is of
          importance to add, that there is no example of Christian writers of
          the first three centuries composing comments upon any other books than
          those which are found in the New Testament, except the single one of
          Clement of Alexandria commenting upon a book called the Revelation of
          Peter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the ancient versions of the New Testament, one of the most valuable
          is the Syriac. Syriac was the language of Palestine when Christianity
          was there first established. And although the books of Scripture were
          written in Greek, for the purpose of a more extended circulation than
          within the precincts of Judea, yet it is probable that they would soon
          be translated into the vulgar language of the country where the
          religion first prevailed. Accordingly, a Syriac translation is now
          extant, all along, so far as it appears, used by the inhabitants of
          Syria, bearing many internal marks of high antiquity, supported in its
          pretensions by the uniform tradition of the East, and confirmed by the
          discovery of many very ancient manuscripts in the libraries of Europe,
          It is about 200 years since a bishop of Antioch sent a copy of this
          translation into Europe to be printed; and this seems to be the first
          time that the translation became generally known to these parts of the
          world. The bishop of Antioch&#x27;s Testament was found to contain all
          our books, except the second epistle of Peter, the second and third of
          John, and the Revelation; which books, however, have since been
          discovered in that language in some ancient manuscripts of Europe. But
          in this collection, no other book, besides what is in ours, appears
          ever to have had a place. And, which is very worthy of observation,
          the text, though preserved in a remote country, and without
          communication with ours, differs from ours very little, and in nothing
          that is important (Jones on the Canon, vol. i. e. 14.).
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VII.</p>
        <p>
          Our Scriptures were received by ancient Christians of different sects
          and persuasions, but many Heretics as well as Catholics, and were
          usually appealed to by both sides in the controversies which arose in
          those days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three most ancient topics of controversy amongst Christians were,
          the authority of the Jewish constitution, the origin of evil, and the
          nature of Christ. Upon the first of these we find, in very early
          times, one class of heretics rejecting the Old Testament entirely;
          another contending for the obligation of its law, in all its parts,
          throughout its whole extent, and over every one who sought acceptance
          with God. Upon the two latter subjects, a natural, perhaps, and
          venial, but a fruitless, eager, and impatient curiosity, prompted by
          the philosophy and by the scholastic habits of the age, which carried
          men much into bold hypotheses and conjectural solutions, raised,
          amongst some who professed Christianity, very wild and unfounded
          opinions. I think there is no reason to believe that the number of
          these bore any considerable proportion to the body of the Christian
          church; and, amidst the disputes which such opinions necessarily
          occasioned, it is a great satisfaction to perceive what, in a vast
          plurality of instances, we do perceive, all sides recurring to the
          same Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          *I. Basilides lived near the age of the apostles, about the year 120,
          or, perhaps, sooner. (Lardner, vol. ix. p. 271.) He rejected the
          Jewish institution, not as spurious, but as proceeding from a being
          inferior to the true God; and in other respects advanced a scheme of
          theology widely different from the general doctrine of the Christian
          church, and which, as it gained over some disciples, was warmly
          opposed by Christian writers of the second and third century. In these
          writings there is positive evidence that Basilides received the Gospel
          of Matthew; and there is no sufficient proof that he rejected any of
          the other three: on the contrary, it appears that he wrote a
          commentary upon the Gospel, so copious as to be divided into
          twenty-four books. (Lardner, vol. ix. ed. 1788, p. 305, 306.)

          * The materials of the former part of this section are taken from Dr.
          Lardner&#x27;s History of the Heretics of the first two centuries,
          published since his death, with additions, by the Rev. Mr. Hogg, of
          Exeter, and inserted into the ninth volume of his works, of the
          edition of 1778. _________

          II. The Valentinians appeared about the same time. Their heresy
          consisted in certain notions concerning angelic natures, which can
          hardly be rendered intelligible to a modern reader. They seem,
          however, to have acquired as much importance as any of the separatists
          of that early age. Of this sect, Irenaeus, who wrote A.D. 172,
          expressly records that they endeavoured to fetch arguments for their
          opinions from the evangelic and apostolic writings. Heracleon, one of
          the most celebrated of the sect, and who lived probably so early as
          the year 125, wrote commentaries upon Luke and John. Some observations
          also of his upon Matthew are preserved by Origen. Nor is there any
          reason to doubt that he received the whole New Testament. (Lardner,
          vol. ix. ed. 1788, pp. 350-351; vol. i. p. 383; vol. ix. ed. 1788, p.
          352-353.)
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The Carpocratians were also an early heresy, little, if at all,
          later than the two preceding. Some of their opinions resembled what we
          at this day mean by Socinianism. With respect to the Scriptures, they
          are specifically charged, by Irenaeus and by Epiphanius, with
          endeavouring to pervert a passage in Matthew, which amounts to a
          positive proof that they received that Gospel. Negatively, they are
          not accused, by their adversaries, of rejecting any part of the New
          Testament. (Lardner, vol. ix. ed. 1788, pp. 309 &amp; 318.)
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The Sethians, A.D. 150; the Montanists, A.D. 156; the Marcosigns,
          A.D. 160; Hermogenes, A.D. 180; Praxias, A.D. 196; Artemon, A.D. 200;
          Theodotus, A.D. 200; all included under the denomination of heretics,
          and all engaged in controversies with Catholic Christians, received
          the Scriptures of the New Testament. (Lardner, vol. ix. ed. 1788, pp.
          455, 482, 348, 473, 433, 466.)
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Tatian, who lived in the year 172, went into many extravagant
          opinions, was the founder of a sect called Encratites, and was deeply
          involved in disputes with the Christians of that age; yet Tatian so
          received the four Gospels as to compose a harmony from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. From a writer quoted by Eusebius, of about the year 200, it is
          apparent that they who at that time contended for the mere humanity of
          Christ, argued from the Scriptures; for they are accused by this
          writer of making alterations in their copies in order to favour their
          opinions. (Lardner, vol. iii. P. 46.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Origen&#x27;s sentiments excited great controversies,—the bishops
          of Rome and Alexandria, and many others, condemning, the bishops of
          the east espousing them; yet there is not the smallest question but
          that both the advocates and adversaries of these opinions acknowledged
          the same authority of Scripture. In his time, which the reader will
          remember was about one hundred and fifty years after the Scriptures
          were published, many dissensions subsisted amongst Christians, with
          which they were reproached by Celsus; yet Origen, who has recorded
          this accusation without contradicting it, nevertheless testifies, that
          the four Gospels were received without dispute, by the whole church of
          God under heaven. (Lardner, vol. iv. ed. 1788, p. 642.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Paul of Samosata, about thirty years after Origen, so
          distinguished himself in the controversy concerning the nature of
          Christ as to be the subject of two councils or synods, assembled at
          Antioch, upon his opinions. Yet he is not charged by his adversaries
          with rejecting any book of the New Testament. On the contrary,
          Epiphanius, who wrote a history of heretics a hundred years
          afterwards, says, that Paul endeavoured to support his doctrine by
          texts of Scripture. And Vincentius Lirinensis, A.D. 434, speaking of
          Paul and other heretics of the same age, has these words: &quot;Here,
          perhaps, some one may ask whether heretics also urge the testimony of
          Scripture. They urge it, indeed, explicitly and vehemently; for you
          may see them flying through every book of the sacred law.&quot;
          (Lardner, vol. ix. p. 158.)
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. A controversy at the same time existed with the Noetians or
          Sabellians, who seem to have gone into the opposite extreme from that
          of Paul of Samosata and his followers. Yet according to the express
          testimony of Epiphanius, Sabellius received all the Scriptures. And
          with both sects Catholic writers constantly allege the Scriptures, and
          reply to the arguments which their opponents drew from particular
          texts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have here, therefore, a proof, that parties who were the most
          opposite and irreconcilable to one another acknowledged the authority
          of Scripture with equal deference.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. And as a general testimony to the same point, may be produced what
          was said by one of the bishops of the council of Carthage, which was
          holden a little before this time:—&quot;I am of opinion that
          blasphemous and wicked heretics, who pervert the sacred and adorable
          words of the Scripture, should be execrated.&quot; Undoubtedly, what
          they perverted they received. (Lardner, vol. ix. p. 839.)
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. The Millennium, Novatianism, the baptism of heretics, the keeping
          of Easter, engaged also the attention and divided the opinions of
          Christians, at and before that time (and, by the way, it may be
          observed, that such disputes, though on some accounts to be blamed,
          showed how much men were in earnest upon the subject.); yet every one
          appealed for the grounds of his opinion to Scripture authority.
          Dionysius of Alexandria, who flourished A.D. 247, describing a
          conference or public disputation, with the Millennarians of Egypt,
          confesses of them, though their adversary, &quot;that they embrace
          whatever could be made out by good arguments, from the Holy
          Scriptures.&quot; (Lardner, vol. iv. p. 666.) Novatus, A.D. 251,
          distinguished by some rigid sentiments concerning the reception of
          those who had lapsed, and the founder of a numerous sect, in his few
          remaining works quotes the Gospel with the same respect as other
          Christians did; and concerning his followers, the testimony of
          Socrates, who wrote about the year 440, is positive, viz. &quot;That
          in the disputes between the Catholics and them, each side endeavoured
          to support itself by the authority of the Divine Scriptures&quot;
          (Lardner, vol. v. p. 105.)
        </p>
        <p>XII. The Donatists, who sprung up in the year 328, used the same</p>
        <p>
          Scriptures as we do. &quot;Produce,&quot; saith Augustine, &quot;some
          proof from the
        </p>
        <p>
          Scriptures, whose authority is common to us both&quot; (Lardner, vol.
          vii. p.
        </p>
        <p>243.)</p>
        <p>
          XIII. It is perfectly notorious, that in the Arian controversy, which
          arose soon after the year 300, both sides appealed to the same
          Scriptures, and with equal professions of deference and regard. The
          Arians, in their council of Antioch, A.D. 341, pronounce that &quot;if
          any one, contrary to the sound doctrine of the Scriptures, say, that
          the Son is a creature, as one of the creatures, let him be an
          anathema.&quot; (Lardner, vol. vii. p. 277.) They and the Athanasians
          mutually accuse each other of using unscriptural phrases; which was a
          mutual acknowledgment of the conclusive authority of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. The Priscillianists, A.D. 378, the Pelagians, A.D. 405 received
          the same Scriptures as we do. (Lardner, vol. ix. p. 325; vol. xi p.
          52.)
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. The testimony of Chrysostom, who lived near the year 400, is so
          positive in affirmation of the proposition which we maintain, that it
          may form a proper conclusion of the argument. &quot;The general
          reception of the Gospels is a proof that their history is true and
          consistent; for, since the writing of the Gospels, many heresies have
          arisen, holding opinions contrary to what is contained in them, who
          yet receive the Gospels either entire or in part.&quot; (Lardner, vol.
          x. p. 316.) I am not moved by what may seem a deduction from
          Chrysostom&#x27;s testimony, the words, &quot;entire or in part;&quot;
          for if all the parts which were ever questioned in our Gospels were
          given up, it would not affect the miraculous origin of the religion in
          the smallest degree: e.g.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cerinthus is said by Epiphanius to have received the Gospel of
          Matthew, but not entire. What the omissions were does not appear. The
          common opinion, that he rejected the first two chapters, seems to have
          been a mistake. (Lardner, vol. ix. ed. 1788, p. 322.) It is agreed,
          however, by all who have given any account of Cerinthus, that he
          taught that the Holy Ghost (whether he meant by that name a person or
          a power) descended upon Jesus at his baptism; that Jesus from this
          time performed many miracles, and that he appeared after his death. He
          must have retained therefore the essential parts of the history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of all the ancient heretics, the most extraordinary was Marcion.
          (Lardner, vol. ix. sect. ii. c. x. Also Michael vol. i. c. i. sect.
          xviii.) One of his tenets was the rejection of the Old Testament, as
          proceeding from an inferior and imperfect Deity; and in pursuance of
          this hypothesis, he erased from the New, and that, as it should seem,
          without entering into any critical reasons, every passage which
          recognised the Jewish Scriptures. He spared not a text which
          contradicted his opinion. It is reasonable to believe that Marcion
          treated books as he treated texts: yet this rash and wild
          controversialist published a recension, or chastised edition of Saint
          Luke&#x27;s Gospel, containing the leading facts, and all which is
          necessary to authenticate the religion. This example affords proof
          that there were always some points, and those the main points, which
          neither wildness nor rashness, neither the fury of opposition nor the
          intemperance of controversy, would venture to call in question. There
          is no reason to believe that Marcion, though full of resentment
          against the Catholic Christians, ever charged them with forging their
          books. &quot;The Gospel of Saint Matthew, the Epistle to the Hebrews,
          with those of Saint Peter and Saint James, as well as the Old
          Testament in general&quot; he said, &quot;were writings not for
          Christians but for Jews.&quot; This declaration shows the ground upon
          which Marcion proceeded in his mutilation of the Scriptures, viz., his
          dislike of the passages or the books. Marcion flourished about the
          year 130.*

          Dr. Lardner, in his General Review, sums up this head of evidence in
          the following words:—&quot;Noitus, Paul of Samosata, Sabellius,
          Marcelins, Photinus, the Novatiana, Donatists, Manicheans (This must
          be with an exception, however, of Faustus, who lived so late us the
          year 354), Priscillianists, beside Artemon, the Audians, the Arians,
          and divers others, all received most of all the same books of the New
          Testament which the Catholics received; and agreed in a like respect
          for them as written by apostles, or their disciples and
          companions.&quot; (Lardner, vol. iii. p. 12.—Dr. Lardner&#x27;s future
          inquiries supplied him with many other instances.)
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VIII.</p>
        <p>
          The four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, thirteen Epistles of Saint
          Paul the First Epistle of John, and the First of Peter, were received
          without doubt by those who doubted concerning the other books which
          are included in our present Canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I state this proposition, because, if made out, it shows that the
          authenticity of their books was a subject amongst the early Christians
          of consideration and inquiry; and that, where there was cause of
          doubt, they did doubt; a circumstance which strengthens very much
          their testimony to such books as were received by them with full
          acquiescence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Jerome, in his account of Caius, who was probably a presbyter of
          Rome, and who flourished near the year 200, records of him, that,
          reckoning up only thirteen epistles of Paul, he says the fourteenth,
          which is inscribed to the Hebrews, is not his: and then Jerome adds,
          &quot;With the Romans to this day it is not looked upon as
          Paul&#x27;s.&quot; This agrees in the main with the account given by
          Eusebius of the same ancient author and his work; except that Eusebius
          delivers his own remark in more guarded terms: &quot;And indeed to
          this very time, by some of the Romans, this epistle is not thought to
          be the apostle&#x27;s.&quot; (Lardner, vol. iii. p. 240.)
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Origen, about twenty years after Caius, quoting the Epistle to the
          Hebrews, observes that some might dispute the authority of that
          epistle; and therefore proceeds to quote to the same point, as
          undoubted books of Scripture, the Gospel of Saint Matthew, the Acts of
          the Apostles, and Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Thessalonians.
          (Lardner, vol. iii. p. 246.) and in another place, this author speaks
          of the Epistle to the Hebrews thus: &quot;The account come down to us
          is various; some saying that Clement who was bishop of Rome, wrote
          this epistle; others, that it was Luke, the same who wrote the Gospel
          and the Acts.&quot; Speaking also, in the same paragraph, of Peter,
          &quot;Peter,&quot; says he, &quot;has left one epistle, acknowledged;
          let it be granted likewise that he wrote a second, for it is doubted
          of.&quot; And of John, &quot;He has also left one epistle, of a very
          few lines; grant also a second and a third, for all do not allow them
          to be genuine.&quot; Now let it be noted, that Origen, who thus
          discriminates, and thus confesses his own doubts and the doubts which
          subsisted in his time, expressly witnesses concerning the four
          Gospels, &quot;that they alone are received without dispute by the
          whole church of God under heaven.&quot; (Lardner, vol. iii. p. 234.)
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Dionysius of Alexandria, in the year 247, doubts concerning the
          Book of Revelation, whether it was written by Saint John; states the
          grounds of his doubt, represents the diversity of opinion concerning
          it, in his own time, and before his time. (Lardner, vol. iv. p. 670.)
          Yet the same Dionysius uses and collates the four Gospels in a manner
          which shows that he entertained not the smallest suspicion of their
          authority, and in a manner also which shows that they, and they alone,
          were received as authentic histories of Christ. (Lardner, vol. iv. p.
          661.)
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. But this section may be said to have been framed on purpose to
          introduce to the reader two remarkable passages extant in
          Eusebius&#x27;s Ecclesiastical History. The first passage opens with
          these words:—&quot;Let us observe the writings of the apostle John
          which are uncontradicted: and first of all must be mentioned, as
          acknowledged of all, the Gospel according to him, well known to all
          the churches under heaven.&quot; The author then proceeds to relate
          the occasions of writing the Gospels, and the reasons for placing
          Saint John&#x27;s the last, manifestly speaking of all the four as
          parallel in their authority, and in the certainty of their original.
          (Lardner, vol. viii. p. 90.) The second passage is taken from a
          chapter, the title of which is, &quot;Of the Scriptures universally
          acknowledged, and of those that are not such.&quot; Eusebius begins
          his enumeration in the following manner:—&quot;In the first place are
          to be ranked the sacred four Gospels; then the book of the Acts of the
          Apostles; after that are to be reckoned the Epistles of Paul. In the
          next place, that called the First Epistle of John, and the Epistle of
          Peter, are to be esteemed authentic. After this is to be placed, if it
          be thought fit, the Revelation of John, about which we shall observe
          the different opinions at proper seasons. Of the controverted, but yet
          well known or approved by the most, are, that called the Epistle of
          James, and that of Jude, and the Second of Peter, and the Second and
          Third of John, whether they are written by the evangelist, or another
          of the same name.&quot; (Lardner, vol. viii. p. 39.) He then proceeds
          to reckon up five others, not in our canon, which he calls in one
          place spurious, in another controverted, meaning, as appears to me,
          nearly the same thing by these two words.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * That Eusebius could not intend, by the word rendered
          &#x27;spurious&#x27; what we at present mean by it, is evident from a
          clause in this very chapter where, speaking of the Gospels of Peter,
          and Thomas and Matthias, and some others, he says, &quot;They the are
          not so much as to be reckoned among the spurious, but are altogether
          absurd and impious.&quot; (Lardner, vol. viii. p. 99.) _________
        </p>
        <p>
          It is manifest from this passage, that the four Gospels, and the Acts
          of the Apostles (the parts of Scripture with which our concern
          principally lies), were acknowledged without dispute, even by those
          who raised objections, or entertained doubts, about some other parts
          of the same collection. But the passage proves something more than
          this. The author was extremely conversant in the writings of
          Christians which had been published from the commencement of the
          institution to his own time: and it was from these writings that he
          drew his knowledge of the character and reception of the books in
          question. That Eusebius recurred to this medium of information, and
          that he had examined with attention this species of proof, is shown,
          first, by a passage in the very chapter we are quoting, in which,
          speaking of the books which he calls spurious, &quot;None,&quot; he
          says, &quot;of the ecclesiastical writers, in the succession of the
          apostles, have vouchsafed to make any mention of them in their
          writings;&quot; and, secondly, by another passage of the same work,
          wherein, speaking of the First Epistle of Peter, &quot;This,&quot; he
          says, &quot;the presbyters of ancient times have quoted in their
          writings as undoubtedly genuine;&quot; (Lardner, vol. viii. p. 99.)
          and then, speaking of some other writings bearing the name of Peter,
          &quot;We know,&quot; he says, &quot;that they have not been delivered
          down to us in the number of Catholic writings, forasmuch as no
          ecclesiastical writer of the ancients, or of our times, has made use
          of testimonies out of them.&quot; &quot;But in the progress of this
          history,&quot; the author proceeds, &quot;we shall make it our
          business to show, together with the successions from the apostles,
          what ecclesiastical writers, in every age, have used such writings as
          these which are contradicted, and what they have said with regard to
          the Scriptures received in the New Testament, and acknowledged by all,
          and with regard to those which are not such.&quot; (Lardner, vol.
          viii. p. 111)
        </p>
        <p>
          After this it is reasonable to believe that when Eusebius states the
          four Gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles, as uncontradicted,
          uncontested, and acknowledged by all; and when he places them in
          opposition, not only to those which were spurious, in our sense of
          that term, but to those which were controverted, and even to those
          which were well known and approved by many, yet doubted of by some; he
          represents not only the sense of his own age, but the result of the
          evidence which the writings of prior ages, from the apostles&#x27;
          time to his own, had furnished to his inquiries. The opinion of
          Eusebius and his contemporaries appears to have been founded upon the
          testimony of writers whom they then called ancient: and we may
          observe, that such of the works of these writers as have come down to
          our times entirely confirm the judgment, and support the distinction
          which Eusebius proposes. The books which he calls &quot;books
          universally acknowledged&quot; are in fact used and quoted in time
          remaining works of Christian writers, during the 250 years between the
          apostles&#x27; time and that of Eusebius, much more frequently than,
          and in a different manner from, those the authority of which, he tells
          us, was disputed.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IX.</p>
        <p>
          Our historical Scriptures were attacked by the early adversaries of
          Christianity, as containing the accounts upon which the Religion was
          founded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Near the middle of the second century, Celsus, a heathen philosopher,
          wrote a professed treatise against Christianity. To this treatise
          Origen, who came about fifty years after him, published an answer, in
          which he frequently recites his adversary&#x27;s words and arguments.
          The work of Celsus is lost; but that of Origen remains. Origen appears
          to have given us the words of Celsus, where he professes to give them,
          very faithfully; and amongst other reasons for thinking so, this is
          one, that the objection, as stated by him from Celsus, is sometimes
          stronger than his own answer. I think it also probable that Origen, in
          his answer, has retailed a large portion of the work of Celsus:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;That it may not be suspected,&quot; he says, &quot;that we pass
          by any chapters because we have no answers at hand, I have thought it
          best, according to my ability, to confute everything proposed by him,
          not so much observing the natural order of things, as the order which
          he has taken himself.&quot; (Orig. cont. Cels. I. i. sect. 41.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Celsus wrote about one hundred years after the Gospels were published;
          and therefore any notices of these books from him are extremely
          important for their antiquity. They are, however, rendered more so by
          the character of the author; for the reception, credit, and notoriety
          of these books must have been well established amongst Christians, to
          have made them subjects of animadversion and opposition by strangers
          and by enemies. It evinces the truth of what Chrysostom, two centuries
          afterwards, observed, that &quot;the Gospels, when written, were not
          hidden in a corner or buried in obscurity, but they were made known to
          all the world, before enemies as well as others, even as they are
          now.&quot; (In Matt. Hom. I. 7.)
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Celsus, or the Jew whom he personates, uses these words:—&quot;I
          could say many things concerning the affairs of Jesus, and those, too,
          different from those written by the disciples of Jesus; but I
          purposely omit them.&quot; (Lardner, Jewish and Heathen Test. vol. ii.
          p. 274.) Upon this passage it has been rightly observed, that it is
          not easy to believe, that if Celsus could have contradicted the
          disciples upon good evidence in any material point, he would have
          omitted to do so, and that the assertion is, what Origen calls it, a
          mere oratorical flourish.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is sufficient, however, to prove that, in the time of Celsus, there
          were books well known, and allowed to be written by the disciples of
          Jesus, which books contained a history of him. By the term disciples,
          Celsus does not mean the followers of Jesus in general; for them he
          calls Christians, or believers, or the like; but those who had been
          taught by Jesus himself, i.e. his apostles and companions.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In another passage, Celsus accuses the Christians of altering the
          Gospel. (Lardner, Jewish and Heathen Test. Vol. ii. p. 275.) The
          accusation refers to some variations in the readings of particular
          passages: for Celsus goes on to object, that when they are pressed
          hard, and one reading has been confuted, they disown that, and fly to
          another. We cannot perceive from Origen, that Celsus specified any
          particular instances, and without such specification the charge is of
          no value. But the true conclusion to be drawn from it is, that there
          were in the hands of the Christians histories which were even then of
          some standing: for various readings and corruptions do not take place
          in recent productions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The former quotation, the reader will remember, proves that these
          books were composed by the disciples of Jesus, strictly so called; the
          present quotation shows, that though objections were taken by the
          adversaries of the religion to the integrity of these books, none were
          made to their genuineness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In a third passage, the Jew whom Celsus introduces shuts up an
          argument in this manner:—&quot;these things then we have alleged to
          you out of your own writings, not needing any other weapons.&quot;
          (Lardner, vol. ii. p. 276.) It is manifest that this boast proceeds
          upon the supposition that the books over which the writer affects to
          triumph possessed an authority by which Christians confessed
          themselves to be bound.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That the books to which Celsus refers were no other than our
          present Gospels, is made out by his allusions to various passages
          still found in these Gospels. Celsus takes notice of the genealogies,
          which fixes two of these Gospels; of the precepts, Resist not him that
          injures you, and if a man strike thee on the one cheek, offer to him
          the other also; of the woes denounced by Christ; of his predictions;
          of his saying, That it is impossible to serve two masters; ( Lardner,
          vol. ii. pp. 276-277.) Of the purple robe, the crown of thorns, and
          the reed in his hand; of the blood that flowed from the body of Jesus
          upon the cross, which circumstance is recorded by John alone; and
          (what is instar omnium for the purpose for which we produce it) of the
          difference in the accounts given of the resurrection by the
          evangelists, some mentioning two angels at the sepulchre, ethers only
          one. (Lardner, vol. ii. pp. 280, 281, &amp; 283.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is extremely material to remark, that Celsus not only perpetually
          referred to the accounts of Christ contained in the four Gospels, but
          that he referred to no other accounts; that he founded none of his
          objections to Christianity upon any thing delivered in spurious
          Gospels. (The particulars, of which the above are only a few, are well
          collected by Mr. Bryant, p. 140.)
        </p>
        <p>
          II. What Celsus was in the second century, Porphyry became in the
          third. His work, which was a large and formal treatise against the
          Christian religion, is not extant. We must be content, therefore, to
          gather his objections from Christian writers, who have noticed in
          order to answer them; and enough remains of this species of
          information to prove completely, that Porphyry&#x27;s animadversions
          were directed against the contents of our present Gospels, and of the
          Acts of the Apostles; Porphyry considering that to overthrow them was
          to overthrow the religion. Thus he objects to the repetition of a
          generation in Saint Matthew&#x27;s genealogy; to Matthew&#x27;s call;
          to the quotation of a text from Isaiah, which is found in a psalm
          ascribed to Asaph; to the calling of the lake of Tiberius a sea; to
          the expression of Saint Matthew, &quot;the abomination of
          desolation;&quot; to the variation in Matthew and Mark upon the text,
          &quot;the voice of one crying in the wilderness,&quot; Matthew citing
          it from Isaias, Mark from the Prophets; to John&#x27;s application of
          the term &quot;Word;&quot; to Christ&#x27;s change of intention about
          going up to the feast of Tabernacles (John vii. 8); to the judgment
          denounced by Saint Peter upon Ananias and Sapphira, which he calls an
          &quot;imprecation of death.&quot; (Jewish and Heathen Test. Vol. iii.
          p. 166, et seq.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The instances here alleged serve, in some measure, to show the nature
          of Porphyry&#x27;s objections, and prove that Porphyry had read the
          Gospels with that sort of attention which a writer would employ who
          regarded them as the depositaries of the religion which he attacked.
          Besides these specifications, there exists, in the writings of ancient
          Christians, general evidence that the places of Scripture upon which
          Porphyry had remarked were very numerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some of the above-cited examples, Porphyry, speaking of Saint
          Matthew, calls him your Evangelist; he also uses the term evangelists
          in the plural number. What was said of Celsus is true likewise of
          Porphyry, that it does not appear that he considered any history of
          Christ except these as having authority with Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. A third great writer against the Christian religion was the
          emperor
        </p>

          Julian, whose work was composed about a century after that of
          Porphyry.
        </p>
        <p>
          In various long extracts, transcribed from this work by Cyril and
          Jerome, it appears, (Jewish and Heathen Test. vol. iv. p. 77, et seq.)
          that Julian noticed by name Matthew and Luke, in the difference
          between their genealogies of Christ that he objected to Matthew&#x27;s
          application of the prophecy, &quot;Out of Egypt have I called my
          son&quot; (ii. 15), and to that of &quot;A virgin shall conceive&quot;
          (i. 23); that he recited sayings of Christ, and various passages of
          his history, in the very words of the evangelists; in particular, that
          Jesus healed lame and blind people, and exorcised demoniacs in the
          villages of Bethsaida and Bethany; that he alleged that none of
          Christ&#x27;s disciples ascribed to him the creation of the world,
          except John; that neither Paul, nor Matthew, nor Luke, nor Mark, have
          dared to call Jesus God; that John wrote later than the other
          evangelists, and at a time when a great number of men in the cities of
          Greece and Italy were converted; that he alludes to the conversion of
          Cornelius and of Sergius Paulus, to Peter&#x27;s vision, to the
          circular letter sent by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, which
          are all recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: by which quoting of the
          four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, and by quoting no other,
          Julian shows that these were the historical books, and the only
          historical books, received by Christians as of authority, and as the
          authentic memoirs of Jesus Christ, of his apostles, and of the
          doctrines taught by them. But Julian&#x27;s testimony does something
          more than represent the judgment of the Christian church in his time.
          It discovers also his own. He himself expressly states the early date
          of these records; he calls them by the names which they now bear. He
          all along supposes, he nowhere attempts to question, their
          genuineness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The argument in favour of the books of the New Testament, drawn from
          the notice taken of their contents by the early writers against the
          religion, is very considerable. It proves that the accounts which
          Christians had then were the accounts which we have now; that our
          present Scriptures were theirs. It proves, moreover, that neither
          Celsus in the second, Porphyry in the third, nor Julian in the fourth
          century, suspected the authenticity of these books, or ever insinuated
          that Christians were mistaken in the authors to whom they ascribed
          them. Not one of them expressed an opinion upon this subject different
          from that which was holden by Christians. And when we consider how
          much it would have availed them to have cast a doubt upon this point,
          if they could; and how ready they showed themselves to be to take
          every advantage in their power; and that they were all men of learning
          and inquiry: their concession, or rather their suffrage, upon the
          subject is extremely valuable.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of Porphyry, it is made still stronger, by the
          consideration that he did in fact support himself by this species of
          objection when he saw any room for it, or when his acuteness could
          supply any pretence for alleging it. The prophecy of Daniel he
          attacked upon this very ground of spuriousness, insisting that it was
          written after the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, and maintains his
          charge of forgery by some far-fetched indeed, but very subtle
          criticisms. Concerning the writings of the New Testament, no trace of
          this suspicion is anywhere to be found in him. (Michaelis&#x27;s
          Introduction to the New Testament, vol. i. p. 43. Marsh&#x27;s
          Translation.)
        </p>
        <h2>SECTION X.</h2>
        <p>
          Formal catalogues of authentic Scriptures were published, in all which
          our present sacred histories were included.
        </p>
        <p>
          This species of evidence comes later than the rest; as it was not
          natural that catalogues of any particular class of books should be put
          forth until Christian writings became numerous; or until some writings
          showed themselves, claiming titles which did not belong to them, and
          thereby rendering it necessary to separate books of authority from
          others. But, when it does appear, it is extremely satisfactory; the
          catalogues, though numerous, and made in countries at a wide distance
          from one another, differing very little, differing in nothing which is
          material, and all containing the four Gospels. To this last article
          there is no exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the writings of Origen which remain, and in some extracts
          preserved by Eusebius, from works of his which are now lost, there are
          enumerations of the books of Scriptures, in which the Four Gospels and
          the Acts of the Apostles are distinctly and honourably specified, and
          in which no books appear beside what are now received. The reader, by
          this time, will easily recollect that the date of Origen&#x27;s works
          is A.D. 230. (Lardner, Cred. vol. iii. p. 234, et seq.; vol. viii. p.
          196.)
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Athanasias, about a century afterwards, delivered a catalogue of
          the books of the New Testament in form, containing our Scriptures and
          no others; of which he says, &quot;In these alone the doctrine of
          Religion is taught; let no man add to them, or take anything from
          them.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. ii. p. 223.)
        </p>
        <p>
          III. About twenty years after Athanasius, Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem,
          set forth a catalogue of the books of Scripture, publicly read at that
          time in the church of Jerusalem, exactly the same as ours, except that
          the &quot;Revelation&quot; is omitted. (Lardner, Cred. vol. ii. p.
          270.)
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And fifteen years after Cyril, the council of Laodicea delivered
          an authoritative catalogue of canonical Scripture, like Cyril&#x27;s,
          the same as ours with the omission of the &quot;Revelation.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Catalogues now became frequent. Within thirty years after the last
          date, that is, from the year 363 to near the conclusion of the fourth
          century, we have catalogues by Epiphanius, (Lardner, Cred. vol. ii. p.
          368.) by Gregory Nazianzen, by Philaster, bishop of Breseia in Italy,
          (Lardner, Cred. vol. ix. p. 132 &amp; 373.) by Amphilochius, bishop of
          Iconium; all, as they are sometimes called, clean catalogues (that is,
          they admit no books into the number beside what we now receive); and
          all, for every purpose of historic evidence, the same as ours.
          (Epiphanius omits the Acts of the Apostles. This must have been an
          accidental mistake, either in him or in some copyist of his work; for
          he elsewhere expressly refers to this book, and ascribes it to Luke.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Within the same period Jerome, the most learned Christian writer
          of his age, delivered a catalogue of the hooks of the New Testament,
          recognising every book now received, with the intimation of a doubt
          concerning the Epistle to the Hebrews alone, and taking not the least
          notice of any book which is not now received. (Lardner, Cred. vol. x.
          p. 77.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Contemporary with Jerome, who lived in Palestine, was St.
          Augustine, in Africa, who published likewise a catalogue, without
          joining to the Scriptures, as books of authority, any other
          ecclesiastical writing whatever, and without omitting one which we at
          this day acknowledge. (Lardner, Cred. vol. x. p. 213.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. And with these concurs another contemporary writer, Rufen,
          presbyter of Aquileia, whose catalogue, like theirs, is perfect and
          unmixed, and concludes with these remarkable words: &quot;These are
          the volumes which the fathers have included in the canon, and out of
          which they would have us prove the doctrine of our faith.&quot;
          (Lardner, Cred. vol. x. p. 187.)
        </p>
        <p>SECTION XI.</p>
        <p>
          These propositions cannot be predicated of any of those books which
          are commonly called Apocryphal Books of the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not know that the objection taken from apocryphal writings is at
          present much relied upon by scholars. But there are many, who, hearing
          that various Gospels existed in ancient times under the names of the
          apostles, may have taken up a notion, that the selection of our
          present Gospels from the rest was rather an arbitrary or accidental
          choice, than founded in any clear and certain cause of preference. To
          these it may be very useful to know the truth of the case. I observe,
          therefore:—
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That, beside our Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, no Christian
          history, claiming to be written by an apostle or apostolical man, is
          quoted within three hundred years after the birth of Christ, by any
          writer now extant or known; or, if quoted, is not quoted but with
          marks of censure and rejection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not advanced this assertion without inquiry; and I doubt not
          but that the passages cited by Mr. Jones and Dr. Lardner, under the
          several titles which the apocryphal books bear; or a reference to the
          places where they are mentioned as collected in a very accurate table,
          published in the year 1773, by the Rev. J. Atkinson, will make out the
          truth of the proposition to the satisfaction of every fair and
          competent judgment. If there be any book which may seem to form an
          exception to the observation, it is a Hebrew Gospel, which was
          circulated under the various titles of, the Gospel according to the
          Hebrews, the Gospel of the Nazarenes, of the Ebionites, sometimes
          called of the Twelve, by some ascribed to St Matthew. This Gospel is
          once, and only once, cited by Clemeus Alexandrinus, who lived, the
          reader will remember, in the latter part of the second century, and
          which same Clement quotes one or other of our four Gospels in almost
          every page of his work. It is also twice mentioned by Origen, A.D.
          230; and both times with marks of diminution and discredit. And this
          is the ground upon which the exception stands. But what is still more
          material to observe is, that this Gospel, in the main, agreed with our
          present Gospel of Saint Matthew. (In applying to this Gospel what
          Jerome in the latter end of the fourth century has mentioned of a
          Hebrew Gospel, I think it probable that we sometimes confound it with
          a Hebrew copy of St. Matthew&#x27;s Gospel, whether an original or
          version, which was then extant.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if, with this account of the apocryphal Gospels, we compare what
          we have read concerning the canonical Scriptures in the preceding
          sections; or even recollect that general but well-founded assertion of
          Dr. Lardner, &quot;That in the remaining works of Irenaeus, Clement of
          Alexandria, and Tertullian, who all lived in the first two centuries,
          there are more and larger quotations of the small volume of the New
          Testament than of all the works of Cicero, by writers of all
          characters, for several ages;&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol. xii. p. 53.)
          and if to this we add that, notwithstanding the loss of many works of
          the primitive times of Christianity, we have, within the
          above-mentioned period, the remains of Christian writers who lived in
          Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, Egypt, the part of Africa that used the
          Latin tongue, in Crete, Greece, Italy, and Gaul, in all which remains
          references are found to our evangelists; I apprehend that we shall
          perceive a clear and broad line of division between those writings and
          all others pretending to similar authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But beside certain histories which assumed the names of apostles,
          and which were forgeries properly so called, there were some other
          Christian writings, in the whole or in part of an historical nature,
          which, though not forgeries, are denominated apocryphal, as being of
          uncertain or of no authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of this second class of writings, I have found only two which are
          noticed by any author of the first three centuries without express
          terms of condemnation: and these are, the one a book entitled the
          Preaching of Peter, quoted repeatedly by Clemens Alexandrinus, A.D.
          196; the other a book entitled the Revelation of Peter, upon which the
          above-mentioned Clemens Alexandrinus is said by Eusebius to have
          written notes; and which is twice cited in a work still extant,
          ascribed to the same author.
        </p>
        <p>
          I conceive, therefore, that the proposition we have before advanced,
          even after it hath been subjected to every exception of every kind
          that can be alleged, separates, by a wide interval, our historical
          Scriptures from all other writings which profess to give an account of
          the same subject.
        </p>
        <p>We may be permitted however to add,—</p>
        <p>
          1. That there is no evidence that any spurious or apocryphal books
          whatever existed in the first century of the Christian era, in which
          century all our historical books are proved to have been extant.
          &quot;There are no quotations of any such books in the apostolical
          fathers, by whom I mean Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Hermas, Ignatius,
          and Polycarp, whose writings reach from about the year of our Lord 70
          to the year 108 (and some of whom have quoted each and every one of
          our historical Scriptures): I say this,&quot; adds Dr. Lardner,
          &quot;because I think it has been proved.&quot; (Lardner, Cred. vol.
          xii. p. 158.)
        </p>
        <p>
          2. These apocryphal writings were not read in the churches of
          Christians;
        </p>
        <p>3. Were not admitted into their volume;</p>
        <p>4. Do not appear in their catalogues;</p>
        <p>5. Were not noticed by their adversaries;</p>
        <p>
          6. Were not alleged by different parties, as of authority in their
          controversies;
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Were not the subjects, amongst them, of commentaries, versions,
          collections, expositions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally; beside the silence of three centuries, or evidence within
          that time of their rejection, they were, with a consent nearly
          universal, reprobated by Christian writers of succeeding ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it be made out by these observations that the books in
          question never obtained any degree of credit and notoriety which can
          place them in competition with our Scriptures; yet it appears from the
          writings of the fourth century, that many such existed in that
          century, and in the century preceding it. It may be difficult at this
          distance of time to account for their origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most probable explication is, that they were in general
          composed with a design of making a profit by the sale. Whatever
          treated of the subject would find purchasers. It was an advantage
          taken of the pious curiosity of unlearned Christians. With a view to
          the same purpose, there were many of them adapted to the particular
          opinions of particular sects, which would naturally promote their
          circulation amongst the favourers of those opinions. After all, they
          were probably much more obscure than we imagine. Except the Gospel
          according to the Hebrews, there is none of which we hear more than the
          Gospel of the Egyptians; yet there is good reason to believe that
          Clement, a presbyter of Alexandria in Egypt, A.D. 184, and a man of
          almost universal reading, had never seen it. (Jones, vol. i. p. 243.)
          A Gospel according to Peter was another of the most ancient books of
          this kind; yet Serapion, bishop of Antioch, A.D. 200, had not read it,
          when he heard of such a book being in the hands of the Christians of
          Rhossus in Cillcia; and speaks of obtaining a sight of this Gospel
          from some sectaries who used it. (Lardner, Cred. vol. ii. p. 557.)
          Even of the Gospel of the Hebrews, which confessedly stands at the
          head of the catalogue, Jerome, at the end of the fourth century, was
          glad to procure a copy by the favour of the Nazarenes of Berea.
          Nothing of this sort ever happened, or could have happened, concerning
          our Gospels.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing is observable of all the apocryphal Christian writings, viz.
          that they proceed upon the same fundamental history of Christ and his
          apostles as that which is disclosed in our Scriptures. The mission of
          Christ, his power of working miracles, his communication of that power
          to the apostles, his passion, death, and resurrection, are assumed or
          asserted by every one of them. The names under which some of them came
          forth are the names of men of eminence in our histories. What these
          books give are not contradictions, but unauthorised additions. The
          principal facts are supposed, the principal agents the same; which
          shows that these points were too much fixed to be altered or disputed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there be any book of this description which appears to have imposed
          upon some considerable number of learned Christians, it is the
          Sibylline oracles; but when we reflect upon the circumstances which
          facilitated that imposture, we shall cease to wonder either at the
          attempt or its success. It was at that time universally understood
          that such a prophetic writing existed. Its contents were kept secret.
          This situation afforded to some one a hint, as well as an opportunity,
          to give out a writing under this name, favourable to the already
          established persuasion of Christians, and which writing, by the aid
          and recommendation of these circumstances, would in some degree, it is
          probable, be received. Of the ancient forgery we know but little; what
          is now produced could not, in my opinion, have imposed upon any one.
          It is nothing else than the Gospel history woven into verse; perhaps
          was at first rather a fiction than a forgery; an exercise of
          ingenuity, more than an attempt to deceive.
