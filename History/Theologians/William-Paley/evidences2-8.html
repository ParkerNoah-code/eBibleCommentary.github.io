        <h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
        <p>OF THE HISTORY OF THE RESURRECTION.</p>
        <p>
          The history of the resurrection of Christ is a part of the evidence of
          Christianity: but I do not know whether the proper strength of this
          passage of the Christian history, or wherein its peculiar value, as a
          head of evidence, consists, be generally understood. It is not that,
          as a miracle, the resurrection ought to be accounted a more decisive
          proof of supernatural agency than other miracles are; it is not that,
          as it stands in the Gospels, it is better attested than some others;
          it is not, for either of these reasons, that more weight belongs to it
          than to other miracles, but for the following, viz., That it is
          completely certain that the apostles of Christ, and the first teachers
          of Christianity, asserted the fact. And this would have been certain,
          if the four Gospels had been lost, or never written. Every piece of
          Scripture recognizes the resurrection. Every epistle of every apostle,
          every author contemporary with the apostles, of the age immediately
          succeeding the apostles, every writing from that age to the present
          genuine or spurious, on the side of Christianity or against it, concur
          in representing the resurrection of Christ as an article of his
          history, received without doubt or disagreement by all who called
          themselves Christians, as alleged from the beginning by the
          propagators of the institution, and alleged as the centre of their
          testimony. Nothing, I apprehend, which a man does not himself see or
          hear can be more certain to him than this point. I do not mean that
          nothing can be more certain than that Christ rose from the dead; but
          that nothing can be more certain than that his apostles, and the first
          teachers of Christianity, gave out that he did so. In the other parts
          of the Gospel narrative, a question may be made, whether the things
          related of Christ be the very things which the apostles and first
          teachers of the religion delivered concerning him? And this question
          depends a good deal upon the evidence we possess of the genuineness,
          or rather perhaps of the antiquity, credit, and reception of the
          books. On the subject of the resurrection, no such discussion is
          necessary, because no such doubt can be entertained. The only points
          which can enter into our consideration are, whether the apostles
          knowingly published a falsehood, or whether they were themselves
          deceived; whether either of these suppositions be possible. The first,
          I think, is pretty generally given up. The nature of the undertaking,
          and of the men; the extreme unlikelihood that such men should engage
          in such a measure as a scheme; their personal toils, and dangers and
          sufferings in the cause; their appropriation of their whole time to
          the object; the warm and seemingly unaffected zeal and earnestness
          with which they profess their sincerity exempt their memory from the
          suspicion of imposture. The solution more deserving of notice is that
          which would resolve the conduct of the apostles into enthusiasm; which
          would class the evidence of Christ&#x27;s resurrection with the
          numerous stories that are extant of the apparitions of dead men. There
          are circumstances in the narrative, as it is preserved in our
          histories, which destroy this comparison entirely. It was not one
          person but many, who saw him; they saw him not only separately but
          together, not only by night but by day, not at a distance but near,
          not once but several times; they not only saw him, but touched him,
          conversed with him, ate with him, examined his person to satisfy their
          doubts. These particulars are decisive: but they stand, I do admit,
          upon the credit of our records. I would answer, therefore, the
          insinuation of enthusiasm, by a circumstance which arises out of the
          nature of the thing; and the reality of which must be confessed by all
          who allow, what I believe is not denied, that the resurrection of
          Christ, whether true or false, was asserted by his disciples from the
          beginning; and that circumstance is, the non-production of the dead
          body. It is related in the history, what indeed the story of the
          resurrection necessarily implies, that the corpse was missing out of
          the sepulchre: it is related also in the history, that the Jews
          reported that the followers of Christ had stolen it away.* And this
          account, though loaded with great improbabilities, such as the
          situation of the disciples, their fears for their own safety at the
          time, the unlikelihood of their expecting to succeed, the difficulty
          of actual success,+ and the inevitable consequence of detection and
          failure, was, nevertheless, the most credible account that could be
          given of the matter. But it proceeds entirely upon the supposition of
          fraud, as all the old objections did. What account can be given of the
          body, upon the supposition of enthusiasm? It is impossible our
          Lord&#x27;s followers could believe that he was risen from the dead,
          if his corpse was lying before them. No enthusiasm ever reached to
          such a pitch of extravagancy as that: a spirit may be an illusion; a
          body is a real thing, an object of sense, in which there can be no
          mistake. All accounts of spectres leave the body in the grave. And
          although the body of Christ might be removed by fraud, and for the
          purposes of fraud, yet without any such intention, and by sincere but
          deluded men (which is the representation of the apostolic character we
          are now examining), no such attempt could be made. The presence and
          the absence of the dead body are alike inconsistent with the
          hypothesis of enthusiasm: for if present, it must have cured their
          enthusiasm at once; if absent, fraud, not enthusiasm, must have
          carried it away.

          * &quot;And this saying,&quot; Saint Matthew writes, &quot;is commonly
          reported amongst the Jews until this day&quot; (chap. xxviii. 15). The
          evangelist may be thought good authority as to this point, even by
          those who do not admit his evidence in every other point: and this
          point is sufficient to prove that the body was missing. It has been
          rightly, I think, observed by Dr. Townshend (Dis. upon the Res. p.
          126), that the story of the guards carried collusion upon the face of
          it:â€”&quot;His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we
          slept.&quot; Men in their circumstances would not have made such an
          acknowledgment of their negligence without previous assurances of
          protection and impunity.

          + &quot;Especially at the full moon, the city full of people, many
          probably passing the whole night, as Jesus and his disciples had done,
          in the open air, the sepulchre so near the city as to be now enclosed
          within the walls.&quot; Priestley on the Resurr. p. 24. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, if we admit, upon the concurrent testimony of all the
          histories, so much of the account as states that the religion of Jesus
          was set up at Jerusalem, and set up with asserting, in the very place
          in which he had been buried, and a few days after he had been buried,
          his resurrection out of the grave, it is evident that, if his body
          could have been found, the Jews would have produced it, as the
          shortest and completest answer possible to the whole story. The
          attempt of the apostles could not have survived this refutation a
          moment. If we also admit, upon the authority of Saint Matthew, that
          the Jews were advertised of the expectation of Christ&#x27;s
          followers, and that they had taken due precaution in consequence of
          this notice, and that the body was in marked and public custody, the
          observation receives more force still. For notwithstanding their
          precaution and although thus prepared and forewarned; when the story
          of the resurrection of Christ came forth, as it immediately did; when
          it was publicly asserted by his disciples, and made the ground and
          basis of their preaching in his name, and collecting followers to his
          religion, the Jews had not the body to produce; but were obliged to
          meet the testimony of the apostles by an answer not containing indeed
          any impossibility in itself, but absolutely inconsistent with the
          supposition of their integrity; that is, in other words, inconsistent
          with the supposition which would resolve their conduct into
          enthusiasm.
