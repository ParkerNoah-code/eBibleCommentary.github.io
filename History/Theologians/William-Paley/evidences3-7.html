        <h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
        <p>THE SUPPOSED EFFECTS OF CHRISTIANITY.</p>
        <p>
          That a religion which under every form in which it is taught holds
          forth the final reward of virtue and punishment of vice, and proposes
          those distinctions of virtue and vice which the wisest and most
          cultivated part of mankind confess to be just, should not be believed,
          is very possible; but that, so far as it is believed, it should not
          produce any good, but rather a bad effect upon public happiness, is a
          proposition which it requires very strong evidence to render credible.
          Yet many have been found to contend for this paradox, and very
          confident appeals have been made to history and to observation for the
          truth of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the conclusions, however, which these writers draw from what they
          call experience, two sources, I think, of mistake may be perceived.
        </p>
        <p>
          One is, that they look for the influence of religion in the wrong
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other, that they charge Christianity with many consequences for
          which it is not responsible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The influence of religion is not to be sought for in the councils
          of princes, in the debates or resolutions of popular assemblies, in
          the conduct of governments towards their subjects, of states and
          sovereigns towards one another; of conquerors at the head of their
          armies, or of parties intriguing for power at home (topics which alone
          almost occupy the attention, and fill the pages of history); but must
          be perceived, if perceived at all, in the silent course of private and
          domestic life. Nay, even there its influence may not be very obvious
          to observation. If it check, in some degree, personal dissoluteness,
          if it beget general probity in the transaction of business, if it
          produce soft and humane manners in the mass of the community, and
          occasional exertions of laborious or expensive benevolence in a
          individuals, it is all the effect which can offer itself to external
          notice. The kingdom of heaven is within us. That which the substance
          of the religion, its hopes and consolation, its intermixture with the
          thoughts by day and by night, the devotion of the heart, the control
          of appetite, the steady direction of will to the commands of God, is
          necessarily invisible. Yet these depend the virtue and the happiness
          of millions. This cause renders the representations of history, with
          respect to religion, defect and fallacious in a greater degree than
          they are upon any other subject. Religion operates most upon those of
          whom history knows the least; upon fathers and mothers their families,
          upon men-servants and maid-servants, upon orderly tradesman, the quiet
          villager, the manufacturer at his loom, the husbandman in his fields.
          Amongst such, its collectively may be of inestimable value, yet its
          effects, in mean time, little upon those who figure upon the stage of
          world. They may know nothing of it; they may believe nothing of it;
          they may be actuated by motives more impetuous than those which
          religion is able to excite. It cannot, be thought strange that this
          influence should elude the grasp and touch of public history; for what
          is public history but register of the successes and disappointments,
          the vices, the follies, and the quarrels, of those who engage in
          contentions power?
        </p>
        <p>
          I will add, that much of this influence may be felt in times of public
          distress, and little of it in times of public wealth and security.
          This also increases the uncertainty of any opinions that we draw from
          historical representations. The influence of Christianity is
          commensurate with no effects which history states. We do not pretend
          that it has any such necessary and irresistible power over the affairs
          of nations as to surmount the force of other causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian religion also acts upon public usages and institutions,
          by an operation which is only secondary and indirect. Christianity is
          not a code of civil law. It can only reach public institutions through
          private character. Now its influence upon private character may be
          considerable, yet many public usages and institutions repugnant to its
          principles may remain. To get rid of these, the reigning part of the
          community must act, and act together. But it may be long before the
          persons who compose this body be sufficiently touched with the
          Christian character to join in the suppression of practices to which
          they and the public have been reconciled by causes which will
          reconcile the human mind to anything, by habit and interest.
          Nevertheless, the effects of Christianity, even in this view, have
          been important. It has mitigated the conduct of war, and the treatment
          of captives. It has softened the administration of despotic, or of
          nominally despotic governments. It has abolished polygamy. It has
          restrained the licentiousness of divorces. It has put an end to the
          exposure of children and the immolation of slaves. It has suppressed
          the combats of gladiators,* and the impurities of religions rites. It
          has banished, if not unnatural vices, at least the toleration of them.
          It has greatly meliorated the condition of the laborious part, that is
          to say, of the mass of every community, by procuring for them a day of
          weekly rest. In all countries in which it is professed it has produced
          numerous establishments for the relief of sickness and poverty; and in
          some, a regular and general provision by law. It has triumphed over
          the slavery established in the Roman empire: it is contending, and I
          trust will one day prevail, against the worse slavery of the West
          Indies.

          * Lipsius affirms (Sat. b. i. c. 12) that the gladiatorial shows
          sometimes cost Europe twenty or thirty thousand lives in a month; and
          that not only the men, but even the women of all ranks were
          passionately fond of these shows. See Bishop Porteus, Sermon XIII.
          _________
        </p>
        <p>
          A Christian writer, (Bardesanes, ap. Euseb. Praep. Evang. vi. 10.) so
          early as in the second century, has testified the resistance which
          Christianity made to wicked and licentious practices though
          established by law and by public usage:â€”&quot;Neither in Parthia do
          the Christians, though Parthians, use polygamy; nor in Persia, though
          Persians, do they marry their own daughters; nor among the Bactri, or
          Galli, do they violate the sanctity of marriage; nor wherever they
          are, do they suffer themselves to be overcome by ill-constituted laws
          and manners.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Socrates did not destroy the idolatry of Athens, or produce the
          slighter revolution in the manners of his country.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the argument to which I recur is, that the benefit of religion,
          being felt chiefly in the obscurity of private stations, necessarily
          escapes the observation of history. From the first general
          notification of Christianity to the present day, there have been in
          every age many millions, whose names were never heard of, made better
          by it, not only in their conduct, but in their disposition; and
          happier, not so much in their external circumstances, as in that which
          is inter praecordia, in that which alone deserves the name of
          happiness, the tranquillity and consolation of their thoughts. It has
          been since its commencement the author of happiness and virtue to
          millions and millions of the human race. Who is there that would not
          wish his son to be a Christian?
        </p>
        <p>
          Christianity also, in every country in which it is professed, hath
          obtained a sensible, although not a complete influence upon the public
          judgment of morals. And this is very important. For without the
          occasional correction which public opinion receives, by referring to
          some fixed standard of morality, no man can foretel into what
          extravagances it might wander. Assassination might become as
          honourable as duelling: unnatural crimes be accounted as venal as
          fornication is wont to be accounted. In this way it is possible that
          many may be kept in order by Christianity who are not themselves
          Christians. They may be guided by the rectitude which it communicates
          to public opinion. Their consciences may suggest their duty truly, and
          they may ascribe these suggestions to a moral sense, or to the native
          capacity of the human intellect, when in fact they are nothing more
          than the public opinion, reflected from their own minds; and opinion,
          in a considerable degree, modified by the lessons of Christianity.
          &quot;Certain it is, and this is a great deal to say, that the
          generality, even of the meanest and most vulgar and ignorant people,
          have truer and worthier notions of God more just and right
          apprehensions concerning his attributes and perfections, a deeper
          sense of the difference of good and evil, a greater regard to moral
          obligations, and to the plain and most necessary duties of life, and a
          more firm and universal expectation of a future state of rewards and
          punishments, than in any heathen country any considerable number of
          men were found to have had.&quot; (Clarke, Ev. Nat. Rel. p. 208. ed.
          v.)
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, the value of Christianity is not to be appreciated by its
          temporal effects. The object of revelation is to influence human
          conduct in this life; but what is gained to happiness by that
          influence can only be estimated by taking in the whole of human
          existence. Then, as hath already been observed, there may be also
          great consequences of Christianity which do not belong to it as a
          revelation. The effects upon human salvation of the mission, of the
          death, of the present, of the future agency of Christ, may be
          universal, though the religion be not universally known.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I assert that Christianity is charged with many consequences
          for which it is not responsible. I believe that religious motives have
          had no more to do in the formation of nine tenths of the intolerant
          and persecuting laws which in different countries have been
          established upon the subject of religion, than they have had to do in
          England with the making of the game-laws. These measures, although
          they have the Christian religion for their subject, are resolvable
          into a principle which Christianity certainly did not plant (and which
          Christianity could not universally condemn, because it is not
          universally wrong), which principle is no other than this, that they
          who are in possession of power do what they can to keep it.
          Christianity is answerable for no part of the mischief which has been
          brought upon the world by persecution, except that which has arisen
          from conscientious persecutors. Now these perhaps have never been
          either numerous or powerful. Nor is it to Christianity that even their
          mistake can fairly be imputed. They have been misled by an error not
          properly Christian or religious, but by an error in their moral
          philosophy. They pursued the particular, without adverting to the
          general consequence. Believing certain articles of faith, or a certain
          mode of worship, to be highly conducive, or perhaps essential, to
          salvation, they thought themselves bound to bring all they could, by
          every means, into them, and this they thought, without considering
          what would be the effect of such a conclusion when adopted amongst
          mankind as a general rule of conduct. Had there been in the New
          Testament, what there are in the Koran, precepts authorising coercion
          in the propagation of the religion, and the use of violence towards
          unbelievers, the case would have been different. This distinction
          could not have been taken, nor this defence made.
        </p>
        <p>
          I apologise for no species nor degree of persecution, but I think that
          even the fact has been exaggerated. The slave-trade destroys more in a
          year than the Inquisition does in a hundred or perhaps hath done since
          its foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be objected, as I apprehend it will be, that Christianity is
          chargeable with every mischief of which it has been the occasion,
          though not the motive; I answer that, if the malevolent passions be
          there, the world will never want occasions. The noxious element will
          always find a conductor. Any point will produce an explosion. Did the
          applauded intercommunity of the pagan theology preserve the peace of
          the Roman world? did it prevent oppressions, proscriptions, massacres,
          devastation? Was it bigotry that carried Alexander into the East, or
          brought Caesar into Gaul? Are the nations of the world into which
          Christianity hath not found its way, or from which it hath been
          banished, free from contentions? Are their contentions less ruinous
          and sanguinary? Is it owing to Christianity, or to the want of it,
          that the regions of the East, the countries inter quatuor maria,
          peninsula of Greece, together with a great part of the Mediterranean
          coast, are at this day a desert? or that the banks of the Nile, whose
          constantly renewed fertility is not to be impaired by neglect, or
          destroyed by the ravages of war, serve only for the scene of a
          ferocious anarchy, or the supply of unceasing hostilities? Europe
          itself has known no religious wars for some centuries, yet has hardly
          ever been without war. Are the calamities which at this day afflict it
          to be imputed to Christianity? Hath Poland fallen by a Christian
          crusade? Hath the overthrow in France of civil order and security been
          effected by the votaries of our religion, or by the foes? Amongst the
          awful lessons which the crimes and the miseries of that country afford
          to mankind this is one; that in order to be a persecutor it is not
          necessary to be a bigot: that in rage and cruelty, in mischief and
          destruction, fanaticism itself can be outdone by infidelity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, if war, as it is now carried on between nations produce less
          misery and ruin than formerly, we are indebted perhaps to Christianity
          for the change more than to any other cause. Viewed therefore even in
          its relation to this subject, it appears to have been of advantage to
          the world. It hath humanised the conduct of wars; it hath ceased to
          excite them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The differences of opinion that have in all ages prevailed amongst
          Christians fall very much within the alternative which has been
          stated. If we possessed the disposition which Christianity labours,
          above all other qualities, to inculcate, these differences would do
          little harm. If that disposition be wanting, other causes, even were
          these absent, would continually rise up to call forth the malevolent
          passions into action. Differences of opinion, when accompanied with
          mutual charity, which Christianity forbids them to violate, are for
          the most part innocent, and for some purposes useful. They promote
          inquiry, discussion, and knowledge. They help to keep up an attention
          to religious subjects, and a concern about them, which might be apt to
          die away in the calm and silence of universal agreement. I do not know
          that it is in any degree true that the influence of religion is the
          greatest where there are the fewest dissenters.
