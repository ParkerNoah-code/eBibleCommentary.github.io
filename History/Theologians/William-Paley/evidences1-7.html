        <h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
        <p>
          There is satisfactory evidence that many, professing to be original
          witnesses of the Christian miracles, passed their lives in labours,
          dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation of the
          accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of their
          belief of those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the same
          motives, to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          It being then once proved, that the first propagators of the Christian
          institution did exert activity, and subject themselves to great
          dangers and sufferings, in consequence and for the sake of an
          extraordinary and, I think, we may say, of a miraculous story of some
          kind or other; the next great question is, whether the account, which
          our Scriptures contain, be that story; that which these men delivered,
          and for which they acted and suffered as they did? This question is,
          in effect, no other than whether the story which Christians have now
          be the story which Christians had then? And of this the following
          proofs may be deduced from general considerations, and from
          considerations prior to any inquiry into the particular reasons and
          testimonies by which the authority of our histories is supported.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, there exists no trace or vestige of any other
          story. It is not, like the death of Cyrus the Great, a competition
          between opposite accounts, or between the credit of different
          historians. There is not a document, or scrap of account, either
          contemporary with the commencement of Christianity, or extant within
          many ages afar that commencement, which assigns a history
          substantially different from ours. The remote, brief, and incidental
          notices of the affair which are found in heathen writers, so far as
          they do go, go along with us. They bear testimony to these facts—that
          the institution originated from Jesus; that the Founder was put to
          death, as a malefactor, at Jerusalem, by the authority of the Roman
          governor, Pontius Pilate; that the religion nevertheless spread in
          that city, and throughout Judea; and that it was propagated thence to
          distant countries; that the converts were numerous; that they suffered
          great hardships and injuries for their profession; and that all this
          took place in the age of the world which our books have assigned. They
          go on, further, to describe the manners of Christians in terms
          perfectly conformable to the accounts extant in our books; that they
          were wont to assemble on a certain day; that they sang hymns to Christ
          as to a God; that they bound themselves by an oath not to commit any
          crime, but to abstain from theft and adultery, to adhere strictly to
          their promises, and not to deny money deposited in their hands;* that
          they worshipped him who was crucified in Palestine; that this their
          first lawgiver had taught them that they were all brethren; that they
          had a great contempt for the things of this world, and looked upon
          them as common; that they flew to one another&#x27;s relief; that they
          cherished strong hopes of immortality; that they despised death, and
          surrendered themselves to sufferings.+
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * See Pliny&#x27;s Letter—Bonnet, in his lively way of expressing
          himself, says,—&quot;Comparing Pliny&#x27;s Letter with the account of
          the Acts, it seems to me that I had not taken up another author, but
          that I was still reading the historian of that extraordinary
          society.&quot; This is strong; but there is undoubtedly an affinity,
          and all the affinity that could be expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          + &quot;It is incredible, what expedition they use when any of their
          friends are known to be in trouble. In a word, they spare nothing upon
          such an occasion;—for these miserable men have no doubt they shall be
          immortal and live for ever; therefore they contemn death, and many
          surrender themselves to sufferings. Moreover, their first lawgiver has
          taught them that they are all brethren, when once they have turned and
          renounced the gods of the Greeks, and worship this Master of theirs
          who was crucified, and engage to live according to his laws. They have
          also a sovereign contempt for all the things of this world, and look
          upon them as common.&quot; Lucian, de Morte Peregrini, t. i. p. 565,
          ed. Graev. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the account of writers who viewed the subject at a great
          distance; who were uninformed and uninterested about it. It bears the
          characters of such an account upon the face of it, because it
          describes effects, namely the appearance in the world of a new
          religion, and the conversion of great multitudes to it, without
          descending, in the smallest degree, to the detail of the transaction
          upon which it was founded, the interior of the institution, the
          evidence or arguments offered by those who drew over others to it. Yet
          still here is no contradiction of our story; no other or different
          story set up against it: but so far a confirmation of it as that, in
          the general points on which the heathen account touches, it agrees
          with that which we find in our own books.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same may be observed of the very few Jewish writers of that and
          the adjoining period, which have come down to us. Whatever they omit,
          or whatever difficulties we may find in explaining the omission, they
          advance no other history of the transaction than that which we
          acknowledge. Josephus, who wrote his Antiquities, or History of the
          Jews, about sixty years after the commencement of Christianity, in a
          passage generally admitted as genuine, makes mention of John under the
          name of John the Baptist; that he was a preacher of virtue; that he
          baptized his proselytes; that he was well received by the people; that
          he was imprisoned and put to death by Herod; and that Herod lived in a
          criminal cohabitation with Herodias, his brother&#x27;s wife. (Antiq.
          I. xviii. cap. v. sect. 1, 2.) In another passage allowed by many,
          although not without considerable question being moved about it, we
          hear of &quot;James, the brother of him who was called Jesus, and of
          his being put to death.&quot; (Antiq. I. xx. cap. ix. sect. 1.) In a
          third passage, extant in every copy that remains of Josephus&#x27;s
          history, but the authenticity of which has nevertheless been long
          disputed, we have an explicit testimony to the substance of our
          history in these words:—&quot;At that time lived Jesus, a wise man, if
          he may be called a man, for he performed many wonderful works. He was
          a teacher of such men as received the truth with pleasure. He drew
          over to him many Jews and Gentiles. This was the Christ; and when
          Pilate, at the instigation of the chief men among us had condemned him
          to the cross, they who before had conceived an affection for him did
          not cease to adhere to him; for, on the third day, he appeared to them
          alive again, the divine prophets having foretold these and many
          wonderful things concerning him. And the sect of the Christians, so
          called from him, subsists to this time.&quot; (Antiq. I. xviii. cap.
          iii. sect 3.) Whatever become of the controversy concerning the
          genuineness of this passage; whether Josephus go the whole length of
          our history, which, if the passage be sincere, he does; or whether he
          proceed only a very little way with us, which, if the passage be
          rejected, we confess to be the case; still what we asserted is true,
          that he gives no other or different history of the subject from ours,
          no other or different account of the origin of the institution. And I
          think also that it may with great reason be contended, either that the
          passage is genuine, or that the silence of Josephus was designed. For,
          although we should lay aside the authority of our own books entirely,
          yet when Tacitus, who wrote not twenty, perhaps not ten, years after
          Josephus, in his account of a period in which Josephus was nearly
          thirty years of age, tells us, that a vast multitude of Christians
          were condemned at Rome; that they derived their denomination from
          Christ, who, in the reign of Tiberius, was put to death, as a
          criminal, by the procurator, Pontius Pilate; that the superstition had
          spread not only over Judea, the source of the evil but it had reached
          Rome also:—when Suetonius, an historian contemporary with Tacitus,
          relates that, in the time of Claudius, the Jews were making
          disturbances at Rome, Christus being their leader: and that, during
          the reign of Nero, the Christians were punished; under both which
          emperors Josephus lived: when Pliny, who wrote his celebrated epistle
          not more than thirty years after the publication of Josephus&#x27;s
          history, found the Christians in such numbers in the province of
          Bithynia as to draw from him a complaint that the contagion had seized
          cities, towns, and villages, and had so seized them as to produce a
          general desertion of the public rites; and when, as has already been
          observed, there is no reason for imagining that the Christians were
          more numerous in Bithynia than in many other parts of the Roman
          empire; it cannot, I should suppose, after this, be believed, that the
          religion, and the transaction upon which it was founded, were too
          obscure to engage the attention of Josephus, or to obtain a place in
          his history. Perhaps he did not know how to represent the business,
          and disposed of his difficulties by passing it over in silence.
          Eusebius wrote the life of Constantine, yet omits entirely the most
          remarkable circumstance in that life, the death of his son Crispus;
          undoubtedly for the reason here given. The reserve of Josephus upon
          the subject of Christianity appears also in his passing over the
          banishment of the Jews by Claudius, which Suetonius, we have seen, has
          recorded with an express reference to Christ. This is at least as
          remarkable as his silence about the infants of Bethlehem.* Be,
          however, the fact, or the cause of the omission in Josephus,+ what it
          may, no other or different history on the subject has been given by
          him, or is pretended to have been given.

          * Michaelis has computed, and, as it should seem, fairly enough; that
          probably not more than twenty children perished by this cruel
          precaution. Michaelis&#x27;s Introduction to the New Testament,
          translated by Marsh; vol. i. c. ii. sect. 11.

          + There is no notice taken of Christianity in the Mishna, a collection
          of Jewish traditions compiled about the year 180; although it contains
          a Tract &quot;De cultu peregrino,&quot; of strange or idolatrous
          worship; yet it cannot be disputed but that Christianity was perfectly
          well known in the world at this time. There is extremely little notice
          of the subject in the Jerusalem Talmud, compiled about the year 300,
          and not much more in the Babylonish Talmud, of the year 500; although
          both these works are of a religions nature, and although, when the
          first was compiled, Christianity was on the point of becoming the
          religion of the state, and, when the latter was published, had been so
          for 200 years. _________

          But further; the whole series of Christian writers, from the first age
          of the institution down to the present, in their discussions,
          apologies, arguments, and controversies, proceed upon the general
          story which our Scriptures contain, and upon no other. The main facts,
          the principal agents, are alike in all. This argument will appear to
          be of great force, when it is known that we are able to trace back the
          series of writers to a contact with the historical books of the New
          Testament, and to the age of the first emissaries of the religion, and
          to deduce it, by an unbroken continuation, from that end of the train
          to the present.

          The remaining letters of the apostles, (and what more original than
          their letters can we have?) though written without the remotest design
          of transmitting the history of Christ, or of Christianity, to future
          ages, or even of making it known to their contemporaries, incidentally
          disclose to us the following circumstances:—Christ&#x27;s descent and
          family; his innocence; the meekness and gentleness of his character (a
          recognition which goes to the whole Gospel history); his exalted
          nature; his circumcision; his transfiguration; his life of opposition
          and suffering; his patience and resignation; the appointment of the
          Eucharist, and the manner of it; his agony; his confession before
          Pontius Pilate; his stripes, crucifixion, and burial; his
          resurrection; his appearance after it, first to Peter, then to the
          rest of the apostles; his ascension into heaven; and his designation
          to be the future judge of mankind; the stated residence of the
          apostles at Jerusalem; the working of miracles by the first preachers
          of the Gospel, who were also the hearers of Christ;* the successful
          propagation of the religion; the persecution of its followers; the
          miraculous conversion of Paul; miracles wrought by himself, and
          alleged in his controversies with his adversaries, and in letters to
          the persons amongst whom they were wrought; finally, that MIRACLES
          were the signs of an apostle.+
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Heb. ii. 3. &quot;How shall we escape, if we neglect so great
          salvation, which, at the first, began to be spoken by the Lord, and
          was confirmed unto us by them that heard him, God also be bearing them
          witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and
          gifts of the Holy Ghost?&quot; I allege this epistle without
          hesitation; for, whatever doubts may have been raised about its
          author, there can be none concerning the age in which it was written.
          No epistle in the collection carries about it more indubitable marks
          of antiquity than this does. It speaks for instance, throughout, of
          the temple as then standing and of the worship of the temple as then
          subsisting.—Heb. viii. 4: &quot;For, if he were on earth, he should
          not be a priest, seeing there are priests that offer according to the
          law.&quot;—Again, Heb. xiii. 10: &quot;We have an altar whereof they
          have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          + Truly the signs of as apostle were wraught among you in all
          patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.&#x27; 2 Cor. xii.

        </p>
        <p>
          In an epistle bearing the name of Barnabas, the companion of Paul,
          probably genuine, certainly belonging to that age, we have the
          sufferings of Christ, his choice of apostles and their number, his
          passion, the scarlet robe, the vinegar and gall, the mocking and
          piercing, the casting lots for his coat, (Ep. Bar. c. vii.) his
          resurrection on the eighth, (i. e. the first day of the week,[Ep. Bar.
          c. vi.]) and the commemorative distinction of that day, his
          manifestation after his resurrection, and, lastly, his ascension. We
          have also his miracles generally but positively referred to in the
          following words:—&quot;Finally, teaching the people of Israel, and
          doing many wonders and signs among them, he preached to them, and
          showed the exceeding great love which he bare towards them.&quot; (Ep.
          Bar. c. v.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In an epistle of Clement, a hearer of St. Paul, although written for a
          purpose remotely connected with the Christian history, we have the
          resurrection of Christ, and the subsequent mission of the apostles,
          recorded in these satisfactory terms: &quot;The apostles have preached
          to us from our Lord Jesus Christ from God:—For, having received their
          command, and being thoroughly assured by the resurrection of our Lord
          Jesus Christ, they went abroad, publishing that the kingdom of God was
          at hand.&quot; (Ep. Clem. Rom. c. xlii.) We find noticed, also, the
          humility, yet the power of Christ, (Ep. Clem. Rom. c. xvi.) his
          descent from Abraham—his crucifixion. We have Peter and Paul
          represented as faithful and righteous pillars of the church; the
          numerous sufferings of Peter; the bonds, stripes, and stoning of Paul,
          and more particularly his extensive and unwearied travels.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an epistle of Polycarp, a disciple of St. John, though only a brief
          hortatory letter, we have the humility, patience, sufferings,
          resurrection, and ascension of Christ, together with the apostolic
          character of St. Paul, distinctly recognised. (Pol. Ep. Ad Phil. C. v.
          viii. ii. iii.) Of this same father we are also assured, by Irenaeus,
          that he (Irenaeus) had heard him relate, &quot;what he had received
          from eye-witnesses concerning the Lord, both concerning his miracles
          and his doctrine.&quot; (Ir. ad Flor. 1 ap. Euseb. l. v. c. 20.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In the remaining works of Ignatius, the contemporary of Polycarp,
          larger than those of Polycarp, (yet, like those of Polycarp, treating
          of subjects in nowise leading to any recital of the Christian
          history,) the occasional allusions are proportionably more numerous.
          The descent of Christ from David, his mother Mary, his miraculous
          conception, the star at his birth, his baptism by John, the reason
          assigned for it, his appeal to the prophets, the ointment poured on
          his head, his sufferings under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch,
          his resurrection, the Lord&#x27;s day called and kept in commemoration
          of it, and the Eucharist, in both its Parts,—are unequivocally
          referred to. Upon the resurrection, this writer is even
          circumstantial. He mentions the apostles&#x27; eating and drinking
          with Christ after he had risen, their feeling and their handling him;
          from which last circumstance Ignatius raises this just
          reflection;—&quot;They believed, being convinced both by his flesh and
          spirit; for this cause, they despised death, and were found to be
          above it.&quot; (Ad Smyr. c. iii.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Quadratus, of the same age with Ignatius, has left us the following
          noble testimony:—&quot;The works of our Saviour were always
          conspicuous, for they were real; both those that were healed, and
          those that were raised from the dead; who were seen not only when they
          were healed or raised, but for a long time afterwards; not only whilst
          he dwelled on this earth, but also after his departure, and for a good
          while after it, insomuch that some of them have reached to our
          times.&quot; (Ap. Euseb. H. E. l. iv. c. 3.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Justin Martyr came little more than thirty years after Quadratus. From
          Justin&#x27;s works, which are still extant, might be collected a
          tolerably complete account of Christ&#x27;s life, in all points
          agreeing with that which is delivered in our Scriptures; taken indeed,
          in a great measure, from those Scriptures, but still proving that this
          account, and no other, was the account known and extant in that age.
          The miracles in particular, which form the part of Christ&#x27;s
          history most material to be traced, stand fully and distinctly
          recognised in the following passage:—&quot;He healed those who had
          been blind, and deaf, and lame from their birth; causing, by his word,
          one to leap, another to hear, and a third to see: and, by raising the
          dead, and making them to live, he induced, by his works, the men of
          that age to know him.&quot; (Just. Dial. cum Tryph. p. 288, ed.
          Thirl.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is unnecessary to carry these citations lower, because the history,
          after this time, occurs in ancient Christian writings as familiarly as
          it is wont to do in modern sermons;—occurs always the same in
          substance, and always that which our evangelists represent.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not only true of those writings of Christians which are
          genuine, and of acknowledged authority; but it is, in a great measure,
          true of all their ancient writings which remain; although some of
          these may have been erroneously ascribed to authors to whom they did
          not belong, or may contain false accounts, or may appear to be
          undeserving of credit, or never indeed to have obtained any. Whatever
          fables they have mixed with the narrative, they preserve the material
          parts, the leading facts, as we have them; and, so far as they do
          this, although they be evidence of nothing else, they are evidence
          that these points were fixed, were received and acknowledged by all
          Christians in the ages in which the books were written. At least, it
          may be asserted, that, in the places where we were most likely to meet
          with such things, if such things had existed, no reliques appear of
          any story substantially different from the present, as the cause, or
          as the pretence, of the institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that the original story, the story delivered by the first
          preachers of the institution, should have died away so entirely as to
          have left no record or memorial of its existence, although so many
          records and memorials of the time and transaction remain; and that
          another story should have stepped into its place, and gained exclusive
          possession of the belief of all who professed, themselves disciples of
          the institution, is beyond any example of the corruption of even oral
          tradition, and still less consistent with the experience of written
          history: and this improbability, which is very great, is rendered
          still greater by the reflection, that no such change as the oblivion
          of one story, and the substitution of another, took place in any
          future period of the Christian aera. Christianity hath travelled
          through dark and turbulent ages; nevertheless it came out of the cloud
          and the storm, such, in substance, as it entered in. Many additions
          were made to the primitive history, and these entitled to different
          degrees of credit; many doctrinal errors also were from time to time
          grafted into the public creed; but still the original story remained,
          and remained the same. In all its principal parts, it has been fixed
          from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly: The religious rites and usages that prevailed amongst the
          early disciples of Christianity were such as belonged to, and sprung
          out of, the narrative now in our hands; which accordancy shows, that
          it was the narrative upon which these persons acted, and which they
          had received from their teachers. Our account makes the Founder of the
          religion direct that his disciples should be baptized: we know that
          the first Christians were baptized, Our account makes him direct that
          they should hold religious assemblies: we find that they did hold
          religious assemblies. Our accounts make the apostles assemble upon a
          stated day of the week: we find, and that from information perfectly
          independent of our accounts, that the Christians of the first century
          did observe stated days of assembling. Our histories record the
          institution of the rite which we call the Lord&#x27;s Supper, and a
          command to repeat it in perpetual succession: we find, amongst the
          early Christians, the celebration of this rite universal. And, indeed,
          we find concurring in all the above-mentioned observances, Christian
          societies of many different nations and languages, removed from one
          another by a great distance of place and dissimilitude of situation.
          It is also extremely material to remark, that there is no room for
          insinuating that our books were fabricated with a studious
          accommodation to the usages which obtained at the time they were
          written; that the authors of the books found the usages established,
          and framed the story to account for their original. The Scripture
          accounts, especially of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, are too short and
          cursory, not to say too obscure, and in this view, deficient, to allow
          a place for any such suspicion.*

          * The reader who is conversant in these researches, by comparing the
          short Scripture accounts of the Christian rites above-mentioned with
          the minute and circumstantial directions contained in the pretended
          apostolical constitutions, will see the force of this observation; the
          difference between truth and forgery. _________

        <p>
          Amongst the proofs of the truth of our proposition, viz. That the
          story which we have now is, in substance, the story which the
          Christians had then, or, in other words, that the accounts in our
          Gospels are, as to their principal parts, at least, the accounts which
          the apostles and original teachers of the religion delivered, one
          arises from observing, that it appears by the Gospels themselves that
          the story was public at the time; that the Christian community was
          already in possession of the substance and principal parts of the
          narrative. The Gospels were not the original cause of the Christian
          history being believed, but were themselves among the consequences of
          that belief. This is expressly affirmed by Saint Luke, in his brief,
          but, as I think, very important and instructive
          preface:—&quot;Forasmuch (says the evangelist) as many have taken in
          hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are
          most surely believed amongst us, even as they delivered them unto us,
          which, from the beginning, were eye-witnesses and ministers of the
          word; it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of
          all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most
          excellent Theophilus, that thou mightest know the certainty of those
          things wherein thou hast been instructed.&quot;—This short
          introduction testifies, that the substance of the history which the
          evangelist was about to write was already believed by Christians; that
          it was believed upon the declarations of eye-witnesses and ministers
          of the word; that it formed the account of their religion in which
          Christians were instructed; that the office which the historian
          proposed to himself was to trace each particular to its origin, and to
          fix the certainty of many things which the reader had before heard of.
          In Saint John&#x27;s Gospel the same point appears hence, that there
          are some principal facts to which the historian refers, but which he
          does not relate. A remarkable instance of this kind is the ascension,
          which is not mentioned by St. John in its place, at the conclusion of
          his history, but which is plainly referred to in the following words
          of the sixth chapter; &quot;What and if ye shall see the Son of man
          ascend up where he was before?&quot; (Also John iii. 31; and xvi. 28.)
          And still more positively in the words which Christ, according to our
          evangelist, spoke to Mary after his resurrection, &quot;Touch me not,
          for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go unto my brethren, and
          say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, unto my God
          and your God.&quot; (John xx. 17.) This can only be accounted for by
          the supposition that St. John wrote under a sense of the notoriety of
          Christ&#x27;s ascension, among those by whom his book was likely to be
          read. The same account must also be given of Saint Matthew&#x27;s
          omission of the same important fact. The thing was very well known,
          and it did not occur to the historian that it was necessary to add any
          particulars concerning it. It agrees also with this solution, and with
          no other, that neither Matthew nor John disposes of the person of our
          Lord in any manner whatever. Other intimations in St. John&#x27;s
          Gospel of the then general notoriety of the story are the following:
          His manner of introducing his narrative (ch. i. ver. 15.)—&quot;John
          bare witness of him, and cried, saying&quot; evidently presupposes
          that his readers knew who John was. His rapid parenthetical reference
          to John&#x27;s imprisonment, &quot;for John was not yet cast into
          prison,&quot; (John iii, 24.) could only come from a writer whose mind
          was in the habit of considering John&#x27;s imprisonment as perfectly
          notorious. The description of Andrew by the addition &quot;Simon
          Peter&#x27;s brother,&quot; (John i. 40.) takes it for granted, that
          Simon Peter was well known. His name had not been mentioned before.
          The evangelist&#x27;s noticing the prevailing misconstruction of a
          discourse, (John xxi. 24.) which Christ held with the beloved
          disciple, proves that the characters and the discourse were already
          public. And the observation which these instances afford is of equal
          validity for the purpose of the present argument, whoever were the
          authors of the histories.
        </p>
        <p>
          These four circumstances:—first, the recognition of the account in its
          principal parts by a series of succeeding writers; secondly, the total
          absence of any account of the origin of the religion substantially
          different from ours; thirdly, the early and extensive prevalence of
          rites and institutions, which resulted from our account; fourthly, our
          account bearing in its construction proof that it is an account of
          facts which were known and believed at the time, are sufficient, I
          conceive, to support an assurance, that the story which we have now
          is, in general, the story which Christians had at the beginning. I say
          in general; by which term I mean, that it is the same in its texture,
          and in its principal facts. For instance, I make no doubt, for the
          reasons above stated, but that the resurrection of the Founder of the
          religion was always a part of the Christian story. Nor can a doubt of
          this remain upon the mind of any one who reflects that the
          resurrection is, in some form or other, asserted, referred to, or
          assumed, in every Christian writing, of every description which hath
          come down to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if our evidence stopped here, we should have a strong case to
          offer: for we should have to allege, that in the reign of Tiberius
          Caesar, a certain number of persons set about an attempt of
          establishing a new religion in the world: in the prosecution of which
          purpose, they voluntarily encountered great dangers, undertook great
          labours, sustained great sufferings, all for a miraculous story, which
          they published wherever they came; and that the resurrection of a dead
          man, whom during his life they had followed and accompanied, was a
          constant part of this story. I know nothing in the above statement
          which can, with any appearance of reason, be disputed; and I know
          nothing, in the history of the human species, similar to it.
