        <h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
        <p>ERRONEOUS OPINIONS IMPUTED TO THE APOSTLES.</p>
        <p>
          A species of candour which is shown towards every other book is
          sometimes refused to the Scriptures: and that is, the placing of a
          distinction between judgment and testimony. We do not usually question
          the credit of a writer, by reason of an opinion he may have delivered
          upon subjects unconnected with his evidence: and even upon subjects
          connected with his account, or mixed with it in the same discourse or
          writing, we naturally separate facts from opinions, testimony from
          observation, narrative from argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          To apply this equitable consideration to the Christian records, much
          controversy and much objection has been raised concerning the
          quotations of the Old Testament found in the New; some of which
          quotations, it is said, are applied in a sense and to events
          apparently different from that which they bear, and from those to
          which they belong in the original. It is probable, to my apprehension,
          that many of those quotations were intended by the writers of the New
          Testament as nothing more than accommodations. They quoted passages of
          their Scripture which suited, and fell in with, the occasion before
          them, without always undertaking to assert that the occasion was in
          the view of the author of the words. Such accommodations of passages
          from old authors, from books especially which are in every one&#x27;s
          hands, are common with writers of all countries; but in none, perhaps,
          were more to be expected than in the writings of the Jews, whose
          literature was almost entirely confined to their Scriptures. Those
          prophecies which are alleged with more solemnity, and which are
          accompanied with a precise declaration that they originally respected
          the event then related, are, I think, truly alleged. But were it
          otherwise; is the judgment of the writers of the New Testament, in
          interpreting passages of the Old, or sometimes, perhaps, in receiving
          established interpretations, so connected either with their veracity,
          or with their means of information concerning what was passing in
          their own times, as that a critical mistake, even were it clearly made
          out, should overthrow their historical credit?â€”Does it diminish it?
          Has it anything to do with it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Another error imputed to the first Christians was the expected
          approach of the day of judgment. I would introduce this objection by a
          remark upon what appears to me a somewhat similar example. Our
          Saviour, speaking to Peter of John, said, &quot;If I will that he
          tarry till I come, what is that to thee?&quot;&#x27; (John xxi. 22.)
          These words we find had been so misconstrued, as that a report from
          thence &quot;went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should
          not die.&quot; Suppose that this had come down to us amongst the
          prevailing opinions of the early Christians, and that the particular
          circumstance from which the mistake sprang had been lost (which,
          humanly speaking, was most likely to have been the case), some, at
          this day, would have been ready to regard and quote the error as an
          impeachment of the whole Christian system. Yet with how little justice
          such a conclusion would have been drawn, or rather such a presumption
          taken up, the information which we happen to possess enables us now to
          perceive. To those who think that the Scriptures lead us to believe
          that the early Christians, and even the apostles, expected the
          approach of the day of judgment in their own times, the same
          reflection will occur as that which we have made with respect to the
          more partial, perhaps, and temporary, but still no less ancient, error
          concerning the duration of Saint John&#x27;s life. It was an error, it
          may be likewise said, which would effectually hinder those who
          entertained it from acting the part of impostors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difficulty which attends the subject of the present chapter is
          contained in this question; If we once admit the fallibility of the
          apostolic judgment, where are we to stop, or in what can we rely upon
          it? To which question, as arguing with unbelievers, and as arguing for
          the substantial truth of the Christian history, and for that alone, it
          is competent to the advocate of Christianity to reply, Give me the
          apostles&#x27; testimony, and I do not stand in need of their
          judgment; give me the facts, and I have complete security for every
          conclusion I want.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, although I think that it is competent to the Christian apologist
          to return this answer, I do not think that it is the only answer which
          the objection is capable of receiving. The two following cautions,
          founded, I apprehend, in the most reasonable distinctions, will
          exclude all uncertainty upon this head which can be attended with
          danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, to separate what was the object of the apostolic mission, and
          declared by them to be so, from what was extraneous to it, or only
          incidentally connected with it. Of points clearly extraneous to the
          religion nothing need be said. Of points incidentally connected with
          it something may be added. Demoniacal possession is one of these
          points: concerning the reality of which, as this place will not admit
          the examination, nor even the production of the argument on either
          side of the question, it would be arrogance in me to deliver any
          judgment. And it is unnecessary. For what I am concerned to observe
          is, that even they who think it was a general, but erroneous opinion
          of those times; and that the writers of the New Testament, in common
          with other Jewish writers of that age, fell into the manner of
          speaking and of thinking upon the subject which then universally
          prevailed, need not be alarmed by the concession, as though they had
          anything to fear from it for the truth of Christianity. The doctrine
          was not what Christ brought into the world. It appears in the
          Christian records, incidentally and accidentally, as being the
          subsisting opinion of the age and country in which his ministry was
          exercised. It was no part of the object of his revelation, to regulate
          men&#x27;s opinions concerning the action of spiritual substances upon
          animal bodies. At any rate it is unconnected with testimony. If a dumb
          person was by a word restored to the use of his speech, it signifies
          little to what cause the dumbness was ascribed; and the like of every
          other cure wrought upon these who are said to have been possessed. The
          malady was real, the cure was real, whether the popular explication of
          the cause was well founded or not. The matter of fact, the change, so
          far as it was an object of sense, or of testimony, was in either case
          the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, that, in reading the apostolic writings, we distinguish
          between their doctrines and their arguments. Their doctrines came to
          them by revelation properly so called; yet in propounding these
          doctrines in their writings or discourses they were wont to
          illustrate, support, and enforce them by such analogies, arguments,
          and considerations as their own thoughts suggested. Thus the call of
          the gentiles, that is, the admission of the Gentiles to the Christian
          profession without a previous subjection to the law of Moses, was
          imported to the apostles by revelation, and was attested by the
          miracles which attended the Christian ministry among them. The
          apostles&#x27; own assurance of the matter rested upon this
          foundation. Nevertheless, Saint Paul, when treating of the subject,
          often a great variety of topics in its proof and vindication. The
          doctrine itself must be received: but it is not necessary, in order to
          defend Christianity, to defend the propriety of every comparison, or
          the validity of every argument, which the apostle has brought into the
          discussion. The same observation applies to some other instances, and
          is, in my opinion, very well founded; &quot;When divine writers argue
          upon any point, we are always bound to believe the conclusions that
          their reasonings end in, as parts of divine revelation: but we are not
          bound to be able to make out, or even to assent to all the premises
          made use of by them, in their whole extent, unless it appear plainly,
          that they affirm the premises as expressly as they do the conclusions
          proved by them.&quot; (Burnets Expos. art. 6.)
