        <p>
          PROPOSITION I.<br />
          That there is satisfactory Evidence, that many professing to be
          original Witnesses of the Christian Miracles passed their Lives in
          Labours, Dangers, and Sufferings, voluntarily undergone in Attestation
          of the Accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of
          their Belief of those Accounts; and that they submitted, from the same
          Motives, to new Rules of Conduct.
