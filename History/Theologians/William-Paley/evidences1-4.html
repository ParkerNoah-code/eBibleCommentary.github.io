        <h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
        <p>
          There is satisfactory evidence that many professing to be original
          witnesses of the Christian miracles, passed their lives in labours,
          dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation of the
          accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of their
          belief of those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the same
          motives, to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          The account of the treatment of the religion, and of the exertions of
          its first preachers, as stated in our Scriptures (not in a professed
          history of persecutions, or in the connected manner in which I am
          about to recite it, but dispersedly and occasionally, in the course of
          a mixed general history, which circumstance, alone negatives the
          supposition of any fraudulent design), is the following: &quot;That
          the Founder of Christianity, from the commencement of his ministry to
          the time of his violent death, employed himself wholly in publishing
          the institution in Judea and Galilee; that, in order to assist him in
          this purpose, he made choice, out of the number of his followers, of
          twelve persons, who might accompany him as he travelled from place to
          place; that, except a short absence upon a journey in which he sent
          them two by two to announce his mission, and one of a few days, when
          they went before him to Jerusalem, these persons were steadily and
          constantly attending upon him; that they were with him at Jerusalem
          when he was apprehended and put to death; and that they were
          commissioned by him, when his own ministry was concluded, to publish
          his Gospel, and collect disciples to it from all countries of the
          world.&quot; The account then proceeds to state, &quot;that a few days
          after his departure, these persons, with some of his relations, and
          some who had regularly frequented their society, assembled at
          Jerusalem; that, considering the office of preaching the religion as
          now devolved upon them, and one of their number having deserted the
          cause, and, repenting of his perfidy, having destroyed himself, they
          proceeded to elect another into his place, and that they were careful
          to make their election out of the number of those who had accompanied
          their master from the first to the last, in order, as they alleged,
          that he might be a witness, together with themselves, of the principal
          facts which they were about to produce and relate concerning him; (
          Acts i. 12, 22.) that they began their work at Jerusalem by publicly
          asserting that this Jesus, whom the rulers and inhabitants of that
          place had so lately crucified, was, in truth, the person in whom all
          their prophecies and long expectations terminated; that he had been
          sent amongst them by God; and that he was appointed by God the future
          judge of the human species; that all who were solicitous to secure to
          themselves happiness after death, ought to receive him as such, and to
          make profession of their belief, by being baptised in his name.&quot;
          (Acts xi.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The history goes on to relate, &quot;that considerable numbers
          accepted this proposal, and that they who did so formed amongst
          themselves a strict union and society; (Acts iv. 32.) that the
          attention of the Jewish government being soon drawn upon them, two of
          the principal persons of the twelve, and who also had lived most
          intimately and constantly with the Founder of the religion, were
          seized as they were discoursing to the people in the temple; that
          after being kept all night in prison, they were brought the next day
          before an assembly composed of the chief persons of the Jewish
          magistracy and priesthood; that this assembly, after some
          consultation, found nothing, at that time, better to be done towards
          suppressing the growth of the sect, than to threaten their prisoners
          with punishment if they persisted; that these men, after expressing,
          in decent but firm language, the obligation under which they
          considered themselves to be, to declare what they knew, &#x27;to speak
          the things which they had seen and heard,&#x27; returned from the
          council, and reported what had passed to their companions; that this
          report, whilst it apprized them of the danger of their situation and
          undertaking, had no other effect upon their conduct than to produce in
          them a general resolution to persevere, and an earnest prayer to God
          to furnish them with assistance, and to inspire them with fortitude,
          proportioned to the increasing exigency of the service.&quot; ( Acts
          iv.) A very short time after this, we read &quot;that all the twelve
          apostles were seized and cast into prison; ( Acts v. 18.) that, being
          brought a second time before the Jewish Sanhedrim, they were upbraided
          with their disobedience to the injunction which had been laid upon
          them, and beaten for their contumacy; that, being charged once more to
          desist, they were suffered to depart; that however they neither
          quitted Jerusalem, nor ceased from preaching, both daily in the
          temple, and from house to house (Acts v. 42.) and that the twelve
          considered themselves as so entirely and exclusively devoted to this
          office, that they now transferred what may be called the temporal
          affairs of the society to other hands.&quot;*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * I do not know that it has ever been insinuated that the Christian
          mission, in the hands of the apostles, was a scheme for making a
          fortune, or for getting money. But it may nevertheless be fit to
          remark upon this passage of their history, how perfectly free they
          appear to have been from any pecuniary or interested views whatever.
          The most tempting opportunity which occurred of making gain of their
          converts, was by the custody and management of the public funds, when
          some of the richer members, intending to contribute their fortunes to
          the common support of the society, sold their possessions, and laid
          down the prices at the apostles&#x27; feet. Yet, so insensible or
          undesirous were they of the advantage which that confidence afforded,
          that we find they very soon disposed of the trust, by putting it into
          the hands, not of nominees of their own, but of stewards formally
          elected for the purpose by the society at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may add also, that this excess of generosity, which cast private
          property into the public stock, was so far from being required by the
          apostles, or imposed as a law of Christianity, that Peter reminds
          Ananias that he had been guilty, in his behaviour, of an officious and
          voluntary prevarication; &quot;for whilst,&quot; says he, &quot;thy
          estate remained unsold, was it not thine own? And after it was sold,
          was it not in thine own power?&quot; _________
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitherto the preachers of the new religion seem to have had the common
          people on their side; which is assigned as the reason why the Jewish
          rulers did not, at this time, think it prudent to proceed to greater
          extremities. It was not long, however, before the enemies of the
          institution found means to represent it to the people as tending to
          subvert their law, degrade their lawgiver, and dishonour their temple.
          (Acts vi. 12.) And these insinuations were dispersed with so much
          success as to induce the people to join with their superiors in the
          stoning of a very active member of the new community.
        </p>
        <p>
          The death of this man was the signal of a general persecution, the
          activity of which may be judged of from one anecdote of the
          time:—&quot;As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into
          every house, and taking men and women committed them to prison.&quot;
          (Acts viii. 3.) This persecution raged at Jerusalem with so much fury
          as to drive most of the new converts out of the place,* except the
          twelve apostles. The converts thus &quot;scattered abroad,&quot;
          preached the religion wherever they came; and their preaching was, in
          effect, the preaching of the twelve; for it was so far carried on in
          concert and correspondence with them, that when they heard of the
          success of their emissaries in a particular country, they sent two of
          their number to the place, to complete and confirm the mission.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          *Acts viii. I. &quot;And they were all scattered abroad;&quot; but the
          term &quot;all&quot; is not, I think, to be taken strictly as denoting
          more than the generality; in like manner as in Acts ix. 35: &quot;And
          all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the
          Lord.&quot; _________
        </p>
        <p>
          An event now took place, of great importance in the future history of
          the religion. The persecution which had begun at Jerusalem followed
          the Christians to other cities, ( Acts ix.) in which the authority of
          the Jewish Sanhedrim over those of their own nation was allowed to be
          exercised. A young man, who had signalized himself by his hostility to
          the profession, and had procured a commission from the council at
          Jerusalem to seize any converted Jews whom he might find at Damascus,
          suddenly became a proselyte to the religion which he was going about
          to extirpate. The new convert not only shared, on this extraordinary
          change, the fate of his companions, but brought upon himself a double
          measure of enmity from the party which he had left. The Jews at
          Damascus, on his return to that city, watched the gates night and day,
          with so much diligence, that he escaped from their hands only by being
          let down in a basket by the wall. Nor did he find himself in greater
          safety at Jerusalem, whither he immediately repaired. Attempts were
          there also soon set on foot to destroy him; from the danger of which
          he was preserved by being sent away to Cilicia, his native country.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some reason not mentioned, perhaps not known, but probably
          connected with the civil history of the Jews, or with some danger*
          which engrossed the public attention, an intermission about this time
          took place in the sufferings of the Christians. This happened, at the
          most, only seven or eight, perhaps only three or four years after
          Christ&#x27;s death, within which period, and notwithstanding that the
          late persecution occupied part of it, churches, or societies of
          believers, had been formed in all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria; for we
          read that the churches in these countries &quot;had now rest and were
          edified, and, walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of
          the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.&quot; (Acts ix 31.) The original
          preachers of the religion did not remit their labours or activity
          during this season of quietness; for we find one, and he a very
          principal person among them, passing throughout all quarters. We find
          also those who had been before expelled from Jerusalem by the
          persecution which raged there, travelling as far as Poenice, Cyprus,
          and Antioch; (Acts xi. 19.) and lastly, we find Jerusalem again in the
          centre of the mission, the place whither the preachers returned from
          their several excursions, where they reported the conduct and effects
          of their ministry, where questions of public concern were canvassed
          and settled, whence directions were sought, and teachers sent forth.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Dr. Lardner (in which he is followed also by Dr. Benson) ascribes
          the cessation of the persecution of the Christians to the attempt of
          Caligula to set up his own statue in the temple of Jerusalem, and to
          the consternation thereby excited in the minds of the Jewish people;
          which consternation for a season superseded every other contest.
          _________
        </p>
        <p>
          The time of this tranquillity did not, however, continue long. Herod
          Agrippa, who had lately acceded to the government of Judea,
          &quot;stretched forth his hand to vex certain of the church.&quot;
          (Acts xii. 1.) He began his cruelty by beheading one of the twelve
          original apostles, a kinsman and constant companion of the Founder of
          the religion. Perceiving that this execution gratified the Jews, he
          proceeded to seize, in order to put to death, another of the
          number,—and him, like the former, associated with Christ during his
          life, and eminently active in the service since his death. This man
          was, however, delivered from prison, as the account states
          miraculously, (Acts xii. 3—17.) and made his escape from Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          These things are related, not in the general terms under which, in
          giving the outlines of the history, we have here mentioned them, but
          with the utmost particularity of names, persons, places, and
          circumstances; and, what is deserving of notice, without the smallest
          discoverable propensity in the historian, to magnify the fortitude, or
          exaggerate the sufferings, of his party. When they fled for their
          lives, he tells us. When the churches had rest, he remarks it. When
          the people took their part, he does not leave it without notice. When
          the apostles were carried a second time before the Sanhedrim, he is
          careful to observe that they were brought without violence. When
          milder counsels were suggested, he gives us the author of the advice
          and the speech which contained it. When, in consequence of this
          advice, the rulers contented themselves with threatening the apostles,
          and commanding them to be beaten with stripes, without urging at that
          time the persecution further, the historian candidly and distinctly
          records their forbearance. When, therefore, in other instances, he
          states heavier persecutions, or actual martyrdoms, it is reasonable to
          believe that he states them because they were true, and not from any
          wish to aggravate, in his account, the sufferings which Christians
          sustained, or to extol, more than it deserved, their patience under
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our history now pursues a narrower path. Leaving the rest of the
          apostles, and the original associates of Christ, engaged in the
          propagation of the new faith, (and who there is not the least reason
          to believe abated in their diligence or courage,) the narrative
          proceeds with the separate memoirs of that eminent teacher, whose
          extraordinary and sudden conversion to the religion, and corresponding
          change of conduct, had before been circumstantially described. This
          person, in conjunction with another, who appeared among the earlier
          members of the society at Jerusalem, and amongst the immediate
          adherents of the twelve apostles, (Acts iv. 36.) set out from Antioch
          upon the express business of carrying the new religion through the
          various provinces of the Lesser Asia. (Acts xiii. 2.) During this
          expedition, we find that in almost every place to which they came,
          their persons were insulted, and their lives endangered. After being
          expelled from Antioch in Pisidia, they repaired to Iconium. (Acts
          xiii. 51.) At Iconium, an attempt was made to stone them; at Lystra,
          whither they fled from Iconium, one of them actually was stoned and
          drawn out of the city for dead. (Acts xiv. 19.) These two men, though
          not themselves original apostles, were acting in connection and
          conjunction with the original apostles; for, after the completion of
          their journey, being sent on a particular commission to Jerusalem,
          they there related to the apostles (Acts xv. 12—26.) and elders the
          events and success of their ministry, and were in return recommended
          by them to the churches, &quot;as men who had hazarded their lives in
          the cause.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The treatment which they had experienced in the first progress did not
          deter them from preparing for a second. Upon a dispute, however,
          arising between them, but not connected with the common subject of
          their labours, they acted as wise and sincere men would act; they did
          not retire in disgust from the service in which they were engaged,
          but, each devoting his endeavours to the advancement of the religion,
          they parted from one another, and set forward upon separate routes.
          The history goes along with one of them; and the second enterprise to
          him was attended with the same dangers and persecutions as both had
          met with in the first. The apostle&#x27;s travels hitherto had been
          confined to Asia. He now crosses for the first time the Aegean sea,
          and carries with him, amongst others, the person whose accounts supply
          the information we are stating. (Acts xvi. 11.) The first place in
          Greece at which he appears to have stopped, was Philippi in Macedonia.
          Here himself and one of his companions were cruelly whipped, cast into
          prison, and kept there under the most rigorous custody, being thrust,
          whilst yet smarting with their wounds, into the inner dungeon, and
          their feet made fast in the stocks. (Acts xvi. 23, 24, 33.)
          Notwithstanding this unequivocal specimen of the usage which they had
          to look for in that country, they went forward in the execution of
          their errand. After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they
          came to Thessalonica; in which city the house in which they lodged was
          assailed by a party of their enemies, in order to bring them out to
          the populace. And when, fortunately for their preservation, they were
          not found at home, the master of the house was dragged before the
          magistrate for admitting them within his doors. (Acts xvii. 1—5.)
          Their reception at the next city was something better: but neither had
          they continued long before their turbulent adversaries the Jews,
          excited against them such commotions amongst the inhabitants as
          obliged the apostle to make his escape by a private journey to Athens.
          (Acts xvii. 13.) The extremity of the progress was Corinth. His abode
          in this city, for some time, seems to have been without molestation.
          At length, however, the Jews found means to stir up an insurrection
          against him, and to bring him before the tribunal of the Roman
          president. (Acts xviii. 12.) It was to the contempt which that
          magistrate entertained for the Jews and their controversies, of which
          he accounted Christianity to be one, that our apostle owed his
          deliverance. (Acts xviii. 15.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This indefatigable teacher, after leaving Corinth, returned by Ephesus
          into Syria; and again visited Jerusalem, and the society of Christians
          in that city, which, as hath been repeatedly observed, still continued
          the centre of the mission. (Acts xviii. 22.) It suited not, however,
          with the activity of his zeal to remain long at Jerusalem. We find him
          going thence to Antioch, and, after some stay there, traversing once
          more the northern provinces of Asia Minor. (Acts xviii. 23.) This
          progress ended at Ephesus: in which city, the apostle continued in the
          daily exercise of his ministry two years, and until his success, at
          length, excited the apprehensions of those who were interested in the
          support of the national worship. Their clamour produced a tumult, in
          which he had nearly lost his life. (Acts xix. 1, 9, 10.) Undismayed,
          however, by the dangers to which he saw himself exposed, he was driven
          from Ephesus only to renew his labours in Greece. After passing over
          Macedonia, he thence proceeded to his former station at Corinth. (Acts
          xx. 1, 2.) When he had formed his design of returning by a direct
          course from Corinth into Syria, he was compelled by a conspiracy of
          the Jews, who were prepared to intercept him on his way, to trace back
          his steps through Macedonia to Philippi, and thence to take shipping
          into Asia. Along the coast of Asia, he pursued his voyage with all the
          expedition he could command, in order to reach Jerusalem against the
          feast of Pentecost. (Acts xx. 16.) His reception at Jerusalem was of a
          piece with the usage he had experienced from the Jews in other places.
          He had been only a few days in that city, when the populace,
          instigated by some of his old opponents in Asia, who attended this
          feast, seized him in the temple, forced him out of it, and were ready
          immediately to have destroyed him, had not the sudden presence of the
          Roman guard rescued him out of their hands. (Acts xxi. 27—33.) The
          officer, however, who had thus seasonably interposed, acted from his
          care of the public peace, with the preservation of which he was
          charged, and not from any favour to the apostle, or indeed any
          disposition to exercise either justice or humanity towards him; for he
          had no sooner secured his person in the fortress, than he was
          proceeding to examine him by torture. (Acts xxii 24.)
        </p>
        <p>
          From this time to the conclusion of the history, the apostle remains
          in public custody of the Roman government. After escaping
          assassination by a fortunate discovery of the plot, and delivering
          himself from the influence of his enemies by an appeal to the audience
          of the emperor, (Acts xxv. 9, 11.) he was sent, but not until he had
          suffered two years&#x27; imprisonment, to Rome. (Acts xxiv. 27.) He
          reached Italy after a tedious voyage, and after encountering in his
          passage the perils of a desperate shipwreck. (Acts xxvii.) But
          although still a prisoner, and his fate still depending, neither the
          various and long-continued sufferings which he had undergone, nor the
          danger of his present situation, deterred him from persisting in
          preaching the religion: for the historian closes the account by
          telling us that, for two years, he received all that came unto him in
          his own hired house, where he was permitted to dwell with a soldier
          that guarded him, &quot;preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching
          those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all
          confidence.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the historian, from whom we have drawn this account, in the part
          of his narrative which relates to Saint Paul, is supported by the
          strongest corroborating testimony that a history can receive. We are
          in possession of letters written by Saint Paul himself upon the
          subject of his ministry, and either written during the period which
          the history comprises, or, if written afterwards, reciting and
          referring to the transactions of that period. These letters, without
          borrowing from the history, or the history from them, unintentionally
          confirm the account which the history delivers, in a great variety of
          particulars. What belongs to our present purpose is the description
          exhibited of the apostle&#x27;s sufferings: and the representation,
          given in our history, of the dangers and distresses which he underwent
          not only agrees in general with the language which he himself uses
          whenever he speaks of his life or ministry, but is also, in many
          instances, attested by a specific correspondency of time, place, and
          order of events. If the historian put down in his narrative, that at
          Philippi the apostle &quot;was beaten with many stripes, cast into
          prison, and there treated with rigour and indignity;&quot; (Acts xvi.
          23, 24.) we find him, in a letter to a neighbouring church, (I Thess.
          ii. 2.) reminding his converts that, &quot;after he had suffered
          before, and was shamefully entreated at Philippi, he was bold,
          nevertheless, to speak unto them (to whose city he next came) the
          Gospel of God.&quot; If the history relates that, (Acts xvii. 5.) at
          Thessalonica, the house in which the apostle was lodged, when he first
          came to that place, was assaulted by the populace, and the master of
          it dragged before the magistrate for admitting such a guest within his
          doors; the apostle, in his letter to the Christians of Thessalonica,
          calls to their remembrance &quot;how they had received the Gospel in
          much affliction.&quot; (1 Thess. i. 6.) If the history deliver an
          account of an insurrection at Ephesus, which had nearly cost the
          apostle his life, we have the apostle himself, in a letter written a
          short time after his departure from that city, describing his despair,
          and returning thanks for his deliverance. (Acts xix. 2 Cor. i. 8—10.)
          If the history inform us, that the apostle was expelled from Antioch
          in Pisidia, attempted to be stoned at Iconium, and actually stoned at
          Lystra; there is preserved a letter from him to a favourite convert,
          whom, as the same history tells us, he first met with in these parts;
          in which letter he appeals to that disciple&#x27;s knowledge &quot;of
          the persecutions which befell him at Antioch, at Iconium, at
          Lystra.&quot; (Acts xiii. 50; xiv. 5, 19. 2 Tim. 10, 11.) If the
          history make the apostle, in his speech to the Ephesian elders, remind
          them, as one proof of the disinterestedness of his views, that, to
          their knowledge, he had supplied his own and the necessities of his
          companions by personal labour; (Acts xx. 34.) we find the same
          apostle, in a letter written during his residence at Ephesus,
          asserting of himself, &quot;that even to that hour he laboured,
          working with his own hands.&quot; (1 Cor. iv 11, 12.)
        </p>
        <p>
          These coincidences, together with many relative to other parts of the
          apostle&#x27;s history, and all drawn from independent sources, not
          only confirm the truth of the account, in the particular points as to
          which they are observed, but add much to the credit of the narrative
          in all its parts; and support the author&#x27;s profession of being a
          contemporary of the person whose history he writes, and, throughout a
          material portion of his narrative, a companion.

          What the epistles of the apostles declare of the suffering state of
          Christianity the writings which remain of their companions and
          immediate followers expressly confirm.

          Clement, who is honourably mentioned by Saint Paul in his epistle to
          the Philippians, (Philipp. iv. 3.) hath left us his attestation to
          this point, in the following words: &quot;Let us take (says he) the
          examples of our own age. Through zeal and envy, the most faithful and
          righteous pillars of the church have been persecuted even to the most
          grievous deaths. Let us set before our eyes the holy apostles. Peter,
          by unjust envy, underwent not one or two, but many sufferings; till at
          last, being martyred, he went to the place of glory that was due unto
          him. For the same cause did Paul, in like manner, receive the reward
          of his patience. Seven times he was in bonds; he was whipped, was
          stoned; he preached both in the East and in the West, leaving behind
          him the glorious report of his faith; and so having taught the whole
          world righteousness, and for that end travelled even unto the utmost
          bounds of the West, he at last suffered martyrdom by the command of
          the governors, and departed out of the world, and went unto his holy
          place, being become a most eminent pattern of patience unto all ages.
          To these holy apostles were joined a very great number of others, who,
          having through envy undergone, in like manner, many pains and
          torments, have left a glorious example to us. For this, not only men,
          but women, have been persecuted; and, having suffered very grievous
          and cruel punishments, have finished the course of their faith with
          firmness.&quot; (Clem. ad Cor. c. v. vi. Abp. Wake&#x27;s Trans.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Hermas, saluted by Saint Paul in his epistle to the Romans, in a piece
          very little connected with historical recitals, thus speaks:
          &quot;Such as have believed and suffered death for the name of Christ,
          and have endured with a ready mind, and have given up their lives with
          all their hearts.&quot; (Shepherd of Hermas, c. xxviii.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Polycarp, the disciple of John (though all that remains of his works
          be a very short epistle), has not left this subject unnoticed. &quot;I
          exhort (says he) all of you, that ye obey the word of righteousness,
          and exercise all patience, which ye have seen set forth before your
          eyes, not only in the blessed Ignatius, and Lorimus, and Rufus, but in
          others among yourselves, and in Paul himself and the rest of the
          apostles; being confident in this, that all these have not run in
          vain, but in faith and righteousness; and are gone to the place that
          was due to them from the Lord, with whom also they suffered. For they
          loved not this present world, but him who died, and was raised again
          by God for us.&quot; (Pol. ad Phil c. ix.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignatius, the contemporary of Polycarp, recognises the same topic,
          briefly indeed, but positively and precisely. &quot;For this cause,
          (i. e. having felt and handled Christ&#x27;s body at his resurrection,
          and being convinced, as Ignatius expresses it, both by his flesh and
          spirit,) they (i. e. Peter, and those who were present with Peter at
          Christ&#x27;s appearance) despised death, and were found to be above
          it.&quot; (19. Ep. Smyr. c. iii.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Would the reader know what a persecution in those days was, I would
          refer him to a circular letter, written by the church of Smyrna soon
          after the death of Polycarp, who it will be remembered, had lived with
          Saint John; and which letter is entitled a relation of that
          bishop&#x27;s martyrdom. &quot;The sufferings (say they) of all the
          other martyrs were blessed and generous, which they underwent
          according to the will of God. For so it becomes us, who are more
          religious than others, to ascribe the power and ordering of all things
          unto Him. And, indeed, who can choose but admire the greatness of
          their minds, and that admirable patience and love of their Master,
          which then appeared in them? Who, when they were so flayed with
          whipping that the frame and structure of their bodies were laid open
          to their very inward veins and arteries, nevertheless endured it. In
          like manner, those who were condemned to the beasts, and kept a long
          time in prison, underwent many cruel torments, being forced to lie
          upon sharp spikes laid under their bodies, and tormented with divers
          other sorts of punishments; that so, if it were possible, the tyrant,
          by the length of their sufferings, might have brought them to deny
          Christ.&quot; (Rel. Mor. Pol. c. ii.)
