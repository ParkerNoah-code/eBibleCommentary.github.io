        <h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
        <p>
          THAT THE CHRISTIAN MIRACLES ARE NOT RECITED, OR APPEALED TO, BY EARLY
          CHRISTIAN WRITERS THEMSELVES SO FULLY OR FREQUENTLY AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN
          EXPECTED.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall consider this objection, first, as it applies to the letters
          of the apostles preserved in the New Testament; and secondly, as it
          applies to the remaining writings of other early Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          The epistles of the apostles are either hortatory or argumentative. So
          far as they were occupied in delivering lessons of duty, rules of
          public order, admonitions against certain prevailing corruptions,
          against vice, or any particular species of it, or in fortifying and
          encouraging the constancy of the disciples under the trials to which
          they were exposed, there appears to be no place or occasion for more
          of these references than we actually find.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far as these epistles are argumentative, the nature of the argument
          which they handle accounts for the infrequency of these allusions.
          These epistles were not written to prove the truth of Christianity.
          The subject under consideration was not that which the miracles
          decided, the reality of our Lord&#x27;s mission; but it was that which
          the miracles did not decide, the nature of his person or power, the
          design of his advent, its effects, and of those effects the value,
          kind, and extent. Still I maintain that miraculous evidence lies at
          the bottom of the argument. For nothing could be so preposterous as
          for the disciples of Jesus to dispute amongst themselves, or with
          others, concerning his office or character; unless they believed that
          he had shown, by supernatural proofs, that there was something
          extraordinary in both. Miraculous evidence, therefore, forming not the
          texture of these arguments, but the ground and substratum, if it be
          occasionally discerned, if it be incidentally appealed to, it is
          exactly so much as ought take place, supposing the history to be true.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a further answer to the objection, that the apostolic epistles do
          not contain so frequent, or such direct and circumstantial recitals of
          miracles as might be expected, I would add, that the apostolic
          epistles resemble in this respect the apostolic speeches, which
          speeches are given by a writer who distinctly records numerous
          miracles wrought by these apostles themselves, and by the Founder of
          the institution in their presence; that it is unwarrantable to contend
          that the omission, or infrequency, of such recitals in the speeches of
          the apostles negatives the existence of the miracles, when the
          speeches are given in immediate conjunction with the history of those
          miracles: and that a conclusion which cannot be inferred from the
          speeches without contradicting the whole tenour of the book which
          contains them cannot be inferred from letters, which in this respect
          are similar only to the speeches.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove the similitude which we allege, it may be remarked, that
          although in Saint Luke&#x27;s Gospel the apostle Peter is represented
          to have been present at many decisive miracles wrought by Christ; and
          although the second part of the same history ascribes other decisive
          miracles to Peter himself, particularly the cure of the lame man at
          the gate of the temple (Acts iii. 1), the death of Ananias and
          Sapphira (Acts v. 1), the cure of Aeneas (Acts ix. 34), the
          resurrection of Dorcas (Acts ix. 40); yet out of six speeches of
          Peter, preserved in the Acts, I know but two in which reference is
          made to the miracles wrought by Christ, and only one in which he
          refers to miraculous powers possessed by himself. In his speech upon
          the day of Pentecost, Peter addresses his audience with great
          solemnity thus: &quot;Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of
          Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and wonders,
          and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves
          also know:&quot; (Acts ii. 22.) &amp;c. In his speech upon the
          conversion of Cornelius, he delivers his testimony to the miracles
          performed by Christ in these words: &quot;We are witnesses of all
          things which he did, both in the land of the Jews and in
          Jerusalem.&quot; (Acts x. 39.) But in this latter speech no allusion
          appears to the miracles wrought by himself notwithstanding that the
          miracles above enumerated all preceded the time in which it was
          delivered. In his speech upon the election of Matthias, (Acts i. 15.)
          no distinct reference is made to any of the miracles of Christ&#x27;s
          history except his resurrection. The same also may be observed of his
          speech upon the cure of the lame man at the of the temple; (Acts iii.
          12.) the same in his speech before the Sanhedrim; (Acts iv. 8.) the
          same in his second apology in the presence of that assembly
          Stephen&#x27;s long speech contains no reference whatever to miracles,
          though it be expressly related of him, in the book which preserves the
          speech, and almost immediately before the speech, &quot;that he did
          great wonders and miracles among the people.&quot; (Acts vi. 8.)
          Again, although miracles be expressly attributed to Saint Paul in the
          Acts of the Apostles, first generally, as at Iconium (Acts xiv. 3),
          during the whole tour through the Upper Asia (xiv. 27; xv. 12), at
          Ephesus (xix. 11, 12); secondly, in specific instances, as the
          blindness of Elymas at Paphos, (Acts xiii. 11.) the cure of the
          cripple at Lystra, (Acts xiv. 8.) of the pythoness at Philippi, (Acts
          xvi. 16.) the miraculous liberation from prison in the same city,
          (Acts xvi. 26.) the restoration of Eutychus, (Acts xx. 10.) the
          predictions of his shipwreck, (Acts xxvii. 1.) the viper at Melita,
          the cure of Publius&#x27;s father; (Acts xxvii. 8.) at all which
          miracles, except the first two, the historian himself was present:
          notwithstanding, I say, this positive ascription of miracles to St.
          Paul, yet in the speeches delivered by him, and given as delivered by
          him, in the same book in which the miracles are related, and the
          miraculous powers asserted, the appeals to his own miracles, or indeed
          to any miracles at all, are rare and incidental. In his speech at
          Antioch in Pisidia, (Acts xiii. 16.) there is no allusion but to the
          resurrection. In his discourse at Miletus, (Acts xx. 17.) none to any
          miracle: none in his speech before Felix; (Acts xxiv. 10.) none in his
          speech before Festus; (Acts xxv. 8.) except to Christ&#x27;s
          resurrection and his own conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agreeably hereunto, in thirteen letters ascribed to Saint Paul, we
          have incessant references to Christ&#x27;s resurrection, frequent
          references to his own conversion, three indubitable references to the
          miracles which he wrought; (Gal. iii. 5; Rom. xv. 18, 19; 2 Cor. xii.
          12.) four other references to the same, less direct, yet highly
          probable; (1 Cor. ii. 4,5; Eph. iii. 7; Gal. ii. 8; 1 Thess. i. 8.)
          but more copious or circumstantial recitals we have not. The consent,
          therefore, between Saint Paul&#x27;s speeches and letters is in this
          respect sufficiently exact; and the reason in both is the same,
          namely, that the miraculous history was all along presupposed, and
          that the question which occupied the speaker&#x27;s and the
          writer&#x27;s thoughts was this: whether, allowing the history of
          Jesus to be true, he was, upon the strength of it, to be received as
          the promised Messiah; and, if he was, what were the consequences, what
          was the object and benefit of his mission?
        </p>
        <p>
          The general observation which has been made upon the apostolic
          writings, namely, that the subject of which they treated did not lead
          them to any direct recital of the Christian history, belongs to the
          writings of the apostolic fathers. The epistle of Barnabas is, in its
          subject and general composition, much like the epistle to the Hebrews;
          an allegorical application of divers passages of the Jewish history,
          of their law and ritual, to those parts of the Christian dispensation
          in which the author perceived a resemblance. The epistle of Clement
          was written for the sole purpose of quieting certain dissensions that
          had arisen amongst the members of the church of Corinth, and of
          reviving in their minds that temper and spirit of which their
          predecessors in the Gospel had left them an example. The work of
          Hermas is a vision; quotes neither the Old Testament nor the New, and
          merely falls now and then into the language and the mode of speech
          which the author had read in our Gospels. The epistles of Polycarp and
          Ignatius had for their principal object the order and discipline of
          the churches which they addressed. Yet, under all these circumstances
          of disadvantage, the great points of the Christian history are fully
          recognised. This hath been shown in its proper place. (Vide supra, pp.
          48-51. [Part 1, Chapter 8])
        </p>
        <p>
          There is, however, another class of writers to whom the answer above
          given, viz. the unsuitableness of any such appeals or references as
          the objection demands to the subjects of which the writings treated,
          does not apply; and that is the class of ancient apologists, whose
          declared design it was to defend Christianity, and to give the reasons
          of their adherence to it. It is necessary, therefore, to inquire how
          the matter of the objection stands in these.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most ancient apologist of whose works we have the smallest
          knowledge is Quadratus. Quadratus lived about seventy years after the
          ascension, and presented his apology to the Emperor Adrian. From a
          passage of this work, preserved in Eusebius, it appears that the
          author did directly and formally appeal to the miracles of Christ, and
          in terms as express and confident as we could desire. The passage
          (which has been once already stated) is as follows: &quot;The works of
          our Saviour were always conspicuous, for they were real: both they
          that were healed, and they that were raised from the dead, were seen,
          not only when they were healed or raised, but for a long time
          afterwards; not only whilst he dwelled on this earth, but also after
          his departure, and for a good while after it; insomuch as that some of
          them have reached to our times,&quot; (Euseb. Hist. I. iv. c. 3.)
          Nothing can be more rational or satisfactory than this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Justin Martyr, the next of the Christian apologists, whose work is not
          lost, and who followed Quadratus at the distance of about thirty
          years, has touched upon passages of Christ&#x27;s history in so many
          places, that a tolerably complete account of Christ&#x27;s life might
          be collected out of his works. In the following quotation he asserts
          the performance of miracles by Christ, in words as strong and positive
          as the language possesses: &quot;Christ healed those who from their
          birth were blind, and deaf, and lame; causing, by his word, one to
          leap, another to hear, and a third to see; and having raised the dead,
          and caused them to live, he, by his works, excited attention, and
          induced the men of that age to know him: who, however, seeing these
          things done, said that it was a magical appearance, and dared to call
          him a magician, and a deceiver of the people.&quot; (Just. Dial. p.
          258, ed. Thirlby.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In his first apology, (Apolog. prim. p. 48, ib.) Justin expressly
          assigns the reason for his having recourse to the argument from
          prophecy, rather than alleging the miracles of the Christian history;
          which reason was, that the persons with whom he contended would
          ascribe these miracles to magic; &quot;lest any of our opponents
          should say, What hinders, but that he who is called Christ by us,
          being a man sprung from men, performed the miracles which we attribute
          to him by magical art?&quot; The suggestion of this reason meets, as I
          apprehend, the very point of the present objection; more especially
          when we find Justin followed in it by other writers of that age.
          Irenaeus, who came about forty years after him, notices the same
          evasion in the adversaries of Christianity, and replies to it by the
          same argument: &quot;But if they shall say, that the Lord performed
          these things by an illusory appearance (phantasiodos), leading these
          objectors to the prophecies, we will show from them, that all things
          were thus predicted concerning him, and Strictly came to pass.&quot;
          (Iren. I. ii. c. 57.) Lactantius, who lived a century lower, delivers
          the same sentiment upon the same occasion: &quot;He performed
          miracles;—we might have supposed him to have been a magician, as ye
          say, and as the Jews then supposed, if all the prophets had not with
          one spirit foretold that Christ should perform these very
          things.&quot; (Lactant. v. 3.)
        </p>
        <p>
          But to return to the Christian apologists in their order.
          Tertullian:—&quot;That person whom the Jews had vainly imagined, from
          the meanness of his appearance, to be a mere man, they afterwards, in
          consequence of the power he exerted, considered as a magician, when
          he, with one word, ejected devils out of the bodies of men, gave sight
          to the blind, cleansed the leprous, strengthened the nerves of those
          that had the palsy, and lastly, with one command, restored the dead to
          life; when he, I say, made the very elements obey him, assuaged the
          storms, walked upon the seas, demonstrating himself to be the Word of
          God.&quot; (Tertul. Apolos. p. 20; ed. Priorii, Par. 1675.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Next in the catalogue of professed apologists we may place Origen,
          who, it is well known, published a formal defence of Christianity, in
          answer to Celsus, a heathen, who had written a discourse against it. I
          know no expressions by which a plainer or more positive appeal to the
          Christian miracles can be made, than the expressions used by Origen;
          &quot;Undoubtedly we do think him to be the Christ, and the Son of
          God, because he healed the lame and the blind; and we are the more
          confirmed in this persuasion by what is written in the prophecies:
          &#x27;Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the
          deaf shall hear, and the lame man shall leap as a hart.&#x27; But that
          he also raised the dead, and that it is not a fiction of those who
          wrote the Gospels, is evident from hence, that if it had been a
          fiction, there would have been many recorded to be raised up, and such
          as had been a long time in their graves. But, it not being a fiction,
          few have been recorded: for instance, the daughter of the ruler of a
          synagogue, of whom I do not know why he said, She is not dead, but
          sleepeth, expressing something peculiar to her, not common to all dead
          persons: and the only son of a widow, on whom he had compassion, and
          raised him to life, after he had bid the bearers of the corpse to
          stop; and the third, Lazarus, who had been buried four days.&quot;
          This is positively to assert the miracles of Christ, and it is also to
          comment upon them, and that with a considerable degree of accuracy and
          candour.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another passage of the same author, we meet with the old solution
          of magic applied to the miracles of Christ by the adversaries of the
          religion. &quot;Celsus,&quot; saith Origen, &quot;well knowing what
          great works may be alleged to have been done by Jesus, pretends to
          grant that the things related of him are true; such as healing
          diseases, raising the dead, feeding multitudes with a few leaves, of
          which large fragments were left.&quot; (Orig. cont. Cels. lib. ii.
          sect. 48.) And then Celsus gives, it seems, an answer to these proofs
          of our Lord&#x27;s mission, which, as Origen understood it, resolved
          the phenomena into magic; for Origen begins his reply by observing,
          &quot;You see that Celsus in a manner allows that there is such a
          thing as magic.&quot; (Lardner&#x27;s Jewish and Heath. Test, vol. ii.
          p. 294, ed. 4to.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It appears also from the testimony of St. Jerome, that Porphyry, the
          most learned and able of the heathen writers against Christianity,
          resorted to the same solution: &quot;Unless,&quot; says he, speaking
          to Vigilantius, &quot;according to the manner of the Gentiles and the
          profane, of Porphyry and Eunomius, you pretend that these are the
          tricks of demons.&quot; (Jerome cont. Vigil.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This magic, these demons, this illusory appearance, this comparison
          with the tricks of jugglers, by which many of that age accounted so
          easily for the Christian miracles, and which answers the advocates of
          Christianity often thought it necessary to refute by arguments drawn
          from other topics, and particularly from prophecy (to which, it seems,
          these solutions did not apply), we now perceive to be gross
          subterfuges. That such reasons were ever seriously urged and seriously
          received, is only a proof what a gloss and varnish fashion can give to
          any opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It appears, therefore, that the miracles of Christ, understood as we
          understand them in their literal and historical sense, were positively
          and precisely asserted and appealed to by the apologists for
          Christianity; which answers the allegation of the objection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am ready, however, to admit, that the ancient Christian advocates
          did not insist upon the miracles in argument so frequently as I should
          have done. It was their lot to contend with notions of magical agency,
          against which the mere production of the facts was not sufficient for
          the convincing of their adversaries: I do not know whether they
          themselves thought it quite decisive of the controversy. But since it
          is proved, I conceive with certainty, that the sparingness with which
          they appealed to miracles was owing neither to their ignorance nor
          their doubt of the facts, it is, at any rate, an objection not to the
          truth of the history, but to the judgment of its defenders.
