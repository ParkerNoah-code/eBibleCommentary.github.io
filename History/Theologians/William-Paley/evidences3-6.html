        <h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
        <p>
          WANT OF UNIVERSALITY IN THE KNOWLEDGE AND RECEPTION OF CHRISTIANITY,
          AND OF GREATER CLEARNESS IN THE EVIDENCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, a Revelation which really came from God, the proof, it has been
          said, would in all ages be so public and manifest, that no part of the
          human species would remain ignorant of it, no understanding could fail
          of being convinced by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advocates of Christianity do not pretend that the evidence of
          their religion possesses these qualities. They do not deny that we can
          conceive it to be within the compass of divine power to have
          communicated to the world a higher degree of assurance, and to have
          given to his communication a stronger and more extensive influence.
          For anything we are able to discern, God could have so formed men, as
          to have perceived the truths of religion intuitively; or to have
          carried on a communication with the other world whilst they lived in
          this; or to have seen the individuals of the species, instead of
          dying, pass to heaven by a sensible translation. He could have
          presented a separate miracle to each man&#x27;s senses. He could have
          established a standing miracle. He could have caused miracles to be
          wrought in every different age and country. These and many more
          methods, which we may imagine if we once give loose to our
          imaginations, are, so far as we can judge, all practicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question therefore is, not whether Christianity possesses the
          highest possible degree of evidence, but whether the not having more
          evidence be a sufficient reason for rejecting that which we have.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there appears to be no fairer method of judging concerning any
          dispensation which is alleged to come from God, when question is made
          whether such a dispensation could come from God or not, than by
          comparing it with other things which are acknowledged to proceed from
          the same counsel, and to be produced by the same agency. If the
          dispensation in question labour under no defects but what apparently
          belong to other dispensations, these seeming defects do not justify us
          in setting aside the proofs which are offered of its authenticity, if
          they be otherwise entitled to credit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout that order then of nature, of which God is the author, what
          we find is a system of beneficence: we are seldom or never able to
          make out a system of optimism. I mean, that there are few cases in
          which, if we permit ourselves to range in possibilities, we cannot
          suppose something more perfect, and, more unobjectionable, than what
          we see. The rain which descends from heaven is confessedly amongst the
          contrivances of the Creator for the sustentation of the animals and
          vegetables which subsist upon the surface of the earth. Yet how
          partially: and irregularly is it supplied! How much of it falls upon
          sea, where it can be of no use! how often is it wanted where it would
          be of the greatest! What tracts of continent are rendered deserts by
          the scarcity of it! Or, not to speak of extreme cases, how much
          sometimes do inhabited countries suffer by its deficiency or delay!—We
          could imagine, if to imagine were our business, the matter to be
          otherwise regulated. We could imagine showers to fall just where and
          when they would do good; always seasonable, everywhere sufficient; so
          distributed as not to leave a field upon the face of the globe
          scorched by drought or even a plant withering for the lack of
          moisture. Yet, does the difference between the real case and the
          imagined case, or the seeming inferiority of the one to the other,
          authorise us to say, that the present disposition of the atmosphere is
          not amongst the productions or the designs of the Deity? Does it check
          the inference which we draw from the confessed beneficence of the
          provision? or does it make us cease to admire the contrivance? The
          observation which we have exemplified in the single instance of the
          rain of heaven may be repeated concerning most of the phenomena of
          nature; and the true conclusion to which it leads is this—that to
          inquire what the Deity might have done, could have done, or, as we
          even sometimes presume to speak, ought to have done, or, in
          hypothetical cases, would have done; and to build any propositions
          upon such inquiries against evidence of facts, is wholly
          unwarrantable. It is a mode of reasoning which will not do in natural
          history, which will not do in natural religion, which cannot therefore
          be applied with safety to revelation. It may have same foundation in
          certain speculative a priori ideas of the divine attributes, but it
          has none in experience or in analogy. The general character of the
          works of nature is, on the one hand, goodness both in design and
          effect; and, on the other hand, a liability to difficulty and to
          objections, if such objections be allowed, by reason of seeming
          incompleteness or uncertainty in attaining their end. Christianity
          participates of this character. The true similitude between nature and
          revelation consists in this—that they each bear strong marks of their
          original, that they each also bear appearances of irregularity and
          defect. A system of strict optimism may, nevertheless, be the real
          system in both cases. But what I contend is, that the proof is hidden
          from us; that we ought not to expect to perceive that in revelation
          which we hardly perceive in anything; that beneficence, of which, we
          can judge, ought to satisfy us that optimism, of which we cannot
          judge, ought not to be sought after. We can judge of beneficence,
          because it depends upon effects which we experience, and upon the
          relation between the means which we see acting and the ends which we
          see produced. We cannot judge of optimism because it necessarily
          implies a comparison of that which is tried with that which is not
          tried; of consequences which we see with others which we imagine, and
          concerning many of which, it is more than probable, we know nothing;
          concerning some that we have no notion.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Christianity be compared with the state and progress of natural
          religion, the argument of the objector will gain nothing by the
          comparison. I remember hearing an unbeliever say that, if God had
          given a revelation, he would have written it in the skies. Are the
          truths of natural religion written in the skies, or in a language
          which every one reads? or is this the case with the most useful arts,
          or the most necessary sciences of human life? An Otaheitean or an
          Esquimaux knows nothing of Christianity; does he know more of the
          principles of deism or morality? which, notwithstanding his ignorance,
          are neither untrue, nor unimportant, nor uncertain. The existence of
          Deity is left to be collected from observations, which every man does
          not make, which every man, perhaps, is not capable of making. Can it
          be argued that God does not exist because if he did, he would let us
          see him, or discover himself to man kind by proofs (such as, we may
          think, the nature of the subject merited) which no inadvertency could
          miss, no prejudice withstand?
        </p>
        <p>
          If Christianity be regarded as a providential instrument the
          melioration of mankind, its progress and diffusion that of other
          causes by which human life is improved diversity is not greater, nor
          the advance more slow, in than we find it to be in learning, liberty,
          government, laws. The Deity hath not touched the order of nature in
          vain. The Jewish religion produced great and permanent effects; the
          Christian religion hath done the same. It hath disposed the world to
          amendment: it hath put things in a train. It is by no means improbable
          that it may become universal; and that the world may continue in that
          stage so long as that the duration of its reign may bear a vast
          proportion to the time of its partial influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we argue concerning Christianity, that it must necessarily be
          true because it is beneficial, we go, perhaps, too far on one side;
          and we certainly go too far on the other when we conclude that it must
          be false because it is not so efficacious as we could have supposed.
          The question of its truth is to be tried upon its proper evidence,
          without deferring much to this sort of argument on either side.
          &quot;The evidence,&quot; as Bishop Butler hath rightly observed,
          &quot;depends upon the judgment we form of human conduct, under given
          circumstances, of which it may be presumed that we know something; the
          objection stands upon the supposed conduct of the Deity, under
          relations with which we are not acquainted.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          What would be the real effect of that overpowering evidence which our
          adversaries require in a revelation it is difficult foretell; at least
          we must speak of it as of a dispensation which we have no experience.
          Some consequences, however, would, it is probable, attend this
          economy, which do not seem to befit a revelation that proceeded from
          God. One is, that irresistible proof would restrain the voluntary
          powers too much; would not answer the purpose of trial and probation;
          would call for no exercise of candour, seriousness, humility, inquiry,
          no submission of passion, interests, and prejudices, to moral evidence
          and to probable truth; no habits of reflection; none of that previous
          desire to learn and to obey the will of God, which forms perhaps the
          test of the virtuous principle, and which induces men to attend, with
          care and reverence, to every credible intimation of that will, and to
          resign present advantages and present pleasures to every reasonable
          expectation of propitiating his favour. &quot;Men&#x27;s moral
          probation may be, whether they will take due care to inform themselves
          by impartial consideration; and, afterwards, whether they will act, as
          the case requires, upon the evidence which they have. And this we find
          by experience is often our probation in our temporal capacity.&quot;
          (Butler&#x27;s Analogy, part ii. c. 6.)
        </p>
        <p>
          II. These modes of communication would leave no place for the
          admission of internal evidence; which ought, perhaps, to bear a
          considerable part in the proof of every revelation, because it is a
          species of evidence which applies itself to the knowledge, love, and
          practice, of virtue, and which operates in proportion to the degree of
          those qualities which it finds in the person whom it addresses. Men of
          good dispositions, amongst Christians, are greatly affected by the
          impression which the Scriptures themselves make upon their minds.
          Their conviction is much strengthened by these impressions. And this
          perhaps was intended to be one effect to be produced by the religion.
          It is likewise true, to whatever cause we ascribe it (for I am not in
          this work at liberty to introduce the Christian doctrine of grace or
          assistance, or the Christian promise that, &quot;if any man will do
          his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God&quot;
          John vii. 17.),—it is true, I say, that they who sincerely act, or
          sincerely endeavour to act, according to what they believe, that is,
          according to the just result of the probabilities, or, if you please,
          the possibilities in natural and revealed religion, which they
          themselves perceive, and according to a rational estimate of
          consequences, and, above all, according to the just effect of those
          principles of gratitude and devotion which even the view of nature
          generates in a well-ordered mind, seldom fail of proceeding farther.
          This also may have been exactly what was designed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas, may it not be said that irresistible evidence would confound
          all characters and all dispositions? would subvert rather than promote
          the true purpose of the Divine counsels; which is, not to produce
          obedience by a force little short of mechanical constraint, (which
          obedience would be regularity, not virtue, and would hardly perhaps
          differ from that which inanimate bodies pay to the laws impressed upon
          their nature), but to treat moral agents agreeably to what they are;
          which is done, when light and motives are of such kinds, and are
          imparted in such measures, that the influence of them depends upon the
          recipients themselves? &quot;It is not meet to govern rational free
          agents in via by sight and sense. It would be no trial or thanks to
          the most sensual wretch to forbear sinning, if heaven and hell were
          open to his sight. That spiritual vision and fruition is our state in
          patria.&quot; (Baxter&#x27;s Reasons, p. 357.) There may be truth in
          this thought, though roughly expressed. Few things are more improbable
          than that we (the human species) should be the highest order of beings
          in the universe: that animated nature should ascend from the lowest
          reptile to us, and all at once stop there. If there be classes above
          us of rational intelligences, clearer manifestations may belong to
          them. This may be one of the distinctions. And it may be one to which
          we ourselves hereafter shall attain.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But may it not also be asked, whether the perfect display of a
          future state of existence would be compatible with the activity of
          civil life, and with the success of human affairs? I can easily
          conceive that this impression may be overdone; that it may so seize
          and fill the thoughts as to leave no place for the cares and offices
          of men&#x27;s several stations, no anxiety for worldly prosperity, or
          even for a worldly provision, and, by consequence, no sufficient
          stimulus to secular industry. Of the first Christians we read,
          &quot;that all that believed were together, and had all things common;
          and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as
          every man had need; and continuing daily with one accord in the
          temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat
          with gladness and singleness of heart&quot; (Acts ii. 44-46.) This was
          extremely natural, and just what might be expected from miraculous
          evidence coming with full force upon the senses of mankind: but I much
          doubt whether, if this state of mind had been universal, or
          long-continued, the business of the world could have gone on. The
          necessary art of social life would have been little cultivated. The
          plough and the loom would have stood still. Agriculture, manufactures,
          trade, and navigation, would not, I think, have flourished, if they
          could have been exercised at all. Men would have addicted themselves
          to contemplative and ascetic lives, instead of lives of business and
          of useful industry. We observe that St. Paul found it necessary
          frequently to recall his converts to the ordinary labours and domestic
          duties of their condition; and to give them, in his own example, a
          lesson of contented application to their worldly employments.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the manner in which the religion is now proposed, a great portion
          of the human species is enabled and of these multitudes of every
          generation are induced, to seek and effectuate their salvation through
          the medium of Christianity, without interruption of the prosperity or
          of the regular course of human affairs.
