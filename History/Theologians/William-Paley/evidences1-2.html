        <h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
        <p>
          There is satisfactory evidence that many, professing to be original
          witnesses of the Christian miracles, passed their lives in labours,
          dangers and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation of the
          accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of their
          belief of those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the same
          motives, to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          After thus considering what was likely to happen, we are next to
          inquire how the transaction is represented in the several accounts
          that have come down to us. And this inquiry is properly preceded by
          the other, forasmuch as the reception of these accounts may depend in
          part on the credibility of what they contain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The obscure and distant view of Christianity, which some of the
          heathen writers of that age had gained, and which a few passage in
          their remaining works incidentally discover to us, offers itself to
          our notice in the first place: because, so far as this evidence goes,
          it is the concession of adversaries; the source from which it is drawn
          is unsuspected. Under this head, a quotation from Tacitus, well known
          to every scholar, must be inserted, as deserving particular attention.
          The reader will bear in mind that this passage was written about
          seventy years after Christ&#x27;s death, and that it relates to
          transactions which took place about thirty years after that
          event—Speaking of the fire which happened at Rome in the time of Nero,
          and of the suspicions which were entertained that the emperor himself
          was concerned in causing it, the historian proceeds in his narrative
          and observations thus:—
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;But neither these exertions, nor his largesses to the people,
          nor his offerings to the gods, did away the infamous imputation under
          which Nero lay, of having ordered the city to be set on fire. To put
          an end, therefore, to this report, he laid the guilt, and inflicted
          the most cruel punishments, upon a set of people, who were holden in
          abhorrence for their crimes, and called by the vulgar, Christians. The
          founder of that name was Christ, who suffered death in the reign of
          Tiberius, under his procurator, Pontius Pilate—This pernicious
          superstition, thus checked for a while, broke out again; and spread
          not only over Judea, where the evil originated, but through Rome also,
          whither everything bad upon the earth finds its way and is practised.
          Some who confessed their sect were first seized, and afterwards, by
          their information, a vast multitude were apprehended, who were
          convicted, not so much of the crime of burning Rome, as of hatred to
          mankind. Their sufferings at their execution were aggravated by insult
          and mockery; for some were disguised in the skins of wild beasts, and
          worried to death by dogs; some were crucified; and others were wrapped
          in pitched shirts,* and set on fire when the day closed, that they
          might serve as lights to illuminate the night. Nero lent his own
          gardens for these executions, and exhibited at the same time a mock
          Circensian entertainment; being a spectator of the whole, in the dress
          of a charioteer, sometimes mingling with the crowd on foot, and
          sometimes viewing the spectacle from his car. This conduct made the
          sufferers pitied; and though they were criminals, and deserving the
          severest punishments, yet they were considered as sacrificed, not so
          much out of a regard to the public good, as to gratify the cruelty of
          one man.&quot;

          * This is rather a paraphrase, but is justified by what the Scholiast
          upon Juvenal says; &quot;Nero maleficos homines taeda et papyro et
          cera supervestiebat, et sic ad ignem admoveri jubebat.&quot; Lard.

        </p>
        <p>
          Our concern with this passage at present is only so far as it affords
          a presumption in support of the proposition which we maintain,
          concerning the activity and sufferings of the first teachers of
          Christianity. Now, considered in this view, it proves three things:
          1st, that the Founder of the institution was put to death; 2dly, that
          in the same country in which he was put to death, the religion, after
          a short check, broke out again and spread; 3dly, that it so spread as
          that, within thirty-four years from the Author&#x27;s death, a very
          great number of Christians (ingens eorum multitudo) were found at
          Rome. From which fact, the two following inferences may be fairly
          drawn: first, that if, in the space of thirty-four years from its
          commencement, the religion had spread throughout Judea, had extended
          itself to Rome, and there had numbered a great multitude of converts,
          the original teachers and missionaries of the institution could not
          have been idle; secondly, that when the Author of the undertaking was
          put to death as a malefactor for his attempt, the endeavours of his
          followers to establish his religion in the same country, amongst the
          same people, and in the same age, could not but be attended with
          danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suetonius, a writer contemporary with Tacitus, describing the
          transactions of the same reign, uses these words: &quot;Affecti
          suppliciis Christiani genus hominum superstitionis novae et
          maleficae.&quot; (Suet. Nero. Cap. 16) &quot;The Christians, a set of
          men of a new and mischievous (or magical) superstition, were
          punished.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Since it is not mentioned here that the burning of the city was the
          pretence of the punishment of the Christians, or that they were the
          Christians of Rome who alone suffered, it is probable that Suetonius
          refers to some more general persecution than the short and occasional
          one which Tacitus describes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Juvenal, a writer of the same age with the two former, and intending,
          it should seem, to commemorate the cruelties exercised under
          Nero&#x27;s government, has the following lines: (Sat. i. ver. 155)
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Pone Tigellinum, taeda lucebis in illa,</p>
        <p>Qua stantes ardent, qui fixo gutture fumant,</p>
        <p>
          Et latum media sulcum deducit arena&quot; (Forsan
          &quot;deducis.&quot;)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Describe Tigellinus (a creature of Nero), and you shall suffer
          the same punishment with those who stand burning in their own flame
          and smoke, their head being held up by a stake fixed to their chin,
          till they make a long stream of blood and melted sulphur on the
          ground.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          If this passage were considered by itself, the subject of allusion
          might be doubtful; but, when connected with the testimony of
          Suetonius, as to the actual punishment of the Christians by Nero, and
          with the account given by Tacitus of the species of punishment which
          they were made to undergo, I think it sufficiently probable that these
          were the executions to which the poet refers.
        </p>
        <p>
          These things, as has already been observed, took place within
          thirty-one years after Christ&#x27;s death, that is, according to the
          course of nature, in the life-time, probably, of some of the apostles,
          and certainly in the life-time of those who were converted by the
          apostles, or who were converted in their time. If then the Founder of
          the religion was put to death in the execution of his design; if the
          first race of converts to the religion, many of them, suffered the
          greatest extremities for their profession; it is hardly credible, that
          those who came between the two, who were companions of the Author of
          the institution during his life, and the teachers and propagators of
          the institution after his death, could go about their undertaking with
          ease and safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          The testimony of the younger Pliny belongs to a later period; for,
          although he was contemporary with Tacitus and Suetonius, yet his
          account does not, like theirs, go back to the transactions of
          Nero&#x27;s reign, but is confined to the affairs of his own time. His
          celebrated letter to Trajan was written about seventy years after
          Christ&#x27;s death; and the information to be drawn from it, so far
          as it is connected with our argument, relates principally to two
          points: first, to the number of Christians in Bithynia and Pontus,
          which was so considerable as to induce the governor of these provinces
          to speak of them in the following terms: &quot;Multi, omnis aetatis,
          utriusque sexus etiam;—neque enim civitates tantum, sed vicos etiam et
          agros, superstitionis istius contagio pervagata est.&quot; &quot;There
          are many of every age and of both sexes;—nor has the contagion of this
          superstition seized cities only, but smaller towns also, and the open
          country.&quot; Great exertions must have been used by the preachers of
          Christianity to produce this state of things within this time.
          Secondly, to a point which has been already noticed, and, which I
          think of importance to be observed, namely, the sufferings to which
          Christians were exposed, without any public persecution being
          denounced against them by sovereign authority. For, from Pliny&#x27;s
          doubt how he was to act, his silence concerning any subsisting law on
          the subject, his requesting the emperor&#x27;s rescript, and the
          emperor, agreeably to his request, propounding a rule for his
          direction without reference to any prior rule, it may be inferred that
          there was, at that time, no public edict in force against the
          Christians. Yet from this same epistle of Pliny it appears &quot;that
          accusations, trials, and examinations, were, and had been, going on
          against them in the provinces over which he presided; that schedules
          were delivered by anonymous informers, containing the names of persons
          who were suspected of holding or of favouring the religion; that, in
          consequence of these informations, many had been apprehended, of whom
          some boldly avowed their profession, and died in the cause; others
          denied that they were Christians; others, acknowledging that they had
          once been Christians, declared that they had long ceased to be
          such.&quot; All which demonstrates that the profession of Christianity
          was at that time (in that country at least) attended with fear and
          danger: and yet this took place without any edict from the Roman
          sovereign, commanding or authorizing the persecution of Christians.
          This observation is further confirmed by a rescript of Adrian to
          Minucius Fundanus, the proconsul of Asia (Lard. Heath. Test. vol. ii.
          p. 110): from which rescript it appears that the custom of the people
          of Asia was to proceed against the Christians with tumult and uproar.
          This disorderly practice, I say, is recognised in the edict, because
          the emperor enjoins, that, for the future, if the Christians were
          guilty, they should be legally brought to trial, and not be pursued by
          importunity and clamour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Martial wrote a few years before the younger Pliny: and, as his manner
          was, made the suffering of the Christians the subject of his ridicule.
        </p>
        <p>In matutina nuper spectatus arena</p>
        <p>Mucius, imposuit qui sua membra focis,</p>
        <p>Si patiens fortisque tibi durusque videtur,</p>
        <p>Abderitanae pectora plebis habes;</p>
        <p>Nam cum dicatur, tunica praesente molesta,</p>
        <p>Ure* manum: plus est dicere, Non facio.</p>
        <p>*Forsan &quot;thure manum.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          Nothing, however, could show the notoriety of the fact with more
          certainty than this does. Martial&#x27;s testimony, as well indeed as
          Pliny&#x27;s, goes also to another point, viz, that the deaths of
          these men were martyrdom in the strictest sense, that is to say, were
          so voluntary, that it was in their power, at the time of pronouncing
          the sentence, to have averted the execution, by consenting to join in
          heathen sacrifices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The constancy, and by consequence the sufferings, of the Christians of
          this period, is also referred to by Epictetus, who imputes their
          intrepidity to madness, or to a kind of fashion or habit; and about
          fifty years afterwards, by Marcus Aurelius, who ascribes it to
          obstinacy. &quot;Is it possible (Epictetus asks) that a man may arrive
          at this temper, and become indifferent to those things from madness or
          from habit, as the Galileans?&quot; &quot;Let this preparation of the
          mind (to die) arise from its own judgment, and not from obstinacy like
          the Christians.&quot; (Epict. I. iv. C. 7.) (Marc. Aur. Med. 1. xi. c.
          3.)
