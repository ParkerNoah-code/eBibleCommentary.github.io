        <h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
        <p>
          One argument which has been much relied upon (but not more than its
          just weight deserves) is the conformity of the facts occasionally
          mentioned or referred to in Scripture with the state of things in
          those times, as represented by foreign and independent accounts; which
          conformity proves, that the writers of the New Testament possessed a
          species of local knowledge which could belong only to an inhabitant of
          that country and to one living in that age. This argument, if well
          made out by examples, is very little short of proving the absolute
          genuineness of the writings. It carries them up to the age of the
          reputed authors, to an age in which it must have been difficult to
          impose upon the Christian public forgeries in the names of those
          authors, and in which there is no evidence that any forgeries were
          attempted. It proves, at least, that the books, whoever were the
          authors of them, were composed by persons living in the time and
          country in which these things were transacted; and consequently
          capable, by their situation, of being well informed of the facts which
          they relate. And the argument is stronger when applied to the New
          Testament, than it is in the case of almost any other writings, by
          reason of the mixed nature of the allusions which this book contains.
          The scene of action is not confined to a single country, but displayed
          in the greatest cities of the Roman empire. Allusions are made to the
          manners and principles of the Greeks, the Romans, and the Jews. This
          variety renders a forgery proportionably more difficult, especially to
          writers of a posterior age. A Greek or Roman Christian who lived in
          the second or third century would have been wanting in Jewish
          literature; a Jewish convert in those ages would have been equally
          deficient in the knowledge of Greece and Rome. (Michaelis&#x27;s
          Introduction to the New Testament [Marsh&#x27;s translation], c. ii.
          sect. xi.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This, however, is an argument which depends entirely upon an induction
          of particulars; and as, consequently, it carries with it little force
          without a view of the instances upon which it is built, I have to
          request the reader&#x27;s attention to a detail of examples,
          distinctly and articulately proposed. In collecting these examples I
          have done no more than epitomise the first volume of the first part of
          Dr. Lardner&#x27;s Credibility of the Gospel History. And I have
          brought the argument within its present compass, first, by passing
          over some of his sections in which the accordancy appeared to me less
          certain, or upon subjects not sufficiently appropriate or
          circumstantial; secondly, by contracting every section into the fewest
          words possible, contenting myself for the most part with a mere
          apposition of passages; and, thirdly, by omitting many disquisitions,
          which, though learned and accurate, are not absolutely necessary to
          the understanding or verification of the argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          The writer principally made use of in the inquiry is Josephus.
          Josephus was born at Jerusalem four years after Christ&#x27;s
          ascension. He wrote his history of the Jewish war some time after the
          destruction of Jerusalem, which happened in the year of our Lord LXX,
          that is, thirty-seven years after the ascension; and his history of
          the Jews he finished in the year xciii, that is, sixty years after the
          ascension. At the head of each article I have referred, by figures
          included in brackets, to the page of Dr. Lardner&#x27;s volume where
          the section from which the abridgment is made begins. The edition used
          is that of 1741.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. [p. 14.] Matt. ii. 22. &quot;When he (Joseph) heard that Archclaus
          did reign in Judea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to
          go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned
          aside into the parts of Galilee.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          II. In this passage it is asserted that Archclaus succeeded Herod in
          Judea; and it is implied that his power did not extend to Galilee. Now
          we learn from Josephus that Herod the Great, whose dominion included
          all the land of Israel, appointed Archelaus his successor in Judea,
          and assigned the rest of his dominions to other sons; and that this
          disposition was ratified, as to the main parts of it, by the Roman
          emperor (Ant. lib. xvi. c. 8, sect. 1.).
        </p>
        <p>
          Saint Matthew says that Archclaus reigned, was king, in Judea.
          Agreeably to this, we are informed by Josephus, not only that Herod
          appointed Archclaus his successor in Judea, but that he also appointed
          him with the title of King; and the Greek verb basileuei, which the
          evangelist uses to denote the government and rank of Archclaus, is
          used likewise by Josephus (De Bell. lib. i. c. 3,3, sect. 7.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The cruelty of Archelaus&#x27;s character, which is not obscurely
          intimated by the evangelist, agrees with divers particulars in his
          history preserved by Josephus:—&quot;In the tenth year of his
          government, the chief of the Jews and Samaritans, not being able to
          endure his cruelty and tyranny, presented complaints against him to
          Caesar.&quot; (Ant, lib. xii. 13, sect. 1.)
        </p>
        <p>
          II. [p. 19.] Luke iii. 1. &quot;In the fifteenth year of the reign of
          Tiberius Caesar—Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother
          Philip tetrarch of Iturea, and of the region of Trachonitis—the word
          of God came unto John.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          By the will of Herod the Great, and the decree of Augustus thereupon,
          his two sons were appointed, one (Herod Antipus) tetrarch of Galilee
          and Peraea, and the other (Philip) tetrarch of Trachonitis and the
          neighbouring countries. (Ant. lib. xvii. c. 8, sect. 1.) We have,
          therefore, these two persons in the situations in which Saint Luke
          places them; and also, that they were in these situations in the
          fifteenth year of Tiberius; in other words, that they continued in
          possession of their territories and titles until that time, and
          afterwards, appears from a passage of Josephus, which relates of
          Herod, &quot;that he was removed by Caligula, the successor of
          Tiberius;&quot; (Ant. lib. xviii. c. 8, sect. 2.) and of Philip, that
          he died in the twentieth year of Tiberius, when he had governed
          Trachonitis and Batanea and Gaulanitis thirty-seven years. (Ant. lib.
          xviii. c. 5, sect. 6.)
        </p>
        <p>
          III. [p. 20.] Mark vi. 17. &quot;Herod had sent forth, and laid hold
          upon John, and bound him in prison, for Heredias&#x27; sake, his
          brother Philip&#x27;s wife: for he had married her.&quot; (See also
          Matt. xiv. 1—13; Luke iii. 19.)
        </p>
        <p>
          With this compare Joseph. Antiq. 1. xviii. c. 6, sect. 1:—&quot;He
          (Herod the tetrareh) made a visit to Herod his brother.—Here, failing
          in love with Herodias, the wife of the said Herod, he ventured to make
          her proposals of marriage.&quot;*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * The affinity of the two accounts is unquestionable; but there is a
          difference in the name of Herodias&#x27;s first husband, which in the
          evangelist is Philip; in Josephus, Herod. The difficulty, however,
          will not appear considerable when we recollect how common it was in
          those times for the same persons to bear two names. &quot;Simon, which
          is called Peter; Lebbeus, whose surname is Thaddeus; Thomas, which is
          called Didymus; Simeon, who was called Niger; Saul, who was also
          called Paul.&quot; The solution is rendered likewise easier in the
          present case by the consideration that Herod the Great had children by
          seven or eight wives; that Josephus mentions three of his sons under
          the name of Herod; that it is nevertheless highly probable that the
          brothers bore some additional name by which they were distinguished
          from one another. Lardner, vol. ii. p. 897. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Mark vi. 22. &quot;And when the daughter of the said Herodias
          came in and danced.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          With this also compare Joseph. Antiq. 1. xviii. c. 6, sect. 4.
          &quot;Herodias was married to Herod, son of Herod the Great. They had
          a daughter, whose name was Salome; after whose birth Herodias, in
          utter violation of the laws of her country, left her husband, then
          living, and married Herod the tetrarch of Galilee, her husband&#x27;s
          brother by the father&#x27;s side.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. [p. 29.] Acts xii. 1. &quot;Now, about that time, Herod the king
          stretched forth his hands, to vex certain of the church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In the conclusion of the same chapter, Herod&#x27;s death is
          represented to have taken place soon after this persecution. The
          accuracy of our historian, or, rather, the unmeditated coincidence
          which truth of its own accord produces, is in this instance
          remarkable. There was no portion of time for thirty years before, nor
          ever afterwards, in which there was a king at Jerusalem, a person
          exercising that authority in Judea, or to whom that title could be
          applied, except the last three years of this Herod&#x27;s life, within
          which period the transaction recorded in the Acts is stated to have
          taken place. This prince was the grandson of Herod the Great. In the
          Acts he appears under his family-name of Herod; by Josephus he was
          called Agrippa. For proof that he was a king, properly so called, we
          have the testimony of Josephus, in full and direct
          terms:—&quot;Sending for him to his palace, Caligula put a crown upon
          his head, and appointed him king of the tetrarchie of Philip,
          intending also to give him the tetrarchie of Lysanias.&quot; (Antiq.
          xviii. c. 7, sect. 10.) And that Judea was at last, but not until the
          last, included in his dominions, appears by a subsequent passage of
          the same Josephus, wherein he tells us that Claudius, by a decree,
          confirmed to Agrippa the dominion which Caligula had given him; adding
          also Judea and Samaria, in the utmost extent, as possessed by his
          grandfather Herod (Antiq. xix. c. 5, sect. 1.).
        </p>
        <p>
          V. [p. 32.] Acts xii. 19—23. &quot;And he (Herod) went down from Judea
          to Cesarea, and there abode. And on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal
          apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them: and the
          people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a
          man; and immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave
          not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the
          ghost.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph. Antiq. lib. xix. c. 8, sect. 2. &quot;He went to the city of
          Cesarea. Here he celebrated shows in honour of Caesar. On the second
          day of the shows, early in the morning, he came into the theatre,
          dressed in a robe of silver, of most curious workmanship. The rays of
          the rising sun, reflected from such a splendid garb, gave him a
          majestic and awful appearance. They called him a god; and intreated
          him to be propitious to them, saying, Hitherto we have respected you
          as a man; but now we acknowledge you to be more than mortal. The king
          neither reproved these persons, nor rejected the impious flattery.
          Immediately after this he was seized with pains in his bowels,
          extremely violent at the very first. He was carried therefore with all
          haste to his palace. These pains continually tormenting him, he
          expired in five days&#x27; time.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The reader will perceive the accordancy of these accounts in various
          particulars. The place (Cesarea), the set day, the gorgeous dress, the
          acclamations of the assembly, the peculiar turn of the flattery, the
          reception of it, the sudden and critical incursion of the disease, are
          circumstances noticed in both narratives. The worms mentioned by Saint
          Luke are not remarked by Josephus; but the appearance of these is a
          symptom not unusually, I believe, attending the disease which Josephus
          describes, viz., violent affections of the bowels.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. [p. 41.] Acts xxiv. 24. &quot;And after certain days, when Felix
          came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for
          Paul.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph. Antiq. lib. xx. c. 6, sect. 1, 2. &quot;Agrippa gave his
          sister Drusilla in marriage to Azizus, king of the Emesenes, when he
          had consented to be circumcised.—But this marriage of Drusilla with
          Azizus was dissolved in a short time after, in this manner:—When Felix
          was procurator of Judea, having had a sight of her, he was mightily
          taken with her.—She was induced to transgress the laws of her country,
          and marry Felix.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the public station of Felix, the name of his wife, and the
          singular circumstance of her religion, all appear in perfect
          conformity with the evangelist.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. [p. 46.] Acts xxv. 13. &quot;And after certain days king Agrippa
          and Berenice came to Cesarea to salute Festus.&quot; By this passage
          we are in effect told that Agrippa was a king, but not of Judea; for
          he came to salute Festus, who at this time administered the government
          of that country at Cesarea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, how does the history of the age correspond with this account? The
          Agrippa here spoken of was the son of Herod Agrippa, mentioned in the
          last article; but that he did not succeed to his father&#x27;s
          kingdom, nor ever recovered Judea, which had been a part of it, we
          learn by the information of Josephus, who relates of him that when his
          father was dead Claudius intended at first to have put him immediately
          in possession of his father&#x27;s dominions; but that, Agrippa being
          then but seventeen years of age, the emperor was persuaded to alter
          his mind, and appointed Cuspius Fadus prefect of Judea and the whole
          kingdom; (Antiq. xi. c. 9 ad fin.) which Fadus was succeeded by
          Tiberius Alexander, Cumanus, Felix, Festus. (Antiq. xx. de Bell. lib.
          ii.) But that, though disappointed of his father&#x27;s kingdom, in
          which was included Judea, he was, nevertheless, rightly styled King
          Agrippa, and that he was in possession of considerable territories,
          bordering upon Judea, we gather from the same authority: for, after
          several successive donations of country, &quot;Claudius, at the same
          time that he sent Felix to be procurator of Judea, promoted Agrippa
          from Chalcis to a greater kingdom, giving to him the tetrarchie which
          had been Philip&#x27;s; and he added, moreover, the kingdom of
          Lysanias, and the province that had belonged to Varus.&quot; (De Bell.
          lib. li. c. 12 ad fin.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Saint Paul addresses this person as a Jew: &quot;King Agrippa,
          believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.&quot; As the
          son of Herod Agrippa, who is described by Josephus to have been a
          zealous Jew, it is reasonable to suppose that he maintained the same
          profession. But what is more material to remark, because it is more
          close and circumstantial, is, that Saint Luke, speaking of the father
          (Acts xii. 1—3), calls him Herod the, king, and gives an example of
          the exercise of his authority at Jerusalem: speaking of the son (xxv.
          13), he calls him king, but not of Judea; which distinction agrees
          correctly with the history.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. [p. 51.] Acts xiii. 6. &quot;And when they had gone through the
          isle
        </p>
        <p>
          (Cyprus) to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a
        </p>
        <p>
          Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus, which was with the deputy of the
          country,
        </p>
        <p>Sergius Paulus, a prudent man.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          The word which is here translated deputy, signifies and upon this word
          our observation is founded. The provinces of the Roman empire were of
          two kinds; those belonging the emperor, in which the governor was
          called proprietor; those belonging to the senate, in which the
          governor was proconsul. And this was a regular distinction. Now it
          appears from Dio Cassius, (Lib. liv. ad A. U. 732.) that the province
          of Cyprus, which, in original distribution, was assigned to the
          emperor, had transferred to the senate, in exchange for some others;
          and after this exchange, the appropriate title of the Roman was
          proconsul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ib. xviii. 12. [p. 55.] &quot;And when Gallio was deputy (proconsul)
          of
        </p>
        <p>Achaia.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          The propriety of the title &quot;proconsul&quot; is in this still more
          critical. For the province of Achaia, after passing from the senate to
          the emperor, had been restored again by the emperor Claudius to the
          senate (and consequently its government had become proconsular) only
          six or seven years before the time in which this transaction is said
          to have taken place. (Suet. in Claud. c. xxv. Dio, lib. lxi.) And what
          confines with strictness the appellation to the time is, that Achaia
          under the following reign ceased to be a Roman province at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. [p. 152.] It appears, as well from the general constitution of a
          Roman province, as from what Josephus delivers concerning the state of
          Judea in particular, (Antiq. lib. xx. c. 8, sect. 5; c. 1, sect. 2.)
          that the power of life and death resided exclusively in the Roman
          governor; but that the Jews, nevertheless, had magistrates and a
          council, invested with a subordinate and municipal authority. This
          economy is discerned in every part of the Gospel narrative of our
          Saviour&#x27;s crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. [p. 203.] Acts ix. 31. &quot;Then had the churches rest throughout
          all
        </p>
        <p>Judea and Galilee and Samaria.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          This rest synchronises with the attempt of Caligula to place his
          statue in the temple of Jerusalem; the threat of which outrage
          produced amongst the Jews a consternation that, for a season, diverted
          their attention from every other object. (Joseph. de Bell lib. Xi. c.
          13, sect. 1, 3, 4.)

          of the temple; and forthwith the doors were shut. And as they went
          about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band that
          all Jerusalem was in an uproar. Then the chief captain came near, and
          took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and demanded
          who he was, and what he had done; and some cried one thing, and some
          another, among the multitude: and, when he could not know the
          certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the
          castle. And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
          of the soldiers for the violence of the people.&quot;

          In this quotation we have the band of Roman soldiers at Jerusalem,
          their office (to suppress tumults), the castle, the stairs, both, as
          it should seem, adjoining to the temple. Let us inquire whether we can
          find these particulars in any other record of that age and place.

          the angle of the western and northern porticoes of the outer temple.
          It was built upon a rock fifty cubits high, steep on all sides.—On
          that side where it joined to the porticoes of the temple, there were
          stairs reaching to each portico, by which the guard descended; for
          there was always lodged here a Roman legion; and posting themselves in
          their armour in several places in the porticoes, they kept a watch on
          the people on the feast-days to prevent all disorders; for as the
          temple was a guard to the city, so was Antonia to the temple.&quot;

          Philo, describing the conduct of the Jews of Alexandria, on a certain

          flocking out of the gates of the city, they go to the neighbouring
          shores, (for the proseuchai were destroyed,) and, standing in a most

          Josephus gives us a decree of the city of Halicarnassus, permitting

          do observe the Sabbaths, and perform sacred rites, according to the
          Jewish laws, and build oratories by the sea-side.&quot; (Joseph.

          In the original, there is an agreement not only in the sense but in

          perish with the bodies.&quot;

          high priest was a Sadducee; which is a character one would not have
          expected to meet with in that station. This circumstance, remarkable
          as it is, was not however without examples.

          and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.

          XXI. [p. 312.] Matt. xxvi. 3. &quot;Then assembled together the chief
          priests, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high
          priest, who was called Caiaphas.&quot; That Caiaphas was high priest,
          and high priest throughout the presidentship of Pontius Pilate, and
          consequently at this time, appears from the following account:—He was
          made high priest by Valerius Gratus, predecessor of Pontius Pilate,
          and was removed from his office by Vitellius, president of Syria,
          after Pilate was sent away out of the province of Judea. Josephus
          relates the advancement of Caiaphas to the high priesthood in this
          manner: &quot;Gratus gave the high priesthood to Simon, the son of
          Camithus. He, having enjoyed this honour not above a year, was
          succeeded by Joseph, who is also called Caiaphas.&quot; (Antiq. lib.
          xviii. c. 2, sect. 2.) After this, Gratus went away for Rome, having
          been eleven years in Judea; and Pontius Pilate came thither as his
          successor. Of the removal of Caiaphas from his office, Josephus
          likewise afterwards informs us: and connects it with a circumstance
          which fixes the time to a date subsequent to the determination of
          Pilate&#x27;s government—&quot;Vitellius,&quot; he tells us;
          &quot;ordered Pilate to repair to Rome: and after that, went up
          himself to Jerusalem, and then gave directions concerning several
          matters. And having done these things he took away the priesthood from
          the high priest Joseph, who is called Caiaphas.&quot; (Antiq. lib.
          xvii. c. 5, sect 3.)
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. (Michaelis, c. xi. sect. 11.) Acts xxiii. 4. &quot;And they that
          stood by said, Revilest thou God&#x27;s high priest? Then said Paul, I
          wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest?&quot; Now, upon
          inquiry into the history of the age, it turns out that Ananias, of
          whom this is spoken, was, in truth, not the high priest, though he was
          sitting in judgment in that assumed capacity. The case was, that he
          had formerly holden the office, and had been deposed; that the person
          who succeeded him had been murdered; that another was not yet
          appointed to the station; and that during the vacancy, he had, of his
          own authority, taken upon himself the discharge of the office.
          (Joseph. Antiq. 1. xx. c. 5, sect. 2; c. 6, sect. 2; c. 9, sect. 2.)
          This singular situation of the high priesthood took place during the
          interval between the death of Jonathan, who was murdered by order of
          Felix, and the accession of Ismael, who was invested with the high
          priesthood by Agrippa; and precisely in this interval it happened that
          Saint Paul was apprehended, and brought before the Jewish council.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. [p. 323.] Matt. xxvi. 59. &quot;Now the chief priests and

          Joseph. Antiq. lib. xviii. e. 15, sect. 3, 4. &quot;Then might be seen
          the high priests themselves with ashes on their heads and their
          breasts naked.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The agreement here consists in speaking of the high priests or chief
          priests (for the name in the original is the same) in the plural
          number, when in strictness there was only one high priest: which may
          be considered as a proof that the evangelists were habituated to the
          manner of speaking then in use, because they retain it when it is
          neither accurate nor just. For the sake of brevity, I have put down
          from Josephus only a single example of the application of this title
          in the plural number; but it is his usual style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ib. [p. 871.] Luke ill. 1. &quot;Now in the fifteenth year of the
          reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Juries, and
          Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, Annas and Caiaphas being the high
          priests, the word of God came unto John.&quot; There is a passage in
          Josephus very nearly parallel to this, and which may at least serve to
          vindicate the evangelist from objection, with respect to his giving
          the title of high priest specifically to two persons at the same time:
          &quot;Quadratus sent two others of the most powerful men of the Jews,
          as also the high priests Jonathan and Ananias.&quot; (De Bell. lib.
          ix. c. 12, sect. 6.) That Annas was a person in an eminent station,
          and possessed an authority coordinate with, or next to, that of the
          high print properly so called, may he inferred from Saint John&#x27;s
          Gospel, which in the history of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion relates that
          &quot;the soldiers led him away to Annas first.&quot; (xviii.13.) And
          this might be noticed as an example of undesigned coincidence in the
          two evangelists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, [p. 870.] Acts iv. 6. Annas is called the high priest, though
          Caiaphas was in the office of the high priesthood. In like manner in
          Josephus, (Lib. ii. c. 20, sect. 3.) &quot;Joseph the son of Gorion,
          and the high priest Ananus, were chosen to be supreme governors of all
          things in the city.&quot; Yet Ananus, though here called the high
          priest Ananus, was not then in the office of the high priesthood. The
          truth is, there is an indeterminateness in the use of this title in
          the Gospel:(Mark xiv. 53.) sometimes it is applied exclusively to the
          person who held the office at the time; sometimes to one or two more,
          who probably shared with him some of the powers or functions of the
          office; and sometimes to such of the priests as were eminent by their
          station or character; and there is the very same indeterminateness in
          Josephus.

          XXIV. [p. 347.] John xix. 19, 20. &quot;And Pilate wrote a title, and
          put it on the cross.&quot; That such was the custom of the Romans on
          these occasions appears from passages of Suetonius and Dio Cassius:
          &quot;Pattrem familias—canibus objecit, cure hoc titulo, Impie locutus
          parmularius.&quot; Suet. Domit. cap. x. And in Dio Cassius we have the
          following: &quot;Having led him through the midst of the court or
          assembly, with a writing signifying the cause of his death, and
          afterwards crucifying him.&quot; Book liv.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ib. &quot;And it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.&quot; That
          it was also usual about this time in Jerusalem to set up
          advertisements in different languages, is gathered from the account
          which Josephus gives of an expostulatory message from Titus to the
          Jews when the city was almost in his hands; in which he says, Did ye
          not erect pillars with inscriptions on them, in the Greek and in our
          language, &quot;Let no one pass beyond these bounds&quot;?

          XXV. [p. 352.] Matt. xxvii. 26. &quot;When he had scourged Jesus, he
          delivered him to be crucified.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>The following passages occur in Josephus:</p>
        <p>
          &quot;Being beaten, they were crucified opposite to the citadel.&quot;
          (P. 1247, edit. 24 Huds.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Whom, having first scourged with whips, he crucified.&quot; (P.
          1080, edit. 45.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;He was burnt alive, having been first beaten.&quot; (P. 1327,
          edit. 43.)
        </p>
        <p>
          To which may he added one from Livy, lib. xi. c. 5. &quot;Pro ductique
          omnes, virgisqus caesi, ac securi percussi.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          A modern example may illustrate the use we make of this instance. The
          preceding of a capital execution by the corporal punishment of the
          sufferer is a practice unknown in England, but retained, in some
          instances at least, as appears by the late execution of a regicide in
          Sweden. This circumstance, therefore, in the account of an English
          execution, purporting to come from an English writer, would not only
          bring a suspicion upon the truth of the account, but would in a
          considerable degree impeach its pretensions of having been written by
          the author whose name it bore. Whereas, the same circumstance in the
          account of a Swedish execution would verify the account, and support
          the authenticity of the book in which it was found, or, at least,
          would prove that the author, whoever he was, possessed the information
          and the knowledge which he ought to possess.

          Joseph. de Bell. 1. xi. c. 15. &quot;It is customary for those who
          have been afflicted with some distemper, or have laboured under any
          other difficulties, to make a vow thirty days before they offer
          sacrifices, to abstain from wine, and shave the hair of their
          heads.&quot;

          Joseph. Antiq. 1. xix. c. 6. &quot;He (Herod Agrippa) coming to
          Jerusalem, offered up sacrifices of thanksgiving, and omitted nothing
          that was prescribed by the law. For which reason he also ordered a
          good number of Nazarites to be shaved.&quot; We here find that it was
          an act of piety amongst the Jews to defray for those who were under
          the Nazaritic vow the expenses which attended its completion; and that
          the phrase was, &quot;that they might be saved.&quot; The custom and
          the expression are both remarkable, and both in close conformity with
          the Scripture account.

        <p>
          The coincidence here is singular, because the law allowed forty
          stripes:—&quot;Forty stripes he may give him and not exceed.&quot;
          Deut. xxv. 3. It proves that the author of the Epistle to the
          Corinthians was guided not by books, but by facts; because his
          statement agrees with the actual custom, even when that custom
          deviated from the written law, and from what he must have learnt by
          consulting the Jewish code, as set forth in the Old Testament.

          Levi or Matthew (Luke v. 29), and of Zaccheus (Luke xix. 2), it
          appears that the publicans or tax-gatherers were, frequently at least,
          if not always, Jews: which, as the country was then under a Roman
          government, and the taxes were paid to the Romans, was a circumstance
          not to be expected. That it was the truth, however, of the case
          appears from a short passage of Josephus.

          character. (Joseph. Antiq. lib. xviii. c. 7, sect. 5.) After the

          certain other prisoners were sent by the same ship into Italy, the
          text must be considered as carrying with it an intimation that the
          sending of persons from Judea to be tried at Rome was an ordinary
          practice. That in truth it was so, is made out by a variety of
          examples which the writings of Josephus furnish: and, amongst others,
          by the following, which comes near both to the time and the subject of
          the instance in the Acts. &quot;Felix, for some slight offence, bound

          impostor, coming into the country, and gaining the reputation of a
          prophet, gathered together thirty thousand men, who were deceived by
          him. Having brought them round out of the wilderness, up to the mount
          of Olives, he intended from thence to make his attack upon Jerusalem;
          but Felix, coming suddenly upon him with the Roman soldiers, prevented
          the attack.—A great number, or (as it should rather be rendered) the
          greatest part, of those that were with him were either slain or taken
          prisoners.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In these two passages, the designation of this impostor, an
          &quot;Egyptian,&quot; without the proper name, &quot;the wilderness
          ;&quot; his escape, though his followers were destroyed; the time of
          the transaction, in the presidentship of Felix, which could not be any
          long time before the words in Luke are supposed to have been spoken;
          are circumstances of close correspondency. There is one, and only one,
          point of disagreement, and that is, in the number of his followers,
          which in the Acts are called four thousand, and by Josephus thirty
          thousand: but, beside that the names of numbers, more than any other
          words, are liable to the errors of transcribers, we are in the present
          instance under the less concern to reconcile the evangelist with
          Josephus, as Josephus is not, in this point, consistent with himself.
          For whereas, in the passage here quoted, he calls the number thirty
          thousand, and tells us that the greatest part, or a great number
          (according as his words are rendered) of those that were with him were
          destroyed; in his Antiquities he represents four hundred to have been
          killed upon this occasion, and two hundred taken prisoners:(Lib. xx.
          c. 7, sect. 6.) which certainly was not the &quot;greatest part,&quot;
          nor &quot;a great part,&quot; nor &quot;a great number,&quot; out of
          thirty thousand. It is probable, also, that Lysias and Josephus spoke
          of the expedition in its different stages: Lysias, of those who
          followed the Egyptian out of Jerusalem; Josephus, of all who were
          collected about him afterwards, from different quarters.

          XLI. (Lardner&#x27;s Jewish and Heathen Testimonies, vol. iii p. 21.)
          Acts xvii. 22. &quot;Then Paul stood in the midst of Marshill, and
          said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too
          superstitious; for, as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found
          an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye
          ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Diogenes Laertius, who wrote about the year 210, in his history of
          Epimenides, who is supposed to have flourished nearly six hundred
          years before Christ, relates of him the following story: that, being
          invited to Athens for the purpose, he delivered the city from a
          pestilence in this manner;—&quot;Taking several sheep, some black,
          others white, he had them up to the Areopagus, and then let them go
          where they would, and gave orders to those who followed them, wherever
          any of them should lie down, to sacrifice it to the god to whom it
          belonged; and so the plague ceased.—Hence,&quot; says the historian,
          &quot;it has come to pass, that to this present time may be found in
          the boroughs of the Athenians ANONYMOUS altars: a memorial of the
          expiation then made.&quot; (In Epimenide, l. i. segm. 110.) These
          altars, it may be presumed, were called anonymous because there was
          not the name of any particular deity inscribed upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pausanias, who wrote before the end of the second century, in his
          description of Athens, having mentioned an altar of Jupiter Olympius,
          adds, &quot;And nigh unto it is an altar of unknown gods.&quot; (Paus.
          l. v. p. 412.) And in another place, he speaks &quot;of altars of gods
          called unknown.&quot; (Paus. l. i. p. 4.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Philostratus, who wrote in the beginning of the third century; records
          it as an observation of Apollonius Tyanseus, &quot;That it was wise to
          speak well of all the gods, especially at Athens, where altars of
          unknown demons were erected.&quot; (Philos. Apoll. Tyan. l. vi. c. 3.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The author of the dialogue Philoparis by many supposed to have been
          Lucian, who wrote about the year 170, by others some anonymous Heathen
          writer of the fourth century, makes Critias swear by the unknown god
          of Athens; and, near time end of the dialogue, has these words,
          &quot;But let us find out the unknown god at Athens, and, stretching
          our hands to heaven, offer to him our praises and thanksgivings.&quot;
          (Lucian. in Philop. tom. ii. Graev. pp. 767, 780.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a very curious and a very important coincidence. It appears
          beyond controversy, that altars with this inscription were existing at
          Athens at the time when Saint Paul is alleged to have been there. It
          seems also (which is very worthy of observation) that this inscription
          was peculiar to the Athenians. There is no evidence that there were
          altars inscribed &quot;to the unknown god&quot; in any other country.
          Supposing the history of Saint Paul to have been a fable, how is it
          possible that such a writer as the author of the Acts of the Apostles
          was should hit upon a circumstance so extraordinary, and introduce it
          by an allusion so suitable to Saint Paul&#x27;s office and character?
        </p>
        <p>
          The examples here collected will be sufficient, I hope, to satisfy us
          that the writers of the Christian history knew something of what they
          were writing about. The argument is also strengthened by the following
          considerations:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That these agreements appear not only in articles of public
          history, but sometimes in minute, recondite, and very peculiar
          circumstances, in which, of all others, a forger is most likely to
          have been found tripping.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That the destruction of Jerusalem, which took place forty years
          after the commencement of the Christian institution, produced such a
          change in the state of the country, and the condition of the Jews,
          that a writer who was unacquainted with the circumstances of the
          nation before that event would find it difficult to avoid mistakes, in
          endeavouring to give detailed accounts of transactions connected with
          those circumstances, forasmuch as he could no longer have a living
          exemplar to copy from.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. That there appears, in the writers of the New Testament, a
          knowledge of the affairs of those times which we do not find in
          authors of later ages. In particular, &quot;many of the Christian
          writers of the second and third centuries, and of the following ages,
          had false notions concerning the state of Judea between the nativity
          of Jesus and the destruction of Jerusalem.&quot; (Lardner, part i.
          vol. ii. p. 960.) Therefore they could not have composed our
          histories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amidst so many conformities we are not to wonder that we meet with
          some difficulties. The principal of these I will put down, together
          with the solutions which they have received. But in doing this I must
          be contented with a brevity better suited to the limits of my volume
          than to the nature of a controversial argument. For the historical
          proofs of my assertions, and for the Greek criticisms upon which some
          of them are founded, I refer the reader to the second volume of the
          first part of Dr. Lardner&#x27;s large work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The taxing during which Jesus was born was &quot;first made,&quot;
          as we read, according to our translation, in Saint Luke, &quot;whilst
          Cyrenius was governor of Syria.&quot; (Chap. ii. ver. 2.) Now it turns
          out that Cyrenius was not governor of Syria until twelve, or at the
          soonest, ten years after the birth of Christ; and that a taxing
          census, or assessment, was made in Judea, in the beginning of his
          government, The charge, therefore, brought against the evangelist is,
          that, intending to refer to this taxing, he has misplaced the date of
          it by an error of ten or twelve years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer to the accusation is founded in his using the word
          &quot;first:&quot;—&quot;And this taxing was first made:&quot; for,
          according to the mistake imputed to the evangelist, this word could
          have no signification whatever; it could have had no place in his
          narrative; because, let it relate to what it will, taxing, census,
          enrolment, or assessment, it imports that the writer had more than one
          of those in contemplation. It acquits him therefore of the charge: it
          is inconsistent with the supposition of his knowing only of the taxing
          in the beginning of Cyrenius&#x27;s government. And if the evangelist
          knew (which this word proves that he did) of some other taxing beside
          that, it is too much, for the sake of convicting him of a mistake, to
          lay it down as certain that he intended to refer to that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sentence in Saint Luke may be construed thus: &quot;This was the
          first assessment (or enrolment) of Cyrenius, governor of Syria;&quot;*
          the words &quot;governor of Syria&quot; being used after the name of
          Cyrenius as his addition or title. And this title, belonging to him at
          the time of writing the account, was naturally enough subjoined to his
          name, though acquired after the transaction which the account
          describes. A modern writer who was not very exact in the choice of his
          expressions, in relating the affairs of the East Indies, might easily
          say that such a thing was done by Governor Hastings; though, in truth,
          the thing had been done by him before his advancement to the station
          from which he received the name of governor. And this, as we contend,
          is precisely the inaccuracy which has produced the difficulty in Saint
          Luke.

          * If the word which we render &quot;first&quot; be rendered
          &quot;before,&quot; which it has been strongly contended that the
          Greek idiom shows of, the whole difficulty vanishes: for then the
          passage would be,—&quot;Now this taxing was made before Cyreulus was
          governor of Syria;&quot; which corresponds with the chronology. But I
          rather choose to argue, that however the word &quot;first&quot; be
          rendered, to give it a meaning at all, it militates with the
          objection. In this I think there can be no mistake. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          At any rate it appears from the form of the expression that he had two
          taxings or enrolments in contemplation. And if Cyrenius had been sent
          upon this business into Judea before he became governor of Syria
          (against which supposition there is no proof, but rather external
          evidence of an enrolment going on about this time under some person or
          other +), then the census on all hands acknowledged to have been made
          by him in the beginning of his government would form a second, so as
          to occasion the other to be called the first.

        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          + Josephus (Antiq. xvii. c. 2, sect. 6.) has this remarkable message:
          &quot;When therefore the whole Jewish nation took an oath to be
          faithful to Caesar, and the interests of the king.&quot; This
          transaction corresponds in the course of the history with the time of
          Christ&#x27;s birth. What is called a census, and which we render
          taxing, was delivering upon oath an account of their property. This
          might be accompanied with an oath of fidelity, or might be mistaken by
          Josephus for it. _________

          II. Another chronological objection arises upon a date assigned in the
          beginning of the third chapter of Saint Luke. (Lardner, part i. vol.
          ii. p. 768.) &quot;Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius
          Caesar,—Jesus began to be about thirty years of age:&quot; for,
          supposing Jesus to have been born as Saint Matthew and Saint Luke also
          himself relate, in the time of Herod, he must, according to the dates
          given in Josephus and by the Roman historians, have been at least
          thirty-one years of age in the fifteenth year of Tiberius. If he was
          born, as Saint Matthew&#x27;s narrative intimates, one or two years
          before Herod&#x27;s death, he would have been thirty-two or
          thirty-three years old at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the difficulty: the solution turns upon an alteration in the
          construction of the Greek. Saint Luke&#x27;s words in the original are
          allowed, by the general opinion of learned men, to signify, not
          &quot;that Jesus began to be about thirty years of age,&quot; but
          &quot;that he was about thirty years of age when he began his
          ministry.&quot; This construction being admitted, the adverb
          &quot;about&quot; gives us all the latitude we want, and more
          especially when applied, as it is in the present instance, to a
          decimal number; for such numbers, even without this qualifying
          addition, are often used in a laxer sense than is here contended for.*

          * Livy, speaking of the peace which the conduct of Romulus had
          procured to the state, during the whole reign of his successor (Numa),
          has these words: &quot;Ab illo enim profectis viribus datis tautum
          valuit, ut, in quaaraginta deiade annos, tutam proem haberet:&quot;
          yet afterwards in the same chapter, &quot;Romulus,&quot; he says,
          &quot;septera et triginta regnavit annos. Numa tres et
          quadraginta.&quot; (Liv. Hist. c. i. sect. 16.) _________

          III. Acts v. 36. &quot;For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting
          himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred,
          joined themselves: who were slain; and all, as many as obeyed him,
          were scattered and brought to nought.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Josephus has preserved the account of an impostor of the name of
          Theudas, who created some disturbances, and was slain; but according
          to the date assigned to this man&#x27;s appearance (in which, however,
          it is very possible that Josephus may have been mistaken),
          (Michaelis&#x27;s Introduction to the New Testament [Marsh&#x27;s
          translation], vol. i. p. 61.) it must have been, at the least, seven
          years after Gamaliel&#x27;s speech, of which this text is a part, was
          delivered. It has been replied to the objection, (Lardner, part i.
          vol. ii. p. 92.) that there might be two impostors of this name: and
          it has been observed, in order to give a general probability to the
          solution, that the same thing appears to have happened in other
          instances of the same kind. It is proved from Josephus, that there
          were not fewer than four persons of the name of Simon within forty
          years, and not fewer than three of the name of Judas within ten years,
          who were all leaders of insurrections: and it is likewise recorded by
          this historian, that upon the death of Herod the Great (which agrees
          very well with the time of the commotion referred to by Gamaliel, and
          with his manner of stating that time, &quot;before these days&quot;)
          there were innumerable disturbances in Judea. (Antiq. 1. 17, c. 12.
          sect. 4.) Archbishop Usher was of opinion, that one of the three
          Judases above mentioned was Gamaliel&#x27;s Theudas; (Annals, p. 797.)
          and that with a less variation of the name than we actually find in
          the Gospel, where one of the twelve apostles is called, by Luke,
          Judas; and by Mark, Thaddeus. (Luke vi. 16. Mark iii. 18.) Origen,
          however he came at his information, appears to have believed that
          there was an impostor of the name of Theudas before the nativity of
          Christ. (Orig. cont Cels. p. 44.)

          IV. Matt. xxiii. 34. &quot;Wherefore, behold I send unto you prophets,
          and wise men, and scribes, and some of them ye shall kill and crucify;
          and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute
          them from city to city; that upon you may come all the righteous blood
          shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood
          of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and
          the altar.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a Zacharias whose death is related in the second book of
          Chronicles,* in a manner which perfectly supports our Saviour&#x27;s
          allusion. But this Zacharias was the son of Jehoiada.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * &quot;And the Spirit of God came upon Zacharias, the son of Jehoiada
          the priest, which stood above the people, and mid unto them, Thus
          saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord that ye
          cannot prosper? Because ye hive forsaken the Lord, he hath also
          forsaken you. And they conspired against him, and stoned him with
          stones, at the commandment of the king, in the court of the house of
          the Lord.&quot; 2 Chron. xxiv. 20, 21. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also Zacharias the prophet; who was the son of Barachiah, and
          is so described in the superscription of his prophecy, but of whose
          death we have no account.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have little doubt but that the first Zacharias was the person spoken
          of by our Saviour; and that the name of the father has been since
          added or changed, by some one who took it from the title of the
          prophecy, which happened to be better known to him than the history in
          the Chronicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is likewise a Zacharias, the son of Baruch, related by Josephus
          to have been slain in the temple a few years before the destruction of
          Jerusalem. It has been insinuated that the words put into our
          Saviour&#x27;s mouth contain a reference to this transaction, and were
          composed by some writer who either confounded the time of the
          transaction with our Saviour&#x27;s age, or inadvertently overlooked
          the anachronism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, suppose it to have been so; suppose these words to have been
          suggested by the transaction related in Josephus, and to have been
          falsely ascribed to Christ; and observe what extraordinary
          coincidences (accidentally as it must in that case have been) attend
          the forger&#x27;s mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that we have a Zacharias in the book of Chronicles, whose
          death, and the manner of it, corresponds with the allusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, that although the name of this person&#x27;s father be
          erroneously put down in the Gospel, yet we have a way of accounting
          for the error by showing another Zacharias in the Jewish Scriptures
          much better known than the former, whose patronymic was actually that
          which appears in the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every one who thinks upon the subject will find these to be
          circumstances which could not have met together in a mistake which did
          not proceed from the circumstances themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have noticed, I think, all the difficulties of this kind. They are
          few: some of them admit of a clear, others of a probable solution. The
          reader will compare them with the number, the variety, the closeness,
          and the satisfactoriness, of the instances which are to be set against
          them; and he will remember the scantiness, in many cases, of our
          intelligence, and that difficulties always attend imperfect
          information.
