        <h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
        <p>
          There is satisfactory evidence that many, professing to be original
          witnesses of the Christian miracles, passed their lives in labours,
          dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation of the
          accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of their
          belief of those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the same
          motives, to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the story which we have now is, in the main, the story which the
          apostles published, is, I think, nearly certain, from the
          considerations which have been proposed. But whether, when we come to
          the particulars, and the detail of the narrative, the historical books
          of the New Testament be deserving of credit as histories, so that a
          fact ought to be accounted true, because it is found in them; or
          whether they are entitled to be considered as representing the
          accounts which, true or false, the apostles published; whether their
          authority, in either of these views, can be trusted to, is a point
          which necessarily depends upon what we know of the books, and of their
          authors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in treating of this part of our argument, the first and most
          material observation upon the subject is, that such was the situation
          of the authors to whom the four Gospels are ascribed, that, if any one
          of the four be genuine, it is sufficient for our purpose. The received
          author of the first was an original apostle and emissary of the
          religion. The received author of the second was an inhabitant of
          Jerusalem, at the time, to whose house the apostles were wont to
          resort, and himself an attendant upon one of the most eminent of that
          number. The received author of the third was a stated companion and
          fellow-traveller of the most active of all the teachers of the
          religion, and, in the course of his travels, frequently in the society
          of the original apostles. The received author of the fourth, as well
          as of the first, was one of these apostles. No stronger evidence of
          the truth of a history can arise from the situation of the historian
          than what is here offered. The authors of all the histories lived at
          the time and upon the spot. The authors of two of the histories were
          present at many of the scenes which they describe; eye-witnesses of
          the facts, ear-witnesses of the discourses; writing from personal
          knowledge and recollection; and, what strengthens their testimony,
          writing upon a subject in which their minds were deeply engaged, and
          in which, as they must have been very frequently repeating the
          accounts to others, the passages of the history would be kept
          continually alive in their memory. Whoever reads the Gospels (and they
          ought to be read for this particular purpose) will find in them not
          merely a general affirmation of miraculous powers, but detailed
          circumstantial accounts of miracles, with specifications of time,
          place, and persons; and these accounts many and various. In the
          Gospels, therefore, which bear the names of Matthew and John, these
          narratives, if they really proceeded from these men, must either be
          true as far as the fidelity of human recollection is usually to be
          depended upon, that is, must be true in substance and in their
          principal parts, (which is sufficient for the purpose of proving a
          supernatural agency,) or they must be wilful and mediated falsehoods.
          Yet the writers who fabricated and uttered these falsehoods, if they
          be such, are of the number of those who, unless the whole contexture
          of the Christian story be a dream, sacrificed their ease and safety in
          the cause, and for a purpose the most inconsistent that is possible
          with dishonest intentions. They were villains for no end but to teach
          honesty, and martyrs without the least prospect of honour or
          advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Gospels which bear the names of Mark and Luke, although not the
          narratives of eye-witnesses, are, if genuine, removed from that only
          by one degree. They are the narratives of contemporary writers, or
          writers themselves mixing with the business; one of the two probably
          living in the place which was the principal scene of action; both
          living in habits of society and correspondence with those who had been
          present at the transactions which they relate. The latter of them
          accordingly tells us (and with apparent sincerity, because he tells it
          without pretending to personal knowledge, and without claiming for his
          work greater authority than belonged to it) that the things which were
          believed amount Christians came from those who from the beginning were
          eye-witnesses and ministers of the word; that he had traced accounts
          up to their source; and that he was prepared to instruct his reader in
          the certainty of the things which he related.* Very few histories lie
          so close to their facts; very few historians are so nearly connected
          with the subject of their narrative, or possess such means of
          authentic information, as these.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Why should not the candid and modest preface of this historian be
          believed, as well as that which Dion Cassius prefixes to his Life of
          Commodus? &quot;These things and the following I write, not from the
          report of others, but from my own knowledge and observation.&quot; I
          see no reason to doubt but that both passages describe truly enough
          the situation of the authors. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          The situation of the writers applies to the truth of the facts which
          they record. But at present we use their testimony to a point somewhat
          short of this, namely, that the facts recorded in the Gospels, whether
          true or false, are the facts, and the sort of facts which the original
          preachers of the religion allege. Strictly speaking, I am concerned
          only to show, that what the Gospels contain is the same as what the
          apostles preached. Now, how stands the proof of this point? A set of
          men went about the world, publishing a story composed of miraculous
          accounts, (for miraculous from the very nature and exigency of the
          case they must have been,) and upon the strength of these accounts
          called upon mankind to quit the religions in which they had been
          educated, and to take up, thenceforth, a new system of opinions, and
          new rules of action. What is more in attestation of these accounts,
          that is, in support of an institution of which these accounts were the
          foundation, is, that the same men voluntarily exposed themselves to
          harassing and perpetual labours, dangers, and sufferings. We want to
          know what these accounts were. We have the particulars, i. e. many
          particulars, from two of their own number. We have them from an
          attendant of one of the number, and who, there is reason to believe,
          was an inhabitant of Jerusalem at the time. We have them from a fourth
          writer, who accompanied the most laborious missionary of the
          institution in his travels; who, in the course of these travels, was
          frequently brought into the society of the rest; and who, let it be
          observed, begins his narrative by telling us that he is about to
          relate the things which had been delivered by those who were ministers
          of the word, and eye-witnesses of the facts. I do not know what
          information can be more satisfactory than this. We may, perhaps,
          perceive the force and value of it more sensibly if we reflect how
          requiring we should have been if we had wanted it. Supposing it to be
          sufficiently proved, that the religion now professed among us owed its
          original to the preaching and ministry of a number of men, who, about
          eighteen centuries ago, set forth in the world a new system of
          religious opinions, founded upon certain extraordinary things which
          they related of a wonderful person who had appeared in Judea; suppose
          it to be also sufficiently proved, that, in the course and prosecution
          of their ministry, these men had subjected themselves to extreme
          hardships, fatigue, and peril; but suppose the accounts which they
          published had not been committed to writing till some ages after their
          times, or at least that no histories but what had been composed some
          ages afterwards had reached our hands; we should have said, and with
          reason, that we were willing to believe these under the circumstances
          in which they delivered their testimony, but that we did not, at this
          day, know with sufficient evidence what their testimony was. Had we
          received the particulars of it from any of their own number, from any
          of those who lived and conversed with them, from any of their hearers,
          or even from any of their contemporaries, we should have had something
          to rely upon. Now, if our books be genuine, we have all these. We have
          the very species of information which, as it appears to me, our
          imagination would have carved out for us, if it had been wanting.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have said that if any one of the four Gospels be genuine, we
          have not only direct historical testimony to the point we contend for,
          but testimony which, so far as that point is concerned, cannot
          reasonably be rejected. If the first Gospel was really written by
          Matthew, we have the narrative of one of the number, from which to
          judge what were the miracles, and the kind of miracles, which the
          apostles attributed to Jesus. Although, for argument&#x27;s sake, and
          only for argument&#x27;s sake, we should allow that this Gospel had
          been erroneously ascribed to Matthew; yet, if the Gospel of St. John
          be genuine, the observation holds with no less strength. Again,
          although the Gospels both of Matthew and John could be supposed to be
          spurious, yet, if the Gospel of Saint Luke were truly the composition
          of that person, or of any person, be his name what it might, who was
          actually in the situation in which the author of that Gospel professes
          himself to have been, or if the Gospel which bear the name of Mark
          really proceeded from him; we still, even upon the lowest supposition,
          possess the accounts of one writer at least, who was not only
          contemporary with the apostles, but associated with them in their
          ministry; which authority seems sufficient, when the question is
          simply what it was which these apostles advanced.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it material to have this well noticed. The New Testament
          contains a great number of distinct writings, the genuineness of any
          one of which is almost sufficient to prove the truth of the religion:
          it contains, however, four distinct histories, the genuineness of any
          one of which is perfectly sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, therefore, we must be considered as encountering the risk of error
          in assigning the authors of our books, we are entitled to the
          advantage of so many separate probabilities. And although it should
          appear that some of the evangelists had seen and used each
          other&#x27;s works, this discovery, whist it subtracts indeed from
          their characters as testimonies strictly independent, diminishes, I
          conceive, little either their separate authority, (by which I mean the
          authority of any one that is genuine,) or their mutual confirmation.
          For, let the most disadvantageous supposition possible be made
          concerning them; let it be allowed, what I should have no great
          difficulty in admitting, that Mark compiled his history almost
          entirely from those of Matthew and Luke; and let it also for a moment
          be supposed that were not, in fact, written by Matthew and Luke; yet,
          if it be true that Mark, a contemporary of the apostles, living, in
          habits of society with the apostles, a fellow-traveller and
          fellow-labourer with some of them; if, I say, it be true, that this
          person made the compilation, it follows, that the writings from which
          he made it existed in the time of the apostles, and not only so, but
          that they were then in such esteem and credit, that a companion of the
          apostles formed a history out of them. Let the Gospel of Mark be
          called an epitome of that of Matthew; if a person in the situation in
          which Mark is described to have been actually made the epitome, it
          affords the strongest possible attestation to the character of the
          original.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, parallelisms in sentences, in word, and in the order of words,
          have been traced out between the Gospel of Matthew and that of Luke;
          which concurrence cannot easily be explained, otherwise than by
          supposing, either that Luke had consulted Matthew&#x27;s history, or,
          what appears to me in nowise incredible, that minutes of some of
          Christ&#x27;s discourses, as well as brief memoirs of some passages of
          his life, had been committed to writing at the time; and that such
          written accounts had by both authors been occasionally admitted into
          their histories. Either supposition is perfectly consistent with the
          acknowledged formation of St. Luke&#x27;s narrative, who professes not
          to write as an eye-witness, but to have investigated the original of
          every account which he delivers: in other words, to have collected
          them from such documents and testimonies as he, who had the best
          opportunities of making inquiries, judged to be authentic. Therefore,
          allowing that this writer also, in some instances, borrowed from the
          Gospel which we call Matthew&#x27;s and once more allowing for the
          sake of stating the argument, that that Gospel was not the production
          of the author to whom we ascribe it; yet still we have in St.
          Luke&#x27;s Gospel a history given by a writer immediately connected
          with the transaction with the witnesses of it with the persons engaged
          in it, and composed from materials which that person, thus situated,
          deemed to be safe source of intelligence; in other words, whatever
          supposition be made concerning any or all the other Gospels, if Saint
          Luke&#x27;s Gospel be genuine, we have in it a credible evidence of
          the point which we maintain. The Gospel according to Saint John
          appears to be, and is on all hands allowed to be, an independent
          testimony, strictly and properly so called. Notwithstanding therefore,
          any connexion or supposed connexion, between one of the Gospels, I
          again repeat what I before said, that if any one of the four be
          genuine, we have, in that one, strong reason, from the character and
          situation of the writer, to believe that we possess the accounts which
          the original emissaries of the religion delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly: In treating of the written evidences of Christianity, next
          to their separate, we are to consider their aggregate authority. Now,
          there is in the evangelic history a cumulation of testimony which
          belongs hardly to any other history, but which our habitual mode of
          reading the Scriptures sometimes causes us to overlook. When a
          passage, in any wise relating to the history of Christ is read to us
          out of the epistle of Clemens Romanus, the epistles of Ignatius, of
          Polycap, or from any other writing of that age, we are immediately
          sensible of the confirmation which it affords to the Scripture
          account. Here is a new witness. Now, if we had been accustomed to read
          the Gospel of Matthew alone, and had known that of Luke only as the
          generality of Christians know the writings of the apostolical fathers,
          that is, had known that such a writing was extant and acknowledged;
          when we came, for the first time, to look into what it contained, and
          found many of the facts which Matthew recorded, recorded also there,
          many other facts of a similar nature added, and throughout the whole
          work the same general series of transactions stated, and the same
          general character of the person who was the subject of the history
          preserved, I apprehend that we should feel our minds strongly
          impressed by this discovery of fresh evidence. We should feel a
          renewal of the same sentiment in first reading the Gospel of Saint
          John. That of Saint Mark perhaps would strike us as an abridgment of
          the history with which we were already acquainted; but we should
          naturally reflect, that if that history was abridged by such a person
          as Mark, or by any person of so early an age, it afforded one of the
          highest possible attestations to the value of the work. This
          successive disclosure of proof would leave us assured, that there must
          have been at least some reality in a story which not one, but many,
          had taken in hand to commit to writing. The very existence of four
          separate histories would satisfy us that the subject had a foundation;
          and when, amidst the variety which the different information of the
          different writers had supplied to their accounts, or which their
          different choice and judgment in selecting their materials had
          produced, we observed many facts to stand the same in all; of these
          facts, at least, we should conclude, that they were fixed in their
          credit and publicity. If, after this, we should come to the knowledge
          of a distinct history, and that also of the same age with the rest,
          taking up the subject where the others had left it, and carrying on a
          narrative of the effects produced in the world by the extraordinary
          causes of which we had already been informed, and which effects
          subsist at this day, we should think the reality of the original story
          in no little degree established by this supplement. If subsequent
          inquiries should bring to our knowledge, one after another, letters
          written by some of the principal agents in the business, upon the
          business, and during the time of their activity and concern in it,
          assuming all along and recognising the original story, agitating the
          questions that arose out of it, pressing the obligations which
          resulted from it, giving advice and directions to these who acted upon
          it; I conceive that we should find, in every one of these, a still
          further support to the conclusion we had formed. At present, the
          weight of this successive confirmation is, in a great measure;
          unperceived by us. The evidence does not appear to us what it is; for,
          being from our infancy accustomed to regard the New Testament as one
          book, we see in it only one testimony. The whole occurs to us as a
          single evidence; and its different parts not as distinct attestations,
          but as different portions only of the same. Yet in this conception of
          the subject we are certainly mistaken; for the very discrepancies
          among the several documents which form our volume prove, if all other
          proof were wanting, that in their original composition they were
          separate, and most of them independent productions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we dispose our ideas in a different order, the matter stands
          thus:—Whilst the transaction was recent, and the original witnesses
          were at hand to relate it; and whilst the apostles were busied in
          preaching and travelling, in collecting disciples, in forming and
          regulating societies of converts, in supporting themselves against
          opposition; whilst they exercised their ministry under the harassings
          of frequent persecutions, and in a state of almost continual alarm, it
          is not probable that, in this engaged, anxious, and unsettled
          condition of life, they would think immediately of writing histories
          for the information of the public or of posterity.* But it is very
          probable, that emergencies might draw from some of them occasional
          letters upon the subject of their mission, to converts, or to
          societies of converts, with which they were connected; or that they
          might address written discourses and exhortations to the disciples of
          the institution at large, which would be received and read with a
          respect proportioned to the character of the writer. Accounts in the
          mean time would get abroad of the extraordinary things that had been
          passing, written with different degrees of information and
          correctness. The extension of the Christian society, which could no
          longer be instructed: by a personal intercourse with the apostles, and
          the possible circulation of imperfect or erroneous narratives, would
          soon teach some amongst them the expediency of sending forth authentic
          memoirs of the life and doctrine of their Master. When accounts
          appeared authorised by the name, and credit, and situation of the
          writers, recommended or recognised by the apostles and first preachers
          of the religion, or found to coincide with what the apostles and first
          preachers of the religion had taught, other accounts would fall into
          disuse and neglect; whilst these, maintaining their reputation (as, if
          genuine and well founded, they would do) under the test of time,
          inquiry, and contradiction, might be expected to make their way into
          the hands of Christians of all countries of the world.
        </p>
        <p>________</p>
        <p>
          * This thought occurred to Eusebius: &quot;Nor were the apostles of
          Christ greatly concerned about the writing of books, being engaged in
          a more excellent ministry which is above all human power.&quot;
          Eccles. Hist. 1. iii. c. 24.—The same consideration accounts also for
          the paucity of Christian writings in the first century of its aera.

          This seems the natural progress of the business; and with this the
          records in our possession, and the evidence concerning them
          correspond. We have remaining, in the first place, many letters of the
          kind above described, which have been preserved with a care and
          fidelity answering to the respect with which we may suppose that such
          letters would be received. But as these letters were not written to
          prove the truth of the Christian religion, in the sense in which we
          regard that question; nor to convey information of facts, of which
          those to whom the letters were written had been previously informed;
          we are not to look in them for anything more than incidental allusions
          to the Christian history. We are able, however, to gather from these
          documents various particular attestations which have been already
          enumerated; and this is a species of written evidence, as far as it
          goes, in the highest degree satisfactory, and in point of time perhaps
          the first. But for our more circumstantial information, we have, in
          the next place, five direct histories, bearing the names of persons
          acquainted, by their situation, with the truth of what they relate,
          and three of them purporting, in the very body of the narrative, to be
          written by such persons; of which books we know, that some were in the
          hands of those who were contemporaries of the apostles, and that, in
          the age immediately posterior to that, they were in the hands, we may
          say, of every one, and received by Christians with so much respect and
          deference, as to be constantly quoted and referred to by them, without
          any doubt of the truth of their accounts. They were treated as such
          histories, proceeding from such authorities, might expect to be
          treated. In the preface to one of our histories, we have intimations
          left us of the existence of some ancient accounts which are now lost.
          There is nothing in this circumstance that can surprise us. It was to
          be expected, from the magnitude and novelty of the occasion, that such
          accounts would swarm. When better accounts came forth, these died
          away. Our present histories superseded others. They soon acquired a
          character and established a reputation which does not appear to have
          belonged to any other: that, at least, can be proved concerning them
          which cannot be proved concerning any other.

        <p>
          But to return to the point which led to these reflections. By
          considering our records in either of the two views in which we have
          represented them, we shall perceive that we possess a connection of
          proofs, and not a naked or solitary testimony; and that the written
          evidence is of such a kind, and comes to us in such a state, as the
          natural order and progress of things, in the infancy of the
          institution, might be expected to produce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly: The genuineness of the historical books of the New Testament
          is undoubtedly a point of importance, because the strength of their
          evidence is augmented by our knowledge of the situation of their
          authors, their relation to the subject, and the part which they
          sustained in the transaction; and the testimonies which we are able to
          produce compose a firm ground of persuasion, that the Gospels were
          written by the persons whose names they bear. Nevertheless, I must be
          allowed to state, that to the argument which I am endeavouring to
          maintain, this point is not essential; I mean, so essential as that
          the fate of the argument depends upon it. The question before us is,
          whether the Gospels exhibit the story which the apostles and first
          emissaries of the religion published, and for which they acted and
          suffered in the manner in which, for some miraculous story or other,
          they did act and suffer. Now let us suppose that we possess no other
          information concerning these books than that they were written by
          early disciples of Christianity; that they were known and read during
          the time, or near the time, of the original apostles of the religion;
          that by Christians whom the apostles instructed, by societies of
          Christians which the apostles founded, these books were received, (by
          which term &quot;received&quot; I mean that they were believed to
          contain authentic accounts of the transactions upon which the religion
          rested, and accounts which were accordingly used, repeated, and relied
          upon,) this reception would be a valid proof that these books, whoever
          were the authors of them, must have accorded with what the apostles
          taught. A reception by the first race of Christians, is evidence that
          they agreed with what the first teachers of the religion delivered. In
          particular, if they had not agreed with what the apostles themselves
          preached, how could they have gained credit in churches and societies
          which the apostles established?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the fact of their early existence, and not only of their
          existence, but their reputation, is made out by some ancient
          testimonies which do not happen to specify the names of the writers:
          add to which, what hath been already hinted, that two out of the four
          Gospels contain averments in the body of the history, which, though
          they do not disclose the names, fix the time and situation of the
          authors, viz., that one was written by an eye-witness of the
          sufferings of Christ, the other by a contemporary of the apostles. In
          the Gospel of St. John (xix. 35), describing the crucifixion, with the
          particular circumstance of piercing Christ&#x27;s side with a spear,
          the historian adds, as for himself, &quot;and he that saw it bare
          record, and his record is true, and he knoweth that he saith true,
          that ye might believe.&quot; Again (xxi. 24), after relating a
          conversation which passed between Peter and &quot;the disciple,&quot;
          as it is there expressed, &quot;whom Jesus loved,&quot; it is added,
          &quot;this is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote
          these things.&quot; This testimony, let it be remarked, is not the
          less worthy of regard, because it is, in one view, imperfect. The name
          is not mentioned; which, if a fraudulent purpose had been intended,
          would have been done. The third of our present Gospels purports to
          have been written by the person who wrote the Acts of the Apostles; in
          which latter history, or rather latter part of the same history, the
          author, by using in various places the first person plural, declares
          himself to have been a contemporary of all, and a companion of one, of
          the original preachers of the religion.
