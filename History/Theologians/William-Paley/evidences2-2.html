        <h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
        <p>THE MORALITY OF THE GOSPEL.</p>
        <p>
          Is stating the morality of the Gospel as an argument of its truth, I
          am willing to admit two points; first, that the teaching of morality
          was not the primary design of the mission; secondly, that morality,
          neither in the Gospel, nor in any other book, can be a subject,
          properly speaking, of discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I were to describe in a very few words the scope of Christianity as
          a revelation,* I should say that it was to influence the conduct of
          human life, by establishing the proof of a future state of reward and
          punishment,—&quot;to bring life and immortality to light.&quot; The
          direct object, therefore, of the design is, to supply motives, and not
          rules; sanctions, and not precepts. And these were what mankind stood
          most in need of. The members of civilised society can, in all ordinary
          cases, judge tolerably well how they ought to act: but without a
          future state, or, which is the same thing, without credited evidence
          of that state, they want a motive to their duty; they want at least
          strength of motive sufficient to bear up against the force of passion,
          and the temptation of present advantage. Their rules want authority.
          The most important service that can be rendered to human life, and
          that consequently which one might expect beforehand would be the great
          end and office of a revelation from God, is to convey to the world
          authorised assurances of the reality of a future existence. And
          although in doing this, or by the ministry of the same person by whom
          this is done, moral precepts or examples, or illustrations of moral
          precepts, may be occasionally given and be highly valuable, yet still
          they do not form the original purpose of the mission.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Great and inestimably beneficial effects may accrue from the mission
          of Christ, and especially from his death, which do not belong to
          Christianity as a revelation: that is, they might have existed, and
          they might have been accomplished, though we had never, in this life,
          been made acquainted with them. These effects may be very extensive;
          they may be interesting even to other orders of intelligent beings. I
          think it is a general opinion, and one to which I have long come, that
          the beneficial effects of Christ&#x27;s death extend to the whole
          human species. It was the redemption of the world. &quot;He is the
          propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the whole
          world;&quot; 1 John ii. 2. Probably the future happiness, perhaps the
          future existence of the species, and more gracious terms of acceptance
          extended to all, might depend upon it or be procured by it. Now these
          effects, whatever they be, do not belong to Christianity as a
          revelation; because they exist with respect to those to whom it is not
          revealed. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly; morality, neither in the Gospel nor in any other book, can
          be a subject of discovery, properly so called. By which proposition I
          mean that there cannot, in morality, be anything similar to what are
          called discoveries in natural philosophy, in the arts of life, and in
          some sciences; as the system of the universe, the circulation of the
          blood, the polarity of the magnet, the laws of gravitation,
          alphabetical writing, decimal arithmetic, and some other things of the
          same sort; facts, or proofs, or contrivances, before totally unknown
          and unthought of. Whoever, therefore, expects in reading the New
          Testament to be struck with discoveries in morals in the manner in
          which his mind was affected when he first came to the knowledge of the
          discoveries above mentioned: or rather in the manner in which the
          world was affected by them, when they were first published; expects
          what, as I apprehend, the nature of the subject renders it impossible
          that he should meet with. And the foundation of my opinion is this,
          that the qualities of actions depend entirely upon their effects,
          which effects must all along have been the subject of human
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it is once settled, no matter upon what principle, that to do
          good is virtue, the rest is calculation. But since the calculation
          cannot be instituted concerning each particular action, we establish
          intermediate rules; by which proceeding, the business of morality is
          much facilitated, for then it is concerning our rules alone that we
          need inquire, whether in their tendency they be beneficial; concerning
          our actions, we have only to ask whether they be agreeable to the
          rules. We refer actions to rules, and rules to public happiness. Now,
          in the formation of these rules, there is no place for discovery,
          properly so called, but there is ample room for the exercise of
          wisdom, judgment, and prudence.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I wish to deliver argument rather than panegyric, I shall treat of
          the morality of the Gospel in subjection to these observations. And
          after all, I think it such a morality as, considering from whom it
          came, is most extraordinary; and such as, without allowing some degree
          of reality to the character and pretensions of the religion, it is
          difficult to account for: or, to place the argument a little lower in
          the scale, it is such a morality as completely repels the supposition
          of its being the tradition of a barbarous age or of a barbarous
          people, of the religion being founded in folly, or of its being the
          production of craft; and it repels also, in a great degree, the
          supposition of its having been the effusion of an enthusiastic mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The division under which the subject may be most conveniently treated
          is that of the things taught, and the manner of teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the first head, I should willingly, if the limits and nature of
          my work admitted of it, transcribe into this chapter the whole of what
          has been said upon the morality of the Gospel by the author of The
          Internal Evidence of Christianity; because it perfectly agrees with my
          own opinion, and because it is impossible to say the same things so
          well. This acute observer of human nature, and, as I believe, sincere
          convert to Christianity, appears to me to have made out satisfactorily
          the two following positions, viz.—
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That the Gospel omits some qualifies which have usually engaged the
          praises and admiration of mankind, but which, in reality, and in their
          general effects, have been Prejudicial to human happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That the Gospel has brought forward some virtues which possess the
          highest intrinsic value, but which have commonly been overlooked and
          contemned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first of these propositions he exemplifies in the instances of
          friendship, patriotism, active courage; in the sense in which these
          qualities are usually understood, and in the conduct which they often
          produce.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second, in the instances of passive courage or endurance of
          sufferings, patience under affronts and injuries, humility,
          irresistance, placability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is, there are two opposite descriptions of character under
          which mankind may generally be classed. The one possesses rigour,
          firmness, resolution; is daring and active, quick in its
          sensibilities, jealous of its fame, eager in its attachments,
          inflexible in its purpose, violent in its resentments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other meek, yielding, complying, forgiving; not prompt to act, but
          willing to suffer; silent and gentle under rudeness and insult, suing
          for reconciliation where others would demand satisfaction, giving way
          to the pushes of impudence, conceding and indulgent to the prejudices,
          the wrong-headedness, the intractability of those with whom it has to
          deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The former of these characters is, and ever hath been, the favourite
          of the world. It is the character of great men. There is a dignity in
          it which universally commands respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latter is poor-spirited, tame, and abject. Yet so it hath
          happened, that with the Founder of Christianity this latter is the
          subject of his commendation, his precepts, his example; and that the
          former is so in no part of its composition. This, and nothing else, is
          the character designed in the following remarkable passages:
          &quot;Resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on the right
          cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any man will sue thee at the
          law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also: and
          whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain: love your
          enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and
          pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you.&quot; This
          certainly is not commonplace morality. It is very original. It shows
          at least (and it is for this purpose we produce it) that no two things
          can be more different than the Heroic and the Christian characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the author to whom I refer has not only marked this difference
          more strongly than any preceding writer, but has proved, in
          contradiction to first impressions, to popular opinion, to the
          encomiums of orators and poets, and even to the suffrages of
          historians and moralists, that the latter character possesses the most
          of true worth, both as being most difficult either to be acquired or
          sustained, and as contributing most to the happiness and tranquillity
          of social life. The state of his argument is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. If this disposition were universal, the case is clear; the world
          would be a society of friends. Whereas, if the other disposition were
          universal, it would produce a scene of universal contention. The world
          could not hold a generation of such men.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. If, what is the fact, the disposition be partial; if a few be
          actuated by it, amongst a multitude who are not; in whatever degree it
          does prevail, in the same proportion it prevents, allays, and
          terminates quarrels, the great disturbers of human happiness, and the
          great sources of human misery, so far as man&#x27;s happiness and
          misery depend upon man. Without this disposition enmities must not
          only be frequent, but, once begun, must be eternal: for, each
          retaliation being a fresh injury, and consequently requiring a fresh
          satisfaction, no period can be assigned to the reciprocation of
          affronts, and to the progress of hatred, but that which closes the
          lives, or at least the intercourse, of the parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would only add to these observations, that although the former of
          the two characters above described may be occasionally useful;
          although, perhaps, a great general, or a great statesman, may be
          formed by it, and these may be instruments of important benefits to
          mankind, yet is this nothing more than what is true of many qualities
          which are acknowledged to be vicious. Envy is a quality of this sort:
          I know not a stronger stimulus to exertion; many a scholar, many an
          artist, many a soldier, has been produced by it; nevertheless, since
          in its general effects it is noxious, it is properly condemned,
          certainly is not praised, by sober moralists.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a portion of the same character as that we are defending, or
          rather of his love of the same character, which our Saviour displayed
          in his repeated correction of the ambition of his disciples; his
          frequent admonitions that greatness with them was to consist in
          humility; his censure of that love of distinction and greediness of
          superiority which the chief persons amongst his countrymen were wont,
          on all occasions, great and little, to betray. &quot;They (the Scribes
          and Pharisees) love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats
          in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of
          men Rabbi, Rabbi. But be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your Master,
          even Christ, and all ye are brethren: and call no man your father upon
          the earth, for one is your father, which is in heaven; neither be ye
          called master, for one is your Master, even Christ; but he that is
          greatest among you shall be your servant; and whosoever shall exalt
          himself shall be abased, and he that shall humble himself shall be
          exalted.&quot; (Matt. xxiii. 6. See also Mark xii. 39; Luke xx. 46;
          xiv. 7.) I make no further remark upon these passages (because they
          are, in truth, only a repetition of the doctrine, different
          expressions of the principle, which we have already stated), except
          that some of the passages, especially our Lord&#x27;s advice to the
          guests at an entertainment, (Luke iv. 7.) seem to extend the rule to
          what we call manners; which was both regular in point of consistency,
          and not so much beneath the dignity of our Lord&#x27;s mission as may
          at first sight be supposed, for bad manners are bad morals.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is sufficiently apparent that the precepts we have tired, or rather
          the disposition which these precepts inculcate, relate to personal
          conduct from personal motives; to cases in which men act from impulse,
          for themselves and from themselves. When it comes to be considered
          what is necessary to be done for the sake of the public, and out of a
          regard to the general welfare (which consideration, for the most part,
          ought exclusively to govern the duties of men in public stations), it
          comes to a case to which the rules do not belong. This distinction is
          plain; and if it were less so the consequence would not be much felt:
          for it is very seldom that in time intercourse of private life men act
          with public views. The personal motives from which they do act the
          rule regulates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The preference of time patient to the heroic cheer, which we have here
          noticed, and which the reader will find explained at large in the work
          to which we have referred him, is a peculiarity in the Christian
          institution, which I propose as an argument of wisdom, very much
          beyond the situation and natural character of the person who delivered
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. A second argument, drawn from the morality of the New Testament,
          is the stress which is laid by our Saviour upon the regulation of the
          thoughts; and I place this consideration next to the other because
          they are connected. The other related to the malicious passions; this
          to the voluptuous. Together, they comprehend the whole character.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
          fornications,&quot; &amp;c. &quot;These are the things which defile a
          man.&quot; (Matt. xv. 19.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Wo unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
          clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are
          full of extortion and excess.—Ye are like unto whited sepulchres,
          which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead
          men&#x27;s bones, and of all uncleanness; even so ye also outwardly
          appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and
          iniquity&quot; (Matt. xxiii. 25, 27)
        </p>
        <p>
          And more particularly that strong expression, (Matt. v. 28.)
          &quot;Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed
          adultery with her already in his heart.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          There can be no doubt with any reflecting mind but that the
          propensities of our nature must be subject to regulation; but the
          question is, where the check ought to be placed, upon the thought, or
          only upon the action? In this question our Saviour, in the texts here
          quoted, has pronounced a decisive judgment. He makes the control of
          thought essential. Internal purity with him is everything. Now I
          contend that this is the only discipline which can succeed; in other
          words, that a moral system which prohibits actions, but leaves the
          thoughts at liberty, will be ineffectual, and is therefore unwise. I
          know not how to go about the proof of a point which depends upon
          experience, and upon a knowledge of the human constitution, better
          than by citing the judgment of persons who appear to have given great
          attention to the subject, and to be well qualified to form a true
          opinion about it. Boerhaave, speaking of this very declaration of our
          Saviour, &quot;Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath
          already committed adultery with her in his heart,&quot; and
          understanding it, as we do, to contain an injunction to lay the check
          upon the thoughts, was wont to say that &quot;our Saviour knew mankind
          better than Socrates.&quot; Hailer, who has recorded this saying of
          Boerhaave, adds to it the following remarks of his own:—(Letters to
          his Daughter.) &quot;It did not escape the observation of our Saviour
          that the rejection of any evil thoughts was the best defence against
          vice: for when a debauched person fills his imagination with impure
          pictures, the licentious ideas which he recalls fail not to stimulate
          his desires with a degree of violence which he cannot resist. This
          will be followed by gratification, unless some external obstacle
          should prevent him from the commission of a sin which he had
          internally resolved on.&quot; &quot;Every moment of time,&quot; says
          our author, &quot;that is spent in meditations upon sin increases the
          power of the dangerous object which has possessed our
          imagination.&quot; I suppose these reflections will be generally
          assented to.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, had a teacher of morality been asked concerning a
          general principle of conduct, and for a short rule of life; and had he
          instructed the person who consulted him, &quot;constantly to refer his
          actions to what he believed to be the will of his Creator, and
          constantly to have in view not his own interest and gratification
          alone, but the happiness and comfort of those about him,&quot; he
          would have been thought, I doubt not, in any age of the world, and in
          any, even the most improved state of morals, to have delivered a
          judicious answer; because, by the first direction, he suggested the
          only motive which acts steadily and uniformly, in sight and out of
          sight, in familiar occurrences and under pressing temptations; and in
          the second he corrected what of all tendencies in the human character
          stands most in need of correction, selfishness, or a contempt of other
          men&#x27;s conveniency and satisfaction. In estimating the value of a
          moral rule, we are to have regard not only to the particular duty, but
          the general spirit; not only to what it directs us to do, but to the
          character which a compliance with its direction is likely to form in
          us. So, in the present instance, the rule here recited will never fail
          to make him who obeys it considerate not only of the rights, but of
          the feelings of other men, bodily and mental, in great matters and in
          small; of the ease, the accommodation, the self-complacency of all
          with whom he has any concern, especially of all who are in his power,
          or dependent upon his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now what, in the most applauded philosopher of the most enlightened
          age of the world, would have been deemed worthy of his wisdom, and of
          his character, to say, our Saviour hath said, and upon just such an
          occasion as that which we have feigned.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
          tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in
          the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
          all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; this is
          the first and great commandment: and the second is like unto it, Thou
          shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: on these two commandments hang
          all the law and the prophets.&quot; (Matt. xxii. 35-40.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The second precept occurs in St. Matthew (xix. 16), on another
          occasion similar to this; and both of them, on a third similar
          occasion, in Luke (x. 27). In these two latter instances the question
          proposed was, &quot;What shall I do to inherit eternal life?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon all these occasions I consider the words of our Saviour as
          expressing precisely the same thing as what I have put into the mouth
          of the moral philosopher. Nor do I think that it detracts much from
          the merit of the answer, that these precepts are extant in the Mosaic
          code: for his laying his finger, if I may so say, upon these precepts;
          his drawing them out from the rest of that voluminous institution; his
          stating of them, not simply amongst the number, but as the greatest
          and the sum of all the others; in a word, his proposing of them to his
          hearers for their rule and principle, was our Saviour&#x27;s own.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what our Saviour had said upon the subject appears to me to have
          fixed the sentiment amongst his followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saint Paul has it expressly, &quot;If there be any other commandment,
          it is briefly comprehended in this saying, Thou shalt love thy
          neighbour as thyself;&quot; (Rom. xiii. 9.) and again, &quot;For all
          the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy
          neighbour as thyself.&quot; (Gal. v. 14.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Saint John, in like manner, &quot;This commandment have we from him,
          that he who loveth God love his brother also.&quot; (1 John iv. 21.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Saint Peter, not very differently: &quot;Seeing that ye have purified
          your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit, unto unfeigned
          love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart
          fervently.&quot; (I Peter i, 22.)
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is so well known as to require no citations to verify it, that
          this love, or charity, or, in other words, regard to the welfare of
          others, runs in various forms through all the preceptive parts of the
          apostolic writings. It is the theme of all their exhortations, that
          with which their morality begins and ends, from which all their
          details and enumerations set out, and into which they return.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that this temper, for some time at least, descended in its purity
          to succeeding Christians, is attested by one of the earliest and best
          of the remaining writings of the apostolical fathers, the epistle of
          the Roman Clement. The meekness of the Christian character reigns
          throughout the whole of that excellent piece. The occasion called for
          it. It was to compose the dissensions of the church of Corinth. And
          the venerable hearer of the apostles does not fall short, in the
          display of this principle, of the finest passages of their writings.
          He calls to the remembrance of the Corinthian church its former
          character in which &quot;ye were all of you,&quot; he tells them,
          &quot;humble-minded, not boasting of anything, desiring rather to be
          subject than to govern, to give than to receive, being content with
          the portion God had dispensed to you and hearkening diligently to his
          word; ye were enlarged in your bowels, having his sufferings always
          before your eyes. Ye contended day and night for the whole
          brotherhood, that with compassion and a good conscience the number of
          his elect might be saved. Ye were sincere, and without offence towards
          each other. Ye bewailed every one his neighbour&#x27;s sins, esteeming
          their defects your own.&quot; His prayer for them was for the
          &quot;return of peace, long-suffering, and patience.&quot; (Ep. Clem.
          Rom. c. 2 &amp; 53; Abp. Wake&#x27;s Translation.) And his advice to
          those who might have been the occasion of difference in the society is
          conceived in the true spirit, and with a perfect knowledge of the
          Christian character: &quot;Who is there among you that is generous?
          who that is compassionate? Who that has any charity? Let him say, If
          this sedition, this contention, and these schisms be upon my account,
          I am ready to depart, to go away whithersoever ye please, and do
          whatsoever ye shall command me; only let the flock of Christ be in
          peace with the elders who are set over it. He that shall do this shall
          get to himself a very great honour in the Lord; and there is no place
          but what will he ready to receive him; for the earth is the
          Lord&#x27;s and the fullness thereof. These things they who have their
          conversation towards God, not to be repented of, both have done, and
          will always be ready to do.&quot; (Ep. Clem. Rom. c. 54; Abp.
          Wake&#x27;s Translation.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This sacred principle, this earnest recommendation of forbearance,
          lenity, and forgiveness, mixes with all the writings of that age.
          There are more quotations in the apostolical fathers of texts which
          relate to these points than of any other. Christ&#x27;s sayings had
          struck them. &quot;Not rendering,&quot; said Polycarp, the disciple of
          John, &quot;evil for evil, or railing for railing, or striking for
          striking, or cursing for cursing.&quot; Again, speaking of some whose
          behaviour had given great offence, &quot;Be ye moderate,&quot; says
          he, &quot;on this occasion, and look not upon such as enemies, but
          call them back as suffering and erring members, that ye save your
          whole body.&quot; (Pol. Ep. ad Phil. c. 2 &amp; 11.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Be ye mild at their anger,&quot; saith Ignatius, the companion
          of Polycarp, &quot;humble at their boastings, to their blasphemies
          return your prayers, to their error your firmness in the faith; when
          they are cruel, be ye gentle; not endeavouring to imitate their ways,
          let us be their brethren in all kindness and moderation: but let us be
          followers of the Lord; for who was ever more unjustly used, more
          destitute, more despised?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. A fourth quality by which the morality of the Gospel is
          distinguished is the exclusion of regard to fame and reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of
          them, otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in
          heaven.&quot; &quot;When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
          thou hast shut the door, pray to thy father which is in secret; and
          thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.&quot;
          (Matt. vi. 1 &amp; 6.)
        </p>
        <p>
          And the rule, by parity of reason, is extended to all other virtues.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not think that either in these or in any other passage of the New
          Testament, the pursuit of fame is stated as a vice; it is only said
          that an action, to be virtuous, must be independent of it. I would
          also observe that it is not publicity, but ostentation, which is
          prohibited; not the mode, but the motive of the action, which is
          regulated. A good man will prefer that mode, as well as those objects
          of his beneficence, by which he can produce the greatest effect; and
          the view of this purpose may dictate sometimes publication, and
          sometimes concealment. Either the one or the other may be the mode of
          the action, according as the end to be promoted by it appears to
          require. But from the motive, the reputation of the deed, and the
          fruits and advantage of that reputation to ourselves, must be shut
          out, or, in whatever proportion they are not so, the action in that
          proportion fails of being virtuous.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exclusion of regard to human opinion is a difference not so much
          in the duties to which the teachers of virtue would persuade mankind,
          as in the manner and topics of persuasion. And in this view the
          difference is great. When we set about to give advice, our lectures
          are full of the advantages of character, of the regard that is due to
          appearances and to opinion; of what the world, especially of what the
          good or great, will think and say; of the value of public esteem, and
          of the qualities by which men acquire it. Widely different from this
          was our Saviour&#x27;s instruction; and the difference was founded
          upon the best reasons. For, however the care of reputation, the
          authority of public opinion, or even of the opinion of good men, the
          satisfaction of being well received and well thought of, the benefit
          of being known and distinguished, are topics to which we are fain to
          have recourse in our exhortations; the true virtue is that which
          discards these considerations absolutely, and which retires from them
          all to the single internal purpose of pleasing God. This at least was
          the virtue which our Saviour taught. And in teaching this, he not only
          confined the views of his followers to the proper measure and
          principle of human duty, but acted in consistency with his office as a
          monitor from heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to what our Saviour taught, may be considered the manner of his
          teaching; which was extremely peculiar, yet, I think, precisely
          adapted to the peculiarity of his character and situation. His lessons
          did not consist of disquisitions; of anything like moral essays, or
          like sermons, or like set treatises upon the several points which he
          mentioned. When he delivered a precept, it was seldom that he added
          any proof or argument; still more seldom that he accompanied it with
          what all precepts require, limitations and distinctions. His
          instructions were conceived in short, emphatic, sententious rules, in
          occasional reflections, or in round maxims. I do not think that this
          was a natural, or would have been a proper method for a philosopher or
          a moralist; or that it is a method which can be successfully imitated
          by us. But I contend that it was suitable to the character which
          Christ assumed, and to the situation in which, as a teacher, he was
          placed. He produced himself as a messenger from God. He put the truth
          of what he taught upon authority. (I say unto you, Swear not at all; I
          say auto you, Resist not evil; I say unto you, Love your
          enemies.—Matt. v. 34, 39, 44.) In the choice, therefore, of his mode
          of teaching, the purpose by him to be consulted was impression:
          because conviction, which forms the principal end of our discourses,
          was to arise in the minds of his followers from a different source,
          from their respect to his person and authority. Now, for the purpose
          of impression singly and exclusively, (I repeat again, that we are not
          here to consider the convincing of the understanding,) I know nothing
          which would have so great force as strong ponderous maxims, frequently
          urged and frequently brought back to the thoughts of the hearers. I
          know nothing that could in this view be said better, than &quot;Do
          unto others as ye would that others should do unto you:&quot;
          &quot;The first and great commandment is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy
          God: and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
          thyself.&quot; It must also be remembered, that our Lord&#x27;s
          ministry, upon the supposition either of one year or three, compared
          with his work, was of short duration; that, within this time, he had
          many places to visit, various audiences to address; that his person
          was generally besieged by crowds of followers; that he was, sometimes,
          driven away from the place where he was teaching by persecution, and
          at other times thought fit to withdraw himself from the commotions of
          the populace. Under these circumstances, nothing appears to have been
          so practicable, or likely to be so efficacious, as leaving, wherever
          he came, concise lessons of duty. These circumstances at least show
          the necessity he was under of comprising what he delivered within a
          small compass. In particular, his sermon upon the mount ought always
          to be considered with a view to these observations. The question is
          not, whether a fuller, a more accurate, a more systematic, or a more
          argumentative discourse upon morals might not have been pronounced;
          but whether more could have been said in the same room better adapted
          to the exigencies of the hearers, or better calculated for the purpose
          of impression? Seen in this light, it has always appeared to me to be
          admirable. Dr. Lardner thought that this discourse was made up of what
          Christ had said at different times, and on different occasions,
          several of which occasions are noticed in St Luke&#x27;s narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can perceive no reason for this opinion. I believe that our Lord
          delivered this discourse at one time and place, in the manner related
          by Saint Matthew, and that he repeated the same rules and maxims at
          different times, as opportunity or occasion suggested; that they were
          often in his mouth, and were repeated to different audiences, and in
          various conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is incidental to this mode of moral instruction, which proceeds not
          by proof but upon authority, not by disquisition but by precept, that
          the rules will be conceived in absolute terms, leaving the application
          and the distinctions that attend it to the reason of the hearer. It is
          likewise to be expected that they will be delivered in terms by so
          much the more forcible and energetic, as they have to encounter
          natural or general propensities. It is further also to be remarked,
          that many of those strong instances which appear in our Lord&#x27;s
          sermon, such as, &quot;If any man will smite thee on the right cheek,
          turn to him the other also:&quot; &quot;If any man will sue thee at
          the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also:&quot;
          &quot;Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him
          twain:&quot; though they appear in the form of specific precepts, are
          intended as descriptive of disposition and character. A specific
          compliance with the precepts would be of little value, but the
          disposition which they inculcate is of the highest. He who should
          content himself with waiting for the occasion, and with literally
          observing the rule when the occasion offered, would do nothing, or
          worse than nothing: but he who considers the character and disposition
          which is hereby inculcated, and places that disposition before him as
          the model to which he should bring his own, takes, perhaps, the best
          possible method of improving the benevolence, and of calming and
          rectifying the vices of his temper.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be said that this disposition is unattainable, I answer, so is
          all perfection: ought therefore a moralist to recommend imperfections?
          One excellency, however, of our Saviour&#x27;s rules is, that they are
          either never mistaken, or never so mistaken as to do harm. I could
          feign a hundred cases in which the literal application of the rule,
          &quot;of doing to others as we would that others should do unto
          us,&quot; might mislead us; but I never yet met with the man who was
          actually misled by it. Notwithstanding that our Lord bade his
          followers, &quot;not to resist evil,&quot; and to &quot;forgive the
          enemy who should trespass against them, not till seven times, but till
          seventy times seven,&quot; the Christian world has hitherto suffered
          little by too much placability or forbearance. I would repeat once
          more, what has already been twice remarked, that these rules were
          designed to regulate personal conduct from personal motives, and for
          this purpose alone. I think that these observations will assist us
          greatly in placing our Saviour&#x27;s conduct as a moral teacher in a
          proper point of view; especially when it is considered, that to
          deliver moral disquisitions was no part of his design,—to teach
          morality at all was only a subordinate part of it; his great business
          being to supply what was much more wanting than lessons of morality,
          stronger moral sanctions, and clearer assurances of a future
          judgment.*

          * Some appear to require in a religious system, or in the books which
          profess to deliver that system, minute directions for every case and
          occurrence that may arise. This, say they, is necessary to render a
          revelation perfect, especially one which has for its object the
          regulation of human conduct. Now, how prolix, and yet how incomplete
          and unavailing, such an attempt must have been, is proved by one
          notable example: &quot;The Indoo and Mussulman religions are
          institutes of civil law, regulating the minutest questions, both of
          property and of all questions which come under the cognizance of the
          magistrate. And to what length details of this kind are necessarily
          carried when once begun, may be understood from an anecdote of the
          Mussulman code, which we have received from the most respectable
          authority, that not less than seventy-five thousand traditional
          precepts have been promulgated.&quot; (Hamilton&#x27;s translation of
          Hedays, or Guide.) _________

        <p>
          The parables of the New Testament are, many of them, such as would
          have done honour to any book in the world: I do not mean in style and
          diction, but in the choice of the subjects, in the structure of the
          narratives, in the aptness, propriety, and force of the circumstances
          woven into them; and in some, as that of the Good Samaritan, the
          Prodigal Son, the Pharisee and the Publican, in an union of pathos and
          simplicity, which in the best productions of human genius is the fruit
          only of a much exercised and well cultivated judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord&#x27;s Prayer, for a succession of solemn thoughts, for
          fixing the attention upon a few great points, for suitableness to
          every condition, for sufficiency, for conciseness without obscurity,
          for the weight and real importance of its petitions, is without an
          equal or a rival.
        </p>
        <p>
          From whence did these come? Whence had this man his wisdom? Was our
          Saviour, in fact, a well instructed philosopher, whilst he is
          represented to us as an illiterate peasant? Or shall we say that some
          early Christians of taste and education composed these pieces and
          ascribed them to Christ? Beside all other incredibilities in this
          account, I answer, with Dr. Jortin, that they could not do it. No
          specimens of composition which the Christians of the first century
          have left us authorise us to believe that they were equal to the task.
          And how little qualified the Jews, the countrymen and companions of
          Christ, were to assist him in the undertaking, may be judged of from
          the traditions and writings of theirs which were the nearest to that
          age. The whole collection of the Talmud is one continued proof into
          what follies they fell whenever they left their Bible; and how little
          capable they were of furnishing out such lessons as Christ delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is still another view in which our Lord&#x27;s discourses
          deserve to be considered; and that is, in their negative
          character,—not in what they did, but in what they did not, contain.
          Under this head the following reflections appear to me to possess some
          weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. They exhibit no particular description of the invisible world. The
          future happiness of the good, and the misery of the bad, which is all
          we want to be assured of, is directly and positively affirmed, and is
          represented by metaphors and comparisons, which were plainly intended
          as metaphors and comparisons, and as nothing more. As to the rest, a
          solemn reserve is maintained. The question concerning the woman who
          had been married to seven brothers, &quot;Whose shall she be on the
          resurrection?&quot; was of a nature calculated to have drawn from
          Christ a more circumstantial account of the state of the human species
          in their future existence. He cuts short, however, the inquiry by an
          answer, which at once rebuked intruding curiosity, and was agreeable
          to the best apprehensions we are able to form upon the subject, viz.
          &quot;That they who are accounted worthy of that resurrection, shall
          be as the angels of God in heaven.&quot; I lay a stress upon this
          reserve, because it repels the suspicion of enthusiasm: for enthusiasm
          is wont to expatiate upon the condition of the departed, above all
          other subjects, and with a wild particularity. It is moreover a topic
          which is always listened to with greediness. The teacher, therefore,
          whose principal purpose is to draw upon himself attention, is sure to
          be full of it. The Koran of Mahomet is half made up of it.

          II. Our Lord enjoined no austerities. He not only enjoined none as
          absolute duties, but he recommended none as carrying men to a higher
          degree of Divine favour. Place Christianity, in this respect, by the
          side of all institutions which have been founded in the fanaticism
          either of their author or of his first followers: or, rather, compare
          in this respect Christianity, as it came from Christ, with the same
          religion after it fell into other hands—with the extravagant merit
          very soon ascribed to celibacy, solitude, voluntary poverty; with the
          rigours of an ascetic, and the vows of a monastic life; the
          hair-shirt, the watchings, the midnight prayers, the obmutescence, the
          gloom and mortification of religious orders, and of those who aspired
          to religious perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Our Saviour uttered no impassioned devotion. There was no heat in
          his piety, or in the language in which he expressed it; no vehement or
          rapturous ejaculations, no violent urgency, in his prayers. The
          Lord&#x27;s Prayer is a model of calm devotion. His words in the
          garden are unaffected expressions of a deep, indeed, but sober piety.
          He never appears to have been worked up into anything like that
          elation, or that emotion of spirits which is occasionally observed in
          most of those to whom the name of enthusiast can in any degree be
          applied. I feel a respect for Methodists, because I believe that there
          is to be found amongst them much sincere piety, and availing though
          not always well-informed Christianity: yet I never attended a meeting
          of theirs but I came away with the reflection, how different what I
          heard was from what I read! I do not mean in doctrine, with which at
          present I have no concern, but in manner how different from the
          calmness, the sobriety, the good sense, and I may add, the strength
          and authority of our Lord&#x27;s discourses!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. It is very usual with the human mind to substitute forwardness and
          fervency in a particular cause for the merit of general and regular
          morality; and it is natural, and politic also, in the leader of a sect
          or party, to encourage such a disposition in his followers. Christ did
          not overlook this turn of thought; yet, though avowedly placing
          himself at the head of a new institution, he notices it only to
          condemn it. &quot;Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
          enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
          Father which is in heaven. Many will say unto me in that day, Lord,
          Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast
          out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I
          profess unto you, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work
          iniquity.&quot; (Matt. vii. 21, 22.) So far was the Author of
          Christianity from courting the attachment of his followers by any
          sacrifice of principle, or by a condescension to the errors which even
          zeal in his service might have inspired. This was a proof both of
          sincerity and judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Nor, fifthly, did he fall in with any of the depraved fashions of
          his country, or with the natural bias of his own education. Bred up a
          Jew, under a religion extremely technical, in an age and amongst a
          people more tenacious of the ceremonies than of any other part of that
          religion, he delivered an institution containing less of ritual, and
          that more simple, than is to be found in any religion which ever
          prevailed amongst mankind. We have known, I do allow, examples of an
          enthusiasm which has swept away all external ordinances before it. But
          this spirit certainly did not dictate our Saviour&#x27;s conduct,
          either in his treatment of the religion of his country, or in the
          formation of his own institution. In both he displayed the soundness
          and moderation of his judgment. He censured an overstrained
          scrupulousness, or perhaps an affectation of scrupulousness, about the
          Sabbath: but how did he censure it? not by contemning or decrying the
          institution itself, but by declaring that &quot;the Sabbath was made
          for man, not man for the Sabbath;&quot; that is to say, that the
          Sabbath was to be subordinate to its purpose, and that that purpose
          was the real good of those who were the subjects of the law. The same
          concerning the nicety of some of the Pharisees, in paying tithes of
          the most trifling articles, accompanied with a neglect of justice,
          fidelity, and mercy. He finds fault with them for misplacing their
          anxiety. He does not speak disrespectfully of the law of tithes, nor
          of their observance of it; but he assigns to each class of duties its
          proper station in the scale of moral importance. All this might be
          expected perhaps from a well-instructed, cool, and judicious
          philosopher, but was not to be looked for from an illiterate Jew;
          certainly not from an impetuous enthusiast.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Nothing could be more quibbling than were the comments and
          expositions of the Jewish doctors at that time; nothing so puerile as
          their distinctions. Their evasion of the fifth commandment, their
          exposition of the law of oaths, are specimens of the bad taste in
          morals which then prevailed. Whereas, in a numerous collection of our
          Saviour&#x27;s apophthegms, many of them referring to sundry precepts
          of the Jewish law, there is not to be found one example of sophistry,
          or of false subtlety, or of anything approaching thereunto.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. The national temper of the Jews was intolerant, narrow-minded,
          and excluding. In Jesus, on the contrary, whether we regard his
          lessons or his example, we see not only benevolence, but benevolence
          the most enlarged and comprehensive. In the parable of the Good
          Samaritan, the very point of the story is, that the person relieved by
          him was the national and religious enemy of his benefactor. Our Lord
          declared the equity of the Divine administration, when he told the
          Jews, (what, probably, they were surprised to hear,) &quot;That many
          should come from the east and west, and should sit down with Abraham,
          Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; but that the children of
          the kingdom should be cast into outer darkness.&quot; (Matt. viii.
          11.) His reproof of the hasty zeal of his disciples, who would needs
          call down fire from heaven to revenge an affront put upon their
          Master, shows the lenity of his character, and of his religion: and
          his opinion of the manner in which the most unreasonable opponents
          ought to be treated, or at least of the manner in which they ought not
          to be treated. The terms in which his rebuke was conveyed deserve to
          be noticed:—&quot;Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.&quot;
          (Luke ix. 55.)
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Lastly, amongst the negative qualities of our religion, as it
          came out of the hands of its Founder and his apostles, we may reckon
          its complete abstraction from all views either of ecclesiastical or
          civil policy; or, to meet a language much in fashion with some men,
          from the politics either of priests or statesmen. Christ&#x27;s
          declaration, that &quot;his kingdom was not of this world,&quot;
          recorded by Saint John; his evasion of the question, whether it was
          lawful or not to give tribute unto Caesar, mentioned by the three
          other evangelists; his reply to an application that was made to him,
          to interpose his authority in a question of property; &quot;Man, who
          made me a ruler or a judge over you?&quot; ascribed to him by St.
          Luke; his declining to exercise the office of a criminal judge in the
          case of the woman taken in adultery, as related by John, are all
          intelligible significations of our Saviour&#x27;s sentiments upon this
          head. And with respect to politics, in the usual sense of that word,
          or discussions concerning different forms of government, Christianity
          declines every question upon the subject. Whilst politicians are
          disputing about monarchies, aristocracies, and republics, the Gospel
          is alike applicable, useful, and friendly to them all; inasmuch, as,
          1stly, it tends to make men virtuous, and as it is easier to govern
          good men than bad men under any constitution; as, 2ndly, it states
          obedience to government, in ordinary cases, to be not merely a
          submission to force, but a duty of conscience; as, 3rdly, it induces
          dispositions favourable to public tranquillity, a Christian&#x27;s
          chief care being to pass quietly through this world to a better; as,
          4thly, it prays for communities, and, for the governors of
          communities, of whatever description or denomination they be, with a
          solicitude and fervency proportioned to the influence which they
          possess upon human happiness. All which, in my opinion, is just as it
          should be. Had there been more to be found in Scripture of a political
          nature, or convertible to political purposes, the worst use would have
          been made of it, on whichever side it seemed to lie.
        </p>
        <p>
          When, therefore, we consider Christ as a moral teacher (remembering
          that this was only a secondary part of his office; and that morality,
          by the nature of the subject, does not admit of discovery, properly so
          called)—when we consider either what he taught, or what he did not
          teach, either the substance or the manner of his instruction; his
          preference of solid to popular virtues, of a character which is
          commonly despised to a character which is universally extolled; his
          placing, in our licentious vices, the check in the right place, viz.
          upon the thoughts; his collecting of human duty into two well-devised
          rules, his repetition of these rules, the stress he laid upon them,
          especially in comparison with positive duties, and his fixing thereby
          the sentiments of his followers; his exclusion of all regard to
          reputation in our devotion and alms, and by parity of reason in our
          other virtues;—when we consider that his instructions were delivered
          in a form calculated for impression, the precise purpose in his
          situation to be consulted; and that they were illustrated by parables,
          the choice and structure of which would have been admired in any
          composition whatever;—when we observe him free from the usual symptoms
          of enthusiasm, heat and vehemence in devotion, austerity in
          institutions, and a wild particularity in the description of a future
          state; free also from the depravities of his age and country; without
          superstition amongst the most superstitious of men, yet not decrying
          positive distinctions or external observances, but soberly calling
          them to the principle of their establishment, and to their place in
          the scale of human duties; without sophistry or trifling, amidst
          teachers remarkable for nothing so much as frivolous subtleties and
          quibbling expositions; candid and liberal in his judgment of the rest
          of mankind, although belonging to a people who affected a separate
          claim to Divine favour, and in consequence of that opinion prone to
          uncharitableness, partiality, and restriction;—when we find in his
          religion no scheme of building up a hierarchy, or of ministering to
          the views of human governments;—in a word, when we compare
          Christianity, as it came from its Author, either with other religions,
          or with itself in other hands, the most reluctant understanding will
          be induced to acknowledge the probity, I think also the good sense, of
          those to whom it owes its origin; and that some regard is due to the
          testimony of such men, when they declare their knowledge that the
          religion proceeded from God; and when they appeal for the truth of
          their assertion, to miracles which they wrought, or which they saw.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the qualities which we observe in the religion may be thought
          to prove something more. They would have been extraordinary had the
          religion come from any person; from the person from whom it did come,
          they are exceedingly so. What was Jesus in external appearance? A
          Jewish peasant, the son of a carpenter, living with his father and
          mother in a remote province of Palestine, until the time that he
          produced himself in his public character. He had no master to instruct
          or prompt him; he had read no books but the works of Moses and the
          prophets; he had visited no polished cities; he had received no
          lessons from Socrates or Plato,—nothing to form in him a taste or
          judgment different from that of the rest of his countrymen, and of
          persons of the same rank of life with himself. Supposing it to be
          true, which it is not, that all his points of morality might be picked
          out of Greek and Roman writings, they were writings which he had never
          seen. Supposing them to be no more than what some or other had taught
          in various times and places, he could not collect them together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who were his coadjutors in the undertaking,—the persons into whose
          hands the religion came after his death? A few fishermen upon the lake
          of Tiberias, persons just as uneducated, and, for the purpose of
          framing rules of morality, as unpromising as himself. Suppose the
          mission to be real, all this is accounted for; the unsuitableness of
          the authors to the production, of the characters to the undertaking,
          no longer surprises us: but without reality, it is very difficult to
          explain how such a system should proceed from such persons. Christ was
          not like any other carpenter; the apostles were not like any other
          fishermen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the subject is not exhausted by these observations. That portion
          of it which is most reducible to points of argument has been stated,
          and, I trust, truly. There are, however, some topics of a more diffuse
          nature, which yet deserve to be proposed to the reader&#x27;s
          attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          The character of Christ is a part of the morality of the Gospel: one
          strong observation upon which is, that, neither as represented by his
          followers, nor as attacked by his enemies, is he charged with any
          personal vice. This remark is as old as Origen: &quot;Though
          innumerable lies and calumnies had been forged against the venerable
          Jesus, none had dared to charge him with an intemperance.&quot; (Or.
          Ep. Cels. 1. 3, num. 36, ed. Bened.) Not a reflection upon his moral
          character, not an imputation or suspicion of any offence against
          purity and chastity, appears for five hundred years after his birth.
          This faultlessness is more peculiar than we are apt to imagine. Some
          stain pollutes the morals or the morality of almost every other
          teacher, and of every other lawgiver.* Zeno the stoic, and Diogenes
          the cynic, fell into the foulest impurities; of which also Socrates
          himself was more than suspected. Solon forbade unnatural crimes to
          slaves. Lycurgus tolerated theft as a part of education. Plato
          recommended a community of women. Aristotle maintained the general
          right of making war upon barbarians. The elder Cato was remarkable for
          the ill usage of his slaves; the younger gave up the person of his
          wife. One loose principle is found in almost all the Pagan moralists;
          is distinctly, however, perceived in the writings of Plato, Xenophon,
          Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus; and that is, the allowing, and even the
          recommending to their disciples, a compliance with the religion, and
          with the religious rites, of every country into which they came. In
          speaking of the founders of new institutions we cannot forget Mahomet.
          His licentious transgressions of his own licentious rules; his abuse
          of the character which he assumed, and of the power which he had
          acquired, for the purposes of personal and privileged indulgence; his
          avowed claim of a special permission from heaven of unlimited
          sensuality, is known to every reader, as it is confessed by every
          writer of the Moslem story.

          Secondly, in the histories which are left us of Jesus Christ, although
          very short, and although dealing in narrative, and not in observation
          or panegyric, we perceive, beside the absence of every appearance of
          vice, traces of devotion, humility, benignity, mildness, patience,
          prudence. I speak of traces of these qualities, because the qualities
          themselves are to be collected from incidents; inasmuch as the terms
          are never used of Christ in the Gospels, nor is any formal character
          of him drawn in any part of the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we see the devoutness of his mind in his frequent retirement to
          solitary prayer; (Matt. xiv. 23. Luke ix. 28. Matt. xxvi. 36.) in his
          habitual giving of thanks; (Matt. xi. 25. Mark viii. 6. John vi. 23.
          Luke xxii. 17.) in his reference of the beauties and operations of
          nature to the bounty of Providence; (Matt. vi, 26—28.) in his earnest
          addresses to his Father, more particularly that short but solemn one
          before the raising of Lazarus from the dead; (John xi. 41.) and in the
          deep piety of his behaviour in the garden on the last evening of his
          life:(Matt. xxvi. 86—47.) his humility in his constant reproof of
          contentions for superiority:(Mark ix. 33.) the benignity and
          affectionateness of his temper in his kindness to children; (Mark x.
          16.) in the tears which he shed over his falling country, (Luke xix.
          41.) and upon the death of his friend; (John xi. 35.) in his noticing
          of the widow&#x27;s mite; (Mark xii. 42.) in his parables of the good
          Samaritan, of the ungrateful servant, and of the Pharisee and
          publican, of which parables no one but a man of humanity could have
          been the author: the mildness and lenity of his character is
          discovered in his rebuke of the forward zeal of his disciples at the
          Samaritan village; (Luke ix. 55.) in his expostulation with Pilate;
          (John xix. 11.) in his prayer for his enemies at the moment of his
          suffering, (Luke xxiii. 34.) which, though it has been since very
          properly and frequently imitated, was then, I apprehend, new. His
          prudence is discerned, where prudence is most wanted, in his conduct
          on trying occasions, and in answers to artful questions. Of these the
          following are examples:—His withdrawing in various instances from the
          first symptoms of tumult, (Matt. xiv. 22. Luke v. 15, 16. John v. 13;
          vi. 15.) and with the express care, as appears from Saint Matthew,
          (Chap. xii. 19.) of carrying on his ministry in quietness; his
          declining of every species of interference with the civil affairs of
          the country, which disposition is manifested by his behaviour in the
          case of the woman caught in adultery, (John viii. 1.) and in his
          repulse of the application which was made to him to interpose his
          decision about a disputed inheritance:(Luke xii. 14.) his judicious,
          yet, as it should seem, unprepared answers, will be confessed in the
          case of the Roman tribute (Matt. xxii. 19.) in the difficulty
          concerning the interfering relations of a future state, as proposed to
          him in the instance of a woman who had married seven brethren; (Matt.
          xxii. 28.) and more especially in his reply to those who demanded from
          him an explanation of the authority by which he acted, which reply
          consisted in propounding a question to them, situated between the very
          difficulties into which they were insidiously endeavouring to draw
          him. (Matt. xxi. 23, et seq.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Saviour&#x27;s lessons, beside what has already been remarked in
          them, touch, and that oftentimes by very affecting representations,
          upon some of the most interesting topics of human duty, and of human
          meditation; upon the principles by which the decisions of the last day
          will be regulated; (Matt. xxv. 31, et seq.) upon the superior, or
          rather the supreme importance of religion; ( Mark viii. 35. Matt. vi.
          31—33. Luke xii. 4, 5, 16—21.) upon penitence, by the most pressing
          calls, and the most encouraging invitations; (Luke xv.) upon
          self-denial, (Matt. v. 29.) watchfulhess, (Mark xiii. 37. Matt. xxiv.
          42; xxv. 13.) placability, (Luke xvii. 4. Matt. xviii. 33, et seq.)
          confidence in God, (Matt. vi. 25—30.) the value of spiritual, that is,
          of mental worship, (John iv. 23, 24.) the necessity of moral
          obedience, and the directing of that obedience to the spirit and
          principle of the law, instead of seeking for evasions in a technical
          construction of its terms. (Matt. v. 21.)

          If we extend our argument to other parts of the New Testament, we may
          offer, as amongst the best and shortest rules of life, or, which is
          the same thing, descriptions of virtue, that have ever been delivered,
          the following passages:—
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Pure religion, and undefiled, before God and the Father, is
          this; to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
          keep himself unspotted from the world.&quot; (James i. 27.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Now the end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart
          and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.&quot; (I Tim. i. 5.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
          all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
          should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
          world.&quot; (Tit. ii. 11, 12.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Enumerations of virtues and vices, and those sufficiently accurate and
          unquestionably just, are given by St. Paul to his converts in three
          several epistles. (Gal. v. 19. Col. iii. 12. 1 Cor. xiii.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The relative duties of husbands and wives, of parents and children, of
          masters and servants, of Christian teachers and their flocks, of
          governors and their subjects, are set forth by the same writer, (Eph.
          v. 33; vi. 1—5. 2 Cor. vi. 6, 7. Rom. xiii.) not indeed with the
          copiousness, the detail, or the distinctness of a moralist who should
          in these days sit down to write chapters upon the subject, but with
          the leading rules and principles in each; and, above all, with truth
          and with authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, the whole volume of the New Testament is replete with piety;
          with what were almost unknown to heathen moralists, devotional
          virtues, the most profound veneration of the Deity, an habitual sense
          of his bounty and protection, a firm confidence in the final result of
          his counsels and dispensations, a disposition to resort upon all
          occasions to his mercy for the supply of human wants, for assistance
          in danger, for relief from pain, for the pardon of sin.
