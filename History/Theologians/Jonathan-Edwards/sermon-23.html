        <h2>Pressing into the Kingdom of God– Luke 26:16</h2>
        <p class="title">
          Luke 16:16, “The law and the prophets were until John; since that time
          the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In these words two things may be observed: First, Wherein the work and
          office of John the Baptist consisted, viz. in preaching the kingdom of
          God, to prepare the way for its introduction to succeed the law and
          the prophets. By the law and the prophets, in the text, seems to be
          intended the ancient dispensation under the Old Testament, which was
          received from Moses and the prophets. These are said to be until John;
          not that the revelations given by them are out of use since that time,
          but that the state of the church, founded and regulated under God by
          them, the dispensation of which they were the ministers, and wherein
          the church depended mainly on light received from them, fully
          continued till John. He first began to introduce the New Testament
          dispensation, or gospel-state of the church; which, with its glorious,
          spiritual, and eternal privileges and blessings, is often called the
          kingdom of heaven, or kingdom of God. John the Baptist preached, that
          the kingdom of God was at hand. “Repent” says he, “for the kingdom of
          heaven is at hand:”-“Since that time,” says Christ, “the kingdom of
          God is preached.” John the Baptist first began to preach it; and then,
          after him, Christ and his disciples preached the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus Christ preached, Matthew 4:17. “From that time Jesus began to
          preach, and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” So
          the disciples were directed to preach, Matthew 10:7. “And, as ye go,
          preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” It was not John the
          Baptist, but Christ, that fully brought in, and actually established,
          this kingdom of God; but he, as Christ’s forerunner to prepare his way
          before him, did the first thing that was done towards introducing it.
          The old dispensation was abolished, and the new brought in by degrees;
          as the night gradually ceases, and gives place to the increasing day
          which succeeds in its room.
        </p>
        <p>
          First the day-star arises; next follows the light of the sun itself,
          but dimly reflected, in the dawning of the day; but this light
          increases, and shines more and more, and the stars that served for
          light during the foregoing night, gradually go out, and their light
          ceases, as being now needless, till at length the sun rises, and
          enlightens the world by his own direct light, which increases as he
          ascends higher above the horizon, till the day-star itself gradually
          disappears; agreeable to what John says of himself, John 3:30. “He
          must increase, but I must decrease.” John was the forerunner of
          Christ, and harbinger of the gospel-day; much as the morning-star is
          the forerunner of the sun. He had the most honorable office of any of
          the prophets; the other prophets foretold Christ to come, he revealed
          him as already come, and had the honour to be that servant who should
          come immediately before him, and actually introduce him, and even to
          be the instrument concerned in his solemn inauguration, as he was in
          baptizing him. He was the greatest of the prophets that came before
          Christ, as the morning-star is the brightest of all the stars, Matthew
          11:11. He came to prepare men’s hearts to receive that kingdom of God
          which Christ was about more fully to reveal and erect. Luke 1:17. “To
          make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, We may observe wherein his success appeared, viz. in that
          since he began his ministry, every man pressed into that kingdom of
          God which he preached. The greatness of his success appeared in two
          things:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the generalness of it, with regard to the subject, or the
          persons in whom the success appeared; every man. Here is a term of
          universality; but it is not to be taken as universal with regard to
          individuals, but kinds; as such universal terms are often used in
          Scripture. When John preached, there was an extraordinary pouring out
          of the Spirit of God that attended his preaching. An uncommon
          awakening, and concern for salvation, appeared on the minds of all
          sorts of persons; and even in the most unlikely persons, and those
          from whom such a thing might least be expected; as the Pharisees, who
          were exceeding proud, and self-sufficient, and conceited of their own
          wisdom and righteousness, and looked on themselves fit to be teachers
          of others, and used to scorn to be taught; and the Sadducees, who were
          a kind of infidels, that denied any resurrection, angel, spirit, or
          any future state. So that John himself seems to be surprised to see
          them come to him, under such concern for their salvation; as in
          Matthew 3:7. “But when he saw many of the Pharisees come to his
          baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you
          to flee from the wrath to come?” And besides these, the publicans, who
          were some of the most infamous sort of men, came to him, inquiring
          what they should do to be saved. And the soldiers, who were doubtless
          a very profane, loose, and prolifigate sort of persons, made the same
          inquiry, Luke 3:12, and 14. “Then came also publicans to be baptized,
          and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? And the soldiers likewise
          demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. His success appeared in the manner in which his hearers sought the
          kingdom of God; they pressed into it. It is elsewhere set forth by
          their being violent for the kingdom of heaven, and taking it by force.
          Matthew 11:12. “From the days of John the Baptist until now, the
          kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Doctrine that I observe from the words is this,- “It concerns
          every one that would obtain the kingdom of God, to be pressing into
          it.” -In discoursing of this subject, I would,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Show what is that way of seeking salvation that seems to be
          pointed forth in the expression of pressing into the kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Give the reasons why it concerns every one that would obtain
          the kingdom of God, to seek it in this way.- And then make
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I would show what manner of seeking salvation seems to be denoted
          by “pressing into the kingdom of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This expression denotes strength of desire. Men in general who live
          under the light of the gospel, and are not atheists, desire the
          kingdom of God; that is, they desire to go to heaven rather than to
          hell. Most of them indeed are not much concerned about it; but on the
          contrary, live a secure and careless life. And some who are many
          degrees above these, being under some degrees of the awakenings of
          God’s Spirit, yet are not pressing into the kingdom of God. But they
          that may be said to be truly so, have strong desires to get out of a
          natural condition, and to get an interest in Christ. They have such a
          conviction of the misery of their present state, and of the extreme
          necessity of obtaining a better, that their minds are as it were
          possessed with and wrapped up in concern about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To obtain salvation is desired by them above all things in the world.
          This concern is so great that it very much shuts out other concerns.
          They used before to have the stream of their desires after other
          things, or, it may be, had their concern divided between this and
          them; but when they come to answer the expression of the text, of
          pressing into the kingdom of God, this concern prevails above all
          others; it lays other things low, and does in a manner engross the
          care of the mind. This seeking eternal life should not only be one
          concern that our souls are taken up about with other things; but
          salvation should be sought as the one thing needful, Luke 10:42. And
          as the one thing that is desired, Psalm 27:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Pressing into the kingdom of heaven denotes earnestness and
          firmness of resolution. There should be strength of resolution,
          accompanying strength of desire, as it was in the psalmist, in the
          place just now referred to: “one thing have I desired, and that will I
          seek after.” In order to a thorough engagedness of the mind in this
          affair, both these must meet together. Besides desires after
          salvation, there should be an earnest resolution in persons to pursue
          this good as much as lies in their power; to do all that in the use of
          their utmost strength they are able to do, in an attendance on every
          duty, and resisting and militating against all manner of sin, and to
          continue in such a pursuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two things needful in a person, in order to these strong
          resolutions; there must be a sense of the great importance and
          necessity of the mercy sought, and there must also be a sense of
          opportunity to obtain it, or the encouragement there is to seek it.
          The strength of resolution depends on the sense which God gives to the
          heart of these things. Persons without such a sense, may seem to
          themselves to take up resolutions; they may, as it were, force a
          promise to themselves, and say within themselves, “I will seek as long
          as I live, I will not give up till I obtain,” when they do but deceive
          themselves. Their hearts are not in it; neither do they indeed take up
          any such resolution as they seem to themselves to do. It is the
          resolution of the mouth more than of the heart; their hearts are not
          strongly bent to fulfill what their mouth says. The firmness of the
          resolution lies in the fulness of the disposition of the heart to do
          what is resolved to be done. Those who are pressing into the kingdom
          of God, have a disposition of heart to do everything that is required,
          and that lies in their power to do, and to continue in it. They have
          not only earnestness, but steadiness of resolution: they do not seek
          with a wavering unsteady heart, by turns or fits, being off and on;
          but it is the constant bent of the soul, if possible, to obtain the
          kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. By pressing into the kingdom of God is signified greatness of
          endeavor. It is expressed in Ecclesiastes 10:10. by doing what our
          hand finds to do with our might. And this is the natural and necessary
          consequence of the two forementioned things. Where there is strength
          of desire, and firmness of resolution, there will be answerable
          endeavors. Persons thus engaged in their hearts will “strive to enter
          in at the strait gate,” and will be violent for heaven; their practice
          will be agreeable to the counsel of the wise man, in Proverbs 2 at the
          beginning, “My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
          commandments with thee; so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom,
          and apply thine heart to understanding; yea, if thou criest after
          knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest
          her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; then shalt
          thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.”
          Here the earnestness of desire and strength of resolution is signified
          by inclining the ear to wisdom, and applying the heart to
          understanding; and the greatness of endeavor is denoted by crying
          after knowledge, and lifting up the voice for understanding; seeking
          her as silver, and searching for her as for hid treasures: such
          desires and resolutions, and such endeavors go together.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Pressing into the kingdom of God denotes an engagedness and
          earnestness, that is directly about that business of getting into the
          kingdom of God. Persons may be in very great exercise and distress of
          mind, and that about the condition of their souls; their thoughts and
          cares may be greatly engaged and taken up about things of a spiritual
          nature, and yet not be pressing into the kingdom of God, nor towards
          it. The exercise of their minds is not directly about the work of
          seeking salvation, in a diligent attendance on the means that God hath
          appointed in order to it, but something else that is beside their
          business; it may be God’s decrees and secret purposes, prying into
          them, searching for signs whereby they may determine, or at least
          conjecture, what they are before God makes them known by their
          accomplishment. They distress their minds with fears that they be not
          elected, or that they have committed the unpardonable sin, or that
          their day is past, and that God has given them up to judicial and
          final hardness, and never intends to show them mercy; and therefore,
          that it is in vain for them to seek salvation. Or they entangle
          themselves about the doctrine of original sin, and other mysterious
          doctrines of religion that are above their comprehension.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many persons that seem to be in great distress about a future eternal
          state, get much into a way of perplexing themselves with such things
          as these. When it is so, let them be never so much concerned and
          engaged in their minds, they cannot be said to be pressing towards the
          kingdom of God: because their exercise is not in their work, but
          rather that which tends to hinder them in their work. If they are
          violent, they are only working violently to entangle themselves, and
          lay blocks in their own way; their pressure is not forwards. Instead
          of getting along, they do but lose their time, and worse than merely
          lose it; instead of fighting with the giants that stand in the way to
          keep them out of Canaan, they spend away their time and strength in
          conflicting with shadows that appear by the wayside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence we are not to judge of the hopefulness of the way that persons
          are in, or of the probability of their success in seeking salvation,
          only by the greatness of the concern and distress that they are in;
          for many persons have needless distresses that they had much better be
          without. It is thus very often with persons overrun with the distemper
          of melancholy: whence the adversary of souls is wont to take great
          advantage. But then are persons in the most likely way to obtain the
          kingdom of heaven, when the intent of their minds, and the engagedness
          of their spirits, be about their proper work and business, and all the
          bent of their souls is to attend on God’s means, and to do what he
          commands and directs them to. The apostle tells us, I Corinthians
          9:26. “that he did not fight as those that beat the air.” Our time is
          short enough; we had not need to spend it in that which is nothing to
          the purpose. There are real difficulties and enemies enough for
          persons to encounter, to employ all their strength; they had not need
          to waste it in fighting with phantoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. By pressing into the kingdom of God is denoted a breaking through
          opposition and difficulties. There is in the expression a plain
          intimation of difficulty. If there were no opposition, but the way was
          all clear and open, there would be no need of pressing to get along.
          They therefore that are pressing into the kingdom of God, go on with
          such engagedness, that they break through the difficulties that are in
          the way. They are so set for salvation, that those things by which
          others are discouraged, and stopped, and turned back, do not stop
          them, but they press through them. Persons ought to be so resolved for
          heaven, that if by any means they can obtain, they will obtain.
          Whether those means be difficult or easy, cross or agreeable, if they
          are requisite means of salvation, they should be complied with. When
          anything is presented to be done, the question should not be, Is it
          easy or hard? is it agreeable to my carnal inclinations or interest,
          or against them? But is it a required means of my obtaining an
          interest in Jesus Christ, and eternal salvation? Thus the apostle,
          Philippians 3:11. “If by any means I might attain unto the
          resurrection of the dead.” He tells us there in the context what
          difficulties he broke through, that he suffered the loss of all
          things, and was willingly made conformable even to Christ’s death,
          though that was attended with such extreme torment and ignominy.
        </p>
        <p>
          He that is pressing into the kingdom of God, commonly finds many
          things in the way that are against the grain; but he is not stopped by
          the cross that lies before him, but takes it up, and carries it.
          Suppose there be something incumbent on him to do, that is cross to
          his natural temper, and irksome to him on that account; suppose
          something that he cannot do without suffering in his estate, or that
          he apprehends will look odd and strange in the eyes of others, and
          expose him to ridicule and reproach, or any thing that will offend a
          neighbor, and get his ill-will, or something that will be very cross
          to his own carnal appetite-he will press through such difficulties.
          Everything that is found to be a weight that hinders him in running
          this race he casts from him, though it be a weight of gold or pearls;
          yea, if it be a right hand or foot that offends him, he will cut them
          off, and will not stick at plucking out a right eye with his own
          hands. These things are insuperable difficulties to those who are not
          thoroughly engaged in seeking their salvation; they are
          stumbling-blocks that they never get over. But it is not so with him
          that presses into the kingdom of God. Those things (before he was
          thoroughly roused from his security) about which he was wont to have
          long parleyings and disputings with his own conscience-employing
          carnal reason to invent arguments and pleas of excuse-he now sticks at
          no longer; he has done with this endless disputing and reasoning, and
          presses violently through all difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let what will be in the way, heaven is what he must and will obtain,
          not if he can without difficulty, but if it be possible. He meets with
          temptation: the devil is often whispering in his ear, setting
          allurements before him, magnifying the difficulties of the work he is
          engaged in, telling him that they are insuperable, and that he can
          never conquer them, and trying all ways in the world to discourage
          him; but still he presses forward. God has given and maintains such an
          earnest spirit for heaven, that the devil cannot stop him in his
          course; he is not at leasure to lend an ear to what he has to say.-I
          come now,
        </p>
        <p>
          To show why the kingdom of heaven should be sought in this manner.-It
          should be thus sought,<br />
          1. On account of the extreme necessity we are in of getting into the
          kingdom of heaven. We are in a perishing necessity of it; without it
          we are utterly and eternally lost. Out of the kingdom of God is no
          safety; there is no other hiding-place; this is the only city of
          refuge, in which we can be secure from the avenger that pursues all
          the ungodly. The vengeance of God will pursue, overtake, and eternally
          destroy, them that are not in this kingdom. All that are without this
          enclosure will be swallowed up in an overflowing fiery deluge of
          wrath. They may stand at the door and knock, and cry, Lord, Lord, open
          to us, in vain; they will be thrust back; and God will have no mercy
          on them; they shall be eternally left of him. His fearful vengence
          will seize them; the devils will lay hold of them; and all evil will
          come upon them; and there will be none to pity or help; their case
          will be utterly desperate, and infinitely doleful. It will be a gone
          case with them; all offers of mercy and expressions of divine goodness
          will be finally withdrawn, and all hope will be lost. God will have no
          kind of regard to their well-being; will take no care of them to save
          them from any enemy, or any evil; but himself will be their dreadful
          enemy, and will execute wrath with fury, and will take vengeance in an
          inexpressibly dreadful manner. Such as shall be in this case will be
          lost and undone indeed! They will be sunk down into perdition,
          infinitely below all that we can think. For who knows the power of
          God’s anger? And who knows the misery of that poor worm, on whom that
          anger is executed without mercy?
        </p>

          2. On account of the shortness and uncertainty of the opportunity for
          getting into this kingdom. When a few days are past, all our
          opportunity for it will be gone. Our day is limited. God has set our
          bounds, and we know not where. While persons are out of this kingdom,
          they are in danger every hour of being overtaken with wrath. We know
          not how soon we shall get past that line, beyond which there is no
          work, device, knowledge, nor wisdom; and therefore we should do what
          we have to do with our might, Ecclesiastes 9:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. On account of the difficulty of getting into the kingdom of God.
          There are innumerable difficulties in the way; such as few conquer:
          most of them that try have not resolution, courage, earnestness, and
          constancy enough; but they fail, give up, and perish. The difficulties
          are too many and too great for them that do not violently press
          forward. They never get along, but stick by the way; are turned aside,
          or turned back, and ruined. Matthew 7:14. “Strait is the gate, and
          narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find
          it.” Luke 13:24. “Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I
          say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The possibility of obtaining. Though it be attended with so much
          difficulty, yet it is not a thing impossible. Acts 8:22. “If perhaps
          the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.” II Timothy 2:25. “If
          peradventure God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
          truth.” However sinful a person is, and whatever his circumstances
          are, there is, notwithstanding, a possibility of his salvation. He
          himself is capable of it, and God is able to accomplish it, and has
          mercy sufficient for it; and there is sufficient provision made
          through Christ, that God may do it consistent with the honour of his
          majesty, justice, and truth. So that there is no want either of
          sufficiency in God, or capacity in the sinner, in order to this. The
          greatest and vilest most blind, dead, hard-hearted sinner living, is a
          subject capable of saving light and grace. Seeing therefore there is
          such a necessity of obtaining the kingdom of God, and so short a time,
          and such difficulty, and yet such a possibility, it may well induce us
          to press into it. Jonah 3:8, 9.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It is meet that the kingdom of heaven should be thus sought,
          because of the great excellency of it. We are willing to seek earthly
          things, of trifling value, with great diligence, and through much
          difficulty; it therefore certainly becomes us to seek that with great
          earnestness which is of infinitely greater worth and excellence. And
          how well may God expect and require it of us, that we should seek it
          in such a manner, in order to our obtaining it!
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Such a manner of seeking is needful to prepare persons for the
          kingdom of God. Such earnestness and thoroughness of endeavors, is the
          ordinary means that God makes use of to bring persons to an
          acquaintance with themselves, to a sight of their own hearts, to a
          sense of their own helplessness, and to a despair in their own
          strength and righteousness. And such engagedness and constancy in
          seeking the kingdom of heaven, prepare the soul to receive it the more
          joyfully and thankfully, and the more highly to prize and value it
          when obtained. So that it is in mercy to us, as well as for the glory
          of his own name, that God has appointed such earnest seeking, to be
          the way in which he will bestow the kingdom of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          The use I would make of this doctrine, is of exhortation to all
          Christless persons to press into the kingdom of God. Some of you are
          inquiring what you shall do? You seem to desire to know what is the
          way wherein salvation is to be sought, and how you may be likely to
          obtain it. You have now heard the way that the holy word of God
          directs to. Some are seeking, but it cannot be said of them that they
          are pressing into the kingdom of heaven. There are many that in time
          past have sought salvation, but not in this manner, and so they never
          obtained, but are now gone to hell. Some of them sought it year after
          year, but failed of it, and perished at last. They were overtaken with
          divine wrath, and are now suffering the fearful misery of damnation,
          and have no rest day nor night, having no more opportunity to seek,
          but must suffer and be miserable throughout the never-ending ages of
          eternity. Be exhorted, therefore, not to seek salvation as they did,
          but let the kingdom of heaven suffer violence from you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I would first answer an objection or two, and then proceed to
          give some directions how to press into the kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objection. 1. Some may be ready to say, We cannot do this of
          ourselves; that strength of desire, and firmness of resolution, that
          have been spoken of, are out of our reach. If I endeavor to resolve
          and to seek with engagedness of spirit, I find I fail; my thoughts are
          presently off from the business, and I feel myself dull, and my
          engagedness relaxed, in spite of all I can do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer. 1. Though earnestness of mind be not immediately in your
          power, yet the consideration of what has been now said of the need of
          it, may be a means of stirring you up to it. It is true, persons never
          will be thoroughly engaged in this business, unless it be by God’s
          influence; but God influences persons by means. Persons are not
          stirred up to a thorough earnestness without some considerations that
          move them to it. And if persons can but be made sensible of the
          necessity of salvation, and also duly consider the exceeding difficuly
          of it, and the greatness of the opposition, and how short and
          uncertain the time is, but yet are sensible that they have an
          opportunity, and that there is a possibility of their obtaining, they
          will need no more in order to their being thoroughly engaged and
          resolved in this matter. If we see persons slack and unresolved, and
          unsteady, it is because they do not enough consider these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Though strong desires and resolutions of mind be not in your power,
          yet painfulness of endeavors is in your power. It is in your power to
          take pains in the use of means, yea very great pains. You can be very
          painful and diligent in watching your own heart, and striving against
          sin. Though there is all manner of corruption in the heart continually
          ready to work, yet you can very laboriously watch and strive against
          these corruptions; and it is in your power, with great diligence to
          attend the matter of your duty towards God and towards your neighbour.
          It is in your power to attend all ordinances, and all public and
          private duties of religion, and to do it with your might. It would be
          a contradiction to suppose that a man cannot do these things with all
          the might he has, though he cannot do them with more might than he
          has. The dullness and deadness of the heart, and slothfulness of
          disposition, do not hinder men being able to take pains, though it
          hinders their being willing. That is one thing wherein your
          laboriousness may appear, even striving against your own dullness.
          That men have a dead and sluggish heart, does not argue that they be
          not able to take pains; it is so far from that, that it gives occasion
          for pains. It is one of the difficulties in the way of duty, that
          persons have to strive with, and that gives occasion for struggling
          and labour. If there were no difficulties attended seeking salvation,
          there would be no occasion for striving; a man would have nothing to
          strive about. There is indeed a great deal of difficulty attending all
          duties required of those that would obtain heaven. It is an exceeding
          difficult thing for them to keep their thoughts; it is a difficult
          thing seriously, or to any good purpose, to consider matters of
          greatest importance; it is a difficult thing to hear, or read, or pray
          attentively. But it does not argue that a man cannot strive in these
          things because they are difficult; nay, he could not strive therein if
          there were not difficulty in them. For what is there excepting
          difficulties that any can have to strive or struggle with in any
          affair or business? Earnestness of mind, and diligence of endeavor,
          tend to promote each other. He that has a heart earnestly engaged,
          will take pains; and he that is diligent and painful in all duty,
          probably will not be so long before he finds the sensibleness of his
          heart and earnestness of his spirit greatly increased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objection 2. Some may object, that if they are earnest, and take a
          great deal of pains, they shall be in danger of trusting to what they
          do; they are afraid of doing their duty for fear of making a
          righteousness of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer. There is ordinarily no kind of seekers that trust so much to
          what they do, as slack and dull seekers. Though all seeking salvation,
          that have never been the subjects of a thorough humiliation, do trust
          in their own righteousness; yet some do it much more fully than
          others. Some though they trust in their own righteousness, yet are not
          quiet in it. And those who are most disturbed in their
          self-confidence, (and therefore in the likeliest way to be wholly
          brought off from it,) are not such as go on in a remiss way of
          seeking, but such as are most earnest and thoroughly engaged; partly
          because in such a way conscience is kept more sensible. A more
          awakened conscience will not rest so quietly in moral and religious
          duties, as one that is less awakened. A dull seeker’s conscience will
          be in a great measure satisfied and quieted with his own works and
          performances; but one that is thoroughly awakened cannot be stilled or
          pacified with such things as these. In this way persons gain much more
          knowledge of themselves, and acquaintance with their own hearts, than
          in a negligent, slight way of seeking; for they have a great deal more
          experience of themselves. It is experience of ourselves, and finding
          what we are, that God commonly makes use of as the means of bringing
          us off from all dependence on ourselves. But men never get
          acquaintance with themselves so fast, as in the most earnest way of
          seeking. They that are in this way have more to engage them to think
          of their sins, and strictly to observe themselves, and have much more
          to do with their own hearts, than others. Such a one has much more
          experience of his own weakness, than another that does not put forth
          and try his strength; and will therefore sooner see himself dead in
          sin. Such a one, though he hath a disposition continually to be flying
          to his own righteousness, yet finds rest in nothing; he wanders about
          from one thing to another, seeking something to ease his disquieted
          conscience; he is driven from one refuge to another, goes from
          mountain to hill, seeking rest and finding none; and therefore will
          the sooner prove that there is no rest to be found, nor trust to be
          put, in any creature whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is therefore quite a wrong notion that some entertain, that the
          more they do, the more they shall depend on it. Whereas the reverse is
          true; the more they do, or the more thorough they are in seeking, the
          less will they be likely to rest in their doings, and the sooner will
          they see the vanity of all that they do. So that persons will
          exceedingly miss it, if ever they neglect to do any duty either to God
          or man, whether it be any duty of religion, justice, or charity, under
          a notion of its exposing them to trust in their own righteousness. It
          is very true, that it is a common thing for persons, when they
          earnestly seek salvation, to trust in the pains that they take: but
          yet commonly those that go on in a more slight way, trust a great deal
          more securely to their dull services, than he that is pressing into
          the kingdom of God does to his earnestness. Men’s slackness in
          religion, and their trust in their own righteousness, strengthen and
          establish one another. Their trust in what they have done, and what
          they now do, settles them in a slothful rest and ease, and hinders
          their being sensible of their need of rousing up themselves and
          pressing forward. And on the other hand, their negligence tends so to
          benumb them in such ignorance of themselves, that the most miserable
          refuges are stupidly rested in as sufficient. Therefore we see, that
          when persons have been going on for a long time in such a way, and God
          afterwards comes more thoroughly to awaken them, and to stir them up
          to be in good earnest, he shakes all their old foundations, and rouses
          them out of their old resting places; so that they cannot quiet
          themselves with those things that formerly kept them secure. I would
          now proceed to give some directions how you should press into the
          kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Be directed to sacrifice every thing to your soul’s eternal
          interest. Let seeking this be so much your bent, and what you are so
          resolved in, that you will make every thing give place to it. Let
          nothing stand before your resolution of seeking the kingdom of God.
          Whatever it be that you used to look upon as a convenience, or
          comfort, or ease, or thing desirable on any account, if it stands in
          the way of this great concern, let it be dismissed without hesitation;
          and if it be of that nature that it is likely always to be a
          hinderance, then wholly have done with it, and never entertain any
          expectation from it more. If in time past you have, for the sake of
          worldly gain, involved yourself in more care and business than you
          find to be consistent with your being so thorough in the business of
          religion as you ought to be, then get into some other way, though you
          suffer in your worldly interest by it. Or if you have heretofore been
          conversant with company that you have reason to think have been and
          will be a snare to you, and a hinderance to this great design in any
          wise, break off from their society, however it may expose you to
          reproach from your old companions, or let what will be the effect of
          it. Whatever it be that stands in the way of your most advantageously
          seeking salvation-whether it be some dear sinful pleasure, or strong
          carnal appetite, or credit and honour, or the good-will of some
          persons whose friendship you desire, and whose esteem and liking you
          have highly valued-and though there be danger, if you do as you ought,
          that you shall looked upon by them as odd and ridiculous, and become
          contemptible in their eyes-or if it be your ease and indolence and
          aversion to continual labour; or your outward convenience in any
          respect, whereby you might avoid difficulties of one kind or other-let
          all go; offer up all such things together, as it were, in one
          sacrifice, to the interest of your soul. Let nothing stand in
          competition with this, but make every thing to fall before it. If the
          flesh must be crossed, then cross it, spare it not, crucify it, and do
          not be afraid of being too cruel to it. Galatians 5:24. “They that are
          Christ’s have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.”
          Have no dependence on any worldly enjoyment whatsoever. Let salvation
          be the one thing with you. This is what is certainly required of you:
          and this is what many stick at; this giving up other things for
          salvation, is a stumbling-block that few get over. While others
          pressed into the kingdom of God at the preaching of John the Baptist,
          Herod was pretty much stirred up by his preaching. It is said, he
          heard him, and observed him, and did many things; but when he came to
          tell him that he must part with his beloved Herodias, here he stuck;
          this he never would yield to, Mark 7:18-20. The rich young man was
          considerably concerned for salvation; and accordingly was a very
          strict liver in many things: but when Christ came to direct him to go
          and sell all that he had, and give to the poor, and come and follow
          him, he could not find in his heart to comply with it, but went away
          sorrowful. He had great possessions, and set his heart much on his
          estate, and could not bear to part with it. It may be, if Christ had
          directed him only to give away a considerable part of his estate, he
          would have done it; yea, perhaps, if he had bid him part with half of
          it, he would have complied with it: but when he directed him to throw
          up all, he could not grapple with such a proposal. Herein the
          straitness of the gate very much consists; and it is on this account
          that so many seek to enter in, and are not able. There are many that
          have a great mind to salvation, and spend great part of their time in
          wishing they had it, but they will not comply with the necessary
          means.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Be directed to forget the things that are behind: that is, not to
          keep thinking and making much of what you have done, but let your mind
          be wholly intent on what you have to do. In some sense you ought to
          look back; you should look back to your sins. Jeremiah 2:23. “See thy
          way in the valley, know what thou hast done.” You should look back on
          the wretchedness of your religious performances, and consider how you
          have fallen short in them; how exceedingly polluted all your duties
          have been, and how justly God might reject and loathe them, and you
          for them. But you ought not to spend your time in looking back, as
          many persons do, thinking how much they have done for their salvation;
          what great pains they have taken, how that they have done what they
          can, and do not see how they can do more; how long a time they have
          been seeking, and how much more they have done than others, and even
          than such and such who have obtained mercy. They think with themselves
          how hardly God deals with them, that he does not extend mercy to them,
          but turns a deaf ear to their cries; and hence discourage themselves,
          and complain of God. Do not thus spend your time in looking back on
          what is past, but look forward, and consider what is before you;
          consider what it is that you can do, and what it is necessary that you
          should do, and what God calls you still to do, in order to your own
          salvation. The apostle, in the third chapter to the Philippians, tells
          us what things he did while a Jew, how much he had to boast of, if any
          could boast; but he tells us, that he forgot those things, and all
          other things that were behind, and reached forth towards the things
          that were before, pressing forwards towards the mark for the prize of
          the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Labour to get your heart thoroughly disposed to go on and hold out
          to the end. Many that seem to be earnest have not a heart thus
          disposed. It is a common thing for persons to appear greatly affected
          for a little while; but all is soon past away, and there is no more to
          be seen of it. Labour therefore to obtain a thorough willingness and
          preparation of spirit, to continue seeking, in the use of your utmost
          endeavours, without limitation; and do not think your whole life too
          long. And in order to this, be advised to two things,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Remember that if ever God bestows mercy upon you, he will use his
          sovereign pleasure about the time when. He will bestow it on some in a
          little time, and on others not till they have sought it long. If other
          persons are soon enlightened and comforted, while you remain long in
          darkness, there is no other way but for you to wait. God will act
          arbitrarily in this matter, and you cannot help it. You must even be
          content to wait, in a way of laborious and earnest striving, till his
          time comes. If you refuse, you will but undo yourself; and when you
          shall hereafter find yourself undone, and see that your case is past
          remedy, how will you condemn yourself for foregoing a great
          probability of salvation, only because you had not the patience to
          hold out, and was not willing to be at the trouble of a persevering
          labour! And what will it avail before God or your own conscience to
          say, that you could not bear to be obliged to seek salvation so long,
          when God bestowed it on others that sought it but for a very short
          time? Though God may have bestowed the testimonies of his favour on
          others in a few days or hours after they have begun earnestly to seek
          it, how does that alter the case as to you, if there proves to be a
          necessity of your laboriously seeking many years before you obtain
          them? Is salvation less worth taking a great deal of pains for,
          because, through the sovereign pleasure of God, others have obtained
          it with comparatively little pains? If there are two persons, the one
          of which has obtained converting grace with comparative ease, and
          another that has obtained it after continuing for many years in the
          greatest and most earnest labours after it, how little difference does
          it make at last, when once salvation is obtained! Put all the labour
          and pains, the long-continued difficulties and strugglings, of the one
          in the scale against salvation, and how little does it subtract; and
          put the ease with which the other has obtained in the scale with
          salvation, and how little does it add! What is either added or
          subtracted is lighter than vanity, and a thing worthy of no
          consideration, when compared with that infinite benefit that is
          obtained. Indeed if you were ten thousand years, and all that time
          should strive and press forward with as great earnestness as ever a
          person did for one day, all this would bear no proportion to the
          importance of the benefit; and it will doubtless appear little to you,
          when once you come to be in actual possession of eternal glory, and to
          see what that eternal misery is which you have escaped. You must not
          think much of your pains, and of the length of time; you must press
          towards the kingdom of God, and do your utmost, and hold out to the
          end, and learn to make no account of it when you have done. You must
          undertake the business of seeking salvation upon these terms, and with
          no other expectations than this, that if ever God bestows mercy it
          will be in his own time; and not only so, but also that when you have
          done all, God will not hold himself obliged to show you mercy at last.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Endeavour now thoroughly to weigh in your mind the difficulty,
          and to count the cost of perseverence in seeking salvation. You that
          are now setting out in this business, (as there are many here who have
          very lately set about it;-Praised be the name of God that he has
          stirred you up to it!) be exhorted to attend this direction. Do not
          undertake in this affair with any other thought but of giving yourself
          wholly to it for the remaining part of your life, and going through
          many and great difficulties in it. Take heed that you do not engage
          secretly upon this condition, that you shall obtain in a little time,
          promising yourself that it shall be within this present season of the
          pouring out of God’s Spirit, or with any other limitation of time
          whatsoever. Many, when they begin, (seeming to set out very
          earnestly,) do not expect that they shall need to seek very long, and
          so do not prepare themselves for it. And therefore, when they come to
          find it otherwise, and meet with unexpected difficulty, they are found
          unguarded, and easily overthrown. But let me advise you all who are
          now seeking salvation, not to entertain any self-flattering thoughts;
          but weigh the utmost difficulties of perseverance, and be provided for
          them, having your mind fixed in it to go through them, let them be
          what they will. Consider now beforehand, how tedious it would be, with
          utmost earnestness and labour, to strive after salvation for many
          years, in the mean time receiving no joyful or comfortable evidence of
          your having obtained. Consider what a great temptation to
          discouragement there probably would be in it; how apt you would be to
          yield the case; how ready to think that it is in vain for you to seek
          any longer, and that God never intends to show you mercy, in that he
          has not yet done it; how apt you would be to think with yourself,
          “What an uncomfortable life do I live! How much more unpleasantly do I
          spend my time than others that do not perplex their minds about the
          things of another world, but are at ease, and take the comfort of
          their worldly enjoyments!” Consider what a temptation there would
          probably be in it, if you saw others brought in that began to seek the
          kingdom of heaven long after you, rejoicing in a hope and sense of
          God’s favour, after but little pains and a short time of awakening;
          while you, from day to day, and from year to year, seemed to labour in
          vain. Prepare for such tempations now. Lay in beforehand for such
          trials and difficulties, that you may not think any strange thing has
          happened when they come.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope that those who have given attention to what has been said, have
          by this time conceived, in some measure, what is signified by the
          expression in the text, and after what manner they ought to press into
          the kingdom of God. Here is this to induce you to a compliance with
          what you have been directed to; if you sit still, you die; if you go
          backward, behold you shall surely die; if you go forward, you may
          live. And though God has not bound himself to any thing that a person
          does while destitute of faith, and out of Christ, yet there is great
          probability, that in a way of hearkening to this counsel you will
          live; and that by pressing onward, and persevering, you will at last,
          as it were by violence, take the kingdom of heaven. Those of you who
          have not only heard the directions given, but shall through God’s
          merciful assistance, practise according to them, are those that
          probably will overcome. These we may well hope at last to see standing
          with the Lamb on mount Sion, clothed in white robes, with palms in
          their hands; when all your labour and toil will be abundantly
          compensated, and you will not repent that you have taken so much
          pains, and denied yourself much, and waited so long. This self-denial,
          this waiting, will then look little, and vanish into nothing in your
          eyes, being all swallowed up in the first minute’s enjoyment of that
          glory that you will then possess, and will uninterruptedly possess and
          enjoy to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th Direction. Improve the present season of the pouring out of the
          Spirit of God on this town. Prudence is any affair whatsoever consists
          very much in minding and improving our opportunities. If you would
          have spiritual prosperity, you must exercise prudence in the concerns
          of your souls, as well as in outward concerns when you seek outward
          prosperity. The prudent husbandman will observe his opportunities; he
          will improve seed-time and harvest; he will make his advantage of the
          showers and shines of heaven. The prudent merchant will discern his
          opportunities; he will not be idle on a market-day; he is careful not
          to let slip his seasons for enriching himself: So will those who
          prudently seek the fruits of righteousness, and the merchandise of
          wisdom, improve their opportunities for their eternal wealth and
          happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is pleased at this time, in a very remarkable manner, to pour out
          his Spirit amongst us; (glory be to his name!) You that have a mind to
          obtain converting grace, and to go to heaven when you die, now is your
          season! Now, if you have any sort of prudence for your own salvation,
          and have not a mind to go to hell, improve this season! Now is the
          accepted time! Now is the day of salvation! You that in time past have
          been called upon, and have turned a deaf ear to God’s voice, and long
          stood out and resisted his commands and counsels, hear God’s voice
          today, while it is called today! Do not harden your hearts at such a
          day as this! Now you have a special and remarkable price put into your
          hands to get wisdom, if you have but a heart to improve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          God hath his certain days or appointed seasons of exercising both
          mercy and judgment. There are some remarkable times of wrath, laid out
          by God for his awful visitation, and the executions of his anger;
          which times are called days of vengeance, Proverbs 6:34. Wherein God
          will visit sin, Exodus 32:34. And so, on the contrary, God has laid
          out in his sovereign counsels seasons of remarkable mercy, wherein he
          will manifest himself in the exercises of his grace and
          loving-kindness, more than at other times. Such times in Scripture are
          called by way of eminency, accepted times, and days of salvation, and
          also days of God’s visitation; because they are days wherein God will
          visit in a way of mercy; as in Luke 19:44. “And shall lay thee even
          with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not
          leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the
          time of thy visitation.” It is such a time now in this town; it is
          with us a day of God’s gracious visitation. It is indeed a day of
          grace with us as long as we live in this world, in the enjoyment of
          the means of grace; but such a time as this is especially, and in a
          distinguishing manner, a day of grace. There is a door of mercy always
          standing open for sinners; but such a day as this, God opens an
          extraordinary door.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are directed to seek the Lord while he may be found, and to call
          upon him while he is near, Isaiah 55:6. If you that are hitherto
          Christless, be not strangely besotted and infatuated, you will by all
          means improve such an opportunity as this to get heaven, when heaven
          is brought so near, when the fountain is opened in the midst of us in
          so extraordinary a manner. Now is the time to obtain a supply of the
          necessities of your poor perishing souls! This is the day for sinners
          that have a mind to be converted before they die, when God is dealing
          forth so liberally and bountifully amongst us; when conversion and
          salvation work is going on amongst us from sabbath to sabbath, and
          many are pressing into the kingdom of God! Now do not stay behind, but
          press in amongst the rest! Others have been stirred up to be in good
          earnest, and have taken heaven by violence; be entreated to follow
          their example, if you would have a part of the inheritance with them,
          and would not be left at the great day, when they are taken!
        </p>
        <p>
          How should it move you to consider that you have this opportunity now
          in your hands! You are in the actual possession of it! If it were
          past, it would not be in your power to recover it, or in the power of
          any creature to bring it back for you; but it is not past; it is now,
          at this day. Now is the accepted time, even while it is called today!
          Will you sit still at such a time? Will you sleep in such a harvest?
          Will you deal with a slack hand, and stay behind out of mere sloth, or
          love to some lust, or lothness to grapple with some small difficulty,
          or to put yourself a little out of your way, when so many are flowing
          to the goodness of the Lord? You are behind still; and so you will be
          in danger of being left behind, when the whole number is completed
          that are to enter in, if you do not earnestly bestir yourself! To be
          left behind at the close of such a season as this, will be awful-next
          to being left behind on that day when God’s saints shall mount up as
          with wings to meet the Lord in the air-and will be what will appear
          very threatening of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is now calling you in an extraordinary manner: and it is agreeable
          to the will and word of Christ, that I should now, in his name, call
          you, as one set over you, and sent to you to that end; so it is his
          will that you should hearken to what I say, as his voice. I therefore
          beseech you in Christ’s stead now to press into the kingdom of God!
          Whoever you are, whether young or old, small or great; if you are a
          great sinner, if you have been a backslider, if you have quenched the
          Spirit, be who you will, do not stand making objections, but arise,
          apply yourself to your work! Do what you have to do with your might.
          Christ is calling you before, and holding forth his grace, and
          everlasting benefits, and wrath is pursuing you behind; wherefore fly
          for your life, and look not behind you! But here I would particularly
          direct myself to several sorts of persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. To those sinners who are in a measure awakened, and are concerned
          for their salvation. You have reason to be glad that you have such an
          opportunity, and to prize it above gold. To induce you to prize and
          improve it, consider several things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God has doubtless a design now to deal forth saving blessings to a
          number. God has done it to some already, and it is not probable that
          he has yet finished his work amongst us: we may well hope still to see
          others brought out of darkness into marvellous light. And therefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God comes this day, and knocks at many persons’ doors, and at your
          door among the rest. God seems to be come in a very unusual manner
          amongst us, upon a gracious and merciful design; a design of saving a
          number of poor miserable souls out of a lost and perishing condition,
          and of bringing them into a happy state and eternal glory! This is
          offered to you, not only as it has always been in the word and
          ordinances, but by the particular influences of the Spirit of Christ
          awakening you! This special offer is made to many amongst us; and you
          are not passed over. Christ has not forgot you; but has come to your
          door; and there as it were stands waiting for you to open to him. If
          you have wisdom and discretion to discern your own advantage, you will
          know that now is your opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How much more easily converting grace is obtained at such a time,
          than at other times! The work is equally easy with God at all times;
          but there is far less difficulty in the way as to men at such a time,
          than at other times. It is, as I said before, a day of God’s gracious
          visitation; a day that he has as it were set apart for the more
          liberally and bountifully dispensing of his grace; a day wherein God’s
          hand is opened wide. Experience shows it. God seems to be more ready
          to help, to give proper convictions, to help against temptations, and
          let in divine light. He seems to carry on his work with a more
          glorious discovery of his power, and Satan is more chained up than at
          other times. Those difficulties and temptations that persons before
          struck at, from year to year, they are soon helped over. The work of
          God is carried on with greater speed and swiftness, and there are
          often instances of sudden conversion at such a time. So it was in the
          apostles’ days, when there was a time of the most extraordinary
          pouring out of the Spirit that ever was. How quick and sudden were
          conversions in those days! Such instances as that of the jailer
          abounded then, in fulfillment of that prophecy, Isaiah 66:7, 8.
          “Before she travailed, she brought forth: before her pain came she was
          delivered of a man-child. Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen
          such things? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her
          children.” So it is in some degree, whenever there is an extraordinary
          pouring out of the Spirit of God; more or less so, in proportion to
          the greatness of that effusion. There is seldom such quick work made
          of it at other times. Persons are not so soon delivered from their
          various temptations and entanglements; but are much longer wandering
          in a wilderness, and groping in darkness. And yet,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There are probably some here present that are now concerned about
          their salvation, that will never obtain. It is not to be supposed that
          all that are now moved and awakened, will ever be savingly converted.
          Doubtless there are many now seeking that will not be able to enter.
          When has it been so in times past, when there has been times of great
          outpourings of God’s Spirit, but that many who for a while have
          inquired with others, what they should do to be saved, have failed,
          and afterwards grown hard and secure? All of you that are now
          awakened, have a mind to obtain salvation, and probably hope to get a
          title to heaven, in the time of this present moving of God’s Spirit:
          but yet, (though it be awful to be spoken, and awful to be thought) we
          have no reason to think any other, than that some of you will burn in
          hell to all eternity. You all are afraid of hell, and seem at present
          disposed to take pains to be delivered from it; and yet it would be
          unreasonable to think any other, than that some of you will have your
          portion in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. Though there
          are so many that seem to obtain so easily, having been but a little
          while under convictions, yet, for all that, some never will obtain.
          Some will soon lose the sense of things they now have; though their
          awakenings seem to be very considerable for the present, they will not
          hold; they have not hearts disposed to hold on through very many
          difficulties. Some that have set out for heaven, and hope as much as
          others to obtain, are indeed but slighty and slack, even now, in the
          midst of such a time as this. And others, who for the present seem to
          be more in earnest, will probably, before long, decline and fail, and
          gradually return to be as they were before. The convictions of some
          seem to be great, while that which is the occasion of their
          convictions is new; which, when that begins to grow old, will
          gradually decay and wear off. Thus, it may be, the occasion of your
          awakening has been the hearing of the conversion of some person, or
          seeing so extraordinary a dispensation of Providence as this in which
          God now appears amongst us; but by and by the newness and freshness of
          these things will be gone, and so will not affect your mind as now
          they do; and it may be your convictions will go away with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though this be a time wherein God doth more liberally bestow his
          grace, and so a time of greater advantage for obtaining it; yet there
          seems to be, upon some accounts, greater danger of backsliding, than
          when persons are awakened at other times. For commonly such
          extraordinary times do not last long; and then when they cease, there
          are multitudes that lose their convictions as it were together.<br />
          We speak of it as a happy thing, that God is pleased to cause such a
          time amongst us, and so it is indeed: but there are some to whom it
          will be no benefit; it will be an occasion of their greater misery;
          they will wish they had never seen this time; it will be more
          tolerable for those that never saw it, or any thing like it, in the
          day of judgment, than for them. It is an awful consideration, that
          there are probably those here, whom the great Judge will hereafter
          call to a strict account about this very thing, why they no better
          improved this opportunity, when he set open the fountain of his grace,
          and so loudly called upon them, and came and strove with them in
          particular, by the awakening influences of his Spirit; and they will
          have no good account to give to the Judge, but their mouths will be
          stopped, and they will stand speechless before him.<br />
          You had need therefore to be earnest, and very resolved in this
          affair, that you may not be one of those who shall thus fail, that you
          may so fight, as not uncertainly, and so run, as that you may win the
          prize.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Consider in what sad circumstances times of extraordinary effusion
          of God’s Spirit commonly leave persons, when they leave them
          unconverted. They find them in a doleful, because in a natural,
          condition; but commonly leave them in a much more doleful condition.
          They are left dreadfully hardened, and with a great increase of guilt,
          and their souls under a more strong dominion and possession of Satan.
          And frequently seasons of extraordinary advantage for salvation,when
          they pass over persons, and they do not improve them, nor receive any
          good in them, seal their damnation. As such seasons leave them, God
          for ever leaves them, and gives them up to judicial hardness. Luke
          19:41, 42. “And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept
          over it, saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, the things which
          belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Consider, that it is very uncertain whether you will ever see such
          another time as this. If there should be such another time, it is very
          uncertain uncertain whether you will live to another time, it is very
          uncertain whether you will eve whether you will live to see it. Many
          that are now concerned for their salvation amongst us, will probably
          be in their graves, and it may be in hell, before that time; and if
          you should miss this opportunity, it may be so with you. And what good
          will that do you, to have the Spirit of God poured out upon earth, in
          the place where you once lived, while you are tormented in hell? What
          will it avail you, that others are crying, What shall I do to be
          saved? while you are shut up for ever in the bottomless pit, and are
          wailing and gnashing your teeth in everlasting burnings?
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherefore improve this opportunity, while God is pouring out his
          Spirit, and you are on earth, and while you dwell in the place where
          the Spirit of God is thus poured out, and you yourself have the
          awakening influences of it, that you may never wail and gnash your
          teeth in hell, but may sing in heaven for ever, with others that are
          redeemed from amongst men, and redeemed amongst us.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. If you should see another such time, it will be under far greater
          disadvantages than now. You will probably then be much older, and will
          have more hardened your heart; and so will be under less probability
          of receiving good. Some persons are so hardened in sin, and so left of
          God, that they can live through such a time as this, and not be much
          awakened or affected by it; they can stand their ground, and be but
          little moved. And so it may be with you, by another such time, if
          there should be another amongst us, and you should live to see it. The
          case in all probability will be greatly altered with you by that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you should continue Christless and graceless till then, you will be
          much further from the kingdom of God, and much deeper involved in
          snares and misery; and the devil will probably have a vastly greater
          advantage against you, to tempt and confound you.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. We do not know but that God is now gathering in his elect, before
          some great and sore judgment. It has been God’s manner before he casts
          off a visible people, or brings some great and destroying judgments
          upon them, first to gather in his elect, that they may be secure. So
          it was before the casting off the Jews from being God’s people. There
          was first a very remarkable pouring out of the Spirit, and gathering
          in of the elect, by the preaching of the apostles and evangelists, as
          we read in the beginning of the Acts: but after this the harvest and
          its gleanings were over, the rest were blinded, and hardened; the
          gospel had little success amongst them, and the nation was given up,
          and cast off from being God’s people, and their city and land was
          destroyed by the Romans in a terrible manner; and they have been cast
          off by God now for a great many ages, and still remain a hardened and
          rejected people. So we read in the beginning of the 7th chapter of the
          Revelations, that God, when about to bring destroying judgments on the
          earth, first sealed his servants in the forehead. He set his seal upon
          the hearts of the elect, gave them the saving influences and
          indwelling of his Spirit, by which they were sealed to the day of
          redemption. Revelation 7:1-3. “And after these things, I saw four
          angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four
          winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on
          the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the
          east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud
          voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and
          the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,
          till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And this may be the case now, that God is about, in a great measure,
          to forsake this land, and give up this people, and to bring most awful
          and overwhelming judgments upon it, and that he is now gathering in
          his elect, to secure them from the calamity. The state of the nation,
          and of this land, never looked so threatening of such a thing as at
          this day. The present aspect of things exceedingly threatens vital
          religion, and even those truths that are especially the foundation of
          it, out of this land. If it should be so, how awful will the case be
          with those that shall be left, and not brought in, while God continues
          the influences of his Spirit, to gather in those that are to be
          redeemed from amongst us!
        </p>
        <p>
          9. If you neglect the present opportunity, and be finally unbelieving,
          those that are converted in this time of the pouring out of God’s
          Spirit will rise up in judgment against you. Your neighbors, your
          relations, acquaintance, or companions that are converted, will that
          day appear against you. They will not only be taken while you are
          left, mounting up with joy to meet the Lord in the air-at his right
          hand with glorious saints and angels, while you are at the left with
          devils-but how they will rise up in judgment against you.
        </p>
        <p>
          However friendly you have been together, and have taken pleasure in
          one another’s company, and have often familiarly conversed together,
          they will then surely appear against you. They will rise up as
          witnesses, and will declare what a precious opportunity you had, and
          did not improve; how you continued unbelieving, and rejected the
          offers of a Saviour, when those offers were made in so extraordinary a
          manner, and when so many others were prevailed upon to accept of
          Christ; how you was negligent and slack, and did not know the things
          that belonged to your peace, in that your day. And not only so, but
          they shall be your judges, as assessors with the great Judge; and as
          such will appear against you; they will be with the Judge in passing
          sentence upon you. I Corinthians 6:2. “Know ye not that the saints
          shall judge the world?” Christ will admit them to the honour of
          judging the world with him: “They shall sit with him in his throne,”
          Revelation 3:21. “They shall sit with Christ in his throne of
          government, and they shall sit with him in his throne of judgment, and
          shall be judges with him when you are judged, and as such shall
          condemn you.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. And lastly, You do not know that you shall live through the
          present time of the pouring out of God’s Spirit. You may be taken away
          in the midst of it, or you may be taken away in the beginning of it;
          as God in his providence is putting you in mind, by the late instance
          of death in a young person in the town.* God has of late been very
          awful in his dealings with us, in the repeated deaths of young persons
          amongst us. This should stir every one up to be in the more haste to
          press into the kingdom of God, that so you may be safe whenever death
          comes. This is a blessed season and opportunity; but you do not know
          how little of it you may have. You may have much less of it than
          others; may by death be suddenly snatched away from all advantages
          that are here enjoyed for the good of souls. Therefore make haste, and
          escape for thy life. One moment’s delay is dangerous; for wrath is
          pursuing, and divine vengeance hanging over every uncovered person.<br />
          Let these considerations move every one to be improving this
          opportunity, that while others receive saving good, and are made heirs
          of eternal glory, you may not be left behind, in the same miserable
          doleful circumstances in which you came into the world, a poor captive
          to sin and Satan, a lost sheep, a perishing, undone creature, sinking
          down into everlasting perdition; that you may not be one of them
          spoken of, Jeremiah 17:6. “That shall be like the heath in the desert,
          and shall not see when good comes.” If you do not improve this
          opportunity, remember I have told you, you will hereafter lament it;
          and if you do not lament it in this world, then I will leave it with
          you to remember it throughout a miserable eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I would address myself to such as yet remain unawakened. It is an
          awful thing that there should be any one person remaining secure
          amongst us at such a time as this; but yet it is to be feared that
          there are some of this sort. I would here a little expostulate with
          such persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Joseph Clark’s wife, a young woman lately married, that died
          suddenly the week before this was delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. When do you expect that it will be more likely that you should be
          awakened and wrought upon than now? You are in a Christless condition;
          and yet without doubt intend to go to heaven; and therefore intend to
          be converted some time before you die; but this is not to be expected
          till you are first awakened, and deeply concerned about the welfare of
          your soul, and brought earnestly to seek God’s converting grace. And
          when do you intend that this shall be? How do you lay things out in
          your own mind, or what projection have you about this matter? Is it
          ever so likely that a person will be awakened, as at such a time as
          this? How do we see many, who before were secure, now roused out of
          their sleep, and crying, What shall I do to be saved? But you are yet
          secure! Do you flatter yourself that it will be more likely you should
          be awakened when it is a dull and dead time? Do you lay matters out
          thus in your own mind, that though you are senseless when others are
          generally awakened, that yet you shall be awakened when others are
          generally senseless? Or do you hope to see another such time of the
          pouring out of God’s Spirit hereafter? And do you think it will be
          more likely that you should be wrought upon then, than now? And why do
          you think so? Is it because then you shall be so much older than you
          are now, and so that your heart will be grown softer and more tender
          with age? or because you will then have stood out so much longer
          against the calls of the gospel, and all means of grace? Do you think
          it more likely that God will give you the needed influences of his
          Spirit then, than now, because then you will have provoked him so much
          more, and your sin and guilt will be so much greater? And do you think
          it will be any benefit to you, to stand it out through the present
          season of grace, as proof against the extraordinary means of awakening
          there are? Do you think that this will be a good preparation for a
          saving work of the Spirit hereafter?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What means do you expect to be awakened by? As to the awakening
          awful things of the word of God, you have had those set before you
          times without number, in the most moving manner that the dispensers of
          the word have been capable of. As to particular solemn warnings,
          directed to those that are in your circumstances, you have had them
          frequently, and have them now from time to time. Do you expect to be
          awakened by awful providences? Those also you have lately had, of the
          most awakening nature, one after another. Do you expect to be moved by
          the deaths of others? We have lately had repeated instances of these.
          There have been deaths of old and young: the year has been remarkable
          for the deaths of young persons in the bloom of life; and some of them
          very sudden deaths. Will the conversion of others move you? There is
          indeed scarce any thing that is found to have so great a tendency to
          stir persons up as this: and this you have been tried with of late in
          frequent instances; but are hitherto proof against it. Will a general
          pouring out of the Spirit, and seeing a conern about salvation amongst
          all sorts of people, do it? This means you now have, but without
          effect. Yea, you have all these things together; you have the solemn
          warnings of God’s word, and awful instances of death, and the
          conversion of others, and see a general concern about salvation: but
          all together do not move you to any great concern about your own
          precious, immortal, and miserable soul. Therefore consider by what
          means it is that you expect ever to be awakened.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have heard that it is probable some who are now awakened, will
          never obtain salvation; how dark then does it look upon you that
          remain stupidly unawakened! Those who are not moved at such a time as
          this, come to adult age, have reason to fear whether they are not
          given up to judicial hardness. I do not say they have reason to
          conclude it, but they have reason to fear it. How dark doth it look
          upon you, that God comes and knocks at so many persons’ doors, and
          misses yours! that God is giving the strivings of his Spirit so
          generally amongst us, while you ar left senseless!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Do you expect to obtain salvation without ever seeking it? If you
          are sensible that there is a necessity of your seeking in order to
          obtaining, and ever intend to seek, one would think you could not
          avoid it at such a time as this. Inquire therefore, whether you intend
          to go to heaven, living all your days a secure, negligent, careless
          life.-Or,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Do you think you can bear the damnation of hell? Do you imagine
          that you can tolerably endure the devouring fire, and everlasting
          burnings? Do you hope that you shall be able to grapple with the
          vengeance of God Almighty, when he girds himself with strength, and
          clothes himself with wrath? Do you think to strengthen yourself
          against God, and to be able to make your part good with him? I
          Corinthians 10:22. “Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we
          stronger than he?” Do you flatter yourself that you shall find out
          ways for your ease and support, and to make it out tolerably well, to
          bear up your spirit in those everlasting burnings that are prepared
          for the devil and his angels? Ezekiel 22:14. “Can thine heart endure,
          or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with
          thee?”-It is a difficult thing to conceive what such Christless
          persons think, that are unconcerned at such a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I would direct myself to them who are grown considerably into
          years, and are yet in a natural condition. I would now take occasion
          earnestly to exhort you to improve this extraordinary opportunity, and
          press into the kingdom of God. You have lost many advantages that once
          you had, and now have not the same advantages that others have. The
          case is very different with you from what it is with many of your
          neighbours. You, above all, had need to improve such an opportunity.
          Now is the time for you to bestir yourself, and take the kingdom of
          heaven!-Consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Now there seems to be a door opened for old sinners. Now God is
          dealing forth freely to all sorts: his hand is opened wide, and he
          does not pass by old ones so much as he used to do. You are not under
          such advantages as others who are younger; but yet, so wonderfully has
          God ordered it, that now you are not destitute of great advantage.
          Though old in sin, God has put a new and extraordinary advantage in
          your hands. O! improve this price you have to get wisdom. You that
          have been long seeking to enter in at the strait gate and yet remain
          without, now take your opportunity and press in! You that have been
          long in the wilderness, fighting with various temptations, labouring
          under discouragements, ready to give up the case, and have been often
          tempted to despair, now, behold the door that God opens for you! Do
          not give way to discouragements now; this is not a time for it. Do not
          spend time in thinking, that you have done what you can already, and
          that you are not elected, and in giving way to other perplexing,
          weakening, disheartening temptations. Do not waste away this precious
          opportunity in such a manner. You have no time to spare for such
          things as these; God calls you now to something else. Improve this
          time in seeking and striving for salvation, and not in that which
          tends to hinder it.-It is no time now for you to stand talking with
          the devil; but hearken to God, and apply yourself to that which he
          does now so loudly call you to.<br />
          Some of you have often lamented the loss of past opportunties,
          particularly, the loss of the time of youth, and have been wishing
          that you had so good an opportunity again; and have been ready to say,
          “O! if I was young again, how would I improve such an advantage!” That
          opportunity which you have had in time past is irrecoverable; you can
          never have it again; but God can give you other advantages of another
          sort, that are very great, and he is so doing at this day. He is now
          putting a new opportunity into your hands; though not of the same kind
          with that which you once had, and have lost, yet in some respects as
          great of another kind. If you lament your folly in neglecting and
          losing past opportunties, then do not be guilty of the folly of
          neglecting the opportunity which God now gives you. This opportunity
          you could not have purchased, if you would have given all that you had
          in the world for it. But God is putting it into your hands himself, of
          his own free and sovereign mercy, without your purchasing it.
          Therefore when you have it, do not neglect it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is a great deal more likely with respect to such persons than
          others, that this is their last time. There will be a last time of
          special offer of salvation to impenitent sinners-“God’s Spirit shall
          not always strive with man,” Genesis 6:3. God sometimes continues long
          knocking at the doors of wicked men’s hearts; but there are the last
          knocks, and the last calls that ever they shall have. And sometimes
          God’s last calls are the loudest; and then if sinners do not hearken,
          he finally leaves them. How long has God been knocking at many of your
          doors that are old in sin! It is a great deal more likely that these
          are his last knocks. You have resisted God’s Spirit in times past, and
          have hardened your heart once and again; but God will not be thus
          dealt with always. There is danger, that if now, after so long a time,
          you will not hearken, he will utterly desert you, and leave you to
          walk in your own counsels.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems by God’s providence, as though God had yet an elect number
          amongst old sinners in this place, that perhaps he is now about to
          bring in. It looks as though there were some that long lived under Mr.
          Stoddard’s ministry, that God has not utterly cast off, though they
          stood it out under such great means as they then enjoyed. It is to be
          hoped that God will now bring in a remnant from among them. But it is
          more likely that God is now about finishing with them, one way or
          other, for their having been so long the subjects of such
          extraordinary means. You have seen former times of the pouring out of
          God’s Spirit upon the town, when others were taken and you left,
          others were called out of darkness into marvelous light, and were
          brought into a glorious and happy state, and you saw not good when
          good came. How dark will your circumstances appear, if you shall also
          stand it out through this opportunity, and still be left behind! Take
          heed that you be not of those spoken of, Hebrews 6:7, 8. that are like
          the “earth that has rain coming oft upon it, and only bears briers and
          thorns.” As we see there are some pieces of ground, the more showers
          of rain fall upon them, the more fruitful seasons there are, the more
          do the briers, and other useless and hurtful plants, that are rooted
          in them, grow and flourish. Of such ground the apostle says, “It is
          rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned.” The
          way that the husbandman takes with such ground, is, to set fire to it,
          to burn up the growth of it.-If you miss this opportunity, there is
          danger that you will be utterly rejected, and that your end will be to
          be burned. And if this is to be, it is to be feared, that you are not
          far from, but nigh unto, cursing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those of you that are already grown old in sin, and are now under
          awakenings, when you feel your convictions begin to go off, if ever
          that should be, then remember what you have now been told; it may well
          then strike you to the heart!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I would direct the advice to those that are young, and now under
          their first special convictions. I would earnestly urge such to
          improve this opportunity, and press into the kingdom of God.-Consider
          two things,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. You have all manner of advantages now centering upon you. It is a
          time of great advantage for all; but your advantages are above others.
          There is no other sort of persons that have now so great and happy an
          opportunity as you have.-You have the great advantage that is common
          to all who live in this place, viz. That now it is a time of the
          extraordinary pouring out of the Spirit of God. And have you not that
          great advantage, the awakening influences of the Spirit of God on you
          in particular? and besides, you have this peculiar advantage, that you
          are now in your youth. And added to this, you have another unspeakable
          advantage, that you now are under your first convictions. Happy is he
          that never has hardened his heart, and blocked up his own way to
          heaven by backsliding, and has now the awakening influences of God’s
          Spirit, if God does but enable him thoroughly to improve them! Such
          above all in the world bid fair for the kingdom of God. God is wont on
          such, above any kind of persons, as it were easily and readily to
          bestow the saving grace and comforts of his Spirit. Instances of
          speedy and sudden conversion are most commonly found among such. Happy
          are they that have the Spirit of God with them, and never have
          quenched it, if they did but know the price they have in their hands!

          If you have a sense of your necessity of salvation, and the great
          worth and value of it, you will be willing to take the surest way to
          it, or that which has the greatest probability of success; and that
          certainly is, thoroughly to improve your first convictions. If you so
          go, it is not likely that you will fail; there is the greatest
          probability that you will succeed.-What is it not worth, to have such
          an advantage in one’s hands for obtaining eternal life? The present
          season of the pouring out of God’s Spirit, is the first that many of
          you who are now under awakenings have ever seen, since you came to
          years of understanding. On which account, it is the greatest
          opportunity that ever you had, and probably by far the greatest that
          ever you will have. There are many here present who wish they had such
          an opportunity, but they never can obtain it; they cannot buy it for
          money; but you have it in your possession, and can improve it if you
          will. But yet,

          2. There is on some accounts greater danger that such as are in your
          circumstances will fail of thoroughly improving their convictions,
          with respect to stedfastness and perseverance, than others. Those that
          are young are more unstable than elder persons. They who never had
          convictions before, have less experience of the difficulty of the work
          they have engaged in; they are more ready to think that they shall
          obtain salvation easily, and are more easily discouraged by
          disappointments; and young persons have less reason and consideration
          to fortify them against temptations to backsliding. You should
          therefore labour now the more to guard against such temptations. By
          all means make but one work of seeking salvation! Make thorough work
          of it the first time! There are vast disadvantages that they bring
          themselves under, who have several turns of seeking with great
          intermissions. By such a course, persons exceedingly wound their own
          souls, and entangle themselves in many snares. Who are those that
          commonly meet with so many difficulties, and are so long labouring in
          darkness and perplexity, but those who have had several turns at
          seeking salvation; who have one while had convictions, and then have
          quenched them, and then have set about the work again, and have
          backslidden again, and have gone on after that manner? The children of
          Israel would not have been forty years in the wilderness, if they had
          held their courage, and had gone on as they set out; but they were of
          an unstable mind, and were for going back again into Egypt.-Otherwise,
          if they had gone right forward without discouragement, as God would
          have led them, they would have soon entered and taken possession of
          Canaan. They had got to the very borders of it when they turned back,
          but were thirty-eight years after that, before they got through the
          wilderness. Therefore, as you regard the interest of your soul, do not
          run yourself into a like difficulty, by unsteadiness, intermission,
          and backsliding; but press right forward, from henceforth, and make
          but one work of seeking, converting, and pardoning grace, however
          great, and difficult, and long a work that may be.
