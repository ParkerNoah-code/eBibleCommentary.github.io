        <h2>Sinners Delay Concerns the Soul – Acts 24:25</h2>
        <p class="title">Dated 1749, 1752.</p>
        <p>
          Acts 24:25, “And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and
          judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this
          time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The subject of the Apostle’s preaching.<br />
          II. How Felix was affected by it.<br />
          III. How he conducted himself in these circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject: Sinners delaying in putting off the great concern of their
          souls till a supposed more convenient season.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How sinners oftentimes do delay.<br />
          2. The reasons or causes why sinners do thus.<br />
          3. The end of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I would briefly observe how sinners do frequently delay and put off
          the great concern of their souls till a supposed more convenient
          season.<br />
          (1.) They sometimes put off to certain times they set, when they
          intend… Children sometimes… Shall know more — Know better how to pray
          and perform other duties of Religion that grown-up persons perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          ’Tis a common thing for young people. Till settled in the world.<br />
          “More convenient season:” a better inclination… not so much inclined
          to mirth and youthful vanities… fewer temptations… out of the way of
          young company… more in the way of those who are solid and serious
          persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          They esteem the present season very inconvenient for religion… being
          so very convenient for other purposes… Now a very convenient time to
          take liberty in mirth and youthful delights.<br />
          Many that are past their youth put off to a supposed more convenient
          season… when got through such and such particular affairs wherein they
          are now involved… when they hope they shall be more at liberty… or
          till in this and the other respect they are got into more convenient
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) There are many that delay and put off without fixing any time in
          their mind… hoping for a more convenient future time…<br />
          The present time appears peculiarly inconvenient… feel a great
          opposition… have many temptations… hope it will be better with them…
          not feel such an aversion… fewer temptations…<br />
          Wait to have the Spirit of God strive with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now a time of general deadness, and very inconvenient on that account…
          all the talk is of other things… put off till a time of the outpouring
          of the Spirit of God…
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, perhaps, they are hoping for some greater advantage in other
          respects, some better means than now they enjoy, or a better
          concurrence of circumstances to favor a design of seeking God and
          their salvation.
        </p>
        <p>II. The cause of persons thus delaying.</p>
        <p>
          1. Stupidity… senselessness of their danger and necessity.<br />
          Insensible of the reality… insensible of the greatness… senseless of
          the heinousness of their sin… a brutish stupidity…
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The importunity of lust… Job 20:12 — “Wickedness is sweet in his
          mouth; he hides it under his tongue; he spares it, and forsakes it
          not, he keeps it still in his mouth.”
        </p>
        <p>3. Aversion to their duty.</p>
        <p>4. Ignorance of themselves and self-confidence.</p>
        <p>Trust in wisdom…strength…steadfastness…</p>
        <p>
          5. A spirit of self-blinding… The blinding influence of a sinful
          self-love… promise themselves future opportunity… better opportunity…
          that God will hear…
        </p>
        <p>6. The subtle temptations of the Devil…</p>
        <p>III. The evil of it.</p>
        <p>1. ’Tis exceeding wicked.</p>
        <p>
          Direct disobedience…willful, resolved, wickedness….determine to
          continue in sin, and an allowance of it…
        </p>
        <p>
          ’Tis not only designedly committing one act of wickedness, but
          deliberately determining on a course of it… a course of manifested
          wickedness… neglect of many commands… gratification of many lusts…
          horrible ingratitude, abusing the past “long suffering”… horrible
          presumption on future mercy… contempt of offered mercy…
        </p>
        <p>
          2. ’Tis exceeding foolish… Hereby they reject and miss a good deal of
          present good… willfully continue in a miserable state… bring a great
          deal of certain future misery upon them…<br />
          They run a dreadful risk…depend on innumerable uncertainties.. life
          continued… means of grace continued… use of reason… disposed… “more
          convenient season”…given one… if disposed whether succeed… whether God
          won’t give over to delusion and to hard-heartedness…
        </p>
        <p>
          Depend on many things that are not only uncertain, but very
          improbable… disposition… convenient season… thought when they were
          children… make their case more and more dangerous…depending on greater
          conveniences they make inconveniences for themselves… and by this
          means many thousands are actually undone…
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION:</p>
        <p>
          This may be of warning to sinners not to delay and put off…<br />
          You have heard how common this is… Men are exceeding prone to it… Does
          your own experience confirm what has been said in this matter? And are
          there not some here who are now doing as has been represented? Have we
          not reason to think that there are many here present that say as
          Felix, “When…” etc.?<br />
          Undoubted, by what is everywhere to be seen at such a time of general
          deadness and regardlessness of religion as this is: a good evidence of
          the exceeding proneness to put off…
        </p>
        <p>
          Let all take warning…<br />
          You have heard something in general of wickedness and folly; but here
          consider more particularly —
        </p>
        <p>
          1. What guilt you contract: what a horrible thing it is to live in
          known and willful disobedience to God;… what great light ye will sin
          against if you…
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What would you think of your delays if God should say to you, “Thou
          fool, this night…?”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If the future time you are putting off to should never come, how
          far it will probably be from being a “more convenient season.”…<br />
          In many respects, far more inconvenient… God’s anger increased… your
          heart harder, more stupid… every evil habit established… sloth… a
          carnal, worldly disposition… an habitual making light of things
          affecting such awakenings… Satan’s great opportunity to establish his
          interest… commonly an increase of inconvenience of outward
          circumstances… increase of temptations… commonly many inconveniences
          arise that never would be thought of… less likely ever to set about
          the work… Satan hath greater advantages if they do… more likely to be
          unsteady…more likely soon to be discouraged… the work is greater and
          harder that they have to do… less time to do it…
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Others have lamented their folly in delaying… many when under
          concern… I who have long been in the work of the ministry… many on a
          death-bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. How much otherwise you deal with God, and desire that God should
          deal with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. If you continue still to delay after the warning you have this day,
          how aggravated your wickedness will be!
        </p>
        <p>
          How have you been warned hereof before… and how have you gone from the
          meeting-house and still…
        </p>
        <p>
          How can you excuse yourself to go home tonight and do nothing? or to
          do a little this evening, and then to-morrow, or in a few days?…
        </p>
        <p>Consider how unreasonable this is…</p>
        <p>
          And if now again, … and there be a God,… how many you reasonably
          suppose He will resent it?
        </p>
        <p>
          7. If you still… what danger that you will be utterly given up before
          the time comes… Giving up a common thing…
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Inquire whether you yourself don’t believe [that] there are many
          now in Hell through this very means?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here some, perhaps, may say, to excuse themselves, and quiet their own
          consciences with respect to this, “I don’t delay and put off the
          concern of my soul. I am in a way of seeking my salvation.”
        </p>
        <p>Here I would put two or three questions to such persons.</p>
        <p>
          1. Whether you are in a way of minding this affair more than all
          other? “Seeking FIRST the kingdom of God,” — “one thing.”…
        </p>
        <p>2. Is your reformation universal? Sins of omission… commission…</p>
        <p>
          3. [Do you feel] as much pains as ever you take will be needful?
          Forsaken all practices you think you would need to forsake? Complied
          with all duties? As earnestly?… Do you intend to continue? How has
          secret, closet religion been with you? How have you kept the Sabbath?
          Attended the sermons? If not, … you are guilty of the forementioned
          wickedness,…willful disobedience — guilty of folly. Therefore, if you
          have any regard to… think on your mercies, and “turn your feet,”… and
          whatever “your hands find to do.”…
