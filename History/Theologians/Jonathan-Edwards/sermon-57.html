        <h2>
          The Preciousness Of Time And The Importance Of Redeeming It –
          Ephesians 5:16
        </h2>
        <p class="title">Dated December, 1734</p>
        <p>Ephesians 5:16, “Redeeming the time.”</p>
        <p>
          Christians should not only study to improve the opportunities they
          enjoy, for their own advantage, as those who would make a good
          bargain; but also labor to reclaim others from their evil courses;
          that so God might defer his anger, and time might be redeemed from
          that terrible destruction, which, when it should come, would put an
          end to the time of divine patience. And it may be upon this account,
          that this reason is added, Because the days are evil. As if the
          apostle had said, the corruption of the times tends to hasten
          threatened judgments; but your holy and circumspect walk will tend to
          redeem time from the devouring jaws of those calamities. — However,
          thus much is certainly held forth to us in the words; viz. that upon
          time we should set a high value, and be exceeding careful that it be
          not lost; and we are therefore exhorted to exercise wisdom and
          circumspection, in order that we may redeem it. And hence it appears,
          that time is exceedingly precious.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>Why time is precious.</p>
        <p>Time is precious for the following reasons:</p>
        <p>
          First, because a happy or miserable eternity depends on the good or
          ill improvement of it. Things are precious in proportion to their
          importance, or to the degree wherein they concern our welfare. Men are
          wont to set the highest value on those things upon which they are
          sensible their interest chiefly depends. And this renders time so
          exceedingly precious, because our eternal welfare depends on the
          improvement of it. — Indeed our welfare in this world depends upon its
          improvement. If we improve it not, we shall be in danger of coming to
          poverty and disgrace; but by a good improvement of it, we may obtain
          those things which will be useful and comfortable. But it is above all
          things precious, as our state through eternity depends upon it. The
          importance of the improvement of time upon other accounts, is in
          subordination to this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gold and silver are esteemed precious by men; but they are of no worth
          to any man, only as thereby he has an opportunity of avoiding or
          removing some evil, or of possessing himself of some good. And the
          greater the evil is which any man hath advantage to escape, or the
          good which he hath advantage to obtain, by anything that he possesses,
          by so much the greater is the value of that thing to him, whatever it
          be. Thus if a man, by anything which he hath, may save his life, which
          he must lose without it, he will look upon that by which he hath the
          opportunity of escaping so great an evil as death, to be very
          precious. — Hence it is that time is so exceedingly precious, because
          by it we have opportunity of escaping everlasting misery, and of
          obtaining everlasting blessedness and glory. On this depends our
          escape from an infinite evil, and our attainment of an infinite good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, time is very short, which is another thing that renders it
          very precious. The scarcity of any commodity occasions men to set a
          higher value upon it, especially if it be necessary and they cannot do
          without it. Thus when Samaria was besieged by the Syrians, and
          provisions were exceedingly scarce, “an ass’s head was sold for
          fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s
          dung for five pieces of silver.” 2 Kin. 6:25. — So time is the more to
          be prized by men, because a whole eternity depends upon it; and yet we
          have but a little of time. “When a few years are come, then I shall go
          the way whence I shall not return.” Job 16:22. “My days are swifter
          than a post. They are passed away as the swift ships; as the eagle
          that hasteth to the prey.” Job 9:25, 26. “Our life; what is it? It is
          but a vapour which appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth
          away.” Jam. 4:14. It is but as a moment to eternity. Time is so short,
          and the work which we have to do in it is so great, that we have none
          of it to spare. The work which we have to do to prepare for eternity,
          must be done in time, or it never can be done; and it is found to be a
          work of great difficulty and labor, and therefore that for which time
          is the more requisite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, time ought to be esteemed by us very precious, because we are
          uncertain of its continuance. We know that it is very short, but we
          know not how short. We know not how little of it remains, whether a
          year, or several years, or only a month, a week, or a day. We are
          every day uncertain whether that day will not be the last, or whether
          we are to have the whole day. There is nothing that experience doth
          more verify than this. — If a man had but little provision laid up for
          a journey or a voyage, and at the same time knew that if his provision
          should fail, he must perish by the way, he would be the more choice of
          it. — How much more would many men prize their time, if they knew that
          they had but a few months, or a few days, more to live! And certainly
          a wise man will prize his time the more, as he knows not but that it
          will be so as to himself. This is the case with multitudes now in the
          world, who at present enjoy health, and see no signs of approaching
          death. Many such, no doubt, are to die the next month, many the next
          week, yea, many probably tomorrow, and some this night. Yet these same
          persons know nothing of it, and perhaps think nothing of it, and
          neither they nor their neighbors can say that they are more likely
          soon to be taken out of the world than others. This teaches us how we
          ought to prize our time, and how careful we ought to be, that we lose
          none of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, time is very precious, because when it is past, it cannot be
          recovered. There are many things which men possess, which if they part
          with, they can obtain them again. If a man have parted with something
          which he had, not knowing the worth of it, or the need he should have
          of it; he often can regain it, at least with pains and cost. If a man
          have been overseen in a bargain, and have bartered away or sold
          something, and afterwards repents of it, he may often obtain a
          release, and recover what he had parted with. — But it is not so with
          respect to time. When once that is gone, it is gone forever; no pains,
          no cost will recover it. Though we repent ever so much that we let it
          pass, and did not improve it while we had it, it will be to no
          purpose. Every part of it is successively offered to us, that we may
          choose whether we will make it our own, or not. But there is no delay.
          It will not wait upon us to see whether or no we will comply with the
          offer. But if we refuse, it is immediately taken away, and never
          offered more. As to that part of time which is gone, however we have
          neglected to improve it, it is out of our possession and out of our
          reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have lived fifty, or sixty, or seventy years, and have not
          improved our time, now it cannot be helped. It is eternally gone from
          us. All that we can do, is to improve the little that remains. Yea, if
          a man have spent all his life but a few moments unimproved, all that
          is gone is lost, and only those few remaining moments can possibly be
          made his own. And if the whole of a man’s time be gone, and it be all
          lost, it is irrecoverable. — Eternity depends on the improvement of
          time. But when once the time of life is gone, when once death is come,
          we have no more to do with time; there is no possibility of obtaining
          the restoration of it, or another space in which to prepare for
          eternity. If a man should lose the whole of his worldly substance, and
          become a bankrupt, it is possible that his loss may be made up. He may
          have another estate as good. But when the time of life is gone, it is
          impossible that we should ever obtain another such time. All
          opportunity of obtaining eternal welfare is utterly and everlastingly
          gone.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>Reflections on time past.</p>
        <p>
          You have now heard of the preciousness of time; and you are the
          persons concerned, to whom God hath committed that precious talent.
          You have an eternity before you. When God created you, and gave you
          reasonable souls, he made you for an endless duration. He gave you
          time here in order to a preparation for eternity, and your future
          eternity depends on the improvement of time. — Consider, therefore,
          what you have done with your past time. You are not now beginning your
          time, but a great deal is past and gone; and all the wit, and power,
          and treasure of the universe, cannot recover it. Many of you may well
          conclude, that more than half of your time is gone. Though you should
          live to the ordinary age of man, your glass is more than half run; and
          it may be there are but few sands remaining. Your sun is past the
          meridian, and perhaps just setting, or going into an everlasting
          eclipse. Consider, therefore, what account you can give of your
          improvements of past time. How have you let the precious golden sands
          of your glass run?
        </p>
        <p>
          Every day that you have enjoyed has been precious; yea, your moments
          have been precious. But have you not wasted your precious moments,
          your precious days, yea, your precious years? If you should reckon up
          how many days you have lived, what a sum would there be! And how
          precious hath every one of those days been! Consider, therefore, what
          have you done with them? What is become of them all? What can you show
          of any improvement made, or good done, or benefit obtained, answerable
          to all this time which you have lived? When you look back, and search,
          do you not find this past time of your lives in a great measure empty,
          having not been filled up with any good improvement? And if God, that
          hath given you your time, should now call you to an account, what
          account could you give to him?
        </p>
        <p>
          How much may be done in a year? How much good is there opportunity to
          do in such a space of time! How much service may persons do for God,
          and how much for their own souls, if to their utmost they improve it!
          How much may be done in a day! But what have you done in so many days
          and years that you have lived? What have you done with the whole time
          of your youth, you that are past your youth? What is become of all
          that precious season of life? Hath it not all been in vain to you?
          Would it not have been as well or better for you, if all that time you
          had been asleep, or in a state of nonexistence?
        </p>
        <p>
          You have had much time of leisure and freedom from worldly business.
          Consider to what purpose you have spent it. You have not only had
          ordinary time, but you have had a great deal of holy time. What have
          you done with all the Sabbath-days which you have enjoyed? Consider
          those things seriously, and let your own consciences make answer.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>
          Who are chiefly deserving of reproof from the subject of the
          preciousness of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          How little is the preciousness of time considered, and how little
          sense of it do the greater part of mankind seem to have! And to how
          little good purpose do many spend their time! There is nothing more
          precious, and yet nothing of which men are more prodigal. Time is with
          many, as silver was in the days of Solomon, as the stones of the
          street, and nothing accounted of. They act as if time were as plenty
          as silver was then, and as if they had a great deal more than they
          needed, and knew not what to do with it. If men were as lavish of
          their money as they are of their time, if it were as common a thing
          for them to throw away their money, as it is for them to throw away
          their time, we should think them beside themselves, and not in the
          possession of their right minds. Yet time is a thousand times more
          precious than money; and when it is gone, cannot be purchased for
          money, cannot be redeemed by silver or gold. — There are several sorts
          of persons who are reproved by this doctrine, whom I shall
          particularly mention.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, those who spend a great part of their time in idleness, or in
          doing nothing that turns to any account, either for the good of their
          souls or bodies; nothing either for their own benefit, or for the
          benefit of their neighbor, either of the family or of the body-politic
          to which they belong. There are some persons upon whose hands time
          seems to lie heavy, who, instead of being concerned to improve it as
          it passes, and taking care that it pass not without making it their
          own, act as if it were rather their concern to contrive ways how to
          waste and consume it; as though time, instead of being precious, were
          rather a mere encumbrance to them. Their hands refuse to labor, and
          rather than put themselves to it, they will let their families suffer,
          and will suffer themselves. Pro. 19:15, “An idle soul shall suffer
          hunger.” Pro. 23:21, “Drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Some spend much of their time at the tavern, over their cups, and in
          wandering from house to house, wasting away their hours in idle and
          unprofitable talk which will turn to no good account. Pro. 14:23, “In
          all labour there is profit; but the talk of the lips tendeth only to
          poverty.” The direction of the apostle, in Eph. 4:28 is, that we
          should “labour, working with our hands the thing that is good, that we
          may have to give to him that needeth.” But indolent men, instead of
          gaining anything to give to him that needeth, do but waste what they
          have already. Pro. 18:9, “He that is slothful in his work, is brother
          to him that is a great waster.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, they are reproved by this doctrine who spend their time in
          wickedness, who do not merely spend their time in doing nothing to any
          good purpose, but spend it to ill purposes. Such do not only lose
          their time, but they do worse; with it they hurt both themselves and
          others. — Time is precious, as we have heard, because eternity depends
          upon it. By the improvement of time, we have opportunity of escaping
          eternal misery, and obtaining eternal blessedness. But those who spend
          their time in wicked works, not only neglect to improve their time to
          obtain eternal happiness, or to escape damnation, but they spend it to
          a quite contrary purpose, viz. to increase their eternal misery, or to
          render their damnation the more heavy and intolerable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some spend much time in reveling, and in unclean talk and practices,
          in vicious company-keeping, in corrupting and ensnaring the minds of
          others, setting bad examples, and leading others into sin, undoing not
          only their own souls, but the souls of others. Some spend much of
          their precious time in detraction and backbiting; in talking against
          others; in contention, not only quarreling themselves, but fomenting
          and stirring up strife and contention. It would have been well for
          some men, and well for their neighbors, if they had never done
          anything at all. For then they would have done neither good nor hurt.
          But now they have done a great deal more hurt than they have done or
          ever will do good. There are some persons whom it would have been
          better for the towns where they live, to have at the charge of
          maintaining them in doing nothing, if that would have kept them in a
          state of inactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who have spent much of their time in wickedness, if ever they
          shall reform, and enter upon a different mode of living, will find,
          not only that they have wasted the past, but that they have made work
          for their remaining time, to undo what they have done. How will many
          men, when they shall have done with time, and shall look back upon
          their past lives, wish that they had no time! The time which they
          spend on earth will be worse to them than if they had spent so much
          time in hell. For an eternity of more dreadful misery in hell will be
          the fruit of their time on earth, as they employ it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, those are reproved by this doctrine, who spend their time only
          in worldly pursuits, neglecting their souls. Such men lose their time,
          let them be ever so diligent in their worldly business. And though
          they may be careful not to let any of it pass so, but that it shall
          some way or other turn to their worldly profit. They that improve time
          only for their benefit in time, lose it; because time was not given
          for itself, but for that everlasting duration which succeeds it. —
          They, therefore, whose time is taken up in caring and laboring for the
          world only, in inquiring what they shall eat, and what they shall
          drink, and wherewithal they shall be clothed; in contriving to lay up
          for themselves treasure upon earth, how to enrich themselves, how to
          make themselves great in the world, or how to live in comfortable and
          pleasant circumstances, while here; who busy their minds and employ
          their strength in these things only, and the stream of whose
          affections is directed towards these things; they lose their precious
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let such, therefore, as have been guilty of thus spending their time,
          consider it. You have spent a great part of your time, and a great
          part of your strength, in getting a little of the world; and how
          little good doth it afford you, now you have gotten it! What happiness
          or satisfaction can you reap from it? Will it give you peace of
          conscience, or any rational quietness or comfort? What is your poor,
          needy, perishing soul the better for it? And what better prospects
          doth it afford you of your approaching eternity? And what will all
          that you have acquired avail you when time shall be no longer?
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>An exhortation to improve time.</p>
        <p>
          Consider what hath been said of the preciousness of time, how much
          depends upon it, how short and uncertain it is, how irrecoverable it
          will be when gone. If you have a right conception of these things, you
          will be more choice of your time than of the most fine gold. Every
          hour and moment will seem precious to you. — But besides those
          considerations which have been already set before you, consider also
          the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that you are accountable to God for your time. Time is a talent
          given us by God; he hath set us our day; and it is not for nothing.
          Our day was appointed for some work; therefore he will, at the day’s
          end, call us to an account. We must give account to him of the
          improvement of all our time. We are God’s servants; as a servant is
          accountable to his master, how he spends his time when he is sent
          forth to work, so are we accountable to God. If men would aright
          consider this, and keep it in mind, would they not improve their time
          otherwise than they do? Would you not behave otherwise than you do, if
          you considered with yourselves every morning, that you must give an
          account to God, how you shall have spent that day? And if you
          considered with yourselves, at the beginning of every evening, that
          you must give an account to God, how you shall have spent that
          evening? Christ hath told us, that “for every idle word which men
          speak they shall give account in the day of judgment,” Mat. 12:36. How
          well, therefore, may we conclude, that we must give an account of all
          our idle misspent time!
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, consider how much time you have lost already. For your having
          lost so much, you have the greater need of diligently improving what
          yet remains. You ought to mourn and lament over your lost time. But
          that is not all, you must apply yourselves the more diligently to
          improve the remaining part, that you may redeem lost time. — You who
          are considerably advanced in life, and have hitherto spent your time
          in vanities and worldly cares, and have lived in a great measure
          negligent of the interests of your souls, may well be terrified and
          amazed, when you think how much time you have lost and wasted away. —
          In that you have lost so much time, you have the more need of
          diligence, on three accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. As your opportunity is so much the shorter. — Your time at its
          whole length is short. But set aside all that you have already lost,
          and then how much shorter is it! As to that part of your time which
          you have already lost, it is not to be reckoned into your opportunity;
          for that will never be any more; and it is no better, but worse to
          you, than if it never had been.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. You have the same work to do that you had at first, and that under
          great difficulties. Hitherto you have done nothing at all of your
          work, all remains to be done, and that with vastly greater
          difficulties and opposition in your way than would have been if you
          had set about it seasonably. So that the time in which to do your work
          is not only grown shorter, but your work is grown greater. You not
          only have the same work to do, but you have more work. For while you
          have lost your time, you have not only shortened it, but you have been
          making work for yourselves. How well may this consideration awaken you
          to a thorough care, not to let things run on in this manner any
          longer, and rouse you up immediately to apply yourselves to your work
          with all your might!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. That is the best of your time which you have lost. The first of a
          man’s time, after he comes to the exercise of his reason, and to be
          capable of performing his work, is the best. You who have lived in sin
          till past your youth, have lost the best part. So that here all these
          things to be considered together, viz. that your time in the whole is
          but short, there is none to spare. A great part of that is gone, so
          that it is become much shorter. That which is gone is the best; yet
          all your work remains, and not only so, but with greater difficulties
          than ever before attended it. And the shorter your time is, the more
          work you have to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          What will make you sensible of the necessity of a diligent improvement
          of remaining time, if these things will not? Sometimes such
          considerations as these have another effect, viz. to discourage
          persons, and to make them think, that seeing they have lost so much
          time, it is not worth their while to attempt to do anything now. The
          devil makes fools of them; for when they are young, he tells them,
          there is time enough hereafter, there is no need of being in haste, it
          will be better seeking salvation hereafter; and then they believe him.
          Afterwards, when their youth is past, he tells them, that now they
          have lost so much, and the best of their time, that it is not worth
          their while to attempt to do anything; and now they believe him too.
          So that with them no time is good. The season of youth is not a good
          time; for that is most fit for pleasure and mirth, and there will be
          enough afterwards. And what comes afterwards is not a good time,
          because the best of it is gone. Thus are men infatuated and ruined.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what madness is it for persons to give way to discouragement, so
          as to neglect their work, because their time is short! What need have
          they rather to awake out of sleep, thoroughly to rouse up themselves,
          and to be in good earnest, that if possible they may yet obtain
          eternal life! Peradventure God may yet give them repentance to the
          acknowledgment of the truth, that they may be saved. Though it be late
          in the day, yet God calls upon you to rouse, and to apply yourselves
          to your work. And will you not hearken to his counsel in this great
          affair, rather than to the counsel of your mortal enemy?
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, consider how time is sometimes valued by those who are come
          near to the end of it. What a sense of its preciousness have poor
          sinners sometimes, when they are on their deathbeds! Such have cried
          out, O, a thousand worlds for an inch of time! Then time appears to
          them indeed precious. An inch of time could do them no more good than
          before, when they were in health, supposing a like disposition to
          improve it, nor indeed so much. For a man’s time upon a deathbed is
          attended with far greater disadvantage for such an improvement as will
          be for the good of his soul, than when he is in health. — But the near
          approach of death makes men sensible of the inestimable worth of time.
          Perhaps, when they were in health, they were as insensible of its
          value as your are, and were as negligent of it. But how are their
          thoughts altered now! It is not because they are deceived, that they
          think time to be of such value, but because their eyes are opened. And
          it is because you are deceived and blind that you do not think as they
          do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, consider what a value we may conclude is set upon time by
          those who are past the end of it. What thoughts do you think they have
          of its preciousness, who have lost all their opportunity for obtaining
          eternal life, and are gone to hell? Though they were very lavish of
          their time while they lived, and set no great value upon it; yet how
          have they changed their judgments! How would they value the
          opportunity which you have, if they might but have it granted to them!
          What would they not give for one of your days, under the means of
          grace! — So will you, first or last, be convinced. But if you be not
          convinced except in the manner in which they are, it will be too late.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two ways of making men sensible of the preciousness of time.
          One is, by showing them the reason why it must be precious, by telling
          them how much depends on it, how short it is, how uncertain, etc. The
          other is experience, wherein men are convinced how much depends on the
          improvement of time. The latter is the most effectual way; for that
          always convinces, if nothing else doth. — But if persons be not
          convinced by the former means, the latter will do them no good. If the
          former be ineffectual, the latter, though it be certain, yet is always
          too late. Experience never fails to open the eyes of men, though they
          were never opened before. But if they be first opened by that, it is
          no way to their benefit. Let all therefore be persuaded to improve
          their time to their utmost.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION V</p>
        <p>Advice respecting the improvement of time.</p>
        <p>I shall conclude with advising to three things in particular.</p>
        <p>
          First, improve the present time without any delay. If you delay and
          put off its improvement, still more time will be lost; and it will be
          an evidence that you are not sensible of its preciousness. Talk not of
          more convenient seasons hereafter; but improve your time while you
          have it, after the example of the psalmist. Psa. 119:60, “I made
          haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, be especially careful to improve those parts of time which are
          most precious. Though all time is very precious, yet some parts are
          more precious than others; as, particularly, holy time is more
          precious than common time. Such time is of great advantage for our
          everlasting welfare. Therefore, above all, improve your Sabbaths, and
          especially the time of public worship, which is the most precious
          part. Lose it not either in sleep, or in carelessness, inattention,
          and wandering imaginations. How sottish are they who waste away, not
          only their common, but holy time, yea the very season of attendance on
          the holy ordinances of God! — The time of youth is precious, on many
          accounts. Therefore, if you be in the enjoyment of this time, take
          heed that you improve it. Let not the precious days and years of youth
          slip away without improvement. A time of the strivings of God’s Spirit
          is more precious than other time. Then God is near; and we are
          directed, in Isa. 55:6, “To seek the Lord while he may be found, and
          to call upon him while he is near.” Such especially is an accepted
          time, and a day of salvation: 2 Cor. 6:2, “I have heard thee in a time
          accepted, and in a day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now
          is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, improve well your time of leisure from worldly business. Many
          persons have a great deal of such time, and all have some. If men be
          but disposed to it, such time may be improved to great advantage. When
          we are most free from cares for the body, and business of an outward
          nature, a happy opportunity for the soul is afforded. Therefore spend
          not such opportunities unprofitably, nor in such a manner that you
          will not be able to give a good account thereof to God. Waste them not
          away wholly in unprofitable visits, or useless diversions or
          amusements. Diversion should be used only in subserviency to business.
          So much, and no more, should be used, as doth most fit the mind and
          body for the work of our general and particular callings.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have need to improve every talent, advantage, and opportunity, to
          your utmost, while time lasts; for it will soon be said concerning
          you, according to the oath of the angel, in Rev. 10:5, 6, “And the
          angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his
          hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who
          created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and
          the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are
          therein, that there should be time no longer.”
