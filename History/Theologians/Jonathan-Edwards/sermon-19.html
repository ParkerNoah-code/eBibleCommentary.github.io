        <h2>
          The Perpetuity And Change Of The Sabbath – 1 Corinthians 16:1, 2
        </h2>
        <p>
          1 Corinthians 16:1, 2<br />
          Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to
          the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the first day of the
          week, let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered
          him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject: That it is the mind and will of God that the first day of the
          week should be the day that should be especially set apart for
          religious exercises and duties among Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE find in the New Testament often mentioned a certain collection,
          which was made by the Grecian churches, for the brethren in Judea, who
          were reduced to pinching want by a dearth which then prevailed, and
          was the heavier upon them by reason of their circumstances, they
          having been from the beginning oppressed and persecuted by the
          unbelieving Jews. This collection or contribution is twice mentioned
          in the Acts, 11:28-30 and 24:17. It is also noticed in several of the
          epistles: as Rom. 15:26 and Gal. 2:10. But it is most largely insisted
          on, in these two epistles to the Corinthians: in this first epistle,
          16, and in the second epistle, 8 and 9. The apostle begins the
          directions, which in this place he delivers concerning this matter,
          with the words of the text — wherein we may observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. What is the thing to be done concerning which the apostle gives
          them direction — the exercise and manifestation of their charity
          towards their brethren — by communicating to them for the supply of
          their wants, which was by Christ and his apostles often insisted on,
          as one main duty of the Christian religion and is expressly declared
          to be so by the apostle James, chap. 1:27, “Pure religion and
          undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless
          and widows in their affliction.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We may observe the time on which the apostle directs that this
          should be done, viz. “on the first day of the week.” By the
          inspiration of the Holy Ghost he insists upon it, that it be done on
          such a particular day of the week, as if no other day would do so well
          as that, or were so proper and fit a time for such a work. — Thus,
          although the inspired apostle was not for making that distinction of
          days in gospel times, which the Jews made, as appears by Gal. 4:10,
          “Ye observe days, and months,” etc., yet here he gives the preference
          to one day of the week, before any other, for the performance of a
          certain great duty of Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. It may be observed that the apostle had given to other churches,
          that were concerned in the same duty, to do it on the first day of the
          week: “As I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, even so do
          ye.” Whence we may learn, that it was nothing peculiar in the
          circumstances of the Christians at Corinth, which was the reason why
          the Holy ghost insisted that they should perform this duty on this day
          of the week. The apostle had given the like orders to the churches of
          Galatia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Galatia was far distant from Corinth: the sea parted them, and
          there were several other countries between them. Therefore it cannot
          be thought that the Holy Ghost directs them to this time upon any
          secular account, having respect to some particular circumstances of
          the people in that city, but upon a religious account. In giving the
          preference to this day for such work, before any other day, he has
          respect to something which reached all Christians throughout the wide
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          And by other passages of the New Testament, we learn that the case was
          the same as to other exercises of religion, and that the first day of
          the week was preferred before any other day, in churches immediately
          under the care of the apostles, for an attendance on the exercises of
          religion in general. Acts 20:7, “Upon the first day of the week, when
          the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them.”
          It seems by these things to have been among the primitive Christians
          in the apostles’ days, with respect to the first day of the week, as
          it was among the Jews, with respect to the seventh.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are taught by Christ, that the doing of alms and showing of mercy
          are proper works for the Sabbath-day. When the Pharisees found fault
          with Christ for suffering his disciples to pluck the ears of corn, and
          eat on the Sabbath, Christ corrects them with that saying, “I will
          have mercy and not sacrifice;” Mat. 12:7. And Christ teaches that
          works of mercy are proper to be done on the Sabbath, Luke 13:15, 16,
          and 14:5. — These works used to be done on sacred festivals and days
          of rejoicing under the Old Testament, as in Nehemiah’s and Esther’s
          time, Neh. 8:10 and Est. 9:19, 22. — And Josephus and Philo, two very
          noted Jews, who wrote not long after Christ’s time, give an account
          that it was the manner among the Jews on the Sabbath, to make
          collections for sacred and pious uses.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          It is the mind and will of God that the first day of the week should
          be especially set apart among Christians for religious exercises and
          duties.
        </p>
        <p>
          That this is the doctrine which the Holy Ghost intended to teach us,
          by this and some other passages of the New Testament, I hope will
          appear plainly by the sequel. This is a doctrine that we have been
          generally brought up in by the instructions and examples of our
          ancestors, and it has been the general profession of the Christian
          world, that this day ought to be religiously observed and
          distinguished from other days of the week. However, some deny it. Some
          refuse to take notice of the day, as different from other days. Others
          own that it is a laudable custom of the Christian church, into which
          she fell by agreement and by appointment of her ordinary rulers, to
          set apart this day for public worship. But they deny any other
          original to such an observation of the day, than prudential human
          appointment. Others religiously observe the Jewish Sabbath, as of
          perpetual obligation, and that we want a foundation for determining
          that that is abrogated, and another day of the week is appointed in
          the room of the seventh.
        </p>
        <p>
          All these classes of men say that there is no clear revelation that it
          is the mind and will of God, that the first day of the week should be
          observed as a day to be set apart for religious exercises, in the room
          of the ancient Sabbath, which there ought to be in order to the
          observation of it by the Christian church as a divine institution.
          They say that we ought not to go upon the tradition of past ages, or
          upon uncertain and far-fetched inferences from some passages of the
          history of the New Testament, or upon some obscure and uncertain hints
          in the apostolic writings. But that we ought to expect a plain
          institution, which they say we may conclude God would have given us,
          if he had designed that the whole Christian church, in all ages,
          should observe another day of the week for a holy Sabbath, than that
          which was appointed of old by plain and positive institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far it is undoubtedly true that if this be the mind and will of
          God, he has not left the matter to human tradition, but has so
          revealed his mind about it, in his Word, that there is to be found
          good and substantial evidence that it is his mind. Doubtless, the
          revelation is plain enough for them that have ears to hear: that is
          for them that will justly exercise their understandings about what God
          says to them. No Christian, therefore, should rest till he has
          satisfactorily discovered the mind of God in this matter. If the
          Christian Sabbath be of divine institution, it is doubtless of great
          importance to religion that it be well kept, and therefore, that every
          Christian be well acquainted with the institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          If men take it only upon trust, and keep the first day of the week
          because their parents taught them so, or because they see others do
          it, they will never be likely to keep it so conscientiously and
          strictly, as if they had been convinced by seeing for themselves that
          there are good grounds in the Word of God for their practice. Unless
          they do see thus for themselves, whenever they are negligent in
          sanctifying the Sabbath or are guilty of profaning it, their
          consciences will not have that advantage to smite them for it, as
          otherwise they would. — And those who have a sincere desire to obey
          God in all things, will keep the Sabbath more carefully and more
          cheerfully, if they have seen and been convinced that therein they do
          what is according to the will and command of God, and what is
          acceptable to him. [They] will also have a great deal more comfort in
          the reflection upon their having carefully and painfully kept the
          Sabbath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, I design now, by the help of God, to show that it is
          sufficiently revealed in the Scriptures, to be the mind and will of
          God, that the first day of the week should be distinguished in the
          Christian church from other days of the week, as a Sabbath, to be
          devoted to religious exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to this, I shall here premise that the mind and will of God,
          concerning any duty to be performed by us, may be sufficiently
          revealed in his Word, without a particular precept in so many express
          terms, enjoying it. The human understanding is the ear to which the
          Word of God is spoken; and if it be so spoken, that that ear may
          plainly hear it, it is enough. God is sovereign as to the manner of
          speaking his mind, whether he will speak it in express terms, or
          whether he will speak it by saying several other things which imply
          it, and from which we may, by comparing them together, plainly
          perceive it. If the mind of God be but revealed, if there be but
          sufficient means for the communication of his mind to our minds, that
          is sufficient: whether we hear so many express words with our ears, or
          see them in writing with our eyes, or whether we see the thing that he
          would signify to us, by the eye of reason and understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who can positively say that if it had been the mind of God, that we
          should keep the first day of the week, he would have commanded it in
          express terms, as he did the observation of the seventh day of old?
          Indeed, if God had so made our faculties, that we were not capable of
          receiving a revelation of his mind in any other way, then there would
          have been some reason to say so. But God has given us such
          understandings, that we are capable of receiving a revelation, when
          made in another manner. And if God deals with us agreeably to our
          natures, and in a way suitable to our capacities, it is enough. If God
          discovers his mind in any way whatsoever, provided it be according to
          our faculties, we are obliged to obedience, and God may expect our
          notice and observance of his revelation, in the same manner as if he
          had revealed it in express terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall speak upon this subject under these two general propositions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It is sufficiently clear, that it is the mind of God, that one day
          of the week should be devoted to rest, and to religious exercises,
          throughout all ages and nations.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It is sufficiently clear, that under the gospel-dispensation, this
          day is the first day of the week.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Prop. It is sufficiently clear that it is the mind of God, that one
          day of the week should be devoted to rest and to religious exercises,
          throughout all ages and nations: not only among the ancient
          Israelites, till Christ came, but even in these gospel times and among
          all nations professing Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, from the consideration of the nature and state of mankind in
          this world, it is most consonant to human reason that certain fixed
          parts of time should be set apart, to be spent by the church wholly in
          religious exercises, and in the duties of divine worship. It is a duty
          incumbent on all mankind, in all ages alike, to worship and serve God.
          His service should be our great business. It becomes us to worship him
          with the greatest devotion and engagedness of mind, and therefore to
          put ourselves, at proper times, in such circumstances as will most
          contribute to render our minds entirely devoted to this work, without
          being diverted or interrupted by other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state of mankind in this world is such that we are called to
          concern ourselves in secular business and affairs, which will
          necessarily, in a considerable degree, take up the thoughts and engage
          the attention of the mind. However, some particular persons may be in
          circumstances more free and disengaged. Yet the state of mankind is
          such that the bulk of them, in all ages and nations, are called
          ordinarily to exercise their thoughts about secular affairs, and to
          follow worldly business, which in its own nature, is remote from the
          solemn duties of religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is therefore most meet and suitable that certain times should be
          set apart, upon which men should be required to throw by all other
          concerns: that their minds may be the more freely and entirely engaged
          in spiritual exercises in the duties of religion and in the immediate
          worship of God, and that their minds being disengaged from common
          concerns, their religion may not be mixed with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also suitable that these times should be fixed and settled, that
          the church may agree therein and that they should be the same for all,
          that men may not interrupt one another, but may rather assist one
          another by mutual example: for example has a great influence in such
          cases. If there be a time set apart for public rejoicing, and there be
          a general manifestation of joy, the general example seems to inspire
          men with a spirit of joy: one kindles another. So, if it be a time of
          mourning, and there be general appearances and manifestations of
          sorrow, it naturally affects the mind: it disposes it to depression,
          it casts a gloom upon it, and does as it were dull and deaden the
          spirits. So, if a certain time be set apart as holy time, for general
          devotion and solemn religious exercises, a general example tends to
          render the spirit serious and solemn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, without doubt, one proportion of time is better and fitter
          than another for this purpose. One proportion is more suitable to the
          state of mankind and will have a greater tendency to answer the ends
          of such times, than another. The times may be too far asunder. I think
          human reason is sufficient to discover that it would be too seldom for
          the purposes of such solemn times, that they should be but once a
          year. So, I conclude, nobody will deny but that such times may be too
          near together to agree with the state and necessary affairs of
          mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, there can be no difficulty in allowing that some certain
          proportion of time, whether we can exactly discover it or not, is
          really fittest and best — considering the end for which such times are
          kept, and the condition, circumstances, and necessary affairs of men;
          and considering what the state of man is, taking one age and nation
          with another — more convenient and suitable than any other, which God
          may know and exactly determine, though we, by reason of the scantiness
          of our understandings, cannot.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a certain frequency of the returns of these times may be more
          suitable than any other, so one length or continuance of the times
          themselves may be fitter than another, to answer the purposes of such
          times. If such times, when they come, were to last but an hour, it
          would not well answer the end. For then worldly things would crowd too
          nearly upon sacred exercises, and there would not be that opportunity
          to get the mind so thoroughly free and disengaged from other things,
          as there would be if the times were longer. Being so short, sacred and
          profane things would be as it were mixed together. Therefore, a
          certain distance between these times, and a certain continuance of
          them when they come, is more proper than others, which God knows and
          is able to determine, though perhaps we cannot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, it is unreasonable to suppose any other, than that God’s
          working six days and resting the seventh, and blessing and hallowing
          it, was to be of general use in determining this matter. It was
          written that the practice of mankind in general might some way or
          other be regulated by it. What could be the meaning of God’s resting
          the seventh day and hallowing and blessing it, which he did before the
          giving of the fourth commandment, unless he hallowed and blessed it
          with respect to mankind? For he did not bless and sanctify it with
          respect to himself, or that he within himself might observe it: as
          that is most absurd. And it is unreasonable to suppose that he
          hallowed it only with respect to the Jews, a particular nation, which
          rose up above two thousand years after.
        </p>
        <p>
          So much therefore must be intended by it, that it was his mind, that
          mankind should, after his example, work six days and then rest and
          hallow or sanctify the next following: that they should sanctify every
          seventh day, or that the space between rest and rest, one hallowed
          time and another, among his creatures here upon earth, should be six
          days. — So that it hence appears to be the mind and will of God that
          not only the Jews, but man in all nations and ages, should sanctify
          one day in seven: which is the thing we are endeavoring to prove.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, the mind of God in this matter is clearly revealed in the
          fourth commandment. The will of God is there revealed, not only that
          the Israelitish nation, but that all nations, should keep every
          seventh day holy, or which is the same thing, one day after every six.
          This command, as well as the rest, is doubtless everlasting and of
          perpetual obligation, at least as to the substance of it, as is
          intimated by its being engraven on the tables of stone. Nor is it to
          be thought that Christ ever abolished any command of the ten, but that
          there is the complete number ten yet, and will be to the end of the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some say, that the fourth command is perpetual, but not in its literal
          sense: not as designing any particular proportion of time to be set
          apart and devoted to literal rest and religious exercises. They say
          that it stands in force only in a mystical sense, viz. as that weekly
          rest of the Jews typified spiritual rest in the Christian church, and
          that we under the gospel are not to make any distinction of one day
          from another, but are to keep all time holy, doing everything in a
          spiritual manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is an absurd way of interpreting the command, as it refers to
          Christians. For if the command be so far abolished, it is entirely
          abolished. For it is the very design of the command, to fix the time
          of worship. The first command fixes the object, the second the means,
          the third the manner, the fourth the time. And if it stands in force
          now only as signifying a spiritual, Christian rest, and holy behavior
          at all times, it does not remain as one of the ten commands, but as a
          summary of all the commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main objection against the perpetuity of this command is that the
          duty required is not moral. Those laws whose obligations arises from
          the nature of things and from the general state and nature of mankind,
          as well as from God’s positive revealed will, are called moral laws.
          Others, whose obligation depends merely upon God’s positive and
          arbitrary institution, are not moral: such as the ceremonial laws, and
          the precepts of the gospel about the two sacraments. Now, the
          objectors say, they will allow all that is moral in the decalogue to
          be of perpetual obligation. But this command, they say, is not moral.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this objection is weak and insufficient for the purpose for which
          it is brought, or to prove that the fourth command, as to the
          substance of it, is not of perpetual obligation. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If it should be allowed that there is no morality belonging to the
          command, and that the duty required is founded merely on arbitrary
          institution, it cannot therefore be certainly concluded that the
          command is not perpetual. We know that there may be commands in force
          under the gospel and to the end of the world, which are not moral.
          Such are the institutions of the two sacraments. And why may there not
          be positive commands in force in all ages of the church? If positive,
          arbitrary institutions are in force in gospel-times, what is there
          which concludes that no positive precept give before the times of the
          gospel can yet continue in force? But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As we have observed already, the thing in general that there should
          be certain fixed parts of time set apart to be devoted to religious
          exercises, is founded in the fitness of the thing, arising from the
          nature of things, and the nature and universal state of mankind.
          Therefore, there is as much reason that there should be a command of
          perpetual and universal obligation about this, as about any other duty
          whatsoever. For if the thing in general, that there be a time fixed,
          be founded in the nature of things, there is consequent upon it a
          necessity, that the time be limited by a command. For there must be a
          proportion of time fixed, or else the general moral duty cannot be
          observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The particular determination of the proportion of time in the
          fourth commandment, is also founded in the nature of things, only our
          understandings are not sufficient absolutely to determine it of
          themselves. We have observed already that without doubt one proportion
          of time is in itself fitter than another, and a certain continuance of
          time fitter than any other, considering the universal state and nature
          of mankind, which God may see, though our understandings are not
          perfect enough absolutely to determine it. So that the difference
          between this command and others, does not lie in this (that other
          commands are founded in the fitness of the things themselves, arising
          from the universal state and nature of mankind, and this not), but
          only that the fitness of other commands is more obvious to the
          understandings of men, and they might have seen it of themselves. But
          this could not be precisely discovered and positively determined
          without the assistance of revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that the command of God, that every seventh day should be devoted
          to religious exercises, is founded in the universal state and nature
          of mankind, as well as other commands. Only man’s reason is not
          sufficient, without divine direction, so exactly to determine it.
          Though perhaps man’s reason is sufficient to determine that it ought
          not to be much seldomer, nor much oftener, than once in seven days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, God appears in his Word laying abundantly more weight on this
          precept concerning the Sabbath, than on any precept of the ceremonial
          law. It is in the decalogue, one of the ten commands, which were
          delivered by God with an audible voice. It was written with his own
          finger on the tables of stone in the mount, and was appointed
          afterwards to be written on the tables which Moses made. The keeping
          of the weekly Sabbath is spoken of by the prophets, as that wherein
          consists a great part of holiness of life, and is inserted among moral
          duties, Isa. 58:13, 14, “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath,
          from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a
          delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not
          doing thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord;
          and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and
          fee thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the
          Lord hath spoken it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, it is foretold that this command should be observed in
          gospel-times, as in Isa. 56 at the beginning, where the due observance
          of the Sabbath is spoken of as a great part of holiness of life, and
          is placed among moral duties. It is also mentioned as a duty that
          should be most acceptable to God from his people, even where the
          prophet is speaking of gospel-times, as in the foregoing chapter, and
          in the first verse of this chapter. And, in the third and fourth
          verses, the prophet is speaking of the abolition of the ceremonial law
          in gospel-times, and particularly of that law, which forbids eunuchs
          to come into the congregation of the Lord. Yet, here the man is
          pronounced blessed, who keeps the Sabbath from polluting it, verse 2.
          And even in the very sentence where the eunuchs are spoken of as being
          free from the ceremonial law, they are spoken of as being yet under
          obligation to keep the Sabbath, and actually keeping it, as that which
          God lays great weight upon: “For thus saith the Lord, unto the eunuchs
          that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take
          hold of my covenant; Even unto them will I give in mine house, and
          within my walls, a place and a name better than of sons and of
          daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut
          off.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, the strangers spoken of in the sixth and seventh verses, are
          the Gentiles, that should be called in the times of the gospel, as is
          evident by the last clause in the seventh, and by the eighth verse:
          “For mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people. The
          Lord God, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel, saith, Yet will I
          gather others to him, besides those that are gathered unto him.” Yet
          it is represented here as their duty to keep the Sabbath: “Also the
          sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him,
          and to love the name of the Lord, to be his servants, every one that
          keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;
          even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my
          house of prayer.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, a further argument for the perpetuity of the Sabbath, we have
          in Mat. 24:20, “Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither
          on the sabbath-day.” Christ is here speaking of the flight of the
          apostles and other Christians out of Jerusalem and Judea, just before
          their final destruction, as is manifest by the whole context, and
          especially by the 16th verse, “Then let them which be in Judea flee
          into the mountains.” But this final destruction of Jerusalem was after
          the dissolution of the Jewish constitution, and after the Christian
          dispensation was fully set up. Yet, it is plainly implied in these
          words of our Lord, that even then Christians were bound to a strict
          observation of the Sabbath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have shown that it is the will of God that every seventh day be
          devoted to rest and to religious exercises.
        </p>
        <p>Sermon 2</p>
        <p>
          II. Prop. That it is the will of God that under the gospel
          dispensation, or in the Christian church, this day should be the first
          day of the week.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to the confirmation of this, let the following things be
          considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the words of the fourth commandment afford no objections
          against this being the day that should be the Sabbath, any more than
          against any other day. That this day, which according to the Jewish
          reckoning, is the first of the week, should be kept as a Sabbath, is
          no more opposite to any sentence or word of the fourth command, than
          that the seventh of the week should be the day. The words of the
          fourth command do not determine which day of the week we should keep
          as a Sabbath. They merely determine, that we should rest and keep as a
          Sabbath every seventh day, or one day after every six. It says, “Six
          days thou shalt labour, and the seventh thou shalt rest;” which
          implies no more, than that after six days of labour, we shall upon the
          next to the sixth, rest and keep it holy. And this we are obliged to
          do forever. But the words no way determine where those six days shall
          begin, and so where the rest or Sabbath shall fall. There is no
          direction in the fourth command how to reckon the time, i.e. where to
          begin and end it. But that is supposed to be determined otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jews did not know, by the fourth command, where to begin their six
          days, and on which particular day to rest: this was determined by
          another precept. The fourth command does indeed suppose a particular
          day appointed; but it does not appoint any. It requires us to rest and
          keep holy a seventh day, one after every six of labor, which
          particular day God either had or should appoint. The particular day
          was determined for that nation in another place, viz. in Exo.
          16:23-26, “And he said unto them, this is that which the Lord hath
          said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord: bake
          that which ye will bake, today, and seethe that ye will seethe; and
          that which remaineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the
          morning. And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a sabbath unto
          the Lord: today ye shall not find it in the field. Six days ye shall
          gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there
          shall be none.” This is the first place where we have any mention made
          of the Sabbath, from the first Sabbath on which God rested.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems that the Israelites, in the time of their in Egypt, had lost
          the true reckoning of time by the days of the week, reckoning from the
          first day of the creation. They were slaves and in cruel and had in a
          great measure forgotten the true religion. For we are told that they
          served the gods of Egypt. And it is not to be supposed that the
          Egyptians would suffer their slaves to rest from their work every
          seventh day. Now, they having remained in for so long a time, had
          probably lost the weekly reckoning. Therefore, when God had brought
          them out of Egypt into the wilderness, he made known to them the
          Sabbath, on the occasion and in the manner recorded in the text just
          now quoted. Hence, we read in Nehemiah that when God had led the
          children of Israel out of Egypt, etc. he made known unto them his holy
          Sabbath, Neh. 9:14, “And madest known unto them the holy sabbath.” To
          the same effect, we read din Eze. 20:10, 12, “Wherefore I caused them
          to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the
          wilderness. Moreover also, I gave them my sabbaths.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But they never would have known where the particular day would have
          fallen by the fourth command. Indeed, the fourth command, as it was
          spoken to the Jews, did refer to their Jewish Sabbath. But that does
          not prove that the day was determined and appointed by it. The precept
          in the fourth command is to be taken generally of such a seventh day
          as God should appoint, or had appointed. And because such a particular
          day had been already appointed for the Jewish church, therefore, as it
          was spoken to them, it did refer to that particular day. But this does
          not prove, but the same words refer to another appointed seventh day,
          now in the Christian church. The words of the fourth command may
          oblige the church, under different dispensations, to observe different
          appointed seventh days, as well as the fifth command may oblige
          different persons to honor different fathers and mothers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian Sabbath, in the sense of the fourth command, is as much
          the seventh day as the Jewish Sabbath, because it is kept after six
          days of labor as well as that. It is the seventh reckoning from the
          beginning of our first working-day, as well as that was the seventh
          from the beginning of their first working day. All the difference is
          that the seven days formerly began from the day after God’s rest from
          the creation, and now they begin the day after that. It is no matter
          by what names the days are called: if our nation had, for instance,
          called Wednesday the first day of the week, it would have been all one
          as to this argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, by the institution of the Christian Sabbath, there is no
          change from the fourth command; but the change is from another law,
          which determined the beginning and ending of their working days. So
          that those words of the fourth command, viz. “For in six days the Lord
          made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested
          the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath-day, and
          hallowed it.” These words are not made insignificant to Christians, by
          the institution of the Christian Sabbath. They still remain in their
          full force as to that which is principally intended by them. They were
          designed to give us a reason why we are to word but six days at a
          time, and then rest on the seventh, because God has set us the
          example. And taken so, they remain still in as much force as ever they
          were. This is the reason still, as much as ever it was, why we may
          work but six days at a time. What is the reason that Christians rest
          every seventh, and not every eighth, or every ninth, or tenth day? It
          is because God worked six days and rested the seventh.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true, these words did carry something further in their meaning,
          as they were spoken to the Jews, and to the church before the coming
          of Christ. It was then also intended by them that the seventh day was
          to be kept in commemoration of the work of creation. But this is no
          objection to the supposition that the words, as they relate to us, do
          not import all that they did, as they related to the Jews. For there
          are other words which were written upon those tables of stone with the
          ten commandments, which are known and allowed not to be of the same
          import, as they relate to us, and as they related to the Jews, viz.
          these words, in the preface to the ten commandments, “I am the Lord
          thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
          of .” — These words were written on the tables of stone with the rest,
          and are spoken to us, as well as to the Jews. They are spoken to all
          to whom the commandments themselves are spoken, for they are spoken as
          an enforcement of the commandments. But they do not now remain in all
          the signification which they had, as they respected the Jews. For we
          never were brought out of Egypt, out of the house of , except in a
          mystical sense. — The same may be said of those words which are
          inserted in the commandments themselves, Deu. 5:15, “And remember that
          thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God
          commanded thee out thence, through a mighty hand and by a
          stretched-out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep
          the sabbath-day.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So that all the arguments of those who are against the Christian
          Sabbath, drawn from the fourth command, which are all their strength,
          come to nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, that the ancient church was commanded to keep a seventh day in
          commemoration of the work of creation, is an argument for the keeping
          of a weekly Sabbath in commemoration of the work of redemption, and
          not any reason against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We read in Scripture of two creations, the old and the new, and these
          words of the fourth command are to be taken as of the same force to
          those who belong to the new creation, with respect to that new
          creation as they were to those who belonged to the old creation, with
          respect to that. We read that “in the beginning God created the heaven
          and the earth,” and the church of old were to commemorate that work.
          But when God creates a new heaven and a new earth, those that belong
          to this new heaven and new earth, by a like reason, are to commemorate
          the creation of their heaven and earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scriptures teach us to look upon the old creation as destroyed,
          and as it were annihilated by sin; or, as being reduced to a chaos
          again, without form and void, as it was at first. Jer. 4:22, 23, “They
          are wise to do evil, but to do good they have n knowledge. I beheld
          the earth, and lo, it was without form and void: and the heavens, and
          they had no light!” i.e. were reduced to the same state in which they
          were at first; the earth was without form and void, and there was no
          light, but darkness was upon the face of the deep.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scriptures further teach us to call the gospel-restoration and
          redemption, a creation of a new heaven and a new earth; Isa. 65:17,
          18, “For behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth; and the former
          shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be you glad and
          rejoice forever in that which I create: for behold, I create Jerusalem
          a rejoicing, and her people a joy.” And Isa. 51:16, “And I have put my
          words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand,
          that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth,
          and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” And Isa. 66:22, “For as the
          new heavens and the new earth which I will make,” etc. — In these
          places we are not only told a new creation, or new heavens and a new
          earth, but we are told what is meant by it, viz. The gospel
          renovation, the making of Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy,
          saying unto Zion, “Thou art my people,” etc. The prophet, in all these
          places, is prophesying of the gospel-redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gospel-state is everywhere spoken of as a renewed state of things,
          wherein old things are passed away, and all things become new: we are
          said to be created unto Christ Jesus unto good works. All things are
          restored and reconciled whether in heaven or in earth, and God has
          caused light to shine out of darkness, as he did at the beginning. And
          the dissolution of the Jewish state was often spoken of in the Old
          Testament as the end of the world. — But we who belong to the
          gospel-church, belong to the new creation. Therefore there seems to be
          at least as much reason that we should commemorate the work of this
          creation, as that the members of the ancient Jewish church should
          commemorate the work of the old creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, there is another thing which confirms it (that the fourth
          command teaches God’s resting from the new creation, as well as from
          the old), which is that the Scriptures expressly speak of the one as
          parallel with the other: i.e. Christ’s resting from the work of
          redemption is expressly spoken of as being parallel with God’s resting
          from the work of creation. Heb. 4:10, “For he that is entered into his
          rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Christ rested from his works when he rose from the dead, on the
          first day of the week. When he rose from the dead, then he finished
          his work of redemption. His humiliation was then at an end: he then
          rested and was refreshed. — When it is said, “There remaineth a rest
          to the people of God;” in the original, it is, a sabbatism, or the
          keeping of a Sabbath: and this reason is given for it, “For he that
          entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God
          did from his.” — These three things at least we are taught by these
          words:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. To look upon Christ’s rest from his work of redemption, as parallel
          with God’s rest from the work of creation. For they are expressly
          compared together, as parallel one with the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They are spoken of as parallel, particularly in this respect, viz.
          the relation which they both have to the keeping of a Sabbath among
          God’s people, or with respect to the influence which these two rests
          have as to sabbatizing in the church of God. For it is expressly with
          respect to this that they are compared together. Here is an evident
          reference to God’s blessing and hallowing the day of his rest from the
          creation to be a Sabbath, and appointing a Sabbath of rest in
          imitation of him. For the apostle is speaking of this, verse 4, “For
          he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God
          did rest the seventh day from all his works.” Thus far is evident,
          whatever the apostle has respect to by this keeping of a Sabbath by
          the people of God: whether it be a weekly sabbatizing on earth or a
          sabbatizing in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is evident in these words that the preference is given to the
          latter rest, viz. the rest of our Savior from his works, with respect
          to the influence it should have or relation it bears, to the
          sabbatizing of the people of God, now under the gospel, evidently
          implied in the expression, “There remaineth therefore a sabbatism to
          the people of God. For he that entered into his rest,” etc. For in
          this sabbatism appointed in remembrance of God’s rest from the work of
          creation, does not remain, but ceases, and that this new rest, in
          commemoration of Christ’s resting from his works, remains in the room
          of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, the Holy Ghost has implicitly told us that the Sabbath which
          was instituted in commemoration of the old creation, should not be
          kept in gospel-times. Isa. 65:17, 18. There we are told that when God
          should create new heavens and a new earth, the former should not be
          remembered, nor come into mind. If this be so, it is not to be
          supposed that we are to keep a seventh part of time, on purpose to
          remember it, and call it to mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us understand this which way we will, it will not be well
          consistent with the keeping of one day in seven, in the gospel-church,
          principally for the remembrance and calling to mind of the old
          creation. If the meaning of the place be only this — that the old
          creation shall not be remembered nor come into mind in comparison with
          the new, that the new will be so much more remarkable and glorious,
          will so much more nearly concern us, so much more notice will taken of
          it, and it will be thought so much more worthy to be remembered and
          commemorated, that the other will not be remembered, nor come into
          mind — it is impossible that it should be more to our purpose. For
          then hereby the Holy Ghost teaches us, that the Christian church has
          much more reason to commemorate the new creation than the old;
          insomuch, that the old is worthy to be forgotten in comparison with
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as the old creation was no more to be remembered, nor come into
          mind; so, in the following verse, the church is directed forever to
          commemorate the new creation, “But be you glad, and rejoice for ever
          in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing,
          and her people a joy;” i.e. Though you forget the old, yet forever to
          the end of the world, keep a remembrance of the new creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, it is an argument that the Jewish Sabbath was not to be
          perpetual, that the Jews were commanded to keep it in remembrance of
          their deliverance out of Egypt. One reason why it was instituted was
          because God thus delivered them, as we are expressly told, Deu. 5:15,
          “And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that
          the Lord thy God brought thee out thence, through a mighty hand, and
          by a stretched-out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to
          keep the sabbath-day.” Now can any person think that God would have
          all nations under the gospel, and to the end of the world, keep a day
          every week, which was instituted in remembrance of the deliverance of
          the Jews out of Egypt?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, the Holy Ghost has implicitly told us that instituted memorials
          of the Jews’ deliverance from Egypt should be no longer upheld in
          gospel-times, Jer. 16:14-15. The Holy Ghost, speaking of gospel-times,
          says, “Therefore, behold the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall
          no more be said, The Lord liveth that brought up the children of
          Israel out of Egypt; but the Lord liveth that brought up the children
          of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither
          he had driven them; and I will bring them again into their own land.”
          They shall no more say, The Lord liveth that brought, etc. i.e. at
          least they shall keep up no more any public memorials of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there be a Sabbath kept up in gospel-times, as we have shown there
          must be it is more just from these words to suppose that it should be
          as a memorial of that which is spoken of in the latter verse, the
          bringing up of the children of Israel from the land of the north: that
          is the redemption of Christ and his bringing home the elect, not only
          from Judea, but from the north, and from all quarters of the world. —
          See Isa. 43:16-20.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, it is no more than just to suppose that God intended to
          intimate to us that the Sabbath ought by Christians to be kept in
          commemoration of Christ’s redemption, in that the Israelites were
          commanded to keep it in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt,
          because that deliverance out of Egypt is an evident, known, and
          allowed type of it. It was ordered of God, on purpose to represent it.
          Everything about that deliverance was typical of this redemption, and
          much is made of it, principally for this reason: because it is so
          remarkable a type of Christ’s redemption. And it was but a shadow, the
          work in itself was nothing in comparison with the work of redemption.
          What is a petty redemption of one nation from a temporal , to the
          eternal salvation of the whole church of the elect in all ages and
          nations, from eternal damnation and the introduction of them, not into
          a temporal Canaan, but into heaven: into eternal glory and
          blessedness? Was that shadow so much to be commemorated as that a day
          once a week was to be kept on the account of it, and shall not we much
          more commemorate that great and glorious work of which it was designed
          on purpose to be a shadow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, the words in the fourth commandment, which speak of the
          deliverance out of Egypt, can be of no significance unto us, unless
          they are to be interpreted of the gospel-redemption. But the words of
          the decalogue are spoken to all nations and ages. Therefore, as the
          words were spoken to the Jews, they referred to the type or shadow. As
          they are spoken to us, they are to be interpreted of the antitype and
          substance. For the Egypt from which we under the gospel are redeemed,
          is the spiritual Egypt; the house of from which we are redeemed, is a
          state of spiritual . — Therefore the words, as spoken to us, are to be
          thus interpreted, “Remember, thou was a servant to sin and Satan, and
          the Lord thy God delivered thee from this , with a mighty hand and
          outstretched arm; therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep
          the Sabbath-day.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As the words in the preface to the ten commandments, about the
          bringing of the children of Israel out of Egypt, are interpreted in
          our catechism (and as they have respect to us): [they] must be
          interpreted [as being] of our spiritual redemption. So, by an exact
          identity of reason, must these words in Deuteronomy, annexed to the
          fourth command, be interpreted [as] of the same gospel redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jewish Sabbath was kept on the day that the children of Israel
          came up out of the Red sea. For we are told in Deu. 5:15, that this
          holy rest of the Sabbath was appointed in commemoration of their
          coming up out of Egypt. But the day of their going through the Red sea
          was the day of their coming up out of Egypt. For till then they were
          in the land of Egypt. The Red sea was the boundary of the land of
          Egypt. — The Scripture itself tells us that the day on which they sung
          the song of Moses, was the day of their coming up out of the land of
          Egypt; Hos. 2:15, “And she shall sing there, as in the days of her
          youth, as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt;”
          referring plainly to that triumphant song which Moses and the children
          of Israel sang when they came up out of the Red sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scripture tells us that God appointed the Jewish Sabbath in
          commemoration of the deliverance of the children of Israel from their
          task-masters, the Egyptians, and of their rest from their hard and
          slavery under them; Deu. 5:14, 15, “That thy man-servant and thy
          maid-servant may rest as well as thou. And remember that thou wast a
          servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee
          out thence, through a mighty hand, and by a stretched-out arm:
          therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath-day.”
          But the day that the children of Israel were delivered from their
          task-masters and had rest from them, was the day when the children of
          Israel came up out of the Red Sea. They had no rest from them till
          then. For though they were before come forth on their journey to go
          out of the land of Egypt, yet they were pursued by the Egyptians and
          were exceedingly perplexed and distressed. But on the morning that
          they came up out of the Red sea, they had complete and final
          deliverance. Then they had full rest from their taskmasters. Then God
          said to them, “The Egyptians which ye have seen this day, ye shall see
          no more for ever;” Exo. 14:13. Then they enjoyed a joyful day of rest,
          a day of refreshment. Then they sang the song of Moses, and on that
          day was their Sabbath of rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this coming up of the children of Israel out of the Red sea, was
          only a type of the resurrection of Christ. That people was the
          mystical body of Christ, and Moses was a great type of Christ himself.
          And besides, on that day Christ went before the children of Israel in
          the pillar of cloud and of fire, as their Savior and Redeemer. On that
          morning Christ, in this pillar of cloud and fire, rose out of the Red
          sea, as out of great waters, which was a type of Christ’s rising from
          a state of death and from that great humiliation which he suffered in
          death. The resurrection of Christ from the dead, is in Scripture
          represented by his coming up out of deep waters. So it is in Christ’s
          resurrection, as represented by Jonah’s coming out of the sea, Mat.
          12:40. It is also compared to a deliverance out of deep waters, Psa.
          69:1-3, 14, and 15. These things are spoken of Christ, as is evident
          from this, that many things in this Psalm are in the New Testament
          expressly applied to Christ. [Compare verse 4 with John 15:25, verse 9
          with John 2:17, and verse 2 with Mat. 27:34, 48; Mark 15:23; John
          19:29, and verse 2, with Rom. 11:9, 10, and verse 25 with Acts 1:20.]
          Therefore, as the Jewish Sabbath was appointed on the day on which the
          pillar of cloud and fire rose out of the Red sea, and on which Moses
          and the church, the mystical body of Christ, came up out of the same
          sea, which is a type of the resurrection of Christ — it is a great
          confirmation that the Christian Sabbath should be kept on the day of
          the rising of the real body of Christ from the grave, which is the
          antitype. For surely the Scriptures have taught us that the type
          should give way to the antitype, and that the shadow should give way
          to the substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eighth, I argue the same thing from Psa. 118:22-24. There we are
          taught that the day of Christ’s resurrection is to be celebrated with
          holy joy by the church. “The stone which the builders refused is
          become the head-stone of the corner. This is the Lord’s doing, it is
          marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made, we
          will rejoice and be glad in it.” The stone spoken of is Christ: he was
          refused and rejected by the builders, especially when he was put to
          death. That making him the head of the corner, which is the Lord’s
          doing and so marvelous in our eyes, is Christ’s exaltation, which
          began with his resurrection. While Christ lay in the grave, he lay as
          a stone cast away by the builders. But when God raised him from the
          dead, then he became the head of the corner. Thus it is evident the
          apostle interprets it, Acts 4:10, 11, “Be it known unto you all, and
          to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus of Nazareth,
          whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead,” etc. — “This is the
          stone which was set at nought by you builders, which is become the
          head of the corner.” And the day on which this was done, we are here
          taught, God has made to be the day of the rejoicing of the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ninth, the abolition of the Jewish Sabbath seems to be intimated by
          this: that Christ, the Lord of the Sabbath, lay buried on that day.
          Christ, the author of the world, was the author of that work of
          creation of which the Jewish Sabbath was the memorial. It was he that
          worked six days and rested the seventh day from all his works, and was
          refreshed. Yet he was holden in the chains of death on that day. —
          God, who created the world, now in his second work of creation, did
          not follow his own example, if I may so speak. He remained imprisoned
          in the grave on that day and took another day to rest in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sabbath was a day of rejoicing, for it was kept in commemoration
          of God’s glorious and gracious works of creation and the redemption
          out of Egypt. Therefore we are directed to call the Sabbath a delight.
          But it is not a proper day for the church, Christ’s spouse, to
          rejoice, when Christ the bridegroom lies buried in the grave, as
          Christ says, Mat. 9:15, “That the children of the bridechamber cannot
          mourn, while the bridegroom is with them. But the time will come, when
          the bridegroom shall be taken from them; then shall they mourn.” —
          While Christ was holden under the chains of death, then the bridegroom
          was taken from then. Then it was a proper time for the spouse to mourn
          and not rejoice. But when Christ rose again, then it was a day of joy,
          because we are begotten again to a living hope, by the resurrection of
          Jesus Christ from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tenth, Christ has evidently, on purpose and design, peculiarly honored
          the first day of the week, the day on which he rose from the dead, by
          taking it from time to time to appear to the apostles, and he chose
          this day to pour out the Holy Ghost on the apostles, which we read of
          in the second chapter of Acts. For this was on Pentecost, which was on
          the first day of the week, as you may see by Lev. 23:15-16. And he
          honored this day by pouring out his Spirit on the apostle John, and
          giving him his visions, Rev. 1:10, “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s
          day,” etc. — Now doubtless Christ had his meaning in thus
          distinguishingly honoring this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eleventh, it is evident by the New Testament that this was especially
          the day of the public worship of the primitive church, by the
          direction of the apostles. We are told that this was the day that they
          were wont to come together to break bread. And this they evidently did
          with the approbation of the apostles, inasmuch as they preached to
          them on that day, and therefore doubtless they assembled together by
          the direction of the apostles. Acts 20:7, “And upon the first day of
          the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul
          preached unto them.” So the Holy Ghost was careful that the public
          contributions should be on this day, in all the churches, rather than
          on any other day, as appears by our text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twelfth, this first day of the week is in the New Testament called the
          Lord’s day; see Rev. 1:10. — Some say, how do we know that this was
          the first day of the week? Every day is the Lord’s day. But it is the
          design of John to tell us when he had those visions. And if by the
          Lord’s day is meant any day, how does that inform us when that event
          took place?
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is meant by this expression we know, just in the same way as
          we know what is the meaning of any word in the original of the New
          Testament, or the meaning of any expression in an ancient language,
          viz. By what we find to be the universal signification of the
          expression in ancient times. This expression, the Lord’s day, is found
          by the ancient use of the whole Christian church, by what appears in
          all the writings of ancient times, even from the apostles’ days, to
          signify the first day of the week.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the expression implies in it the holiness of the day. For
          doubtless the day is called the Lord’s day, as the sacred supper is
          called the Lord’s supper, which is so called, because it is a holy
          supper — which is so called because it is a holy supper, to be
          celebrated in remembrance of the Lord Christ and of his redemption. So
          this is a holy day, to be kept in remembrance of the Lord Christ and
          his redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first day of the week being in Scripture called the Lord’s day,
          sufficiently makes it out to be the day of the week that is to be kept
          holy unto God. For God has been pleased to call it by his own name.
          When anything is called by the name of God in Scripture, this denotes
          the appropriation of it to God. — Thus God put his name upon his
          people Israel of old; Num. 6:27, “And they shall put my name upon the
          children of Israel.” They were called by the name of God, as it is
          said, 2 Chr. 7:14, “If my people which are called by my name,” etc.
          i.e. They were called God’s people, or the Lord’s people. This denoted
          that they were a holy peculiar people above all others. Deu. 7:6,
          “Thou art a holy people unto the Lord;” and so in verse 14, and many
          other places.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the city Jerusalem was called by God’s name; Jer. 25:29, “Upon the
          city which is called by my name.” Dan. 9:18, 19, “And the city which
          is called by thy name,” etc. This denoted that it was a holy city, a
          city chosen of God above all other cities for holy uses, as it is
          often called the holy city, as in Neh. 11:1, “To dwell in Jerusalem,
          the holy city;” and in many other places.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the temple is said to be a house called by God’s name; 1 Kin. 8:43,
          “This house that is called by name.” And often elsewhere. That is, it
          was called God’s house, or the Lord’s house. This denoted that it was
          called a holy place, a house devoted to holy uses, above all others.
        </p>
        <p>
          So also we find that the first day of the week is called by God’s
          name, being called in Scripture God’s day, or the Lord’s day, which
          denotes that it is a holy day, a day appropriated to holy uses, above
          all others in the week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirteenth, the tradition of the church from age to age, though it be
          no rule, yet may be a great confirmation of the truth in such a case
          as this is. We find by all accounts that it has been the universal
          custom of the Christian church, in all ages, even from the age of the
          apostles, to keep the first day of the week. We read in the writings
          which remain of the first, second, and third centuries, of the
          Christians keeping the Lord’s day (and so in all succeeding ages), and
          there are no accounts that contradict them. — This day has all along
          been kept by Christians, in all countries throughout the world, and by
          almost all that have borne the name of Christians, of all
          denominations, however different in their opinions as to other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, although this be not sufficient of itself without a foundation in
          Scripture, yet it may be a confirmation of it, because here is really
          matter of conviction in it to our reason. Reason may greatly confirm
          truths revealed in the Scriptures. The universality of the custom
          throughout all Christian counties, in all ages, by what account we
          have of them, is a good argument that the church had it from the
          apostles. And it is difficult to conceive how all should come to agree
          to set up such a custom through the world, of different sects and
          opinions, and we have no account of any such thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourteenth, it is no way weakening to these arguments, that there is
          nothing more plainly said about it in the New Testament, till John
          wrote his Revelation, because there is a sufficient reason to be given
          for it. In all probability it was purposely avoided by the Holy
          Spirit, in the first settling of the Christian churches in the world,
          both among the heathen and among the Jews, but especially for the sake
          of the Jews, and out of tenderness to the Jewish Christians. For it is
          evident that Christ and the apostles declared one thing after another
          to them gradually as they could bear it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jews had a regard for their Sabbath above almost anything in the
          laws of Moses, and there was that in the Old Testament which tended to
          uphold them in the observance of this, much more strongly than
          anything else that was Jewish. God had made so much of it, had so
          solemnly, frequently, and carefully commanded it, and had often so
          dreadfully punished the breach of it, that there was more color for
          their retaining this custom than almost any other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore Christ dealt very tenderly with them in this point. Other
          things of this nature we find very gradually revealed. Christ had many
          things to say, as we are informed, which yet he said not, because they
          could not as yet bear them, and gave this reason for it: that it was
          like putting new wine into old bottles. They were so contrary to their
          old customs, that Christ was gradual in revealing them. He gave here a
          little and there a little, as they could bear; and it was a long time
          before he told them plainly the principal doctrines of the kingdom of
          heaven. — He took the most favorable opportunities to tell them of his
          sufferings and death, especially when they were full of admiration at
          some signal miracle, and were confirmed in it, that he was the
          Messiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          He told them many things much more plainly after his resurrection than
          before. But even then, he did not tell them all, but left more to be
          revealed by the Holy Ghost at Pentecost. They therefore were much more
          enlightened after that than before. However, as yet he did not reveal
          all. The abolition of the ceremonial law about meats and drinks was
          not fully known till after this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostles were in the same manner careful and tender of those to
          whom they preached and wrote. It was very gradually that they ventured
          to teach them the cessation of the ceremonial laws of circumcision and
          abstinence from unclean meats. How tender is the apostle Paul with
          such as scrupled in, in the fourteenth chapter of Romans! He directs
          those who had knowledge, to keep it to themselves, for the sake of
          their weak brethren. Rom 14:22 — But I need say no more to evince
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I will say this, that it is very possible that the apostles
          themselves at first might not have this change of the day of the
          Sabbath fully revealed to them. The Holy Ghost, at his descent,
          revealed much to them, yet after that, they were ignorant of much of
          gospel-doctrine. Yea, they were so, a great while after they acted the
          part of apostles in preaching, baptizing, and governing the church.
          Peter was surprised when he was commanded to eat meats legally
          unclean, and so were the apostles in general, when Peter was commanded
          to go to the Gentiles, to preach to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus tender was Christ of the church while an infant. He did not feed
          them with strong meat, but was careful to bring in the observance of
          the Lord’s day by degrees, and therefore took all occasions to honor
          it: by appearing from time to time of choice on that day, by sending
          down his Spirit on that day in that remarkable manner at Pentecost, by
          ordering Christians to meet in order to break bread on that day, and
          by ordering their contributions and other duties of worships to be
          holden on it — thus introducing the observance of it by degrees. And
          though as yet the Holy Ghost did not speak very plainly about it, yet
          God took special care that there should be sufficient evidences of his
          will, to be found out by the Christian church, when it should be more
          established and settled, and should have come to the strength of a
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I leave it with everyone to judge, whether there be not
          sufficient evidence, that it is the mind and will of God, that the
          first day of the week should be kept by the Christian church as a
          Sabbath?
