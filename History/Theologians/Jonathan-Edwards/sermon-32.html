        <h2>Christ Exalted – 1 Corinthians 15:25, 26</h2>
        <p class="title">Dated August 1738. Lecture.</p>
        <p>
          1 Corinthians 15:25, 26, “For he must reign, till he hath put all
          enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed, is
          death.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THE apostle in this chapter particularly opposes some among the
          Christian Corinthians who denied the resurrection of the dead and
          infested the church with their doctrine. There were two sorts of
          persons in that age who were especially great opposers of the doctrine
          of the resurrection. One among the Jews were the Sadducees, of whom we
          read, Acts 23:8. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection,
          either angel or spirit. And we have the same account in other places.
          Among the heathen that were the chief opposers of this doctrine were
          their philosophers. The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead was
          not consistent with their philosophy, by the principles of which, it
          was impossible that one who was deprived of the habit of life, would
          ever receive it again. And therefore they ridiculed the doctrine when
          the apostle preached it among them at Athens. (Acts 17) Probably the
          church at Corinth received this corruption from the philosophers, and
          not the Sadducees. For Corinth was near to Athens, and the place of
          the chief resort of the philosophers of Greece.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle, in opposing this error, first insists on Christ’s
          resurrection from the dead, and next on the resurrection of all the
          saints at the end of the world. And in the verses next before the
          text, shows how both are connected, or that one arises or follows from
          the other. And then adds, “then cometh the end, when he shall have
          delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have
          put down all rule, and all authority, and power. For he must reign
          till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall
          be destroyed is death.” Observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Here is one thing wherein appears the glory of that exaltation and
          dominion, that Christ has as our redeemer, viz. that it issues in the
          subjection of all enemies under his feet. It is not said all his
          enemies, possibly because those that shall be put under his feet are
          not only his enemies, but also the enemies of his Father and of his
          people. Their being under his feet denotes their being perfectly
          subdued, and his being gloriously exalted over them. It shall be thus
          with respect to God’s and his, and his people’s enemies universally,
          not one excepted; which universality is signified here two ways; all
          enemies — and the very last enemy: when there shall be but one enemy
          left, that shall also be put under his feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We may learn what is here meant by enemies by the particular
          instance here given as the last that shall be destroyed, viz. death.
          Which shows that by enemies, is not meant persons only, that set
          themselves in opposition to God and his people, but evils; whatever is
          against God and his people, and opposes Christ or his saints, whether
          they be persons or things.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>
          How evil of all kinds has prevailed and highly exalted itself in the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evil, of all kinds, has risen to an exceeding height in the world, and
          highly exalted itself against God, and Christ, and the church. — This
          will appear by the following particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Satan has highly exalted himself, and greatly prevailed. He is
          vastly superior in his natural capacity and abilities to mankind. He
          was originally one of the highest rank of creatures, but proudly
          exalted himself in rebellion against God in heaven. We are told, that
          pride was the condemnation of the devil. (1 Tim. 3:6) He became proud
          of his own superior dignity and mighty abilities, and the glory which
          his Creator had put upon him. And [he] probably thought it too much to
          submit to the Son of God, and attempted to exalt his throne above him.
          And he prevailed to draw away vast multitudes of the heavenly hosts
          into an open rebellion against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And after he was cast down from heaven, he proudly exalted himself in
          this world, and prevailed to do great things. By his subtle
          temptations he procured the fall of our first parents, and so brought
          about the ruin of their whole race. He procured their ruin in body and
          soul, and the death of both, and that they should be exposed to all
          manner of calamity in this world, and to eternal ruin hereafter. He so
          far prevailed, that he drew men off from the service of their Maker,
          and set up himself to be the god of this world. And in a little time,
          [he] drew the world into that almost universal corruption, which
          brought on the flood of water, but which it was destroyed. And after
          that, he drew on all nations, except the posterity of Jacob, from the
          worship of the true God, and darkened all the world with heathenism,
          and held them under this darkness for a great many ages, he himself
          being worshipped as God almost all over the world. The nations of the
          earth offered sacrifices to him and multitudes offered up their
          children. And during that time, he often so far prevailed against the
          people of God, that he had almost swallowed them up. The church was
          often brought to the very brink of ruin.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when Christ himself appeared in the world, how did he exalt
          himself against him! And prevailed so far, as to influence men to hate
          and despise him all the days of his life. And at last he persuaded one
          of his own disciples to betray him. Accordingly, he was delivered into
          the hands of men, to be mocked, buffeted, spit upon, and treated with
          the greatest ignominy that unrestrained malice could devise. And at
          last procured that he should be put to the most cruel and ignominious
          kind of death. And since that, he has greatly exalted himself against
          the gospel and kingdom of Christ. He has procured that the church, for
          the most part, has been the subject of great persecution; has often
          brought it to the brink of utter destruction; has accomplished great
          works in setting up those great kingdoms of antichrist and Mahomet;
          and darkened great part of the world, that was once enlightened with
          the gospel of Christ, with worse than heathen darkness. And he has
          infected the Christian world with multitudes of heresies and false
          ways of worship, and greatly promoted atheism and infidelity. Thus
          highly has the devil exalted himself against God and Christ, and the
          elect. And so far he prevailed.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Guilt is another evil which has come to a great height in the
          world. All guilt is an evil of a dreadful nature. The least degree of
          it is enough utterly to undo any creature. It is a thing that reaches
          unto heaven, and cries to God, and brings down his wrath. The guilt of
          any one sin is so terrible an evil that it prevails to bind over the
          guilty person to suffer everlasting burnings. And so is in some
          respect infinite, in that it obliges to that punishment which has no
          end. And so is infinitely terrible. But this kind of evil has risen to
          a most amazing height in this world. Where not only some persons are
          guilty, but all, in all nations and ages, are naturally guilty
          wretches. And they who live to act any time in the world, are not only
          guilty of one sin, but of thousands, and thousands of thousands. What
          multiplied and what aggravated sins are some men guilty of! What guilt
          lies on some particular persons! How much more on some particular
          populous cities! How much more still on this wicked world! How much
          does the guilt of the world transcend all account, all expression, all
          power of numbers or measures! And above all, how vast is the guilt of
          the world, in all ages, from the beginning to the end of it! To what a
          pitch has guilt risen! The world being, as it were, on every side,
          loaded with it, as with mountains heaped on mountains, above the
          clouds and stars of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          And guilt, when it was imparted to Christ, greatly prevailed against
          him — though in himself innocent, and the eternal Son of God — even so
          as to hold him prisoner of justice for a while, and to open the
          flood-gates of God’s wrath upon him, and bring his waves and billows
          over him.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Corruption and wickedness of heart is another thing that has
          risen to an exceeding height in the world. Sin has so far prevailed
          that it has become universal. All mere men are become sinful and
          corrupt creatures. Let us attend to St. Paul’s description of the
          world (Rom. 3:9-18), “Jews and Gentiles are all under sin. As is
          written, There is none righteous, no not one; there is none that
          understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone
          out of the way, they are together become unprofitable, there is none
          that doeth good, no not one.” And not only is every one corrupt, but
          they are all over corrupt, in every power, faculty, and principle.
          Every part is depraved. Which is here represented by the several parts
          of the body being corrupt, as the throat, the tongue, the lips, the
          mouth, the feet. “Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their
          tongues they have used deceit, the poison of asps is under their lips;
          whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to
          shed blood.” And not only is every part corrupt, but exceeding
          corrupt, being possessed with dreadful principles of corruption.
          horribly evil dispositions and principles of sin, that may be
          represented by the poison of asps, which makes men like vipers and
          devils, principles of all uncleanness, pride, deceit, injustice,
          enmity, malice, blasphemy, murder. Here their throats are compared to
          an open sepulcher, and their mouth is said to be full of cursing and
          bitterness, and destruction and misery are said to be in their ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there are those principles of sin not only that are very bad, but
          every kind. Here is no sort of wickedness, but there is a seed of it
          in men. And these seeds and principles have not only a being in men’s
          hearts, but are there in great strength. They have the absolute
          possession and dominion over men so that they are sold under sin. Yea,
          wicked principles, and those only, are in the heart. The imagination
          of the thoughts of their heart is evil only. There are bad principles
          only, and no good ones. “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
          Thus the hearts of all men are deceitful and desperately wicked (Jer.
          17:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          And if we look, not only at the natural corruption of the heart, but
          at the contracted habits of sin, by wicked education and customs, how
          full shall we find the world of wickedness, in this respect! How have
          men, by bad customs in sinning, broken down all restraints upon
          natural corruption, and as it were abandoned themselves to wickedness!
          So far has corruption and wickedness prevailed in the world, and so
          high has it risen, that it is become a great and universal deluge,
          that overtops all things, and prevails with that strength, that it is
          like the raging waves of the tempestuous ocean, which are ready to
          bear down all before them.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Many of the devil’s instruments have greatly prevailed and have
          been exalted to an exceeding height in the world. It has been so in
          almost all ages of the world. Many of the devil’s instruments have
          prospered and prevailed till they have got to the head of great
          kingdoms and empires, with vast riches and mighty power. Those four
          great heathen monarchies that rose in the world before Christ are
          spoken of in Scripture as kingdoms set up in opposition to the kingdom
          of Christ. So they are represented in the interpretation of
          Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (Dan. 2:35, 36). These monarchies were
          exceeding powerful. The two last ruled over the greater part of the
          then known world. And the last especially, viz. the Roman empire, was
          exceeding mighty. So that it is said to be diverse from all kingdoms,
          and that it would devour the whole earth, and tread it down, and break
          it in pieces (Dan. 7:23). It is represented by the fourth beast, which
          was dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly, and had great iron
          teeth, that devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with
          his feet (Dan. 7:7). These four kingdoms all persecuted the church of
          God in their turns, especially the last. One of the governors of this
          monarchy put Christ to death. And afterwards one emperor after another
          made dreadful havoc of the church, making a business of it, with the
          force of all the empire, to torment and destroy the Christians,
          endeavoring, if possible, to root out the Christian name from under
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in those latter ages, how have those two great instruments of the
          devil, viz. antichrist and Mahomet, prevailed, and to what a pitch of
          advancement have they arrived, ruling over vast empires, with mighty
          wealth, pride and power, so that the earth has been, as it were,
          subdued by them. Antichrist has set up himself as the vicar of Christ,
          and has for many ages usurped the power of God, “sitting in the temple
          of God, and showing himself that he is God; and exalting himself above
          all that is called God, or that is worshipped.” And how dreadfully has
          he ravaged the church of God, being drunk with the blood of the
          saints, and the martyrs of Jesus. And has often, as it were, deluged
          the world in Christina blood, she with the utmost cruelty that human
          wit and malice could invent. — And at this day, many other instruments
          of the devil, many heretics, atheists, and other infidels, are
          exerting themselves against Christ and his church, with great pride
          and contempt.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Affliction and misery have also prevailed and risen to an
          unspeakable height in the world. The spiritual misery which the elect
          are naturally in is great. They are miserable captives of sin and
          Satan, and under obligations to suffer eternal burnings. This misery
          all mankind are naturally in. And spiritual troubles and sorrows have
          often risen to a great height in the elect. The troubles of a wounded
          spirit and guilty conscience, have been felt with intolerable and
          insupportable weight. “A wounded spirit who can bear?” (Pro. 18:14).
          And the darkness that has risen to God’s people after conversion,
          through the temptations and buffetings of the devil, and the hidings
          of God’s face, and manifestations of his anger, have been very
          terrible. And temporal afflictions have often risen exceeding high.
          The church of God has, for the most part, all along, been a seat of
          great affliction and tribulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the height to which the evil of affliction has risen, nowhere
          appears so much as in the afflictions that Christ suffered. The evil
          of affliction and sorrow exalted itself so high, as to seize the Son
          of God himself, and to cause him to be all in a bloody sweat, and to
          make his soul exceeding sorrowful, even unto death. It caused him to
          cry out, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” Affliction never
          prevailed to such a degree in this world, as in Christ, whose soul
          was, as it were, overwhelmed in an ocean of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Death is an evil which has greatly prevailed and made dreadful
          havoc in this world. How does it waste and devour mankind, one age
          after another, sparing none, high or low, rich or poor, good or bad!
          Wild beasts have destroyed many. Many cruel princes have taken away
          the lives of thousands, and laid waste whole countries. But death
          devours all. None are suffered to escape. And the bodies of the saints
          as well as other, fall a prey to this great devourer. Yea, so high did
          this enemy rise, that he took hold on Christ himself, and swallowed
          him among the rest. He became the prey of this great, insatiable
          monster. By his means, was his bodily frame destroyed, and laid dead
          in the dark and silent grave. And death still goes on destroying
          thousands every day. And therefore the grave is one of those things
          which Agur says, never has enough (Pro. 30:16). — So have evils of
          every kind prevailed, and to such a degree have they exalted
          themselves in the world.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>
          How Jesus Christ, in the work of redemption, appears gloriously above
          all these evils.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not the will of the infinitely wise and holy Governor of the
          world that things should remain in this confusion, this reign of evil,
          which had prevailed and exalted itself to such a height. But he had a
          design of subduing it, and delivering an elect part of the world from
          it, and exalting them to the possession of the greatest good, and to
          reign in the highest glory, out of a state of subjection to all these
          evils. And he chose his Son as the person most fit for an undertaking
          that was infinitely too great for any mere creature. And he has
          undertaken the work of our redemption. And though these evils are so
          many and so great, and have prevailed to such a degree, and have risen
          to such a height, and have been, as it were, all combined together;
          yet wherein they have exalted themselves, Christ, in the work of
          redemption, appears above them. He has gloriously prevailed against
          them all, and brings them under his feet, and rides forth, in the
          chariots of salvation, over their heads, or leading them in triumph at
          his chariot wheels. He appears in this work infinitely higher and
          mightier than they, and sufficient to carry his people above them, and
          utterly to destroy them all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Christ appears gloriously above all evil in what he did to procure
          redemption for us in his state of humiliation, by the righteousness he
          wrought out, and the atonement he made for sin. The evils mentioned,
          never seemed so much to prevail against him as in his sufferings. But
          in them, the foundation was laid for their overthrow. In them he
          appeared above Satan. Though Satan never exalted himself so high, as
          he did in procuring these sufferings of Christ; yet, then, Christ laid
          the foundation for the utter overthrow of his kingdom. He slew Satan,
          as it were, with his own weapon, the spiritual David cut off this
          Goliath’s head with his own sword, and he triumphed over him in his
          cross. “Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of
          them openly, triumphing over them in it,” (Col. 2:15) i.e. in his
          cross, mentioned in the preceding words. Then the wisdom of Christ
          appeared gloriously above the subtlety of Satan. Satan, that old
          serpent, used a great deal of subtlety to procure Christ’s death. And
          doubtless, when he had accomplished it, thought he had obtained a
          complete victory, being then ignorant of the contrivance of our
          redemption. But so did the wisdom of Christ order things that Satan’s
          subtlety and malice should be made the very means of undermining the
          foundations of his kingdom. And so he wisely led him into the pit that
          he had dug.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this also Christ appeared gloriously above the guilt of men. For he
          offered a sacrifice that was sufficient to do away all the guilt of
          the whole world. Though the guilt of man was like the great mountains,
          whose heads are lifted up to the heavens; yet his dying love, and his
          merits, appeared as a mighty deluge that overflowed the highest
          mountains, or like a boundless ocean that swallows them up, or like an
          immense fountain of light that with the fullness and redundancy of its
          brightness, swallows up men’s greatest sins, as little motes are
          swallowed up and hidden in the disk of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this Christ appeared above all the corruption of man, in that
          hereby he purchased holiness for the chief of sinners. And Christ in
          undergoing such extreme affliction, got the victory over all misery;
          and laid a foundation for its being utterly abolished, with respect to
          his elect. In dying he became the plague and destruction of death.
          When death slew him, it slew itself. For Christ, through death,
          destroyed him that had the power of death, even the devil (Heb. 2:14).
          By this he laid the foundation of the glorious resurrection of all his
          people to an immortal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Christ appears gloriously exalted above all evil, in his
          resurrection and ascension into heaven. When Christ rose from the
          dead, then it appeared that he was above death, which, though it had
          taken him captive, could not hold him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he appeared above the devil. Then this Leviathan that had
          swallowed him was forced to vomit him up again, as the Philistines
          that had taken captive the ark were forced to return it, Dagon being
          fallen before it, with his head and hands broken off, and only the
          stumps left. — Then he appeared above our guilt. For he was justified
          in his resurrection (Rom. 4:4, 25; 1 Tim. 3:16). In his resurrection
          he appeared above all affliction. For though he had been subject to
          much affliction and overwhelmed in it, he then emerged out of it, as
          having gotten the victory, never to conflict with any more sorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he ascended up into heaven, he rose far above the reach of the
          devil and all his instruments, who had before had him in their hands.
          And now has he sat down at the right hand of God, as being made head
          over all things to the church, in order to a complete and perfect
          victory over sin, Satan, death, and all his enemies. It was then said
          to him, “Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy
          footstool,” (Psa. 110:1). He entered into a state of glory, wherein he
          is exalted far above all these evils, as the forerunner of his people,
          and to make intercession for them, till they also are brought to be
          with him, in like manner exalted above all evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Christ appears gloriously above all evil, in his work in the
          hearts of the elect, in their conversion and sanctification. This is
          what the application of redemption, so far as it is applied in this
          world, consists in, which is done by the Holy Ghost as the Spirit of
          Christ. In this work of Christ in the hearts of his elect, he appears
          glorious above Satan. For the strong man armed is overcome, and all
          his armor, wherein he trusted, is taken from him, and his spoil
          divided. In this work, the lamb is, by the spiritual David taken out
          of the mouth of the lion and bear. The poor captive is delivered from
          his mighty and cruel enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this Christ appears gloriously above the corruption and wickedness
          of the heart, above its natural darkness in dispelling it, and letting
          in light, and above its enmity and opposition, by prevailing over it,
          drawing it powerfully and irresistibly to himself, and turning a heart
          of stone into a heart of flesh, above the obstinacy and perverseness
          of the will, by making them willing in the day of his power. In this
          he appears above all their lusts. For all sin is mortified in this
          work, and the soul is delivered from the power and dominion of it. —
          In this work the grace of Christ gloriously triumphs over men’s guilt.
          He comes over the mountains of their sins, and visits them with his
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And God is wont often in their work, either in the beginning or
          progress of it, to give his people those spiritual comforts, in which
          he gloriously appears to be above all affliction and sorrow. And often
          gives them to triumph over the devil, and his powerful and cruel
          instruments. Many saints, by the influences of Christ’s Spirit on
          their hearts, have rejoiced and triumphed, when suffering the greatest
          torments and cruelties of their persecutors. And in this work Christ
          sometimes gloriously appears above death, in carrying his people far
          above the fears of it, and making them to say, “O death, where is thy
          sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Christ gloriously appears above all these aforementioned evils, in
          his glorifying the souls of departed saints in heaven. In this he
          gives a glorious victory over death. Death by it is turned from an
          enemy into a servant. And their death, by the glorious change that
          passes in the state of their souls, is become a resurrection, rather
          than a death. Now Christ exalts the soul to a state of glory, wherein
          it is perfectly delivered from Satan and all his temptations, and all
          his instrument, and from all remains of sin and corruption, and from
          all affliction. “They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more,
          neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat — and God shall wipe
          away all tears from their eyes,” (Rev. 7:16, 17).
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Christ appears gloriously above these evils, in what he does in his
          providence in the world, as head and redeemer of his church. He
          appears gloriously above Satan and all his instruments in upholding
          his church, even from its first establishment, through all the
          powerful attempts that have been made against it by earth and hell.
          Hereby fulfilling his promise, “That the gates of hell should never
          prevail against it,” (Mat. 16:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ gloriously triumphed over these his enemies, in a remarkable
          success of his gospel, soon after his ascension, when many thousands
          in Jerusalem, and all parts of the world, were so soon turned from
          darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God, and in
          causing his word to go on and prosper, and his church to increase and
          prevail against all the opposition of the heathen world, when they
          united all their power to put a stop to it, and root it out. So that,
          in spite of all that the philosophers, and wise men, and emperors and
          princes could do, the gospel in a little time overthrew Satan’s old
          heathenish kingdom in the whole Roman empire, which was then the main
          part of the world. And so brought about the greatest and most glorious
          revolution. Instead of one single nation, now the greater part of the
          nations of the known world were become God’s people.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Christ’s exaltation above all evil in his government of the world,
          in his providence, as the Redeemer of his people, has since gloriously
          appeared in reviving his church by the reformation from popery, after
          it had for many ages lain in a great measure hid, and dwelt in a
          wilderness, under antichristian persecution.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he will yet far more gloriously triumph over Satan and all his
          instruments, in all the mighty kingdoms that have been set up in
          opposition to the kingdom of Christ, at the time of the fall of
          antichrist, and the beginning of those glorious times so much spoken
          of in Scripture prophecy. “Then shall the stone that has been cut out
          without hands smite all these kingdoms, and break them to pieces; and
          they shall become like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors, and
          the wind shall carry them away, that no place should be found for
          them: and the stone which smote them shall become a great mountain,
          and fill the whole earth,” (Dan. 2:34, 35). “Then shall the God of
          heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed; and it shall
          break in pieces, and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand
          forever,” (Dan. 2:44). “And then the kingdoms of this world shall
          become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign
          for ever and ever,” (Rev. 11:15). Though great and might empires have
          been set up one after another in the world, in opposition to the
          kingdom of Christ, during the succession of so many ages; yet,
          Christ’s kingdom shall be the last and the universal kingdom, which he
          has given him, as the heir of the world. Whatever great works Satan
          has wrought, the final issue and event of all, in the winding up of
          things in the last ages of the world, shall be the glorious kingdom of
          Christ through the world; a kingdom of righteousness and holiness, of
          love and peace, established everywhere. Agreeable to the ancient
          prediction, “I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like the Son
          of man, came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of
          days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him
          dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and
          languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion,
          which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be
          destroyed. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the
          kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the
          saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and
          all dominions shall serve and obey him,” (Dan. 7:13, 14, 27).
        </p>
        <p>
          Then shall Christ appear gloriously exalted indeed above all evil. And
          then shall all the saints in earth and heaven gloriously triumph in
          him, and sing, “Hallelujah, salvation, and glory, and honour, and
          power unto the Lord our God; for true and righteous are his judgments;
          for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with
          her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her
          hand. Hallelujah: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth,” (Rev. 19:1,
          2, 6).
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Christ will appear gloriously above all evil in the consummation
          of the redemption of his elect church at the end of the world. Then
          will be completed the whole work of redemption with respect to all
          that Christ died for, both in its interpretation and application; and
          not till then. And then will Christ’s exaltation above all evil be
          most perfectly and fully manifest. Then shall the conquest and triumph
          be completed with respect to all of them. Then shall all the devils,
          and all their instruments, be brought before Christ, to be judged and
          condemned. And then shall be completed their destruction in their
          consummate and everlasting misery; when they shall be all cast into
          the lake of fire, no more to range, and usurp dominion in the world,
          or have liberty to make opposition against God and Christ. They shall
          forever be shut up, thence forward only to suffer. Then shall death be
          totally destroyed. All the saints shall be delivered everlastingly
          from it. Even their bodies shall be taken from the power of death by a
          glorious resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then shall all guilt, and all sin and corruption, and all affliction,
          all sighs and tears, be utterly and eternally abolished, concerning
          every one of the elect, they being all brought to one complete body,
          to their consummate and immutable glory. And all this as the fruit of
          Christ’s blood, and as an accomplishment of his redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then all that evil, which has so prevailed, and so exalted itself, and
          usurped and raged, and reigned, shall be perfectly and forever thrust
          down and destroyed, with respect to all the elect. And all will be
          exalted to a state wherein they will be forever immensely above all
          these things. “And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor
          crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things
          are passed away,” (Rev. 21:4).
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>The subject improved and applied.</p>
        <p>
          I. IN this we may see how the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ appears
          in the work of redemption. It was because the Father had from eternity
          a design of exceedingly glorifying his Son, that he appointed him to
          be the person that should thus triumph over the evil in the world. The
          work of redemption is the most glorious of all God’s works that are
          made known to us. The glory of God most remarkably shines forth in it.
          And this is one thing wherein its glory eminently appears, that
          therein Christ appears so gloriously above Satan and all his
          instruments, above all guilt, all corruption, all affliction, above
          death, and above all evil. And more especially, because evil has so
          exalted itself in the world, as we have heard, and exalted itself
          against Christ in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Satan has ever had a peculiar enmity against the Son of God. Probably
          his first rebellion, which was his condemnation, was his proudly
          taking it in disdain, when God declared the decree in heaven, that his
          Son in man’s nature, should be the King of heaven, and that all the
          angels should worship him. However that was, yet it is certain that
          his strife has ever been especially against the Son of God. The enmity
          has always been between the seed of the woman, and the serpent. And
          therefore that war which the devil maintains against God is
          represented by the devil and his angels fighting against Michael and
          his angels (Rev. 12:7). This Michael is Christ (Dan. 10:21 and 12:1).
        </p>
        <p>
          God had appointed his Son to be the heir of the world. But the devil
          has contested this matter with him, and has strove to set himself up
          as God of the world. And how exceedingly has the devil exalted himself
          against Christ! How did he oppose him as he dwelt among the Jews, in
          his tabernacle and temple! And how did he oppose him when on earth!
          And how has he opposed him since his ascension! What great and mighty
          works has Satan brought to pass in the world! How many Babels has he
          built up to heaven, in his opposition to the Son of God! How exceeding
          proud and haughty has he appeared in his opposition! How have he and
          his instruments, and sin, affliction, and death, of which he is the
          father, raged against Christ? But yet Christ, in the work of
          redemption, appears infinitely above them all. In this work he
          triumphs over them, however they have dealt proudly, and they all
          appear under his feet. In this the glory of the Son of God, in the
          work of redemption, remarkably appears.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beauty of good appears with the greatest advantage, when compared
          with its contrary, and appears vastly above it, in its greatest
          height. The glory of Christ, in this glorious exaltation over so great
          evil, that so exalted itself against him, the more remarkable appears,
          in that he is thus exalted out of so low a state. Though he appeared
          in the world as a little child; yet how does he triumph over the most
          gigantic enemies of God and men! He who was “a man of sorrows, and
          acquainted with grief,” is a man of war, and triumphed over his
          enemies in all their power. He who was meek and lowly of heart, has
          triumphed over those proud foes. And he is exalted over them all, in
          that which appears most despicable, even his cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Here is matter of exceeding great encouragement for all sinful
          miserable creatures in the world of mankind to come to Christ. For let
          them be as sinful as they will, and ever so miserable; Christ, in the
          work of redemption, is gloriously exalted above all their sin and
          misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          How high soever their guilt has risen, though mountains have been
          heaping on mountains all the days of their lives, till the pile
          appears towering up to heaven, and above the very stars; yet Christ in
          the work of redemption appears gloriously exalted above all this
          height. — Though they are overwhelmed in a mighty deluge of woe and
          misery, a deluge that is not only above all their heads, but above the
          heads of the highest mountains, and they do not see how it is possible
          that they should escape; yet they have no reason to be discouraged
          from looking to Christ for help, who in the work of redemption,
          appears gloriously above the deluge of evil. Though they see dreadful
          corruption in their hearts, though their lusts appear like giants, or
          like the raging waves of the sea; yet they need not despair of help,
          but may look to Christ, who appears in the work of redemption,
          gloriously above all this corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they apprehend themselves to be miserable captives of Satan, and
          find him too strong an adversary for them, and the devil is often
          tempting and buffeting them, and triumphing over them with great
          cruelty; if it seems to them that the devil has swallowed them up, and
          his got full possession of them, as the whale had of Jonah; yet there
          is encouragement for them to look again, as Jonah did, towards God’s
          holy temple, and to trust in Christ for deliverance from Satan, who
          appears so gloriously exalted above him in the work of redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they are ready to sink with darkness and sorrows, distress of
          conscience, or those frowns of God upon them, so that God’s waves and
          billows seem to pass over them; yet they have encouragement enough to
          look to Christ for deliverance. These waves and billows have before
          exalted themselves against Christ, and he appeared to be infinitely
          above them. — And if they are afraid of death, if it looks exceeding
          terrible, as an enemy that would swallow them up; yet let them look to
          Christ who has appeared so gloriously above death, and their fears
          will turn into joy and triumph.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. What cause have they who have an interest in Christ, to glory in
          their Redeemer! They are often beset with many evils, and many mighty
          enemies surround them on every side, with open mouths ready to devour
          them. But they need not fear any of them. They may glory in Christ,
          the rock of their salvation, who appears so gloriously above them all.
          They may triumph over Satan, over this evil world, over guilt, and
          over death. For as their Redeemer is mighty, and is so exalted above
          all evil, so shall they also be exalted in him, They are now, in a
          sense, so exalted. For nothing can hurt them. Christ carries them, as
          on eagle’s wings, high out of the reach of all evils, so that they
          cannot come near them, to do them any real harm. And, in a little
          time, they shall be carried so out of their reach, that they shall not
          be able even to molest them anymore forever.
