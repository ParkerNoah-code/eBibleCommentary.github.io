        <h2>Hypocrites Deficient in the Duty of Prayer – Job 37:10</h2>
        <p class="title">Job 27:10, “Will he always call upon God?”</p>
        <p>CONCERNING these words, I would observe,</p>
        <p>
          1. Who it is that is here spoken of, viz. the hypocrite; as you may
          see, If you take the two preceding verses with the verse of the text.
          “For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when
          God taketh away his soul? Will God bear his cry when trouble cometh
          upon him? Will he delight himself in the Almighty? Will he always call
          up on God?” Job’s three friends, in their speeches to him, insisted
          much upon it, that he was an hypocrite. But Job, in this chapter,
          asserts his sincerity and integrity, and shows how different his own
          behavior had been from that of hypocrite. Particularly he declares his
          steadfast and immoveable resolution of persevering and holding out in
          the ways of religion and righteousness to the end; as you may see in
          the six first verses. In the text, he shows how contrary to this
          steadfastness and perseverance the character of the hypocrite is, who
          is not wont thus to hold out in religion
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We may observe what duty of religion it is, with respect to which
          the hypocrite is deciphered in the text, and that is the duty of
          prayer; or calling upon God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Here is something supposed of the hypocrite relating to this duty,
          viz. That he may continue in it for a while; he may call upon God for
          a season.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Something asserted, viz. That it is not the manner of hypocrites to
          continue always in this duty. Will he always call upon God? It is in
          the form of an interrogation; but the words have the force of a strong
          negation, or of an assertion, that however the hypocrite may call upon
          God for a season, yet he will not always continue in it.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          However hypocrites may continue for a season in the duty of prayer,
          yet it is their manner, after a while, in a great measure, to leave it
          off. In speaking upon this doctrine, I shall show,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. How hypocrites often continue for a season to call upon God.<br />
          II. How it is their manner, after a while, in a great measure to leave
          off the practice of this duty.<br />
          III. Give some reasons why this is the manner of hypocrites.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I would show how hypocrites often continue for a season in the duty
          of prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They do so for a while after they have received common
          illuminations and affections. While they are under awakenings, they
          may, through fear of hell, call upon God, and attend very constantly
          upon the duty of secret prayer. And after they have had some melting
          affections, having their hearts much moved with the goodness of God,
          or with some affecting encouragements, and false joy and comfort;
          while these impressions last they continue to call upon God in the
          duty of secret prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. After they have obtained an hope, and have made profession of their
          good estate, they often continue for a while in the duty of secret
          prayer. For a while they are affected with their hope: They think that
          God hath delivered them out of a natural condition, and given them an
          interest in Christ, thus introducing them into a state of safety from
          that eternal misery which they lately feared. With this supposed
          kindness of God to them, they are much affected, and often find in
          themselves for a while a kind of love to God, excited by his supposed
          love to them. Now, while this affection towards God continues, the
          duties of religion seem pleasant to them; it is even with some delight
          that they approach to God in their closets; and for the present it may
          be, they think of no other than continuing to call upon God as long as
          they live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yea, they may continue in the duty of secret prayer for awhile after
          the liveliness of their affections is past, partly through the
          influence of their former intentions: They intended to continue
          seeking God always; and now suddenly to leave off, would therefore be
          too shocking to their own minds and partly through the force of their
          own preconceived notions, and what they have always believed, viz.
          That godly persons do continue in religion, and that their goodness is
          not like the morning cloud. Therefore, though they have no love to the
          duty of prayer, and begin to grow weary of it, yet as they love their
          own hope, they are somewhat backward to take a course, which will
          prove it to be a false hope, and so deprive them of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they should at once carry themselves so as they have always been
          taught is a sign of a false hope, they would scare themselves Their
          hope is dear to them, and it would scare them to see any plain
          evidence that it is not true. Hence, for a considerable time after the
          force of their illuminations and affections is over, and after they
          hate the duty of prayer, and would be glad to have done with it, if
          they could, without showing themselves to be hypocrites; they hold up
          a kind of attendance upon the duty of secret prayer. This may keep up
          the outside of religion in them for a good while, and occasion it to
          be somewhat slowly that they are brought to neglect it. They must not
          leave off suddenly, because that would be too great a shock to their
          false peace. But they must come gradually to it, as they find their
          consciences can bear it, and as they can find out devices and salvos
          to cover over the matter, and make their so doing consistent, in their
          own opinion, with the truth of their hope. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It is the manner of hypocrites, after a while, in a great measure
          to leave off the practice of this duty. We are often taught, that the
          seeming goodness and piety of hypocrites is not of a lasting and
          persevering nature. It is so with respect to their practice of the
          duty of prayer in particular, and especially of secret prayer. They
          can omit this duty, and their omission of it not be taken notice of by
          others, who know what profession they have made. So that a regard to
          their own reputation doth not oblige them still to practice it. If
          others saw how they neglect it, it would exceedingly shock their
          charity towards them. But their neglect doth not fall under their
          observation; at least not under the observation of many. Therefore
          they may omit this duty, and still have the credit of being converted
          persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men of this character can come to a neglect of secret prayer by
          degrees without very much shocking their peace. For though indeed for
          a converted person to live in a great measure without secret prayer,
          is very wide of the notion they once had of a true convert; yet they
          find means by degrees to alter their notions, and to bring their
          principles to suit with their inclinations; and at length they come to
          that, in their notions of things, that a man may be a convert, and yet
          live very much in neglect of this duty. In time, they can bring all
          things to suit well together, an hope of heaven, and an indulgence of
          sloth in gratifying carnal appetites, and living in a great measure a
          prayerless life. They cannot indeed suddenly make these things agree;
          it must be a work of time; and length of time will effect it. By
          degrees they find out ways to guard and defend their consciences
          against those powerful enemies; so that those enemies, and a quiet,
          secure conscience, can at length dwell pretty well together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas it is asserted in the doctrine, that it is the manner of
          hypocrites, after a while, in a great measure to leave off this duty;
          I would observe to you,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That it is not intended but that they may commonly continue to the
          end of life in yielding an external attendance on open prayer, or
          prayer with others. They may commonly be present at public prayers in
          the congregation, and also at family prayer. This, in such places of
          light as this is, men commonly do before ever they are so much as
          awakened. Many vicious persons, who make no pretense to serious
          religion, commonly attend public prayers in the congregation; and also
          more private prayers, in the families in which they live, unless it be
          when carnal designs interfere, or when their youthful pleasures and
          diversions, and their vain company call them; and then they make no
          conscience of attending family prayer. Otherwise they may continue to
          attend upon prayer as long as they live, and yet may truly be said not
          to call upon God. For such prayer, in the manner of it, is not their
          own. They are present only for the sake of their credit, or in
          compliance with others. They may be present at these prayers, and yet
          have no proper prayer of their own. Many of those concerning whom it
          maybe said, as in Job 15:. 4, That they cast off fear and restrain
          prayer before God, are yet frequently present at family and public
          prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But they in a great measure leave off the practice of secret
          prayer. They come to this pass by degrees. At first they begin to be
          careless about it, under some particular temptations. Because they
          have been out in young company, or have been taken up very much with
          worldly business, they omit it once: After that they more easily omit
          it again. Thus it presently becomes a frequent thing with them to omit
          it and after a while, it comes to that pass, that they seldom attend
          it. Perhaps they attend it on Sabbath days, and sometimes on other
          days. But they have ceased to make it a constant practice daily to
          retire to worship God alone, and to seek his face in secret places.
          They sometimes do a little to quiet conscience, and just to keep alive
          their old hope; because it would be shocking to them, even after all
          their subtle dealing with their consciences to call themselves
          converts, and yet totally to live without prayer. Yet the practice of
          secret prayer they have in a great measure left off.
        </p>
        <p>I come now,</p>
        <p>III. To the reasons why this is the manner of hypocrites.</p>
        <p>
          1. Hypocrites never had the spirit of prayer given them. They may have
          been stirred up to the external performance of this duty, and that
          with a great deal of earnestness and affection, and yet always have
          been destitute of the true spirit of prayer. The spirit of prayer is
          an holy spirit, a gracious spirit. We read of the spirit of grace and
          supplication, Zech. iii. 10. I will pour out on the house of David and
          the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and supplications.
          Wherever there is a true spirit of supplication, there is the spirit
          of grace. The true spirit of prayer is no other than God’s own Spirit
          dwelling in the hearts of the saints. And as this spirit comes from
          God, so doth it naturally tend to God in holy breathings and pantings.
          It naturally leads to God, to converse with him by prayer. Therefore
          the Spirit is said to make intercession for the saints with groanings
          which cannot be uttered, Rom. 8:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is far otherwise with the true convert. His work is not done;
          but he finds still a great work to do, and great wants to be supplied.
          He sees himself still to be a poor, empty, helpless creature, and that
          he still stands in great and continual need of God’s help. He is
          sensible that without God he can do nothing. A false conversion makes
          a man in his own eyes self-sufficient. He saith he is rich, and
          increased with goods, and hath need of nothing; and knoweth not that
          be is wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. But
          after a true conversion, the soul remains sensible of its own
          impotence and emptiness, as it is in itself, and its sense of it is
          rather increased than diminished. It is still sensible of its
          universal dependence on God for every thing. A true convert is
          sensible that his grace is very imperfect; and he is very far from
          having all that he desires. Instead of that, by conversion are
          begotten in him new desires which he never had before. He now finds in
          him holy appetites, an hungering and thirsting after righteousness, a
          longing after more acquaintance and communion with God. So that he
          hath business enough still at the throne of grace; yea, his business
          there, instead of being diminished, is, since his conversion, rather
          increased.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The hope which the hypocrite hath of his good estate takes off the
          force that the command of God before had upon his conscience; so that
          now he dares neglect so plain a duty. The command which requires the
          practice of the duty of prayer is exceeding plain; Matt. 26:41. “Watch
          and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.” Eph. 6:18. “Praying
          always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching
          thereunto with all perseverance, and supplication for all saints.”
          Matt. vi. 6. “When thou prayest enter into thy closet, and when thou
          hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret.” As long as
          the hypocrite was in his own apprehension in continual danger of hell,
          he durst not disobey these commands. But since he is, as he thinks,
          safe from hell, he is grown bold, he dares to live in the neglect of
          the plainest command in the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is the manner of hypocrites, after a while, to return to sinful
          practices, which will tend to keep them from praying. While they were
          under convictions, they reformed their lives, and walked very exactly.
          This reformation continues for a little time perhaps after their
          supposed conversion, while they are much affected with hope and false
          comfort. But as these things die away, their old lusts revive, and
          they by degrees return like the dog to his vomit, and the sow that was
          washed to her wallowing in the mire. They return to their sensual
          practices, to their worldly practices, to their proud and contentious
          practices, as before. And no wonder this makes them forsake their
          closets. Sinning and praying agree not well together. If a man be
          constant in the duty of secret prayer, it will tend to restrain him
          from willful sinning. So, on the other hand, if he allow himself in
          sinful practices, it will restrain him from praying. It will give
          quite another turn to his mind, so that he will have no disposition to
          the practice of such a duty It will be contrary to him. A man who
          knows that he lives in sin against God, will not be inclined to come
          daily into the presence of God; but will rather be inclined to fly
          from his presence, as Adam, when he had eaten of the forbidden fruit,
          ran away from God, and hid himself among the trees of the garden.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep up the duty of prayer after he hath given loose to his lusts,
          would tend very much to disquiet a man’s conscience. It would give
          advantage to his conscience to testify aloud against him. If he should
          come from his wickedness into the presence of God, immediately to
          speak to him, his conscience would, as it were; fly in his face.
          Therefore hypocrites, as they by degrees admit their wicked practices,
          exclude prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Hypocrites never counted the cost of perseverance in seeking God,
          and of following him to the end of life. To continue instant in prayer
          with all perseverance to the end of life, requires much care,
          watchfulness, and labor. For much opposition is made to it by the
          flesh, the world, and the devil and Christians meet with many
          temptations to forsake this practice. He that would persevere in this
          duty must be laborious in religion in general. But hypocrites never
          count the cost of such labor; i. e. they never were prepared in the
          disposition of their minds to give their lives to the service of God,
          and to the duties of religion. It is therefore no great wonder if they
          are weary and give out, after they have continued for a while, as
          their affections are gone, and they find that prayer to them grows
          irksome and tedious.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Hypocrites have no interest in those gracious promises which God
          hath made to his people, of those spiritual supplies which are needful
          in order to uphold them in the way of their duty to the end. God hath
          promised to true saints that they shall not forsake him; Jer. 32:40. I
          will put my fear into their hearts, that they shall not depart from
          me. He hath promised that he will keep them in the way of their duty;
          1 Thess. 5:23, 24. And the God of peace sanctify you wholly. And I
          pray God your spirit, soul, and body, be preserved blameless unto the
          coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who
          also will do it. But hypocrites have no interest in these and such
          like promises and therefore are liable to fall away. If God do not
          uphold men, there is no dependence on their steadfastness. If the
          Spirit of God depart from them, they will soon become careless and
          profane, and there will be an end to their seeming devotion and piety.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>May be in an use of EXHORTATION in two branches.</p>
        <p>
          I. I would exhort those who have entertained an hope of their being
          true converts, and yet since their supposed conversion have left off
          the duty of secret prayer, and do ordinarily allow themselves in the
          omission of it, to throw away their hope. If you have left off calling
          upon God, it is time for you to leave off hoping and flattering
          yourselves with an imagination that you are the children of God.
          Probably it will be a very difficult thing for you to do this. It is
          hard for a man to let go an hope of heaven, on which he hath once
          allowed himself to lay hold, and which he hath retained for a
          considerable time. True conversion is a rare thing; but that men are
          brought off from a false hope of conversion, after they are once
          settled and established in it, and have continued in it for some time,
          is much more rare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those things in men, which, if they were known to others, would be
          sufficient to convince others that they are hypocrites, will not
          convince themselves; and those things which would be sufficient to
          convince them concerning others, and to cause them to cast others
          entirely out of their charity, will not be sufficient to convince them
          concerning themselves. They can make larger allowances for themselves
          than they can for others. They can find out ways to solve objections
          against their own hope, when they can find none in the like case for
          their neighbor.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it your case be such as is spoken of in the doctrine, it is surely
          time for you to seek a better hope, and another work of God’s Spirit,
          than ever you have yet experienced; something more thorough and
          effectual. When you see and find by experience, that the seed which
          was sown in your hearts, though at first it sprang up and seemed
          flourishing, yet is withering away, as by the heat of the sun, or is
          choked, as with thorns; this shows in what sort of ground the seed was
          sown, that it is either stony or thorny ground; and that therefore it
          is necessary you should pass through another change, whereby your
          heart may become good ground, which shall bring forth fruit with
          patience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I insist not on that as a reason why you should not throw away your
          hope, that you had the judgment of others, that the change of which
          you were the subject was right. It is a small matter to be judged of
          man’s judgment, whether you be approved or condemned, and whether it
          be by minister or people, wise or unwise. I Cor. 4:3. ” It is a very
          small thing that I should be judged of you or of man’s judgment.” If
          your goodness have proved to be as the morning cloud and early dew if
          you be one of those who have forsaken God, and left off calling upon
          his name, you have the judgment of God, and the sentence of God in the
          Scriptures against you, which is a thousand times more than to have
          the judgment of all the wise and godly men and ministers in the world
          in your favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others, from your account of things, may have been obliged to have
          charity for you, and to think that, provided you were not mistaken,
          and in your account did not misrepresent things, or express them by
          wrong terms, you were really converted. But what a miserable
          foundation is this, upon which to build an hope as to your eternal
          state!
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I request your attention to a few things in particular, which I
          have to say to you concerning your hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Why will you retain that hope which by evident experience you find
          poisons you? Is it reasonable to think, that an holy hope, an hope
          that is from heaven, would have such an influence? No surely; nothing
          of such a malignant influence comes from that world of purity and
          glory. No poison groweth in the paradise of God. The same hope which
          leads men to sin in this world will lead to hell hereafter. Why
          therefore will you retain such an hope, of which your own experience
          shows you the ill tendency, in that it encourages you to lead a wicked
          life? For certainly that life is a wicked life wherein you live in the
          neglect of so well known a duty as that of secret prayer, and in the
          disobedience of so plain a command of God, as that by which this duty
          is enjoined. And is not a way of disobedience to God a way to hell?
        </p>
        <p>
          If your own experience of the nature and tendency of your hope will
          not convince you of the falseness of it, what will? Are you resolved
          to retain your hope, let it prove ever so unsound and hurtful? Will
          you hold it fast till you go to hell with it? Many men cling to a
          false hope, and embrace it so closely, that they never let it go till
          the flames of hell cause their arms to unclench and let go their hold.
          Consider how you will answer it at the day of judgment when God shall
          call you to an account for your folly in resting in such an hope. Will
          it be a sufficient answer for you to say, that you had the charity of
          others, and that they thought your conversion was right?
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly it is foolish for men to imagine, that God had no more
          wisdom, or could contrive no other way of bestowing comfort and hope
          of eternal life than one which should encourage men to forsake him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How is your doing, as you do, consistent with loving God above all?
          If you have not spirit to love God above your dearest earthly friends,
          and your most pleasant earthly enjoyments; the scriptures are very
          plain, and full in it, that you are not true Christians. But if you
          had indeed such a spirit, would you thus grow weary of the practice of
          drawing near to him, and become habitually so averse to it, as in a
          great measure to cast off so plain a duty which is so much the life of
          a child of God? It is the nature of love to be averse to absence, and
          to love a near access to those whom we love. We love to be with them;
          we delight to come often to them, and to have much conversation with
          them. But when a person who hath heretofore been wont to converse
          freely with another, by degrees forsakes him, grows strange, and
          converses with him but little, and that although the other be
          importunate with him for the continuance of their former intimacy;
          this plainly shows the coldness of his heart towards him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The neglect of the duty of prayer seems to be inconsistent with
          supreme love to Go also upon another account, and that is, that it is
          against the will of God so plainly revealed. True love to God seeks to
          please God in every thing, and universally to conform to his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          3 Your thus restraining prayer before God is not only inconsistent
          with the love, but also with the fear of God it is an argument that
          you cast off fear, as is manifest by that text, Job. 15:4. “Yea, thou
          castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.” While you thus
          live in the transgression of so plain a command of God, you evidently
          show, that there is no fear of God before your eyes. Psal. 36:1. “The
          transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no
          fear of God before his eyes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Consider how living in such a neglect is inconsistent with leading
          an holy life. We are abundantly instructed in scripture, that true
          Christians do lead an holy life; that without holiness no man shall
          see the Lord, Heb. 12:14; and that every one that hath this hope in
          him, purifieth himself, even as Christ is pure, 1 John 3:3. In Prov.
          16:17, it is said, The highway of the upright is to depart from evil,
          i.e. it is, as it were, the common beaten road in which all the godly
          travel. To the like purpose is Isa. 35:8. A highway shall be there,
          and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness; the unclean
          shall not pass over it, but it shall be for those, i. e. those
          redeemed persons spoken of in the foregoing verses. It is spoken of in
          Rom. viii. 1, as the character of all believers, that they walk not
          after the flesh, but after the spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how is a life, in a great measure prayerless, consistent with an
          holy life? To lead an holy life is to lead a life devoted to God; a
          life of worshipping and serving God; a life consecrated to the service
          of God. But how doth he lead such a life who doth not so much as
          maintain the duty of prayer? How can such a man be said to walk by the
          Spirit and to be a servant of the Most High God? An holy life is a
          life of faith. The life that true Christians live in the world they
          live by the faith of the Son of God. But who can believe that man
          lives by faith who lives without prayer, which, is the natural
          expression of faith? Prayer is as natural an expression of faith as
          breathing is of life; and to say a man lives a life of faith, and yet
          lives a prayerless life, is every whit as inconsistent and incredible,
          as to say, that a man lives without breathing. A prayerless life is so
          far from being an holy life, that it is a profane life. He that lives
          so, lives like an heathen, who calleth not on God’s name; he that
          lives a prayerless life, lives without God in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. If you live in the neglect of secret prayer, you show your good
          will to neglect all the worship of God. He that prays only when he
          prays with others, would not pray at all, were it not that the eyes of
          others are upon him. He that will not pray where none but God seeth
          him, manifestly doth not pray at all out of respect to God, or regard
          to his all-seeing eye, and therefore doth in effect cast off all
          prayer. And he that casts off prayer, in effect casts off all the
          worship of God, of which prayer is the principal duty. Now, what a
          miserable saint is he who is no worshipper of God! He that casts off
          the worship of God, in effect casts off God himself: He refuses to own
          him, or to be conversant with him as his God. For the way in which men
          own God, and are conversant with him as their God, is by worshipping
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. How can you expect to dwell with God for ever, if you so neglect
          and forsake him here? This your practice shows, that you place not
          your happiness in God, in nearness to him, and communion with him. He
          Who refuses to come and visit, and converse with a friend, and who in
          a great measure forsakes him, when he is abundantly invited and
          importuned to come; plainly shows that he places not his happiness in,
          the company and conversation of that friend. Now, if this be the case
          with you respecting God, then how can you expect to have it for your
          happiness to all eternity, to be with God, and to enjoy holy communion
          with him?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let those persons who hope they are converted, and yet have in a great
          measure left off the duty of secret prayer, and whose manner it is
          ordinarily to neglect it, for their own sake seriously consider these
          things. For what will profit then to please themselves with that,
          while they live, which will fail them at last, and leave them in
          fearful and amazing disappointment?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is probable, that some of you who have entertained a good, opinion
          of your state, and have looked upon yourselves as converts; but have
          of late in a great measure left off the duty of secret prayer; will
          this evening attend secret prayer, and so continue to do for a little
          while; after your hearing this sermon, to the end, that you may solve
          the difficulty, and the objection which is made against the truth of
          your hope. But this will not hold. As it hath been in former instances
          of the like nature, so what you now hear will have such effect upon
          you but a little while. When the business and cares of the world shall
          again begin to crowd a little upon you, or next time you shall go out
          into young company, it is probable you will again neglect this duty.
          The next time a frolic shall be appointed, to which it is proposed to
          you to go, it is highly probable you will neglect not only secret
          prayer; but also family prayer. Or at least, after a while, you will
          come to the same pass again, as before, in casting off fear and
          restraining prayer before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not very likely that you will ever be constant and persevering
          in this duty, until you shall have obtained a better principle in your
          hearts. The streams which have no springs to feed them will dry up.
          The drought and heat consume the snow waters. Although they run
          plentifully in the spring, yet when the sun ascends higher with a
          burning heat they are gone. The seed that is sown in stony places,
          though it seem to flourish at present, yet as the sun shall rise with
          a burning heat, will wither away. None will bring forth fruit with
          patience, but those whose hearts are become good ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without any heavenly seed remaining in them, men may whenever they
          fall in among the godly, continue all their lives to talk like saints.
          They may, for their credit’s sake, tell of what they have experienced
          But their deeds will not hold. They may continue to tell of their
          inward experiences, and yet live in the neglect of secret prayer, and
          of other duties.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I would take occasion from this doctrine to exhort all to
          persevere in the duty of prayer. This exhortation is much insisted on
          in the word of God. It is insisted on in the Old Testament; I Chron.
          xvi. II. “Seek the Lord and his strength, seek his face
          continually.”…Isai. 62:7. “Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not
          silence;” i. e. be not silent as to the voice of prayer, as is
          manifest by the following words, “and give him no rest till he
          establish and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth,” Israel of
          old is reproved for growing weary of the duty of prayer. Isai. 43:22.
          “But thou hast not called upon me, 0 Jacob, thou hast been weary of
          me, 0 Israel.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Perseverance in the duty of prayer is very much insisted on in the New
          Testament; as Luke xviii. at the beginning, “A man ought always to
          pray, and not to faint;” i. e. not to be discouraged or weary of the
          duty; but should always continue in it. Again, Luke xxi. 36. “Watch ye
          therefore, and pray always.” We have the example of Anna the
          prophetess set before us, Luke i. 36, &amp;c. who, though she had
          lived to be more than an hundred years old, yet never was weary of
          this duty. It is said, “She departed not from the temple, but served
          God, with fastings and prayers, night and day.” Cornelius also is
          commended for his constancy in this duty. It is said, that he prayed
          to God always; Acts 10:2. The Apostle Paul, in his epistles, insists
          very much on constancy in this duty; Rom. 12:12. “Continuing instant
          in prayer.” Eph. 6:18,19. “Praying always with all prayer and
          supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all
          perseverance.” Col. 4:2. “Continue in prayer, and watch in the same.”
          I Thess. 5:17. “Pray without ceasing.” To the same effect the Apostle
          Peter, 1 Pet. 4:7. “Watch unto prayer.”….Thus abundantly the scripture
          insists upon it, that we should persevere in the duty of prayer; which
          shows that, it is of very great importance that we should persevere.
          If the contrary be the manner of hypocrites, as hath been shown in the
          doctrine, then surely we ought to beware of this leaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here let the following things be particularly considered as
          motives to perseverance in this duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That perseverance in the way of duty is necessary to salvation, and
          is abundantly declared so to be in the holy scriptures; as Isai. 64:5.
          “Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that
          remember thee in thy ways: Behold, thou art wroth, for we have sinned:
          In those is continuance, and we shall be saved.” Heb. 10:38, 39. “Now
          the just shall live by faith: But if any man draw back, my soul hath
          no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto
          perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.” Rom.
          xi. 22. “Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: On them
          which fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness, if thou continue in
          his goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off….So in many other
          places.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many, when they think they are converted, seem to imagine that their
          work is done, and that there is nothing else needful in order to their
          going to heaven. Indeed perseverance in holiness of life is not
          necessary to salvation, as the righteousness by which a right to
          salvation is obtained. Nor is actual perseverance necessary in order
          to our becoming interested in that righteousness by which we are
          justified. For as soon as ever a soul hath believed in Christ, or hath
          put forth one act of faith in him, it becomes interested in his
          righteousness, and in all the promises purchased by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But persevering in the way of duty is necessary to salvation, as a
          concomitant and evidence of a title to salvation. There is never a
          title to salvation without it, though it be not the righteousness by
          which a title to salvation is obtained. It is necessary to salvation,
          as it is the necessary consequence of true faith. It is an evidence
          which universally attends uprightness, and the defect of it is an
          infallible evidence of the want of uprightness. Psal. 125:4, 5. There
          such as are good and upright in heart, are distinguished from such as
          fall away or turn aside: “Do good, O Lord, to those that are good, and
          to them that are upright in their hearts. As for such as turn aside to
          their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of
          iniquity. But peace shall be upon Israel.” It is mentioned as an
          evidence that the hearts of the children of Israel were not right with
          God, that they did not persevere in the ways of holiness. Psal. 78:8.
          “A generation that set not their hearts aright, and whose spirit was
          not steadfast with God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ gives this as a distinguishing character of those that are his
          disciples indeed, and of a true and saving faith, that it is
          accompanied with perseverance in the obedience of Christ’s word. John
          8:31. “Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, if ye
          continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed.” This is
          mentioned as a necessary evidence of an interest in Christ, Heb. iii.
          14. “We are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our
          confidence steadfast to the end.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Perseverance is not only a necessary concomitant and evidence of a
          title to salvation; but also a necessary prerequisite to the actual
          possession of eternal life. It is the only way to heaven, the narrow
          way that leadeth to life. Hence Christ exhorts the church of
          Philadelphia to persevere in holiness from this consideration, that it
          was necessary in order to her obtaining the crown. Rev. 3:11. “Hold
          fast that which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.” It is
          necessary, not only that persons should once have been walking in the
          way of duty, but that they should be found so doing when Christ
          cometh. Luke 9:43. “Blessed is that servant whom his lord, when he
          cometh, shall find so doing.” Holding out to the end is often made the
          condition of actual salvation. Mat. 10:22. “He that endureth to the
          end, the same shall be saved:” And Rev. 2:10. “Be thou faithful unto
          death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In order to your own perseverance in the way of duty, your own care
          and watchfulness is necessary. For though it be promised that true
          saints shall persevere, yet that is no argument that their care and
          watchfulness is not necessary in order to it; because their care to
          keep the commands of God is the thing promised. If the saints should
          fail of care, watchfulness, and diligence to persevere in holiness,
          that failure of their care and diligence would itself be a failure of
          holiness. They who persevere not in watchfulness and diligence,
          persevere not in holiness of life, for holiness of life very much
          consists in watchfulness and diligence to keep the commands of God. It
          is one promise of the covenant of grace, that the Saints shall keep
          God’s commandments. Ezek. 11:19, 20. Yet that is no argument that they
          have no need to take care to keep these commandments, or to do their
          duty. So the promise of God, that the saints shall persevere in
          holiness, is no argument that it is not necessary that they should
          take heed lest they fall away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the scriptures abundantly warn men to watch over themselves
          diligently, and to give earnest heed lest they fall away. 1 Cor.
          15:13. “Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be
          strong.” 1 Cor. 10:12. “Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed
          lest he fall.” Heb. 3:12, 13, 14. “Take heed, brethren, lest there be
          in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living
          God; but exhort one another daily, while it is called today, lest any
          of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we are made
          partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence
          steadfast unto the end.” Heb. 4:1. “Let us therefore fear, lest a
          promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should
          seem to come short of it.” 2 Peter 3:17. “Ye therefore, beloved,
          seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led
          away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.”
          2 John 5:8. “Look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we
          have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus you see how earnestly the scriptures press on Christians
          exhortations to take diligent heed to themselves that they fall not
          away. And certainly these cautions are not without reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scriptures particularly insist upon watchfulness in order to
          perseverance in the duty of prayer. Watch and pray, saith Christ;
          which implies that we should watch unto prayer, as the Apostle Peter
          says, 1 Pet. 4:7. It implies, that we should watch against a neglect
          of prayer, as well as against other sins. The apostle, in places which
          have been already mentioned, directs us to pray with all prayer,
          watching there unto with all perseverance, and to continue in prayer,
          and watch in the same. Nor is it any wonder that the apostles so much
          insisted on watching, in order to a continuance in prayer with all
          perseverance; for there are many temptations to neglect this duty;
          first to be inconstant in it, and from time to time to omit it; then
          in a great measure to neglect it. The devil watches to draw us away
          from God, and to hinder us from going to him in prayer. We are
          surrounded with one and another tempting object, business, and
          diversion: Particularly we meet with many things which are great
          temptations to a neglect of this duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. To move you to persevere in the duty of prayer, consider how much
          you always stand in need of the help of God. If persons who have
          formerly attended this duty, leave it off, the language of it is, that
          now they stand in no further need of God’s help, that they have no
          further occasion to go to God with requests and supplications: When
          indeed it is in God we live, and move, and have our being. We cannot
          draw a breath without his help. You need his help every day, for the
          supply of your outward wants; and especially you stand in continual
          need of him to help your souls. Without his protection they would
          immediately fall into the hands of the devil, who always stands as a
          roaring lion, ready, whenever he is permitted, to fall upon the souls
          of men and devour them. If God should indeed preserve your lives, but
          should otherwise forsake and leave you to yourselves, you would be
          most miserable: Your lives would be a curse to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those that are converted, if God should forsake them, would soon fall
          away totally from a state of grace into a state more miserable than
          ever they were in before their conversion. They have no strength of
          their own to resist those powerful enemies who surround them. Sin and
          Satan would immediately carry them away, as a mighty flood, if God
          should forsake them. You stand in need of daily supplies from God.
          Without God you can receive no spiritual light nor comfort, can
          exercise no grace, can bring forth no fruit. Without God your souls
          will wither and pine away, and sink into a most wretched state. You
          continually need the instructions and directions of God. What can a
          little child do, in a vast howling wilderness, without some one to
          guide it, and to lead it in the right way? Without God you will soon
          fall into snares, and pits, and many fatal calamities.<br />
          Seeing therefore you stand in such continual need of the help of God,
          how reasonable is it that you should continually seek it of him, and
          perseveringly acknowledge your dependence upon him, by resorting to
          him, to spread your needs before him, and to offer up your requests to
          him in prayer. Let us consider how miserable we should be, if we
          should leave off prayer, and God at the same time should leave off to
          take any care of us, or to afford us any more supplies of his grace.
          By our constancy in prayer, we cannot be profitable to God; and if we
          leave it off, God will sustain no damage: He doth not need our
          prayers; Job 10:6, 7. But if God cease to care for us and to help us,
          we immediately sink: We can do nothing: We can receive nothing without
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Consider the great benefit of a constant, diligent, and persevering
          attendance on this duty. It is one of the greatest and most excellent
          means of nourishing the new nature, and of causing the soul to
          flourish and prosper. It is an excellent mean of keeping up an
          acquaintance with God, and of growing in the knowledge of God. It is
          the way to a life of communion with God. It is an excellent mean of
          taking off the heart from the vanities of the world and of causing the
          mind to be conversant in heaven. It is an excellent preservative from
          sin and the wiles of the devil, and a powerful antidote against the
          poison of the old serpent. It is a duty whereby strength is derived
          from God against the lusts and corruptions of the heart, and the
          snares of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It hath a great tendency to keep the soul in a wakeful frame, and to
          lead us to a strict walk with God, and to a life that shall be
          fruitful in such good works, as tend to adorn the doctrine of Christ,
          and to cause our light so to shine before others, that they, seeing
          our good works, shall glorify our Father who is in heaven And if the
          duty be constantly and diligently attended, it will be a very pleasant
          duty. Slack and slothful attendance upon it, and unsteadiness in it,
          are the causes which make it so great a burden as it is to some
          persons. Their slothfulness in it hath naturally the effect to beget a
          dislike of the duty and a great indisposition to it. But if it be
          constantly and diligently attended, it is one of the best means of
          leading not only a Christian and amiable, but also a pleasant life; a
          life of much sweet fellowship with Christ, and of the abundant
          enjoyment of the light of his countenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, the great power which prayer, when duly attended, hath with
          God, is worthy of your notice. By it men become like Jacob, who, as a
          prince, had power with God, and prevailed, when he wrestled with God
          for the blessing. See the power of prayer represented in James
          5:16,18. By these things you may be sensible how much you will lose,
          if you shall be negligent of this great duty of calling upon God; and
          how ill you will consult your own interest by such a neglect.<br />
          I conclude my discourse with two directions in order to constancy and
          perseverance in this duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Watch against the beginnings of a neglect of this duty. Persons who
          have for a time practiced this duty, and afterwards neglect it,
          commonly leave it off by degrees. While their convictions and
          religious affections last, they are very constant in their closets,
          and no worldly business, or company, or diversion hinders them. But as
          their convictions and affections begin to die away, they begin to find
          excuses to neglect it sometimes. They are now so hurried; they have
          now such and such things to attend to; or there are now such
          inconveniences in the way, that they persuade themselves they may very
          excusably omit it for this time. Afterwards it pretty frequently so
          happens, that they have something to hinder, something which they call
          a just excuse. After a while, a less thing becomes a sufficient excuse
          than was allowed to be such at first. Thus the person by degrees
          contracts more and more of an habit of neglecting prayer, and becomes
          more and more indisposed to it. And even when he doth perform it, it
          is in such a poor, dull, heartless, miserable manner, that he says to
          himself, he might as well not do it at all, as do it so. Thus he makes
          his own dullness and indisposition an excuse for wholly neglecting it,
          or at least for living in a great measure in the neglect of it. After
          this manner do Satan and men’s own corruptions inveigle them to their
          ruin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore beware of the first beginnings of a neglect: Watch against
          temptations to it: Take heed how you begin to allow of excuses. Be
          watchful to keep up the duty in the height of it; let it not so much
          as begin to sink. For when you give way, though it be but little, it
          is like giving way to an enemy in the field of battle; the first
          beginning of a retreat greatly encourages the enemy, and weakens the
          retreating soldiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Let me direct you to forsake all such practices as you find by
          experience do indispose you to the duty of secret prayer. Examine the
          things in which you have allowed yourselves, and inquire whether they
          have had this effect. You are able to look over your past behavior,
          and may doubtless, on an impartial consideration, make a judgment of
          the practices and courses in which you have allowed yourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particularly let young people examine their manner of company keeping,
          and the round of diversions in which, with their companions, they have
          allowed themselves. I only desire that you would ask at the mouth of
          your own consciences what has been the effect of these things with
          respect to your attendance on the duty of secret prayer. Have you not
          found that such practices have tended to the neglect of this duty?
          Have you not found that after them you have been more indisposed to
          it, and less conscientious and careful to attend it? Yea have they not
          from, time to time, actually been the means of your neglecting it?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you cannot deny that this is really the case, then, if you seek the
          good of your souls, forsake these practices. Whatever you may plead
          for them, as that there is no hurt in them, or that there is a time
          for all things, and the like; yet if you find this hurt in the
          consequence of them, it is time for you to forsake them. And if you
          value heaven more than a little worldly diversion; if you set an
          higher price on eternal glory than on a dance or a song, you will
          forsake them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If these things be lawful in themselves, yet if your experience show,
          that they are attended with such a consequence as I have now
          mentioned, that is enough. It is lawful in itself for you to enjoy
          your right hand and your right eye: But if, by experience, you find
          they cause you to offend, it is time for you to cut off the one, and
          pluck out the other, as you would rather go to heaven without them
          than go to hell with them, into that place of torment where the worm
          dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
