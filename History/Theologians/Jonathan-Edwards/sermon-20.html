        <h2>God Glorified in Man’s Dependence – 1 Corinthians 1:29-31</h2>
        <p class="title">
          1 Corinthians 1:29, 30, 31, “That no flesh should glory in his
          presence. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto
          us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
          that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in
          the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THOSE Christians to whom the apostle directed this epistle, dwelt in a
          part of the world where human wisdom was in great repute; as the
          apostle observes in the 22nd verse of this chapter, “The Greeks seek
          after wisdom.” Corinth was not far from Athens, that had been for many
          ages the most famous seat of philosophy and learning in the world. The
          apostle therefore observes to them, how God by the gospel destroyed,
          and brought to nought, their wisdom. The learned Grecians, and their
          great philosophers, by all their wisdom did not know God, they were
          not able to find out the truth in divine things. But, after they had
          done their utmost to no effect, it pleased God at length to reveal
          himself by the gospel, which they accounted foolishness. He ” chose
          the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak
          things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and the
          base things of the world, and things that are despised, yea, and
          things which are not, to bring to nought the things that are.” And the
          apostle informs them in the text why he thus did, That no flesh should
          glory in his presence, etc.-In which words may be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. What God aims at in the disposition of things in the affair of
          redemption, viz. that man should not glory in himself, but alone in
          God; That no flesh should glory in his presence,-that, according as it
          is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How this end is attained in the work of redemption, viz. by that
          absolute and immediate dependence which men have upon God in that
          work, for all their good. Inasmuch as,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, All the good that they have is in and through Christ; He is
          made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
          All the good of the fallen and redeemed creature is concerned in these
          four things, and cannot be better distributed than into them; but
          Christ is each of them to us, and we have none of them any otherwise
          than in him. He is made of God unto us wisdom: in him are all the
          proper good and true excellency of the understanding. Wisdom was a
          thing that the Greeks admired; but Christ is the true light of the
          world; it is through him alone that true wisdom is imparted to the
          mind. It is in and by Christ that we have righteousness: it is by
          being in him that we are justified, have our sins pardoned, and are
          received as righteous into God’s favour. It is by Christ that we have
          sanctification: we have in him true excellency of heart as well as of
          understanding; and he is made unto us inherent as well as imputed
          righteousness. It is by Christ that we have redemption or the actual
          deliverance from all misery, and the bestowment of all happiness and
          glory. Thus we have all our good by Christ, who is God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Another instance wherein our dependence on God for all our
          good appears, is this, That it is God that has given us Christ, that
          we might have these benefits through him; he of God is made unto us
          wisdom, righteousness, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, It is of him that we are in Christ Jesus, and come to have an
          interest in him, and so do receive those blessings which he is made
          unto us. It is God that gives us faith whereby we close with Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that in this verse is shown our dependence on each person in the
          Trinity for all our good. We are dependent on Christ the Son of God,
          as he is our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We
          are dependent on the Father, who has given us Christ, and made him to
          be these things to us. We are dependent on the Holy Ghost, for it is
          of him that we are in Christ Jesus; it is the Spirit of God that gives
          faith in him, whereby we receive him, and close with him.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          God is glorified in the work of redemption in this, that there appears
          in it so absolute and universal a dependence of the redeemed on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I propose to show, 1st That there is an absolute and universal
          dependence of the redeemed on God for all their good. And, 2ndly, That
          God hereby is exalted and glorified in the work of redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. There is an absolute and universal dependence of the redeemed on
          God. The nature and contrivance of our redemption is such, that the
          redeemed are in every thing directly, immediately, and entirely
          dependent on God: they are dependent on him for all, and are dependent
          on him every way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The several ways wherein the dependence of one being may be upon
          another for its good, and wherein the redeemed of Jesus Christ depend
          on God for all their good, are these, viz. That they have all their
          good of him, and that they have all through him, and that they have
          all in him: That he is the cause and original whence all their good
          comes, therein it is of him; and that he is the medium by which it is
          obtained and conveyed, therein they have it through him; and that he
          is the good itself given and conveyed, therein it is in him. Now those
          that are redeemed by Jesus Christ do, in all these respects, very
          directly and entirely depend on God for their all.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, The redeemed have all their good of God. God is the great
          author of it. He is the first cause of it; and not only so, but he is
          the only proper cause. It is of God that we have our Redeemer. It is
          God that has provided a Saviour for us. Jesus Christ is not only of
          God in his person, as he is the only­begotten Son of God, but he is
          from God, as we are concerned in him, and in his office of Mediator.
          He is the gift of God to us: God chose and anointed him, appointed him
          his work, and sent him into the world. And as it is God that gives, so
          it is God that accepts the Saviour. He gives the purchaser, and he
          affords the thing purchased.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is of God that Christ becomes ours, that we are brought to him, and
          are united to him. It is of God that we receive faith to close with
          him, that we may have an interest in him. Eph. ii. 8. ” For by grace
          ye are saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the
          gift of God.” It is of God that we actually receive all the benefits
          that Christ has purchased. It is God that pardons and justifies, and
          delivers from going down to hell; and into his favour the redeemed are
          received, when they are justified. So it is God that delivers from the
          dominion of sin, cleanses us from our filthiness, and changes us from
          our deformity. It is of God that the redeemed receive all their true
          excellency wisdom, and holiness; and that two ways, viz. as the Holy
          Ghost by whom these things are immediately wrought is from God,
          proceeds from him, and is sent by him; and also as the Holy Ghost
          himself is God, by whose operation and indwelling the knowledge of God
          and divine things, a holy disposition and all grace, are conferred and
          upheld. And though means are made use of in conferring grace on men’s
          souls, yet it is of God that we have these means of grace, and it is
          he that makes them effectual. It is of God that we have the Holy
          Scriptures; they are his word. It is of God that we have ordinances,
          and their efficacy depends on the immediate influence of his Spirit.
          The ministers of the gospel are sent of God, and all their sufficiency
          is of him. 2 Cor. iv. 7. ” We have this treasure in earthen vessels,
          that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.” Their
          success depends entirely and absolutely on the immediate blessing and
          influence of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The redeemed have all from the grace of God. It was of mere grace
          that God gave us his only­begotten Son. The grace is great in
          proportion to the excellency of what is given. The gift was infinitely
          precious, because it was of a person infinitely worthy, a person of
          infinite glory; and also because it was of a person infinitely near
          and dear to God. The grace is great in proportion to the benefit we
          have given us in him. The benefit is doubly infinite, in that in him
          we have deliverance from an infinite, because an eternal, misery, and
          do also receive eternal joy and glory. The grace in bestowing this
          gift is great in proportion to our unworthiness to whom it is given;
          instead of deserving such a gift, we merited infinitely ill of God’s
          hands. The grace is great according to the manner of giving, or in
          proportion to the humiliation and expense of the method and means by
          which a way is made for our having the gift. He gave him to dwell
          amongst us; he gave him to us incarnate, or in our nature; and in the
          like though sinless infirmities. He gave him to us in a low and
          afflicted state; and not only so, but as slain, that he might be a
          feast for our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grace of God in bestowing this gift is most free. It was what God
          was under no obligation to bestow. He might have rejected fallen man,
          as he did the fallen angels. It was what we never did any thing to
          merit; it was given while we were yet enemies, and before we had so
          much as repented. It was from the love of God who saw no excellency in
          us to attract it; and it was without expectation of ever being
          requited for it.-And it is from mere grace that the benefits of Christ
          are applied to such and such particular persons. Those that are called
          and sanctified are to attribute it alone to the good pleasure of God’s
          goodness, by which they are distinguished. He is sovereign, and hath
          mercy on whom he will have mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man hath now a greater dependence on the grace of God than he had
          before the fall. He depends on the free goodness of God for much more
          than he did then. Then he depended on God’s goodness for conferring
          the reward of perfect obedience; for God was not obliged to promise
          and bestow that reward. But now we are dependent on the grace of God
          for much more; we stand in need of grace, not only to bestow glory
          upon us, but to deliver us from hell and eternal wrath. Under the
          first covenant we depended on God’s goodness to give us the reward of
          righteousness; and so we do now; but we stand in need of God’s free
          and sovereign grace to give us that righteousness; to pardon our sin,
          and release us from the guilt and infinite demerit of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as we are dependent on the goodness of God for more now than under
          the first covenant, so we are dependent on a much greater, more free
          and wonderful goodness. We are now more dependent on God’s arbitrary
          and sovereign good pleasure. We were in our first estate dependent on
          God for holiness. We had our original righteousness from him; but then
          holiness was not bestowed in such a way of sovereign good pleasure as
          it is now. Man was created holy, for it became God to create holy all
          his reasonable creatures. It would have been a disparagement to the
          holiness of God’s nature, if he had made an intelligent creature
          unholy. But now when fallen man is made holy, it is from mere and
          arbitrary grace; God may for ever deny holiness to fallen creature if
          he pleases, without any disparagement to any of his perfections.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we are not only indeed more dependent on the grace of God, but our
          dependence is much more conspicuous, because our own insufficiency and
          helplessness in ourselves is much more apparent in our fallen and
          undone state, than it was before we were either sinful or miserable.
          We are more apparently dependent on God for holiness, because we are
          first sinful, and utterly polluted, and afterward holy. So the
          production of the effect is sensible, and its derivation from God more
          obvious. If man was ever holy and always was so, it would not be so
          apparent, that he had not holiness necessarily, as an inseparable
          qualification of human nature. So we are more apparently dependent on
          free grace for the favour of God, for we are first justly the objects
          of his displeasure, and afterwards are received into favour. We are
          more apparently dependent on God for happiness, being first miserable,
          and afterwards happy. It is more apparently free and without merit in
          us, because we are actually without any kind of excellency to merit,
          if there could be any such thing as merit in creature excellency. And
          we are not only without any true excellency, but are full of, and
          wholly defiled with, that which is infinitely odious. All our good is
          more apparently from God, because we are first naked and wholly
          without any good, and afterwards enriched with all good.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We receive all from the power of God. Man’s redemption is often
          spoken of as a work of wonderful power as well as grace. The great
          power of God appears in bringing a sinner from his low state, from the
          depths of sin and misery, to such an exalted state of holiness and
          happiness. Eph. i. 19. ” And what is the exceeding greatness of his
          power to us­ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty
          power.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We are dependent on God’s power through every step of our redemption.
          We are dependent on the power of God to convert us, and give faith in
          Jesus Christ, and the new nature. It is a work of creation: ” If any
          man be in Christ, he is a new creature,” 2 Cor. 5:17. “We are created
          in Christ Jesus,” Eph. 2:10. The fallen creature cannot attain to true
          holiness, but by being created again. Eph. 4:24. ” And that ye put on
          the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
          holiness.” It is a raising from the dead. Colos. 2:12, 13. “Wherein
          also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God,
          who hath raised him from the dead.” Yea, it is a more glorious work of
          power than mere creation, or raising a dead body to life, in that the
          effect attained is greater and more excellent. That holy and happy
          being, and spiritual life, which is produced in the work of
          conversion, is a far greater and more glorious effect, than mere being
          and life. And the state from whence the change is made-a death in sin,
          a total corruption of nature, and depth of misery-is far more remote
          from the state attained, than mere death or non­entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is by God’s power also that we are preserved in a state of grace. 1
          Peter 1:5. ” Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto
          salvation.” As grace is at first from God, so it is continually from
          him, and is maintained by him, as much as light in the atmosphere is
          all day long from the sun, as well as at first dawning, or
          sun­rising.-Men are dependent on the power of God for every exercise
          of grace, and for carrying on that work in the heart, for subduing sin
          and corruption, increasing holy principles, and enabling to bring
          forth fruit in good works. Man is dependent on divine power in
          bringing grace to its perfection, in making the soul completely
          amiable in Christ’s glorious likeness, and filling of it with a
          satisfying joy and blessedness; and for the raising of the body to
          life, and to such a perfect state, that it shall be suitable for a
          habitation and organ for a soul perfected and blessed. These are the
          most glorious effects of the power of God, that are seen in the series
          of God’s acts with respect to the creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man was dependent on the power of God in his first estate, but he is
          more dependent on his power now; he needs God’s power to do more
          things for him, and depends on a more wonderful exercise of his power.
          It was an effect of the power of God to make man holy at the first;
          but more remarkably so now, because there is a great deal of
          opposition and difficulty in the way. It is a more glorious effect of
          power to make that holy that was so depraved, and under the dominion
          of sin, than to confer holiness on that which before had nothing of
          the contrary. It is a more glorious work of power to rescue a soul out
          of the hands of the devil, and from the powers of darkness, and to
          bring it into a state of salvation, than to confer holiness where
          there was no prepossession or opposition. Luke 11:21,22. “When a
          strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace; but when
          a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh
          from him all his armour, wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.”
          So it is a more glorious work of power to uphold a soul in a state of
          grace and holiness, and to carry it on till it is brought to glory,
          when there is so much sin remaining in the heart resisting, and Satan
          with all his might opposing, than it would have been to have kept man
          from falling at first, when Satan had nothing in man.-Thus we have
          shown how the redeemed are dependent on God for all their good, as
          they have all of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, They are also dependent on God for all, as they have all
          through him. God is the medium of it, as well as the author and
          fountain of it. All we have, wisdom, the pardon of sin, deliverance
          from hell, acceptance into God’s favour, grace and holiness, true
          comfort and happiness, eternal life and glory, is from God by a
          Mediator; and this Mediator is God; which Mediator we have an absolute
          dependence upon, as he through whom we receive all. So that here is
          another way wherein we have our dependence on God for all good. God
          not only gives us the Mediator, and accepts his mediation, and of his
          power and grace bestows the things purchased by the Mediator; but he
          the Mediator is God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our blessings are what we have by purchase; and the purchase is made
          of God, the blessings are purchased of him, and God gives the
          purchaser; and not only so, but God is the purchaser. Yea God is both
          the purchaser and the price; for Christ, who is God, purchased these
          blessings for us, by offering up himself as the price of our
          salvation. He purchased eternal life by the sacrifice of himself. Heb.
          vii. 27. ” He offered up himself.” And ix. 26. ” He hath appeared to
          take away sin by the sacrifice of himself.” Indeed it was the human
          nature that was offered; but it was the same person with the divine,
          and therefore was an infinite price.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we thus have our good through God, we have a dependence on him in a
          respect that man in his first estate had not. Man was to have eternal
          life then through his own righteousness; so that he had partly a
          dependence upon what was in himself; for we have a dependence upon
          that through which we have our good, as well as that from which we
          have it; and though man’s
        </p>
        <p>
          righteousness that he then depended on was indeed from God, yet it was
          his own, it was inherent in himself; so that his dependence was not so
          immediately on God. But now the righteousness that we are dependent on
          is not in ourselves, but in God. We are saved through the
          righteousness of Christ: He is made unto us righteousness; and
          therefore is prophesied of, Jer. 23:. 6, under that name, ” the Lord
          our righteousness.” In that the righteousness we are justified by is
          the righteousness of Christ, it is the righteousness of God. 2 Cor. v.
          21. “That we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”-Thus in
          redemption we have not only all things of God, but by and through him,
          1 Cor. viii. 6. ” But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom
          are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are
          all things, and we by him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, The redeemed have all their good in God. We not only have it
          of him, and through him, but it consists in him; he is all our
          good.-The good of the redeemed is either objective or inherent. By
          their objective good, I mean that extrinsic object, in the possession
          and enjoyment of which they are happy. Their inherent good is that
          excellency or pleasure which is in the soul itself. With respect to
          both of which the redeemed have all their good in God, or which is the
          same thing, God himself is all their good.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The redeemed have all their objective good in God. God himself is
          the great good which they are brought to the possession and enjoyment
          of by redemption. He is the highest good, and the sum of all that good
          which Christ purchased. God is the inheritance of the saints; he is
          the portion of their souls. God is their wealth and treasure, their
          food, their life, their dwellingplace, their ornament and diadem, and
          their everlasting honour and glory. They have none in heaven but God;
          he is the great good which the redeemed are received to at death, and
          which they are to rise to at the end of the world. The Lord God is the
          light of the heavenly Jerusalem; and is the ” river of the water of
          life” that runs, and ” the tree of life that grows, in the midst of
          the paradise of God.” The glorious excellencies and beauty of God will
          be what will for ever entertain the minds of the saints, and the love
          of God will be their everlasting feast. The redeemed will indeed enjoy
          other things; they will enjoy the angels, and will enjoy one another;
          but that which they shall enjoy in the angels, or each other, or in
          any thing else whatsoever that will yield them delight and happiness,
          will be what shall be seen of God in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The redeemed have all their inherent good in God. Inherent good is
          twofold; it is either excellency or pleasure. These the redeemed not
          only derive from God, as caused by him, but have them in him. They
          have spiritual excellency and joy by a kind of participation of God.
          They are made excellent by a communication of God’s excellency. God
          puts his own beauty, i.e. his beautiful likeness, upon their souls.
          They are made partakers of the divine nature, or moral image of God, 2
          Pet. i. 4. They are holy by being made partakers of God’s holiness.
          Heb. 12:. 10. The saints are beautiful and blessed by a communication
          of God’s holiness and joy, as the moon and planets are bright by the
          sun’s light. The saint hath spiritual joy and pleasure by a kind of
          effusion of God on the soul. In these things the redeemed have
          communion with God; that is, they partake with him and of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The saints have both their spiritual excellency and blessedness by the
          gift of the Holy Ghost, and his dwelling in them. They are not only
          caused by the Holy Ghost, but are in him as their principle. The Holy
          Spirit becoming an inhabitant, is a vital principle in the soul. He,
          acting in, upon, and with the soul, becomes a fountain of true
          holiness and joy, as a spring is of water, by the exertion and
          diffusion of itself. John iv. 14. ” But whosoever drinketh of the
          water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I
          shall give him, shall be in him a well of water sprigging up into
          everlasting life.” Compared with chap. vii. 38, 39. ” He that
          believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall
          flow rivers of living water; but this spake he of the Spirit, which
          they that believe on him should receive.” The sum of what Christ has
          purchased for us, is that spring of water spoken of in the former of
          those places, and those rivers of living water spoken of in the
          latter. And the sum of the blessings, which the redeemed shall receive
          in heaven, is that river of water of life that proceeds from the
          throne of God and the Lamb, Rev. 22:. 1. Which doubtless signifies the
          same with those rivers of living water, explained, John vii. 38, 39,
          which is elsewhere called the ” river of God’s pleasures.” Herein
          consists the fulness of good, which the saints receive of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is by partaking of the Holy Spirit, that they have communion with
          Christ in his fulness. God hath given the Spirit, not by measure unto
          him; and they do receive of his fulness, and grace for grace. This is
          the sum of the saints’ inheritance; and therefore that little of the
          Holy Ghost which believers have in this world, is said to be the
          earnest of their inheritance, 2 Cor. 1:22. ” Who hath also sealed us,
          and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.” And chap. 5:5.
          “Now he that hath wrought us for the self­same thing, is God, who also
          hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.” And Eph. 1:13, 14. ” Ye
          were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of
          our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Holy Spirit and good things are spoken of in Scripture as the
          same; as if the Spirit of God communicated to the soul, comprised all
          good things, Matt. 7:2 . ” How much more shall your heavenly Father
          give good things to them that ask him?” In Luke it is, chap. 11:. 13.
          ” How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to
          them that ask him?” This is the sum of the blessings that Christ died
          to procure, and the subject of gospel­promises. Gal. iii. 1 3, 14. ”
          He was made a curse for us, that we might receive the promise of the
          Spirit through faith.” The Spirit of God is the great promise of the
          Father, Luke 24:. 49. ” Behold, I send the promise of my Father upon
          you.” The Spirit of God therefore is called ” the Spirit of promise,”
          Eph. 1:33. This promised thing Christ received, and had given into his
          hand, as soon as he had finished the work of our redemption, to bestow
          on all that he had redeemed; Acts ii. 13. “Therefore being by the
          right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the
          promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye both see
          and hear.” So that all the holiness and happiness of the redeemed is
          in God. It is in the communications, indwelling, and acting of the
          Spirit of God. Holiness and happiness is in the fruit, here and
          hereafter, because God dwells in them, and they in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus God has given us the Redeemer, and it is by him that our good is
          purchased. So God is the Redeemer and the price; and he also is the
          good purchased. So that all that we have is of God, and through him,
          and in him. Rom. 11:36. ” For of him, and through him, and to him, or
          in him, are all things.” The same in the Greek that is here rendered
          to him, is rendered in him, I Cor. 8:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. God is glorified in the work of redemption by this means, viz. By
          there being so great and universal a dependence of the redeemed on
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Man hath so much the greater occasion and obligation to notice and
          acknowledge God’s perfections and all­sufficiency. The greater the
          creature’s dependence is on God’s perfections, and the greater concern
          he has with them, so much the greater occasion has he to take notice
          of them. So much the greater con cern any one has with and dependence
          upon the power and grace of God, so much the greater occasion has he
          to take notice of that power and grace. So much the greater and more
          immediate dependence there is on the divine holiness, so much the
          greater occasion to take notice of and acknowledge that. So much the
          greater and more absolute dependence we have on the divine
          perfections, as belonging to the several persons of the Trinity, so
          much the greater occasion have we to observe and own the divine glory
          of each of them. That which we are most concerned with, is surely most
          in the way of our observation and notice; and this kind of concern
          with any thing, viz. dependence, does especially tend to command and
          oblige the attention and observation. Those things that we are not
          much dependent upon, it is easy to neglect; but we can scarce do any
          other than mind that which we have a great dependence on. By reason of
          our so great dependence on God, and his perfections, and in so many
          respects, he and his glory are the more directly set in our view,
          which way soever we turn our eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have the greater occasion to take notice of God’s all­sufficiency,
          when all our sufficiency is thus every way of him. We have the more
          occasion to contemplate him as an infinite good, and as the fountain
          of all good. Such a dependence on God demonstrates his
          all­sufficiency. So much as the dependence of the creature is on God,
          so much the greater does the creature’s emptiness in himself appear;
          and so much the greater the creature’s emptiness, so much the greater
          must the fulness of the Being be who supplies him. Our having all of
          God, shows the fulness of his power and grace; our having all through
          him, shows the fulness of his merit and worthiness; and our having all
          in him, demonstrates his fulness of beauty, love, and happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the redeemed, by reason of the greatness of their dependence on
          God, have not only so much the greater occasion, but obligation to
          contemplate and acknowledge the glory and fulness of God. How
          unreasonable and ungrateful should we be, if we did not acknowledge
          that sufficiency and glory which we absolutely, immediately, and
          universally depend upon!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Hereby is demonstrated how great God’s glory is considered
          comparatively, or as compared with the creature’s.-By the creature
          being thus wholly and universally dependent on God, it appears that
          the creature is nothing, and that God is all. Hereby it appears that
          God is infinitely above us; that God’s strength, and wisdom, and
          holiness, are infinitely greater than ours. However great and glorious
          the creature apprehends God to be, yet if he be not sensible of the
          difference between God and him, so as to see that God’s glory is
          great, compared with his own, he will not be disposed to give God the
          glory due to his name. If the creature in any respects sets himself
          upon a level with God, or exalts himself to any competition with him,
          however he may apprehend that great honour and profound respect may
          belong to God from those that are at a greater distance, he will not
          be so sensible of its being due from him. So much the more men exalt
          themselves, so much the less will they surely be disposed to exalt
          God. It is certainly what God aims at in the disposition of things in
          redemption, (if we allow the Scriptures to be a revelation of God’s
          mind,) that God should appear full, and man in himself empty, that God
          should appear all, and man nothing. It is God’s declared design that
          others should not ” glory in his presence;” which implies that it is
          his design to advance his own comparative glory. So much the more man
          ” glories in God’s presence,” so much the less glory is ascribed to
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. By its being thus ordered, that the creature should have so
          absolute and universal a dependence on God, provision is made that God
          should have our whole souls, and should be the object of our undivided
          respect. If we had our dependence partly on God, and partly on
          something else, man’s respect would be divided to those different
          things on which he had dependence. Thus it would be if we depended on
          God only for a part of our good, and on ourselves, or some other
          being, for another part: or if we had our good only from God, and
          through another that was not God, and in something else distinct from
          both, our hearts would be divided between the good itself, and him
          from whom, and him through whom, we received it. But now there is no
          occasion for this, God being not only he from or of whom we have all
          good, but also through whom, and is that good itself, that we have
          from him and through him. So that whatsoever there is to attract our
          respect, the tendency is still directly towards God; all unites in him
          as the centre.
        </p>
        <p>Application and Use</p>
        <p>
          1. We may here observe the marvelous wisdom of God, in the work of
          redemption. God hath made man’s emptiness and misery, his low, lost,
          and ruined state, into which he sunk by the fall, an occasion of the
          greater advancement of his own glory, as in other ways, so
          particularly in this, that there is now much more universal and
          apparent dependence of man on God. Though God be pleased to lift man
          out of that dismal abyss of sin and woe into which he was fallen, and
          exceedingly to exalt him in excellency and honour, and to a high pitch
          of glory and blessedness, yet the creature hath nothing in any respect
          to glory of; all the glory evidently belongs to God, all is in a mere,
          and most absolute, and divine dependence on the Father, Son, and Holy
          Ghost. And each person of the Trinity is equally glorified in this
          work: there is an absolute dependence of the creature on every one for
          all: all is of the Father, all through the Son, and all in the Holy
          Ghost. Thus God appears in the work of redemption as all in all. It is
          fit that he who is, and there is none else, should be the Alpha and
          Omega, the first and the last, the all and the only, in this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Hence those doctrines and schemes of divinity that are in any
          respect opposite to such an absolute and universal dependence on God,
          derogate from his glory, and thwart the design of our redemption. And
          such are those schemes that put the creature in God’s stead, in any of
          the mentioned respects, that exalt man into the place of either
          Father, Son, or Holy Ghost, in any thing pertaining to our redemption.
          However they may allow of a dependence of the redeemed on God, yet
          they deny a dependence that is so absolute and universal. They own an
          entire dependence of God for some things, but not for others; they own
          that we depend on God for the gift and acceptance of a Redeemer, but
          deny so absolute a dependence on him for the obtaining of an interest
          in the Redeemer. They own an absolute dependence on the Father for
          giving his Son, and on the Son for working out redemption, but not so
          entire a dependence on the Holy Ghost for conversion, and a being in
          Christ, and so coming to a title to his benefits. They own a
          dependence on God for means of grace, but not absolutely for the
          benefit and success of those means; a partial dependence on the power
          of God, for obtaining and exercising holiness, but not a mere
          dependence on the arbitrary and sovereign grace of God. They own a
          dependence on the free grace of God for a reception into his favour,
          so far that it is without any proper merit, but not as it is without
          being attracted, or moved with any excellency. They own a partial
          dependence on Christ, as he through whom we have life, as having
          purchased new terms of life, but still hold that the righteousness
          through which we have life is inherent in ourselves, as it was under
          the first covenant. Now whatever scheme is inconsistent with our
          entire dependence on God for all, and of having all of him, through
          him, and in him, it is repugnant to the design and tenor of the
          gospel, and robs it of that which God accounts its lustre and glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Hence we may learn a reason why faith is that by which we come to
          have an interest in this redemption; for there is included in the
          nature of faith, a sensible acknowledgment of absolute dependence on
          God in this affair. It is very fit that it should be required of all,
          in order to their having the benefit of this redemption, that they
          should be sensible of, and acknowledge, their dependence on God for
          it. It is by this means that God hath contrived to glorify himself in
          redemption; and it is fit that he should at least have this glory of
          those that are the subjects of this redemption, and have the benefit
          of it.-Faith is a sensibleness of what is real in the work of
          redemption; and the soul that believes doth entirely depend on God for
          all salvation, in its own sense and act. Faith abases men, and exalts
          God; it gives all the glory of redemption to him alone. It is
          necessary in order to saving faith, that man should be emptied of
          himself, be sensible that he is ” wretched, and miserable, and poor,
          and blind, and naked.” Humility is a great ingredient of true faith:
          he that truly receives redemption, receives it as a little child, Mark
          10:15. ” Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of heaven as a little
          child, he shall not enter therein.” It is the delight of a believing
          soul to abase itself and exalt God alone: that is the language of it,
          Psalm 65:1. ” Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name give
          glory.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Let us be exhorted to exalt God alone, and ascribe to him all the
          glory of redemption. Let us endeavour to obtain, and increase in, a
          sensibleness of our great dependence on God, to have our eye to him
          alone, to mortify a self­dependent and self-righteous disposition. Man
          is naturally exceeding prone to exalt himself, and depend on his own
          power or goodness; as though from himself he must expect happiness. He
          is prone to have respect to enjoyments alien from God and his Spirit,
          as those in which happiness is to be found.-But this doctrine should
          teach us to exalt God alone; as by trust and reliance, so by praise.
          Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord. Hath any man hope that he is
          converted, and sanctified, and that his mind is endowed with true
          excellency and spiritual beauty? that his sins are forgiven, and he
          received into God’s favour, and exalted to the honour and blessedness
          of being his child, and an heir of eternal life? let him give God all
          the glory; who alone makes him to differ from the worst of men in this
          world, or the most miserable of the damned in hell. Hath any man much
          comfort and strong hope of eternal life, let not his hope lift him up,
          but dispose him the more to abase himself, to reflect on his own
          exceeding unworthiness of such a favour, and to exalt God alone. Is
          any man eminent in holiness, and abundant in good works, let him take
          nothing of the glory of it to himself, but ascribe it to him whose ”
          workmanship we are, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.”
