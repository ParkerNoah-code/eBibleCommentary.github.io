        <h2>The Peace Which Christ Gives His True Followers – John 14:27</h2>

        <h2 class="authortitle">Jonathan Edwards</h2>
        <h5>Dated August 1750.</h5>
        <p>
          John 14:27, “Peace I leave with you, my peace give unto you: not as
          the world giveth, give I unto you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE words are a part of a most affectionate and affecting discourse
          that Christ had with his disciples the same evening in which he was
          betrayed, knowing that he was to be crucified the next day. This
          discourse begins with the 31st verse of the 13th, and is continued to
          the end of the16th chapter. Christ began his discourse after he
          partook of the passover with them, after he had instituted and
          administered the sacrament of the supper, and after Judas was gone
          out, and none were left but his true and faithful disciples, whom he
          now addresses as his dear children. This was the last discourse that
          Christ had with them before his death. As it was his parting
          discourse, and as it were, his dying discourse, so it is on many
          accounts the most remarkable we have recorded in our Bibles.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident this discourse made a deep impression on the minds of
          the disciples, and we may suppose that it did so, in a special manner,
          on the mind of John the beloved disciple, whose heart was especially
          full of love to him, and who had just then been leaning on his bosom.
          In this discourse Christ had told his dear disciples that he was going
          away, which filled them with sorrow and heaviness. The words of the
          text are given to comfort them, and to relieve their sorrow. He
          supports them with the promise of that peace which he would leave with
          them, and which they would have in him and with him, when he was gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          This promise he delivers in three emphatical expressions which
          illustrate one another. “Peace I leave with you.” As much as to say,
          though I am going away, yet I will not take all comfort away with me.
          While I have been with you, I have been your support and comfort, and
          you have had peace in me in the midst of the losses you have
          sustained, and troubles you have met with from this evil generation.
          This peace I will not take from you, but leave it with you in a more
          full possession.
        </p>
        <p>
          “My peace I give unto you.” Christ by calling it his peace signifies
          two things,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That it was his own, that which he had to give. It was the peculiar
          benefit that he had to bestow on his children, now he was about to
          leave the world as to his human presence. Silver and gold he had none,
          for while in his estate of humiliation, he was poor. The foxes had
          holes, and the birds of the air had nests, but the Son of man had not
          where to lay his head, Luke 9:58. He had no earthly estate to leave to
          his disciples who were as it were his family, but he had peace to give
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It was his peace that he gave them, as it was the same kind of
          peace which he himself enjoyed. The same excellent and divine peace
          which he ever had in God, and which he was about to receive in his
          exalted state in a vastly greater perfection and fullness. For the
          happiness Christ gives to his people, is a participation of his own
          happiness: agreeable to chapter 15:11, “These things have I said unto
          you, that my joy might remain in you.” And in his prayer with his
          disciples at the conclusion of this discourse, chapter 17:13, “And now
          come I to thee, and these things I speak in the world, that they might
          have my joy fulfilled in themselves.” And verse 22, “And the glory
          which thou gavest me, I have given them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ here alludes to men making their wills before death. When
          parents are about to leave their children by death, they are wont in
          their last will and testament to give them their estate, that estate
          which they themselves were wont to possess and enjoy. So it was with
          Christ when he was about to leave the world, with respect to the peace
          which he gave his disciples. Only with this difference: that earthly
          parents, when they die, though they leave the same estate to their
          children which they themselves heretofore enjoyed, yet when the
          children come to the full possession of it, they enjoy it no more. The
          parents do not enjoy it with their children. The time of the full
          possession of parents and children is not together. Whereas with
          respect to Christ’s peace, he did not only possess it himself before
          his death, when he bequeathed it to his disciples, but also afterwards
          more fully, so that they were received to possess it with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third and last expression is, “not as the world giveth, give I
          unto you.” Which is as much as to say my gifts and legacies, now I am
          going to leave the world, are not like those which the rich and great
          men of the world are wont to leave to their heirs, when they die. They
          bequeath to their children their worldly possessions, and it may be
          vast treasures of silver and gold, and sometimes an earthly kingdom.
          But the thing that I give you is my peace, a vastly different thing
          from what they are wont to give, and which cannot be obtained by all
          that they can bestow, or their children inherit from them.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          That peace which Christ, when he died, left as a legacy to all his
          true saints, is very different from all those things which the men of
          this world bequeath to their children, when they die.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Christ at his death made over the blessings of the new covenant to
          believers, as it were in a will or testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. A great blessing that Christ made over to believers in this his
          testament was his peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This legacy of Christ is exceedingly diverse from all that any of
          the men of this world ever leave to their children when they die.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Christ at his death made over the blessings of the new covenant to
          believers, as it were in a will or testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new covenant is represented by the apostle as Christ’s last will
          and testament. Heb. 9:15, 16, “And for this cause he is the Mediator
          of the New Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of
          the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are
          called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. For where a
          testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the
          testator.” What men convey by their will or testament is their own
          estate. So Christ in the New Covenant conveys to believers his own
          inheritance, so far as they are capable of possessing and enjoying it.
          They have that eternal life given to them in their measure, which
          Christ himself possesses. They live in him, and with him, and by a
          participation of his life. Because he lives they live also. They
          inherit his kingdom: the same kingdom which the Father appointed unto
          him, Luke 22:29, “And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath
          appointed unto me.” They shall reign on his throne, Rev. 3:21. They
          have his glory given to them, John 17. And because all things are
          Christ’s, so in Christ all things are the saints’, 1 Cor. 3:21, 22.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men in their wills or testaments most commonly give their estates
          their children: so believers are in Scripture represented as Christ’s
          children, Heb. 2:13, “Behold, I and the children which God hath given
          me.” Men most commonly make their wills a little before their death:
          so Christ did, in a very special and solemn manner, make over and
          confirm to his disciples the blessings of the New Covenant, on the
          evening before the day of his crucifixion, in that discourse of which
          my text is a part. The promises of the New Covenant were never so
          particularly expressed, and so solemnly given forth by Christ in all
          the time that he was upon earth, as in this discourse. Christ promises
          them mansions in his Father’s house, John 14:1-3. Here he promises
          them whatever blessings they should need and ask in his name, John
          15:7, and chap. 14:23, 24. Here he more solemnly and fully than any
          where else, gives forth and confirms the promise of the Holy Spirit,
          which is the sum of the blessings of the covenant of grace. John
          14:16; chap. 14:26; chap. 15:26; and 16:7. Here he promises them his
          own and his Father’s gracious presence and favor, John 14:18, and
          14:20, 21. Here he promises them peace, as in the text. Here he
          promises them his joy, John 15:11. Here he promises grace to bring
          forth holy fruits, Chapter 15:16. And victory over the world, John
          16:33. And indeed there seems to be no where else so full and complete
          an edition of the covenant of grace in the whole Bible, as in this
          dying discourse of Christ with his eleven true disciples.
        </p>
        <p>
          This covenant between Christ and his children is like a will or
          testament also in this respect: that it becomes effectual, and a way
          is made for putting it in execution, no other way than by his death,
          as the apostle observes it is with a will or testament among men. “For
          a testament is of force after men are dead.” Heb. 9:17. For though the
          covenant of grace indeed was of force before the death of Christ, yet
          it was of force no otherwise than by his death. So that his death then
          did virtually intervene, being already undertaken and engaged. As a
          man’s heirs come by the legacies bequeathed to them no otherwise than
          by the death of the testator, so men come by the spiritual and eternal
          inheritance no otherwise than by the death of Christ. If it had not
          been for the death of Christ they never could have obtained it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. A great blessing that Christ in his testament has bequeathed to
          his true followers, is his peace. Here are two things that I would
          observe particularly, viz. That Christ has bequeathed to believers
          true peace, and then that peace he has given them is his peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, our Lord Jesus Christ has bequeathed true peace and comfort to
          his followers. Christ is called the Prince of Peace, Isa. 9:6. And
          when he was born into the world, the angels on that joyful and
          wonderful occasion sang, “Glory to God in the highest, on earth
          peace,” — because of that peace which he should procure for and bestow
          on the children of men: peace with God, and peace one with another,
          and tranquillity and peace within themselves, which last is especially
          the benefit spoken of in the text. This Christ has procured for his
          followers, and laid a foundation for their enjoyment of it, in that he
          has procured for them the other two, viz. peace with God, and one with
          another. He has procured for them peace and reconciliation with God,
          and his favor and friendship, in that he satisfied for their sins and
          laid a foundation for the perfect removal of the guilt of sin, and the
          forgiveness of all their trespasses, and wrought out for them a
          perfect and glorious righteousness, most acceptable to God, and
          sufficient to recommend them to God’s full acceptance, to the adoption
          of children, and to the eternal fruits of his fatherly kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
          By these means true saints are brought into a state of freedom from
          condemnation, and all the curses of the law of God, Rom. 8:34, “Who is
          he that condemneth?” And by these means they are safe from that
          dreadful and eternal misery to which naturally they are exposed, and
          are set on high out of the reach of all their enemies, so that the
          gates of hell and powers of darkness can never destroy them, nor can
          wicked men, though they may persecute, ever hurt them, Rom. 8:31, “If
          God be for us, who can be against us?” Num. 23:8, “How shall I curse
          whom God hath not cursed?” Verse 23, “There is no enchantment against
          Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel.” By these means
          they are out of the reach of death, John 6:4; chap. 6:50, 51, “This is
          the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof
          and not die.” By these means death with respect to them has lost its
          sting, and is no more worthy of the name of death, 1 Cor. 15:55, “O
          death, where is thy sting?” By these means they have no need to be
          afraid of the day of judgment, when the heavens and earth shall be
          dissolved, Psa. 46:1, 2, “God is our refuge and strength, a very
          present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth
          be removed: and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the
          sea.” Yea, a true saint has reason to be at rest in an assurance, that
          nothing can separate him from the love of God, Rom. 8:38, 39.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus he that is in Christ, is in a safe refuge from everything that
          might disturb him, Isa. 32:2, “And a man shall be as an hiding place
          from the wind, and a covert from the tempest: as rivers of water in a
          dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.” And hence
          they that dwell in Christ have that promise fulfilled to then, which
          we have in the 18th verse of the same chapter, “And my people shall
          dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet
          resting places.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And the true followers of Christ have not only ground of rest and
          peace of soul, by reason of their safety from evil, but on account of
          their sure title and certain enjoyment of all that good which they
          stand in need of, living, dying, and through all eternity. They are on
          a sure foundation for happiness, are built on rock that can never be
          moved, and have a fountain that is sufficient, and can never be
          exhausted. The covenant is ordered in all things and sure, and God has
          passed his Word and oath, “That by two immutable things in which it
          was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who
          have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us.” The
          infinite Jehovah is become their God, who can do everything for them.
          He is their portion who has an infinite fullness of good in himself.
          “He is their shield and exceeding great reward.” As great a good is
          made over to them as they can desire or conceive of; and is made as
          sure as they can desire. Therefore they have reason to put their
          hearts at rest, and be at peace in their minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, he has bequeathed peace to the souls of his people, as he has
          procured for them and made over to them the spirit of grace and true
          holiness, which has a natural tendency to the peace and quietness of
          the soul. It implies a discovery and relish of a suitable and
          sufficient. It brings a person into a view of divine beauty, and to a
          relish of that good which is a man’s proper happiness, and so it
          brings the soul to its true center. The soul by his means is brought
          to rest, and ceases from restlessly inquiring, as others do: who will
          show us any good, and wandering to and fro, like lost sheep seeking
          rest, and finding none. The soul has found him who is as the apple
          tree among the trees of the wood, and sits down under his shadow with
          great delight, and his fruit is sweet unto his taste, Song 2:3. And
          thus that saying of Christ is fulfilled, John 4:14, “Whoever drinketh
          of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst.” And besides,
          true grace naturally tends to peace and quietness, as it settles in
          the soul in the due order, sets reason on the throne, and subjects the
          senses and affections to its government, which before were uppermost.
          Grace tends to tranquillity, as it mortifies tumultuous desires and
          passions, [and] subdues the eager and insatiable appetites of the
          sensual nature and greediness after the vanities of the world. It
          mortifies such principles as hatred, variance, emulation, wrath,
          envyings and the like, which are a continual source of inward
          uneasiness and perturbation, and [it] supplies those sweet, calming,
          and quieting principles of humility, meekness, resignation, patience,
          gentleness, forgiveness, and sweet reliance on God. It also tends to
          peace, as it fixes the aim of the soul to a certain end. So that the
          soul is no longer distracted and drawn by opposite ends to be sought,
          and opposite portions to be obtained, and many masters of contrary
          wills and commands to be served. But the heart is fixed in the choice
          of one certain, sufficient, and unfailing good, and the soul’s aim at
          this, and hope of it, is like an anchor that keeps it stedfast, that
          it should no more be driven to and fro by every wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, this peace which Christ has left as a legacy to his true
          followers, is his peace. It is the peace which himself enjoys. This is
          what I take to be principally intended in the expression. It is the
          peace that he enjoyed while on the earth, in his state of humiliation.
          Though he was a man of sorrows, and acquainted grief, and was
          everywhere hated and persecuted by men and devils, and had no place of
          rest in this world, yet in God, his Father, he had peace. We read of
          his rejoicing in spirit, Luke 10:21. So Christ’s true disciples,
          though in the world they have tribulation, yet in God have peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Christ had finished his labors and sufferings, had risen from the
          dead, and ascended into heaven, he entered into his rest, a state of
          most blessed, perfect, and everlasting peace: delivered by his own
          sufferings from our imputed guilt, acquitted and justified of the
          Father on his resurrection. Having obtained a perfect victory over his
          enemies, he was received of his Father into heaven, the rest which he
          had prepared for him, there to enjoy his heart’s desire fully and
          perfectly to all eternity. And then were those words in the six first
          verses of the 21st Psalm, which have respect to Christ, fulfilled.
          This peace and rest of the Messiah is exceeding glorious, Isa. 11:10,
          “And his rest shall be glorious.” This rest is what Christ has
          procured, not only for himself, but also his people, by his death. He
          has bequeathed it to them that they may enjoy it with him, imperfectly
          in this, and perfectly and eternally in another world.
        </p>
        <p>
          That peace, which has been described, and which believers enjoy, is a
          participation of the peace which their glorious Lord and Master
          himself enjoys, by virtue of the same blood by which Christ himself
          has entered into rest. It is in a participation of this same
          justification, for believers are justified with Christ. As he was
          justified when he rose from the dead, and as he was made free from our
          guilt, which he had as our surety, so believers are justified in him
          and through him, as being accepted of God in the same righteousness.
          It is in the favor of the same God and heavenly Father that the enjoy
          peace. “I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your
          God.” It is in a participation of the same Spirit, for believers have
          the Spirit of Christ. He had the Spirit given to him not by measure,
          and of his fullness do they all receive, and grace for grace. As the
          oil poured on the head of Aaron went down to the skirts of his
          garments, so the Spirit poured on Christ, the Head, descends to all
          his members. It is as partaking of the same grace of the Spirit that
          believers enjoy this peace, John 1:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is as being united to Christ, and living by a participation of his
          life, as a branch lives by the 1ife of the vine. It is as partaking of
          the same love of God, John 17:26, “That the love wherewith thou hast
          loved me may be in them.” — It is as having a part with him in his
          victory over the same enemies, and also as having an interest in the
          same kind of eternal rest and peace, Eph. 2:5, 6, “Even when we were
          dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, — and hath
          raised us up together. and hath made us sit together in heavenly
          places.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This legacy of Christ to his true disciples is very diverse from
          all that the men of this world ever leave to their children when they
          die. The men of this world, many of them, when they come to die, have
          great estates to bequeath to their children, an abundance of the good
          things of this world, large tracts of ground, perhaps in a fruitful
          soil, covered with flocks and herds. They sometimes leave to their
          children stately mansions and vast treasures of silver, gold, jewels,
          and precious things, fetched from both the Indies and from every side
          of the globe of the earth. They leave them wherewith to live in much
          state and magnificence, and make a great show among men, to fare very
          sumptuously, and swim in worldly pleasures. Some have crowns,
          scepters, and palaces, and great monarchies to leave to their heirs.
          But none of these things are to be compared to that blessed peace of
          Christ which he has bequeathed to his true followers. These things are
          such as God commonly, in his providence, gives his worst enemies,
          those whom he hates and despises most. But Christ’s peace is a
          precious benefit, which he reserves for his peculiar favorites. These
          worldly things, even the best of them, that the men and princes of the
          world leave for their children, are things which God in his providence
          throws out to those whom he looks on as dogs. But Christ’s peace is
          the bread of his children. All these earthly things are but empty
          shadows, which however men set their hearts upon them, are not bread,
          and can never satisfy their souls. But this peace of Christ is a truly
          substantial, satisfying food, Isa. 55:2. None of those things if men
          have them to the best advantage, and in ever so great abundance, can
          give true peace and rest to the soul, as is abundantly manifest not
          only in reason, but experience: it being found in all ages, that those
          who have the most of them, have commonly the least quietness of mind.
          It is true, there may be a kind of quietness, a false peace they may
          have in their enjoyment of worldly things. Men may bless their souls,
          and think themselves the only happy persons and despise others, [and]
          may say to their souls, as the rich man did, Luke 12:19, “Soul, thou
          hast much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink,
          and be merry.” But Christ’s peace, which he gives to his true
          disciples, vastly differs from this peace that men may have in the
          enjoyments of the world, in the following respects:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Christ’s peace is a reasonable peace and rest of soul. It is
          what has its foundation in light and knowledge, in the proper
          exercises of reason, and a right view of things, whereas the peace of
          the world is founded in blindness and delusion. The peace that the
          people of Christ have, arises from their having their eyes open, and
          seeing things as they be. The more they consider, and the more they
          know of the truth and reality of things — the more they know what is
          true concerning themselves, the state and condition they are in, the
          more they know of God, and the more certain they are that there is a
          God. The more they know what manner of being he is, the more certain
          they are of another world and future judgment and of the truth of
          God’s threatenings and promises, the more their consciences are
          awakened and enlightened and the brighter and the more searching the
          light is that they see things in, — the more is their peace
          established. Whereas, on the contrary, the peace that the men of the
          world have in their worldly enjoyments can subsist no otherwise than
          by their being kept in ignorance. They must be blindfolded and
          deceived, otherwise they can have no peace. Do but let light in upon
          their consciences, so that they may look about them and see what they
          are, and what circumstances they are in, and it will at once destroy
          all their quietness and comfort. Their peace can live nowhere but in
          the dark. Light turns their ease into torment. The more they know what
          is true concerning God and concerning themselves, the more they are
          sensible of the truth concerning those enjoyments which they possess.
          The more they are sensible what things now are, and what things are
          like to be hereafter, the more will their calm be turned into a storm.
          The worldly man’s peace cannot be maintained but by avoiding
          consideration and reflection. If he allows himself to think, and
          properly to exercise his reason, it destroys his quietness and
          comfort. If he would establish his carnal peace, it concerns him to
          put out the light of his mind, and turn beast as fast as he can. The
          faculty of reason, if at liberty, proves a mortal enemy to his peace.
          It concerns him, if he would keep alive his peace, to contrive all
          ways that may be, to stupefy his mind and deceive himself, and to
          imagine things to be otherwise than they be. But with respect to the
          peace which Christ gives, reason is its great friend. The more this
          faculty is exercised, the more it is established. The more they
          consider and view things with truth and exactness, the firmer is their
          comfort, and the higher their joy. How vast a difference is there
          between the peace of a Christian and the worldling! How miserable are
          they who cannot enjoy peace any otherwise than by hiding their eyes
          from the light, and confining themselves to darkness. Their peace is
          stupidity. It is as the ease that a man has who has taken a dose of
          stupefying poison, and the ease and pleasure that a drunkard may have
          in a house on fire over his head, or the joy of a distracted man in
          thinking that he is a king, though a miserable wretch confined in
          bedlam. Whereas, the peace which Christ gives his true disciples, is
          the light of life, something of the tranquillity of heaven, the peace
          of the celestial paradise, that has the glory of God to lighten it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, Christ’s peace is a virtuous and holy peace. The peace that
          the men of the world enjoy is vicious. It is a vile stupidity, that
          depraves and debases the mind, and makes men brutish. But the peace
          that the saints enjoy in Christ, is not only their comfort, but it is
          a part of their beauty and dignity. The Christian tranquillity, rest,
          and joy of real saints, are not only unspeakable privileges, but they
          are virtues and graces of God’s Spirit, wherein the image of God in
          them does partly consist. This peace has its source in those
          principles that are in the highest degree virtuous and amiable, such
          as poverty of spirit, holy resignation, trust in God, divine love,
          meekness, and charity. The exercise of such blessed fruits of the
          Spirit as are spoken of, Gal. 5:22, 23.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, this peace greatly differs from that which is enjoyed by the
          men of the world, with regard to its exquisite sweetness. It is a
          peace so much above all that natural men enjoy in worldly things, that
          it surpasses their understanding and conception, Phil. 4:7. It is
          exquisitely sweet and secure, because it has so firm a foundation, the
          everlasting rock that never can be moved; because [it is] perfectly
          agreeable to reason; because it rises from holy and divine principles
          that as they are the virtue, so they are the proper happiness of men;
          and because the greatness of the objective good that the saints enjoy
          is no other than the infinite bounty and fullness of that God who is
          the fountain of all good. The fullness and perfection of that
          provision that is made for it in Christ and the new covenant, is a
          foundation laid for the saints’ perfect peace, and this hereafter they
          shall actually enjoy. And though their peace is not now perfect, it is
          not owing to any defect in the provision made, but to their own
          imperfection, sin and darkness. As yet, they do partly cleave to the
          world, and seek peace from thence, and do not perfectly cleave to
          Christ. But the more they do so, and the more they see of the
          provision there made, and accept of it, and cleave to that alone, the
          nearer are they brought to perfect tranquillity, Isa. 25:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, the peace of the Christian infinitely differs from that of the
          worldling, in that it is unfailing and eternal peace. That peace which
          carnal men have in the things of the world, is according to the
          foundation upon which it is built, of short continuance like the
          comfort of a dream, 1 John 2:17; 1 Cor. 7:31. These things, the best
          and most durable of them, are like bubbles on the face of the water.
          They vanish in a moment, Hos. 10:7. — But the foundation of the
          Christian’s peace is everlasting. It is what no time, no change, can
          destroy. It will remain when the body dies. It will remain when the
          mountains depart and the hills shall be removed, and when the heavens
          shall be rolled together as a scroll. The fountain of his comfort
          shall never be diminished, and the stream shall never be dried. His
          comfort and joy is a living spring in the soul, a well of water
          springing up to everlasting life.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          The use that I would make of this doctrine, is to improve it as an
          inducement unto all to forsake the world, no longer seeking peace and
          rest in its vanities, and to cleave to Christ and follow him.
          Happiness and rest are what all men pursue. But the things of the
          world, wherein most men seek it, can never afford it. They are
          laboring and spending themselves in vain. But Christ invites you to
          come to him, and offers you this peace which he gives his true
          followers, that so much excels all that the world can afford, Isa.
          55:2, 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          You that have hitherto spent your time in the pursuit of satisfaction
          in the profit and glory of the world, or in the pleasures and vanities
          of youth, have this day an offer of that excellent and everlasting
          peace and blessedness, which Christ has purchased with the price of
          his own blood. As long as you continue to reject those offers and
          invitations of Christ, and continue in a Christless condition, you
          never will enjoy any true peace or comfort, but will be like the
          prodigal, that in vain endeavored to be satisfied with the husks that
          the swine did eat. The wrath of God will abide upon, and misery will
          attend you, wherever you go, which you never will be able to escape.
          Christ gives peace to the most sinful and miserable that come to him.
          He heals the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds. But it is
          impossible that they should have peace, while they continue in their
          sins, Isa. 57:19-21. There is no peace between God and them. For as
          they have the guilt of sin remaining in their souls, and are under its
          dominion, so God’s indignation continually burns against them, and
          therefore there is reason why they should travail in pain all their
          days. While you continue in such a state, you live in a state of
          dreadful uncertainty what will become of you, and in continual danger.
          When you are in the enjoyment of things most pleasing to you, where
          your heart is best suited, and most cheerful, yet you are in a state
          of condemnation. You hang over the infernal pit, with the sword of
          divine vengeance hanging over your head, having no security one moment
          from utter and remediless destruction. What reasonable peace can
          anyone enjoy in such a state as this? What though you clothe him in
          gorgeous apparel, or to set him on a throne, or at a prince’s table,
          and feed him with the rarest dainties the earth affords? How miserable
          is the ease and cheerfulness that such have! What a poor kind of
          comfort and joy is it that such take in their wealth and pleasures for
          a moment, while they are the prisoners of divine justice, and wretched
          captives of the devil! They have none to befriend them, being without
          Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the
          covenant of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          I invite you now to a better portion. There are better things provided
          for the sinful miserable children of men. There is a surer comfort and
          more durable peace: comfort that you may enjoy in a state of safety,
          and on a sure foundation: a peace and rest that you may enjoy with
          reason, and with your eyes open. You may have all your sins forgiven,
          your greatest and most aggravated transgressions blotted out as a
          cloud, and buried as in the depths of the sea, that they may never be
          found more. And being not only forgiven, but accepted to favor, you
          become the objects of God’s complacence and delight. Being taken into
          God’s family and made his children, you may have good evidence that
          your names were written on the heart of Christ before the world was
          made, and that you have an interest in that covenant of grace that is
          well ordered in all things and sure, wherein is promised no less than
          life and immortality, an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, a
          crown of glory that fades not away. Being in such circumstances,
          nothing shall be able to prevent your being happy to all eternity,
          having for the foundation of your hope that love of God which is from
          eternity to eternity, and his promise and oath, and his omnipotent
          power: things infinitely firmer than mountains of brass. The mountains
          shall depart, and the hills be removed, yea, the heavens shall vanish
          away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, yet these
          things will never be abolished.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such a state as this you will have a foundation of peace and rest
          through all changes, and in times of the greatest uproar and outward
          calamity be defended from all storms, and dwell above the floods, Psa.
          32:6, 7. And you shall be at peace with everything, and God will make
          all his creatures throughout all parts of his dominion, to befriend
          you, Job 5:19-24. You need not be afraid of anything that your enemies
          can do unto you, Psa. 3:5, 6. Those things that now are most terrible
          to you, viz. death, judgment, and eternity, will then be most
          comfortable, the most sweet and pleasant objects of your
          contemplation. At least there will be reason that they should be so.
          Hearken therefore to the friendly counsel that is given you this day.
          Turn your feet into the way of peace, forsake the foolish and live,
          forsake those things which are no other than the devil’s baits, and
          seek after this excellent peace and rest of Jesus Christ: that peace
          of God which passeth all understanding. Taste and see: never was any
          disappointed that made a trial. Pro. 24:13, 14. You will not only find
          those spiritual comforts that Christ offers you to be of a surpassing
          sweetness for the present, but they will be to your soul as the
          dawning light that shines more and more to the perfect day. The issue
          of all will be your arrival in heaven, that land of rest, those
          regions of everlasting joy, where your peace and happiness will be
          perfect, without the least mixture of trouble or affliction, and never
          be interrupted nor have an end.
