        <h2>Natural Men in a Dreadful Condition – Acts 16:29, 30</h2>
        <p class="title">
          Dated February, 1753.<br />
          Preached to the Stockbridge Indians
        </p>
        <p>
          Acts 16:29, 30, “Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came
          trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, and brought them out,
          and said, Sirs what must I do to be saved?”
        </p>
        <p>
          WE have here and in the context and account of the conversion of the
          jailer, which is one of the most remarkable instances of the kind in
          the Scriptures. The jailer before seems not only to have been wholly
          insensible to the things of religion, but to have been a persecutor,
          and to have persecuted these very men, Paul and Silas; though he now
          comes to them in so earnest a manner, asking them what he must do to
          be saved. We are told in the context that all the magistrates and
          multitude of the city rose up jointly in a tumult against them, and
          took them, and cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them
          safely. Whereupon he thrust them into the inner prison, and made their
          feet fast in the stocks. And it is probable he did not act in this
          merely as the servant or instrument of the magistrates, but that he
          joined with the rest of the people in their rage against them. And
          that he did what he did urged on by his own will, as well as the
          magistrates’ commands, which made him execute their commands with such
          rigor.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises at midnight, and
          there was suddenly a great earthquake, and God had in so wonderful a
          manner set open the prison doors, and every man’s bands were loosed,
          he was greatly terrified. And in a kind of desperation, [he] was about
          to kill himself. But Paul and Silas crying out to him, “Do thyself no
          harm, for we are all here,” then he called for a light, and sprang in,
          as we have the account in the text. We may observe:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the objects of his concern. He is anxious about his salvation.
          He is terrified by his guilt, especially by his guilt in his ill
          treatment of these ministers of Christ. He is concerned to escape from
          that guilty state, the miserable state he was in by reason of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the sense which he has of the dreadfulness of his present
          state. This he manifests in several ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. By his great haste to escape from that state. By his haste to
          inquire what he must do. He seems to be urged by the most pressing
          concern, sensible of his present necessity of deliverance, without any
          delay. Before, he was quiet and secure in his natural state. But now
          his eyes are opened. He is in the utmost haste. If the house had been
          on fire over his head, he could not have asked more earnestly, or as
          being in greater haste. He could soon have come to Paul and Silas, to
          ask them what he must do, if he had only walked. But he was in too
          great haste to walk only, or to run; for he sprang in. He leaped into
          the place where they were. He fled from wrath. He fled from the fire
          of divine justice, and so hastened, as one that fled for his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. By his behavior and gesture before Paul and Silas. He fell down.
          That he fell down before those whom he had persecuted, and thrust into
          the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks, shows what
          was the state of his mind. It shows some great distress, that makes
          such an alteration in him, that brings him to this. He was broken
          down, as it were, by the distress of his mind, in a sense of the
          dreadfulness of his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. His earnest manner of inquiring of them what he shall do to escape
          from this miserable condition; “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” So
          distressed, that he is brought to be willing to do anything; to have
          salvation on any terms, and by any means, however difficult; brought,
          as it were, to write a blank, and give it in to God, that God may
          prescribe his own terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine. They who are in a natural condition, are in a dreadful
          condition. This I shall endeavor to make appear by a particular
          consideration of the state and condition of unregenerate persons.
        </p>
        <p>I. As to their actual condition in this world.</p>
        <p>II. As to their relations to the future world.</p>
        <p>
          I. The condition of those who are in a natural state, is dreadful in
          the present world.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, On account of the depraved state of their natures. As men come
          into the world, their natures are dreadfully depraved. Man in his
          primitive state was a noble piece of divine workmanship; but by the
          fall it is dreadfully defaced. It is awful to think that so excellent
          a creature as man is, should be so ruined. The dreadfulness of the
          condition, which unconverted men are in, in this respect, appears in
          the following things:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The dreadfulness of their depravity appears in that they are so
          sottishly blind and ignorant. God gave man a faculty of reason and
          understanding, which is a noble faculty. Herein he differs from all
          other creatures here below. He is exalted in his nature above them,
          and is in this respect like the angels, and is made capable to know
          God, and to know spiritual and eternal things. And God gave him
          understanding for this end, that he might know him, and know heavenly
          things and made him as capable to know these things as any others. But
          man has debased himself and has lost his glory in this respect. He has
          become as ignorant of the excellency of God, as the very beasts. His
          understanding is full of darkness. His mind is blind. [It] is
          altogether blind to spiritual things. Men are ignorant of God, and
          ignorant of Christ, ignorant of the way of salvation, ignorant of
          their own happiness, blind in the midst of the brightest and clearest
          light, ignorant under all manner of instructions. Rom. 3:17, “The way
          of peace they have not known.” Isa. 27:11, “It is a people of no
          understanding.” Jer. 4:22, “My people is foolish, they have not known
          me; they are sottish children, and have none understanding:” Jer.
          5:21, “Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding.”
          Psa. 95:10, 11, “It is a people that do err in their heart, and they
          have not known my ways; unto whom I sware in my wrath, that they
          should not enter into my rest.” 1 Cor. 15:34, “Some have not the
          knowledge of God; I speak this to your shame.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a spirit of atheism prevailing in the hearts of men; a
          strange disposition to doubt of the very being of God, and of another
          world, and of everything which cannot be seen with the bodily eyes.
          Psa. 121:1, “The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.” They
          do not realize that God sees them when they commit sin, and will call
          them to an account for it. And therefore, if they can hide sin from
          the eyes of men, they are not concerned, but are bold to commit it.
          Psa. 94:7, 8, 9, “Yet they say, the Lord shall not see, neither shall
          the God of Jacob regard it. Understand, ye brutish among the people;
          and, ye fools, when will ye be wise? He that planted the ear, shall he
          not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?” Psa. 73:11, “They
          say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?” So
          sottishly unbelieving are they of future things, of heaven and hell,
          and will commonly run the venture of damnation sooner than be
          convinced. They are stupidly senseless to the importance of eternal
          things. How hard to make them believe, and to give them a real
          conviction, that to be happy to all eternity is better than all other
          good; and to be miserable for ever under the wrath of God, is worse
          than all other evil. Men show themselves senseless enough in temporal
          things; but in spiritual things far more so. Luke 12:56, “Ye
          hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky, and of the earth; but
          how is it that ye do not discern this time?” They are very subtle in
          evil designs, but sottish in those things which most concern them.
          Jer. 4:22, “They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no
          knowledge.” Wicked men show themselves more foolish and senseless of
          what is best for them, than the very brutes. Isa. 1:3, “The ox knoweth
          his owner, and the ass his master’s crib; but Israel doth not know, my
          people doth not consider.” Jer. 8:7, “Yea, the stork in the heaven
          knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle, and the crane, and the
          swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the
          judgment of the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They have no goodness in them. Rom. 7:18, “In me, that is, in my
          flesh, dwelleth no good thing.” They have no principle that disposes
          them to anything that is good. Natural men have no higher principle in
          their hearts than self-love. And herein they do not excel the devils.
          The devils love themselves, and love their own happiness, and are
          afraid of their own misery. And they go no further. And the devils
          would be as religious as the best of natural men if they were in the
          same circumstances. They would be as moral, and would pray as
          earnestly to God, and take as much pains for salvation, if there were
          the like opportunity. And as there is no good principle in the hearts
          of natural men, so there are never any good exercises of heart, never
          one good thought, or motion of heart in them. Particularly, there is
          no love to God in them. They never had the least degree of love to the
          infinitely glorious Being. They never had the least true respect to
          the Being that made them, and in whose hand their breath is, and from
          whom are all their mercies. However they may seem to do things at
          times out of respect to God, and wear a face as though they honored
          him, and highly esteemed him, it is all in mere hypocrisy. Though
          there may be a fair outside, they are like painted sepulchers. Within,
          there is nothing but putrefaction and rottenness. They have no love to
          Christ, the glorious Son of God, who is so worthy of their love, and
          has shown such wonderful grace to sinners in dying for them. They
          never did anything out of any real respect to the Redeemer of the
          world since they were born. They never brought forth any fruit to that
          God who made them and in whom they live and move and have their being.
          They never have in any way answered the end for which they were made.
          They have hitherto lived altogether in vain, and to no purpose. They
          never so much as sincerely obeyed one common of God; never so much as
          moved one finger out of a true spirit of obedience to him, who make
          them to serve him. And when they have seemed outwardly to comply with
          God’s commands, their hearts were not in it. They did not do it out of
          any spirit of subjection to God, or any disposition to obey him, but
          were merely driven to it by fear, or in some way influenced by their
          worldly interest. They never gave God the honor of one of his
          attributes. They never gave him the honor of his authority by obeying
          him. They never gave him the honor of his sovereignty by submitting to
          him. They never gave him the honor of his holiness and mercy by loving
          him. They never gave him the honor of his sufficiency and faithfulness
          by trusting in him. But have looked upon God as one not fit to be
          believed or trusted, and have treated him as if he were a liar. 1 John
          5:10, “He that believeth not God hath made him a liar.” They never so
          much as heartily thanked God for one mercy they have received in their
          whole lives, though God has always maintained them, and they have
          always lived upon his bounty. They never so much as once heartily
          thanked Christ for coming into the world and dying to give them an
          opportunity to be saved. They never would show him so much gratitude
          as to receive him, when he has knocked at their door; but have always
          shut the door against him, though he has come to knock at their door
          upon no other ground but only to offer himself to be their Savior.
          They never so much as had any true desires after God or Christ in
          their whole lives. When God has offered himself to them to be their
          portion, and Christ to be the friend of their souls, they did not
          desire it. They never desired to have God and Christ for their
          portion. They had rather be without them than with them, if they could
          avoid going to hell without them. They never had so much as an
          honorable thought of God. They always have esteemed earthly things
          before him. And notwithstanding all they have heard in the commands of
          God and Christ, they have always preferred a little worldly profit or
          sinful pleasure before them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Unconverted men are in a dreadful condition by reason of the
          dreadful wickedness which there is in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Sin is a thing of a dreadful nature, and that because it is
          against an infinitely great and an infinitely holy God. There is in
          the nature of man enmity against God, contempt of God, rebellion
          against God. Sin rises up as an enemy against the Most High. It is a
          dreadful thing for a creature to be an enemy to the Creator, or to
          have any such thing in his heart as enmity against him; as will be
          very clear, if we consider the difference between God and the
          creature, and how all creatures, compared with him, are as the small
          dust of the balance, are as nothing, less than nothing, and vanity.
          There is an infinite evil in sin. If we saw the hundredth part of the
          evil there is in sin, it would make us sensible that those who have
          any sin, let it be ever so small, are in a dreadful condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The hearts of natural men are exceedingly full of sin. If they had
          but one sin in their hearts, it would be sufficient to render their
          condition very dreadful. But they have not only one sin, but all
          manner of sin. There is every kind of lust. The heart is a mere sink
          of sin, a fountain of corruption, whence issue all manner of filthy
          streams. Mark 7:21, 22, “From within, out of the heart of men, proceed
          evil thoughts, adulteries, fornication’s, murders, thefts,
          covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye,
          blasphemy, pride, foolishness.” There is no one lust in the heart of
          the devil, that is not in the heart of man. Natural men are in the
          image of the devil. The image of God is rased out, and the image of
          the devil is stamped upon them. God is graciously pleased to restrain
          the wickedness of men, principally by fear and respect to their credit
          and reputation, and by education. And if it were not for such
          restraints as these, there is no kind of wickedness that men would not
          commit, whenever it came in their way. The commission of those things,
          at the mention of which men are now ready to start, and seem to be
          shocked when they hear them read, would be common and general; and
          earth would be a kind of hell. What would not natural men do if they
          were not afraid? Mat. 7:17, “But beware of men.” Men have not only
          every kind of lust, and wicked and perverse dispositions in their
          hearts, but they have them to a dreadful degree. There is not only
          pride, but an amazing degree of it: pride, whereby a man is disposed
          to set himself even above the throne of God itself. The hearts of
          natural men are mere sinks of sensuality. Man is become like a beast
          in placing his happiness in sensual enjoyments. The heart is full of
          the most loathsome lusts. The souls of natural men are more vile and
          abominable than any reptile. If God should open a window in the heart
          so that we might look into it, it would be the most loathsome
          spectacle that ever was set before our eyes. There is not only malice
          in the hearts of natural men, but a fountain of it. Men naturally
          therefore deserve the language applied to them by Christ, Mat. 3:7, “O
          generation of vipers;” and Mat. 23:33, “Ye serpents, ye generation of
          vipers.” Men, if it were not for fear and other such restraints, would
          not only commit all manner of sin, but to what degree, to what length
          would they not proceed! What has a natural man to keep him from openly
          blaspheming God, as much as any of the devils; yea, from dethroning
          him, if that were possible, and fear and other such restraints were
          out of the way? Yea, would it not be thus with many of those, who now
          appear with a fair face, and will speak most of God, and make many
          pretenses of worshipping and serving him? The exceeding wickedness of
          natural men appears abundantly in the sins they commit,
          notwithstanding all these restraints. Every natural man, if he
          reflects, may see enough to show him how exceedingly sinful he is. Sin
          flows from the heart as constantly as water flows from a fountain.
          Jer. 6:7, “As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out
          her wickedness.” And this wickedness, that so abounds in their hearts,
          has dominion over them. They are slaves to it. Rom. 7:14, “Sold under
          sin.” They are so under the power of sin, that they are driven on by
          their lusts in a course against their own conscience, and against
          their own interest. They are hurried on to their own ruin, and that at
          the same time their reason tells them, it will probably be their ruin.
          2 Pet. 2:14, “Cannot cease from sin.” On account of wicked men’s being
          so under the power of sin, the heart of man is said to be desperately
          wicked. Jer. 17:9 and Eph. 2:1, “Dead in trespasses and sins.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The hearts of natural men are dreadfully hard and incorrigible.
          There is nothing but the mighty power of God will move them. They will
          cleave to sin, and go on in sin, let what will be done with them. Pro.
          27:22, “Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with
          a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.” There is
          nothing that will awe our hearts; and there is nothing that will draw
          them to obedience: let there be mercies or afflictions, threatenings
          or gracious calls and invitations, frowning, or patience and
          long-suffering, or fatherly counsels and exhortations. Isa. 26:10,
          “Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
          righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and
          will not behold the majesty of the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. The relative state of those who are in an unconverted
          condition is dreadful. This will appear if we consider,
        </p>
        <p>1. Their relative state with respect to God; and that because,</p>
        <p>
          (1) They are without God in the world. They have no interest or part
          in God. He is not their God. He hath declared he will not be their God
          (Hos. 1:9). God and believers have a mutual covenant relation and
          right to each other. They are his people, and he is their God. But he
          is not the covenant God of those who are in an unconverted state.
          There is a great alienation and estrangement between God and the
          wicked. He is not their Father and portion. They have nothing to
          challenge of God, they have no right to any one of his attributes. The
          believer can challenge a right in the power of God, in his wisdom and
          holiness, his grace and love. All are made over to him, to be for his
          benefit. But the unconverted can claim no right in any of God’s
          perfections. They have no God to protect and defend them in this evil
          world: to defend them from sin, or from Satan, or any evil. They have
          no God to guide and direct them in any doubts or difficulties, to
          comfort and support their minds under afflictions. They are without
          God in all their affairs, in all the business they undertake, in their
          family affairs, and in their personal affairs, in their outward
          concerns, and in the concerns of their souls.

          How can a creature be more miserable than to be separated from the
          Creator and to have no God whom he can call his own God? He is
          wretched indeed, who goes up and down in the world, without a God to
          take care of him, to be his guide and protector, and to bless him in
          his affairs. The very light of nature teaches that a man’s God is his
          all. Jdg. 18:24, “Ye have taken away my gods, and what have I more?”
          There is but one God, and in him they have no right. They are without
          that God, whose will must determine their whole well being, both here
          and forever. That unconverted men are without God shows that they are
          liable to all manner of evil. They are liable to the power of the
          devil, to the power of all manner of temptation, for they are without
          God to protect them. They are liable to be deceived and seduced into
          erroneous opinions, and to embrace damnable doctrines. It is not
          possible to deceive the saints in this way. But the unconverted may be
          deceived. They may become papists, or heathens, or atheists. They have
          nothing to secure them from it. They are liable to be given up of God
          to judicial hardness of heart. They deserve it. And since God is not
          their God, they have no certainty that God will not inflict this awful
          judgment upon them. As they are without God in the world, they are
          liable to commit all manner of sin, and even the unpardonable sin
          itself. They cannot be sure they shall not commit that sin. They are
          liable to build up a false hope of heaven, and so to go hoping to
          hell. They are liable to die senseless and stupid, as many have died.
          They are liable to die in such a case as Saul and Judas did, fearless
          of hell. They have no security from it. They are liable to all manner
          of mischief, since they are without God. They cannot tell what shall
          befall them, nor when they are secure from anything. They are not safe
          one moment. Ten thousand fatal mischiefs may befall them, that may
          make them miserable for ever. They, who have God for their God, are
          safe from all such evils. It is not possible that they should befall
          them. God is their covenant God, and they have his faithful promise to
          be their refuge. But what mischief is there which may not befall
          natural men? Whatever hopes they may have may be disappointed.
          Whatever fair prospect there may seem to be of their conversion and
          salvation, it may vanish away. They may make great progress towards
          the kingdom of God, and yet come short at last. They may seem to be in
          a very hopeful way to be converted, and yet never be converted. A
          natural man is sure of nothing. He is sure of no good, nor is he sure
          of escaping any evil. It is therefore a dreadful condition that a
          natural man is in. They, who are in a natural state, are lost. They
          have wandered from God, and they are like lost sheep, that have
          wandered from their shepherd. They are poor helpless creatures in a
          howling wilderness, and have no shepherd to protect or to guide them.
          They are desolate, and exposed to innumerable fatal mischief’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) They are not only without God, but the wrath of God abides upon
          them. John 3:36, “He that believeth not the Son, shall not see life,
          but the wrath of God abideth on him.” There is no peace between God
          and them, but God is angry with them every day. He is not only angry
          with them, but that to a dreadful degree. There is a fire kindled in
          God’s anger; it burns like fire. Wrath abides upon them, which if it
          should be executed, would plunge them into the lowest hell, and make
          them miserable there to all eternity. They have provoked the Holy One
          of Israel to anger. God has been angry with them every since they
          began to sin. He has been provoked by them every day, every since they
          exercised any reason. And he is provoked by them more and more every
          hour. The flame of his wrath is continually burning. There are many
          now in hell that never provoked God more than they, nor so much as
          many of them. Wherever they go, they go about with the dreadful wrath
          of God abiding on them. They eat, and drink, and sleep under wrath.
          How dreadful a condition therefore are they in! It is the most awful
          thing for the creature to have the wrath of his Creator abiding on
          him. The wrath of God is a thing infinitely dreadful. The wrath of a
          king is as the roaring of a lion. But what is the wrath of a king, who
          is but a worm of the dust, to the wrath of the infinitely great and
          dreadful God? How dreadful is it to be under the wrath of the First
          Being, the Being of beings, the great Creator and mighty possessor of
          heaven and earth! How dreadful is it for a person to go about under
          the wrath of God, who gave him being, and in who he lives and moves,
          who is everywhere present, and without whom he cannot move a step, nor
          draw a breath! Natural men, inasmuch as they are under wrath, are
          under a curse. God’s wrath and curse are continually upon them. They
          can have no reasonable comfort, therefore, in any of their enjoyments;
          for they do not know but that they are given them in wrath, and shall
          be curses to them, and not blessings. As it is said in Job 18:15,
          “Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.” How can they take
          any comfort in their food, or in their possessions, when they do not
          know but all are given them to fit them for the slaughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Their relative state will appear dreadful, if we consider how they
          stand related to the devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) They who are in a natural state are the children of the devil. As
          the saints are the children of God, so the ungodly are the children of
          the devil. 1 John 3:10, “In this the children of God are manifest, and
          the children of the devil.” Mat 13:38, 39, “The field is the world;
          the good seed are the children of the kingdom: but the tares are the
          children of wicked one. The enemy that sowed them is the devil.” John
          8:44, “Ye are of your father, the devil, and the lusts of your father
          ye will do.” They are, as it were, begotten of the devil. They proceed
          from him. 1 John 3:8, “He that committeth sin, is of the devil.” As
          Adam begat a son in his own likeness, so are wicked men in the
          likeness and image of the devil. They acknowledge this relation, and
          own themselves children of the devil, by consenting that he should be
          their father. They subject themselves to him, hearken to this
          counsels, as children hearken to the counsels of a father. They learn
          of him to imitate him, and do as he does, as children learn to imitate
          their parents. John 8:38, “I speak that which I have seen with my
          Father, and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.” How awful
          a state is this! How dreadful is it to be a child of the devil, the
          spirit of darkness, the prince of hell, that wicked, malignant, and
          cruel spirit! To have anything to do with him is very dreadful. It
          would be accounted a dreadful, frightful thing only to meet the devil,
          to have him appear to a person in a visible shape. How dreadful then
          must it be to be his child; how dreadful for any person to have the
          devil for his father!
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) They are the devil’s captives and servants. Man before his fall
          was in a state of liberty; but now he has fallen into Satan’s hands.
          The devil has got the victory and carried him captive. Natural men are
          in Satan’s possession and they are under his dominion. They are
          brought by him into subjection to his will, to go at his bidding, and
          do what he commands. 2 Tim. 2:26, “Taken captive by him at his will.”
          The devil rules over ungodly men. They are all his slaves, and do his
          drudging. This argues their state to be dreadful. Men account it an
          unhappy state of life to be slaves; and especially to be slaves to a
          bad master, to one who is very hard, unreasonable, and cruel. How
          miserable do we look upon those persons, who are taken captive by the
          Turks, or other such barbarous nations, and put by them to the meanest
          and most cruel slavery, and treated no better than they treat their
          cattle! But what is this to being taken captive by the devil, the
          prince of hell, and made a slave to him? Had not a man better be a
          slave to anyone on earth than to the devil? The devil is, of all
          masters, the most cruel, and treats his servants the worst. He puts
          them to the vilest service, to that which is the most dishonorable of
          any in the world. No work is so dishonorable as the practice of sin.
          The devil puts his servants to such work as debases them below the
          dignity of human nature. They must make themselves like beasts to do
          that work to serve their filthy lusts. And besides the meanness of the
          work, it is a very hard service. The devil causes them to serve him at
          the expense of the peace of their own conscience, and oftentimes at
          the expense of their reputation, at the expense of their estates, and
          shortening of their days. The devil is a cruel master; for the service
          upon which he puts his slaves is to undo themselves. He keeps them
          hard at work day and night, to work their own ruin. He never intends
          to give them any reward for their pains, but their pains are to work
          out their own everlasting destruction. It is to gather fuel and kindle
          the fire for themselves to be tormented in to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The soul of a natural man is the habitation of the devil. The
          devil is not only their father and rules over them, but he dwells in
          them. It is a dreadful thing for a man to have the devil near him,
          often coming to him. But it is a more dreadful thing to have him dwell
          with a man, to take up his constant abode with him; and more dreadful
          yet to have him dwell in him, to take up his abode in his heart. But
          thus it is with every natural man. He takes up his abode in his heart.
          As the soul of a godly man is the habitation of the Spirit of God, so
          is the soul of a wicked man the habitation of unclean spirits. As the
          soul of a godly man is the temple of God, so the soul of a wicked man
          is the synagogue of Satan. A wicked man’s soul is in Scripture called
          Satan’s house, and Satan’s palace. Mat. 12:29, “How can one enter into
          a strong man’ s house?” meaning the devil. And Luke 11:21, “When a
          strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace.” Satan
          not only lives, but reigns, in the heart of a wicked man. He has not
          only taken up his abode there, but he has set up his throne there. The
          heart of a wicked man, is the place of the devil’s rendezvous. The
          doors of a wicked man’s heart are open to devils. They have free
          access there, though they are shut against God and Jesus Christ. There
          are many devils, no doubt, that have to do with one wicked man, and
          his heart is the place where they meet. The soul of a wicked man is,
          as it was said of Babylon, the habitation of devils, and the hold of
          every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. Thus
          dreadful is the condition of a natural man by reason of the relation
          in which he stands to the devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The state of unconverted men is very dreadful, if we consider its
          relation to the future world. Our state here is not lasting, but
          transitory. We are pilgrims and strangers here, and are principally
          designed for a future world. We continue in this present state but a
          short time; but we are to be in that future state to all eternity. And
          therefore men are to be denominated either happy or miserable, chiefly
          with regard to that future state. It matters but little comparatively
          what our state is here, but it will continue but a short time; it is
          nothing to eternity. But that man is a happy man who is entitled to
          happiness, and he is miserable who is in danger of misery, in his
          eternal state. Prosperity or adversity in the present state alters
          them but very little because this state is of so short continuance.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, those who are in a natural condition, have no title to any
          inheritance in another world. There are glorious things in another
          world. There are unsearchable riches, an unspeakable and inconceivable
          abundance; but they have nothing to do with it. Heaven is a world of
          glory and blessedness. But they have no right to the least portion of
          those blessings. If they should die and go out of the world as they
          are, they would go destitute, having no inheritance, no friend, no
          enjoyments to go to. They will have no God to whom they may go, no
          Redeemer to receive their departing souls, no angel to be a
          ministering spirit to them, to take care of them, to guard or defend
          them, no interest in that Redeemer, who has purchased those blessings.
          What is said of the Ephesians is true of those who are in a natural
          condition. “At that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the
          commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of promise,
          having no hope, and without God in the world.” What a dreadful case
          they are in, who live in the world having no hope, without any title
          to any benefits hereafter, and without any ground to hope for any good
          in their future and eternal state!
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, natural men are in a dreadful condition because of the misery
          to which they are exposed in the future world. This will be obvious,
          if we consider,
        </p>
        <p>1. How great the misery is of which they are in danger;</p>
        <p>2. How great is their danger of this misery.</p>
        <p>
          1. How great the misery is of which they are in danger. It is great in
          two respects: (1) The torment and misery are great in themselves. And
          (2) They are of endless duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The torment and misery, of which natural men are in danger, are
          exceedingly great in themselves. They are great beyond any of our
          words or thoughts. When we speak of them, our words are swallowed up.
          We say they are great, and exceedingly great, and very dreadful. But
          when we have used all the words we can to express them, how faint is
          the idea that is raised in our minds in comparison with the reality!
          This misery will appear very dreadful if we consider what calamities
          meet together in it. In it the wicked are deprived of all good,
          separated from God and all fruits of his mercy. In this world they
          enjoy many of the streams of God’s goodness. But in the future world
          they will have no more smiles of God, no more manifestations of his
          mercy by benefits, by warnings, by calls and invitations. He will
          never more manifest his mercy by the exercise of patience and
          long-suffering, by waiting to be gracious. No more use any forbearance
          with them for their good. No more exercise his mercy by strivings of
          his Spirit, by sending messengers and using means. They will have no
          more testimonies of the fruits of God’s goodness in enjoying food and
          raiment, and comfortable dwellings and convenient accommodations, nor
          any of the comforts of this life. No more manifestations of his mercy
          by suffering them to draw near to him with their prayers, to pray for
          what they need. God will exercise no pity towards them, no regard for
          their welfare. Cut off from all the comforts of this life, shut out of
          heaven, they will see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of
          heaven. But they shall be turned away from God and from all good into
          the blackness of darkness, into the pit of hell, into that great
          receptacle, which God has provided on purpose to cast into it the
          filthy, and polluted, and abominable of the universe. They will be in
          a most dreadful condition. They will have no friends. God will be
          their enemy, angels and the spirits of the just will be their enemies,
          devils and damned spirits will be their enemies. They will be hated
          with perfect hatred, will have none to pity them, none to bemoan their
          case, or to be any comfort to them. It appears that the state of the
          damned will be exceedingly dreadful in that they will suffer the wrath
          of God, executed to the full upon them, poured out without mixture.
          They shall bear the wrath of the Almighty. They shall know how
          dreadful the wrath of an Almighty God is. Now none knows, none can
          conceive. Psa. 90:11, “Who knoweth the power of thine anger?” Then
          they shall feel the weight of God’s wrath. In this world they have the
          wrath of God abiding on them, but then it will be executed upon them.
          Now they are the objects of it, but then they will be the subjects of
          it. Now it hangs over them, but then it shall fall upon them in its
          full weight without alleviation, or any moderation or restraint. Their
          souls and their bodies shall then be filled full with the wrath of
          God. Wicked men shall be as full of wrath as anything that glows in
          the midst of a furnace is of fire. The wrath of God is infinitely more
          dreadful than fire. Fire, yea the fiercest fire, is but an image and
          shadow of it. The vessels of wrath shall be filled up with wrath to
          the brim. Yes, they shall be plunged into a sea of wrath. And
          therefore hell is compared to a lake of fire and brimstone, because
          there wicked men are overwhelmed and swelled up in wrath, as men who
          are cast into a lake or sea, are swallowed up in water. O who can
          conceive of the dreadfulness of the wrath of an Almighty God!
          Everything in God is answerable to his infinite greatness. When God
          shows mercy, he shows mercy like a God. His love is infinitely
          desirable because it is the love of God. And so when he executes wrath
          it is like a God. This God will pour out without mixture. Rev. 14:10,
          “The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured
          out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be
          tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels,
          and in the presence of the Lamb.” No mixture of mercy or pity; nothing
          thrown into the cup of wrath to assuage or moderate it. “God shall
          cast upon him and not spare.” (Job 27:22) They shall be cast into the
          wine-press of the wrath of God, where they shall be pressed down with
          wrath, as grapes are pressed in a wine-press. Rev. 14:19, “Cast into
          the great wine-press of the wrath of God.” God will then make appear
          in their misery how terrible his wrath is, that men and angels may
          know how much more dreadful the wrath of God is, than the wrath of
          kings, or any creatures. They shall know what God can do towards his
          enemies, and how fearful a thing it is to provoke him to anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a few drops of wrath do sometimes so distress the minds of men in
          this world, so as to be more dreadful than fire, or any bodily
          torment, how dreadful will be a deluge of wrath. How dreadful will it
          be, when all God’s mighty waves and billows of wrath pass over them!
          Every faculty of the soul shall be filled with wrath, and every part
          of the body shall be filled with fire. After the resurrection the body
          shall be cast into that great furnace, which shall be so great as to
          burn up the whole world. These lower heavens, this air and this earth,
          shall all become one great furnace, a furnace that shall burn the
          earth, even to its very center. In this furnace shall the bodies of
          the wicked lie to all eternity, and yet live, and have their sense of
          pain and torment not all diminished. O, how full will the heart, the
          vitals, the brain, the eyes, the tongue, the hands, and the feet be of
          fire; of this fire of such an inconceivable fierceness! How full will
          every member, and every bone, and every vein, and every sinew, be of
          this fire! Surely it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
          living God. Who can bear such wrath? A little of it is enough to
          destroy us. Psa. 2:12, “Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish
          from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.” But how will
          men be overwhelmed, how will they sink, when God’s wrath is executed
          in so dreadful a degree! The misery which the damned will endure, will
          be their perfect destruction. Psa. 50:22, “Now consider this, ye that
          forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In several places the wicked are compared to the stubble, and to
          briers and thorns before devouring flames, and to the fat of lambs,
          which consumes into smoke. Psa. 37:20, “But the wicked shall perish,
          and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs; they shall
          consume; into smoke shall they consume away.” They shall be as it were
          ground to powder under the weight of God’s wrath. Mat. 21:24. Their
          misery shall be perfect misery; and because damnation is the perfect
          destruction of a creature, therefore it is called death. It is eternal
          death, of which temporal death, with all its awful circumstances, is
          but a faint shadow of the state of the soul under the second death.
          How dreadful the state of the damned is, we may argue from the desert
          of sin. One sin deserves eternal death and damnation, which, in the
          least degree of it, is the total destruction of the creature. How
          dreadful, then, is the misery of which natural persons are in danger,
          who have lived some time in the world, and have committed thousands
          and thousands of sins, and have filled up many years with a course of
          sinning, and have committed many great sins, with high aggravations,
          who have sinned against the glorious gospel of Christ, and against
          great light, whose guilt if far more dreadful than that of the people
          of Sodom and Gomorrah! How dreadful is the punishment to which they
          are exposed, in which all their sins shall be punished according to
          their desert, and the uttermost farthing shall be exacted of them! The
          punishment of one idle word, or sinful thought, would be more than
          they could bear. How then will they bear all the wrath that shall be
          heaped upon them for all their multiplied and aggravated
          transgressions? If one sin deserves eternal death and damnation, how
          many deaths and damnations will they have accumulated upon them at
          once! Such an aggravated, multiplied death must they die every moment,
          and always continue dying such a death, and yet never be dead. Such
          misery as this may well be called the blackness of darkness. Hell may
          well be called the bottomless pit, if the misery is so unfathomably
          great. Men sometimes have suffered extreme torment in this world.
          Dreadful have been the sufferings of some of the martyrs. But how
          little those are, in comparison of the sufferings of the damned, we
          may learn from 1 Pet. 4:16, 17, 18, “Yet if any man suffer as a
          Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this
          behalf. For the time is come, that judgment must begin at the house of
          God. And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of those that
          obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved,
          where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?” The apostle is here
          speaking of the sufferings of Christians. And from thence he argues,
          that seeing their sufferings are so great, how unspeakably great will
          be the sufferings of the wicked! And if judgment begins with them,
          what shall be the end of those who obey not the gospel! As much as to
          say, the sufferings of the righteous are nothing to what those, who
          obey not the gospel, are. How dreadful, therefore, does this argue
          their misery to be! Well may the sinners in Zion be afraid, and
          fearful, and surprised. Well may the kings of the earth, and the great
          men, and rich men, and chief captains, and every bond man, and every
          free man, hide themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the
          mountains, at Christ’s second coming; and cry and say to the mountains
          and rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth
          on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of
          his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?” Well may there be
          weeping and gnashing of teeth in hell, where there is such misery.
          Thus the misery of those who are in a natural condition, is, in
          itself, exceedingly great.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) It is of endless duration. The misery is not only amazingly great,
          and extreme, but of long continuance; yea, of infinitely long
          continuance. It never will have any end. There will be no deliverance,
          no rest, no hope. But they will last throughout all eternity. Eternity
          is a thing in the thought of which our minds are swallowed up. As it
          is infinite in itself, so it is infinitely beyond the comprehension of
          our minds. The more we think of it, the more amazing will it seem to
          us. Eternity is a duration, to which a long period of time bears no
          greater proportion than a short period. A thousand years, or a
          thousand ages, bear no greater proportion to eternity than a minute;
          or which is the same thing, a thousand ages are as much less than
          eternity as a minute. A minute comes as near an equality to it; or you
          may take as many thousand ages out of eternity, as you can minutes. If
          a man by the utmost skill in arithmetic, should denote or enumerate a
          great number of ages, and should rise by multiplication to ever so
          prodigious numbers, should make as great figures as he could, and rise
          in multiplying as fast as he could, and should spend his life in
          multiplying; the product of all would be no nearer equal to the
          duration which the wicked must spend in the misery of hell, than one
          minute. Eternity is that, which cannot be made less by subtraction. If
          we take from eternity a thousand years or ages, the remainder is not
          the less for it. Eternity is that which will for ever be but
          beginning, and that because all the time which is past, let it be ever
          so long, is but a point to what remains. The wicked, after they have
          suffered millions of ages, will be, as it were, but in the first
          point, only setting out in their sufferings. It will be no comfort to
          them that so much is gone, for they will have none the less to bear.
          There will never a time come, when, if what is past is compared to
          what is to come, it will not be as a point, and as nothing. The
          continuance of their torment cannot be measured out by revolutions of
          the sun, or moon, or stars, by centuries or ages. They shall continue
          suffering after these heavens and this earth shall wax old as a
          garment, till the whole visible universe is dissolved. Yea, they shall
          remain in their misery through millions of such ages as are equal to
          the age of the sun, and moon, and stars, and still it will be all one,
          as to what remains, still no nearer the end of their misery. Mat.
          25:41, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for
          the devil and his angels.” Mark 9:44, “Where their worm dieth not, and
          the fire is not quenched.” Rev. 20:10, “They shall be tormented day
          and night for ever and ever.” And 14:11, “The smoke of their torment
          ascendeth up for ever and ever.” The damned in hell in their misery
          will be in absolute despair. They shall know that their misery will
          have no end, and therefore they will have no hopes of it. O, who can
          conceive the dreadfulness of such despair as this in the midst of such
          torment! Who can express, or think anything how dreadful the thought
          of eternity is to them, who are under so great torment! To what
          unfathomable depths of woe will it sink them! With what a gloom and
          blackness of darkness will it fill them! What a boundless gulf of
          sorrow and woe is the thought of eternity to the damned, who shall be
          in absolute and utter despair of any deliverance!
        </p>
        <p>
          How dreadful, then, is the condition of those who are in a natural
          state, who are in danger of such misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The dreadfulness of their condition will appear by considering how
          great their danger is of this misery. This will be obvious from the
          following things:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Their danger is such, that continuing in their present state, they
          will unavoidably sink into this misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the state in which natural persons now are, naturally tends to
          it. And this, because they are separate from God, and destitute of any
          spiritual good. The soul that is in a state of separation from its
          Creator, must be miserable because he is separate from the fountain of
          all good. He that is separate from God, is in great danger of ruin
          because he is without any defense. He that is separate from God, must
          perish, if he continue so, because it is from God only that he can
          have those supplies which can make him happy. It is with the soul as
          it is with the body. The body without supplies of sustenance will
          miserably famish and die. So the souls of natural men are in a
          famishing condition. They are separate from God, and therefore are
          destitute of any spiritual good, which can nourish the soul, or keep
          it alive; like one that is remote in a wilderness, where he has
          nothing to eat or drink, and therefore, if he continue so, will
          unavoidably die. So the state of natural men naturally tends to that
          dreadful misery of the damned in hell, because they are separate from
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, they are under the power of a mortal disease, which if it not
          healed, will surely bring them to this death. They are under the power
          and dominion of sin, and sin is a mortal disease of the soul. If it is
          not cured, it will certainly bring them to death; viz. To that second
          death of which we have heard. The infection of the disease has
          powerfully seized their vital parts. The whole head is sick, the whole
          heart faint. The disease is inveterate. The infection is spread
          throughout the whole frame. The very nature is corrupted and ruined;
          and the whole must come to ruin, if God by his mighty power does not
          heal the disease. The soul is under a mortal wound; a would deep and
          dreadfully confirmed. Its roots reach the most vital parts; yea, they
          are principally seated there. There is a plague upon the heart, which
          corrupts and destroys the source of life, ruins the whole frame of
          nature, and hastens an inevitable death. There is a most deadly
          poison, which has been infused into, and spread over, the man. He has
          been bitten by a fiery serpent, whose bite issues in a most tormenting
          death. Sin is that, which does as naturally tend to the misery and
          ruin of the soul, as the most mortal poison tends to the death of the
          body. We look upon persons far gone in a consumption, or with an
          incurable cancer, or some malady, as in doleful circumstances. But
          that mortal disease, under whose power natural men are, makes their
          case a thousand times more doleful. That mortal disease of natural men
          does, as it were, ripen them for damnation. We read of the clusters of
          the vine of the earth being for the wine-press of the wrath of God,
          Rev. 14:18, where by the clusters of the vine are meant wicked men.
          The wickedness of natural men tends to sink them down to hell, as the
          weight of a stone causes it to tend toward the center of the earth.
          Natural men have, as it were, the seeds of hell within their own
          hearts. Those principles of sin and corruption, which are in them, if
          they remain unmortified, will at length breed the torment of hell in
          them, and that necessarily, and of their own tendency. The soul that
          remains under the power of sin will at length take fire of itself.
          Hell will kindle in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) If they continue in their present state, this misery appears to be
          unavoidable, if we consider the justice and truth of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, if they continue in their present condition, so surely as God
          is just, they shall suffer the eternal misery of which we have heard.
          The honor of God’s justice requires it, and God will not disparage his
          own justice. He will not deny his own honor and glory, but will
          glorify himself on the wicked as well as the godly. He will not lose
          his honor of any one of his creatures which he has made.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is impossible that God should be frustrated or disappointed. And so
          surely as God will not be frustrated, so surely shall they who
          continue in a natural condition, suffer that eternal misery, of which
          we have heard. The avenging justice of God is one of the perfections
          of his nature. And he will glorify all his perfections. God is
          unalterable in this as well as his other perfections. His justice
          shall and must be satisfied. He has declared that he will by no means
          clear the guilty, Exo. 34:7. And that he will not justify the wicked,
          Exo. 23:7. And that he will not at all acquit the wicked, Nah. 1:3.
          God is a strictly just Judge. When men come to stand before him, he
          will surely judge them according to their works. They that have guilt
          lying upon them, he will surely judge according to their guilt. The
          debt they owe to justice must be paid to the uttermost farthing. It is
          impossible that anyone, who dies in his sins, should escape
          everlasting condemnation and punishment before such a Judge. He will
          render to every man according to his deeds. Rom. 2:8, “Unto them that
          are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,
          indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man
          that doeth evil.” It is impossible to influence God to be otherwise
          than just in judging ungodly men. There is no bribing him. He
          accepteth not the person of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than
          the poor. Deu. 10:17, “He regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.”
          It is impossible to influence him to be otherwise than strictly just,
          by any supplications, or tears, or cries. God is inexorably just. The
          cries and the moans of the malefactor will have no influence upon this
          Judge to pass a more favorable judgment on them, so as in any way to
          acquit or release them. The eternal cries, and groans, and
          lamentations of the wicked will have no influence upon him. Though
          they are ever so long continued, they will not prevail upon God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, so surely as God is true, if they die in the state they are
          now in, they shall suffer that eternal misery. God has threatened it
          in a positive and absolute manner. The threatenings of the law are
          absolute. And they, who are in a natural state, are under the
          condemnation of the law. The threatening of the law takes hold upon
          them. And if they continue under guilt, God is obliged by his word to
          punish them according to that threatening. And he has often, in the
          most positive and absolute manner, declared that the wicked shall be
          cast into hell; that they who believe not shall be damned; that they
          shall have their portion in the lake that burns with fire and
          brimstone; and that their misery shall never have an end. And
          therefore, if there be any truth in God, it shall surely be so. It is
          as impossible that he who dies in a natural condition, should escape
          suffering that eternal misery, as that God should lie. The Word of God
          is stronger and firmer than mountains of brass, and shall not fail. We
          shall sooner see heaven and earth pass away, than one jot or tittle of
          all that God hath said in his Word not be fulfilled. So much for the
          first thing, that evinces the greatness of the danger that natural men
          are in of hell; viz. that they will unavoidably sink into hell, if
          they continue in such a condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Their danger will appear very dreadful, if we consider how
          uncertain it is, whether they will ever get out of this condition. It
          is very uncertain whether they will ever be converted. If they should
          die in their present condition, their misery is certain and
          inevitable. But it is very doubtful whether they will not die in such
          a condition, their misery is certain and inevitable. But it is very
          doubtful whether they will not die in such a condition. There is great
          danger that they will; great danger of their never being converted.
          And this will appear, if we consider two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, they have nothing on which to depend for conversion. They have
          nothing in the world, by which to persuade themselves that they shall
          ever be converted. Left to themselves, they never will repent and turn
          to God. If they are ever converted, therefore, it is God who must do
          it. But they have no promise of God, that they ever shall be
          converted. They do not know how soon they may die. God has not
          promised them long life; and he has not promised them that they shall
          be ready for death before they die. It is but a peradventure, whether
          God will ever give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.
          2 Tim. 2:25. Their resolutions are not to be depended on. If they have
          convictions, they are not to be depended on; they may lose those
          convictions. Their conversion depends on innumerable uncertainties. It
          is very uncertain, then, whether they will be converted before they
          die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, another thing which shows the danger there is that they shall
          never be converted, is, that there are but few, comparatively, who are
          ever converted. But few of those, who have been natural persons in
          time past, have been converted. Most of them have died unconverted. So
          it has been in all ages, and hence we have reason to think that but
          few of them, who are uncovered now, will ever be converted; that most
          of them will die unconverted, and will go to hell. Natural persons are
          ready to flatter themselves, that they shall be converted. They think
          there are signs of it. But a man would not run the venture of so much
          as a sixpence in such an uncertainty as they are, about their ever
          being converted, or not going to hell. This shows the doleful
          condition of natural men, as it is uncertain whether they shall ever
          be converted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, they who are in a natural condition are in danger of going to
          hell every day. Those now present, who are in a natural condition, are
          in danger of dropping into hell before tomorrow morning. They have
          nothing to depend on, to keep them out of hell one day, or one night.
          We know not what a day may bring forth. God has not promised to spare
          them one day; and he is every day angry with them. The black clouds,
          that are full of the thunder of God’s wrath, hang over their heads
          every day, and they know not how soon the thunder will break forth
          upon their heads. Natural men are in Scripture compared to those that
          walk in slippery places. They know not when their feet will slip. They
          are continually in danger. Psa. 73:18, “Surely thou didst set them in
          slippery places; thou castedst them down into destruction. How are
          they brought into desolation as in a moment.” Natural men hang over
          the pit of hell, as it were, by a thread, that has a moth continually
          gnawing it. They know not when it will snap in twain, and let them
          drop. They are in the utmost uncertainty. They are not secure one
          moment. A natural man never goes to sleep, but that he is in danger of
          waking in hell. Experience abundantly teaches the matter to be so. It
          shows, by millions of instances, that man is not certain of life one
          day. And how common a thing is it for death to come suddenly and
          unexpectedly! And thousands, beyond all reasonable question, are going
          to hell every day, and death comes upon them unexpectedly. “When they
          shall say, peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them,
          as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” It is
          a dreadful condition that natural persons are in upon this account.
          And no wise person would be in their condition for a quarter of an
          hour for the whole world, because such is the danger that they will
          drop into hell before that quarter of an hour is expired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have shown how dreadful the condition of natural men is,
          relatively considered. I shall mention two or three things more, which
          yet further make it appear how doleful their condition is.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The longer it continues, the worse it grows. This is an awful
          circumstance in the condition of a natural man. Any disease is looked
          upon as the more dreadful, for its growing and increasing nature. Thus
          a cancer and gangrene are regarded as dreadful calamities, because
          they continually grow and spread. And the faster they grow, the more
          dreadful are they accounted. It would be dreadful to be in a natural
          condition, if a person could continue as he is, and his condition grow
          no worse; if he could live in a natural condition, and never have it
          any more dreadful, than when he first begins to sin. But it is yet
          much more dreadful, when we consider that it every day becomes worse
          and worse. The condition of natural men is worse today than it was
          yesterday, and that on several accounts. The heart grows more and more
          polluted and hardened. The longer sin continues unmortified, the more
          is it strengthened and rooted. Their guilt also grows greater, and
          hell every day grows hotter; for they are every day adding sin to sin,
          and so their iniquity is increasing over their heads more and more.
          Every new sin adds to the guilt. Every sin deserves eternal death for
          its punishment. And therefore in every sin that a man commits, there
          is so much added to the punishment, to which he lies exposed. There
          is, as it were, another eternal death added to augment his damnation.
          And how much is added to the account in God’s book every day. How many
          new sins are set down, that all may be answered for; each one of which
          sins must be punished, that by itself would be an eternal death! How
          fast do wicked men heap up guilt, and treasure up wrath, so long as
          they continue in a natural condition! How is God more and more
          provoked, his wrath more and more incensed; and how does hell-fire
          continually grow hotter and hotter! If a man has lived twenty years in
          a natural condition, the fire has been increased every day since he
          has lived. It has been, as it were, blown up to a greater and greater
          degree of fierceness. Yea, how dreadfully does one day’s continuance
          in sin add to the heat of hell-fire!

          2. All blessings are turned into curses to those who live and die in
          such a condition. Those things which are most pleasant and
          comfortable, and which men esteem the blessings of life, are but
          curses unto such; as their meat, and their drink, and their raiment.
          There is a curse goes with every mouthful of meat, and every drop of
          drink, to such a person. There is a curse with his raiment which he
          puts on. It all contributes to his misery. Though it may please him,
          yet it does him no good, but he is the more miserable for it. If he
          has any enjoyment which is sweet and pleasant to him, the pleasure is
          a curse to him. He is really the more miserable for it. It is an
          occasion of death to him. His possessions, which he values himself
          upon, and sets his heart upon, are turned into a curse to him. His
          house has the curse of God upon it, and his table is a snare and a
          trap to him. Psa. 69:22. His bed has God’s curse upon it. When he lies
          down to sleep, a curse attends his rest; and when he goes forth to
          labor, he is followed with a curse on that. The curse of God is upon
          his fields, on his corn, and herds, and all he has. If he has friends
          and relations, who are pleasant and dear to him, they are no blessings
          to him. He receives no comfort by them, but they prove a curse to him.
          I say it is thus with those who live and die in a natural condition.
          Deu. 28:16, etc., “Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt
          thou be in the field. Cursed shall be thy basket, and thy store.
          Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, and
          the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep. Cursed shalt
          thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest
          out. The Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in
          all that thou settest thing hand unto for to do, until thou be
          destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of
          thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.” Man’s faculties of reason
          and understanding, and all his natural powers, are turned into a
          curse. Yea, spiritual mercies and privileges shall also be turned into
          a curse to those who live and die in a natural condition. A curse goes
          with the worship of God, and with sabbaths and sacraments, with
          instruction, and counsels, and warnings, and with the most precious
          advantages. They are all turned into a curse. They are a savior of
          death unto death. They do but harden the heart, and aggravate the
          guilt and misery, and inflame the divine wrath. Isaiah 6:9, 10. “Go,
          make the heart of this people fat.” 2 Cor. 2:16, “To the one we are
          the savour of death unto death.” It will only be an occasion of their
          misery, that God ever sent Christ into the world to save sinners. That
          which is in itself so glorious a manifestation of God’s mercy, so
          unspeakable a gift, that which is an infinite blessing to others who
          receive Christ, will be a curse unto them. 1 Pet. 2:8, “A stone of
          stumbling, and a rock of offense.” The blood of Christ, which is the
          price of eternal life and glory to some, is an occasion of sinking
          them vastly the lower into eternal burnings. And that is the case of
          such persons. The more precious any mercies are in themselves, the
          more of a curse are they to them. The better the things are in
          themselves, the more will they contribute to their misery. And
          spiritual privileges, which are in themselves greater mercies than any
          outward enjoyments, will above all other things prove a curse to them.
          Nothing will enhance their condemnation so much as these. On account
          of these, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day
          of judgment, than for them. Yea, so doleful is the condition of
          natural men, that if they live and die in that condition, not only the
          enjoyments of life, but life itself, will be a curse to them. The
          longer they live, the more miserable will they be; the sooner they
          die, the better. If they live long in such a condition, and die in it
          at last, it would have been better for them if they had died before.
          It would have been far better for them to have spent the time in hell,
          than on earth. Yea, better for them to have spent ten thousand years
          in hell, instead of one on earth. When they look back, and consider
          what enjoyments they have had, they will wish they had never had them.
          Though when on earth they set their hearts on their earthly
          enjoyments, they will hereafter wish they had been without them; for
          they will see they have only fitted them for the slaughter. They will
          wish they never had had their houses and lands, their garments, their
          earthly friends, and their earthly possessions. And so they will wish
          that they had never enjoyed the light of the gospel, that they had
          been born among the heathen in some of the most dark and barbarous
          places of the earth. They will wish that Christ had never come into
          the world to die for sinners, so as to give men any opportunity to be
          saved. They will wish that God had cast off fallen man, as he did the
          fallen angels, and had never made him the offer of a Savior. They will
          wish that they had died sooner, and had not had so much opportunity to
          increase their guilt and their misery. They will wish they had died in
          their childhood, and been sent to hell then. They will curse the day
          that ever they were born, and wish they had been made vipers and
          scorpions, or anything, rather than rational creatures.

          3. They have no security from the most dismal horrors of mind in this
          life. They have no security, but their stupidity. A natural man can
          have no comfort or peace in a natural condition, but that of which
          blindness and senselessness are the foundation. And from what has been
          said, that is the very evil. A natural man can have no comfort in
          anything in this world any further, than thought and consideration of
          mind are kept down in him. As you make a condemned malefactor
          senseless of his misery by putting him to sleep with opium, or make
          him merry just before his execution by giving him something to deprive
          him of the use of reason, so that he shall not be sensible of his own
          circumstances. Otherwise, there is no peace or comfort, which a
          natural man can have in a natural condition. Isa. 57:21, “There is no
          peace, saith my God, to the wicked.” Job 15:20, “The wicked man
          travaileth with pain all his days. A dreadful sound is in his ears.”
          The doleful state of a natural man appears especially from the horror
          and amazement to which he is liable on a death-bed. To have the heavy
          hand of God upon one in some dangerous sickness, which is wasting and
          consuming the body, and likely to destroy it, and to have a prospect
          of approaching death, and of soon going into eternity, there to be in
          such a condition as this: to what amazing apprehensions must the
          sinner be liable! How dismal must his state be, when the disease
          prevails, so that there is no hope that he shall recover, when the
          physician begins to give him over, and friends to despair of his life;
          when death seems to hasten on, and he is at the same time perfectly
          blind to any spiritual object, altogether ignorant of God, of Christ,
          and of the way of salvation, having never exercised one act of love to
          God in his life, or done one thing for his glory; having then every
          lust and corruption in its full strength; having then such enmity in
          the heart against God, as to be ready to dethrone him, if that were
          possible; having no right in God, or interest in Christ; having the
          terrible wrath of God abiding on him; being yet the child of the
          devil, entirely in his possession and under his power; with no hope to
          maintain him, and with the full view of never-ending misery just at
          the door. What a dismal case must a natural man be in under such
          circumstances! How will his heart die within him at the news of his
          approaching death, when he finds that he must go, that he cannot
          deliver himself, that death stands with his grim countenance looking
          him in the face, and is just about to seize him, and carry him out of
          the world. And that he at the same time has nothing to depend on! How
          often are there instances of dismal distress of unconverted persons on
          a deathbed! No one knows the fears, the exercise and torment in their
          hearts, but they who feel them. They are such that all the pleasures
          of sin, which they have had in their whole lives, will not pay them
          for. As you may sometimes see godly men go triumphing out of the world
          full of joy, with the foretastes of heaven, so sometimes wicked men,
          when dying, anticipate something of hell before they arrive there. The
          flames of hell do, as it were, come up and reach them, in some
          measure, before they are dead. God then withdraws, and ceases to
          protect them. The tormentor begins his work while they are alive. Thus
          it was with Saul and Judas; and there have been many other similar
          instances since; and none, who are in a natural condition, have any
          security from it. The state of a natural man is doleful on this
          account, though this is but a prelude and foretaste of the everlasting
          misery which follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have, in some measure, shown in what a doleful condition those
          are who are in a natural condition. Still I have said but little. It
          is beyond what we can speak or think. They who say most of the
          dreadfulness of a natural condition, say but little. And they who are
          most sensible, are sensible of but a small part of the misery of a
          natural state.
