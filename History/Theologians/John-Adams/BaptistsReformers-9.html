          "Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized. . . And the
          Lord added to the church, daily, such as should be saved." Acts
          2:41,47
        </p>
        <p>
          All professed Christians, who admit that the Scriptures contain a
          model for church organization, strenuously maintain that the
          denomination with which they are connected, is formed after the
          Scriptural pattern. This is true alike of Episcopalians,
          Presbyterians, Methodists, and all others. But
          <i
            >it is abundantly evident, that while these denominations are so
            very dissimilar, they cannot all resemble one Scriptural model</i
          >. It is further evident, that some who make pretensions to be "THE
          CHURCH," are not satisfied to rest their claim to that title, simply
          on a comparison of their organization with the New Testament pattern
          of a Gospel church, but very gladly seek to bring in evidence from
          other quarters, by which they hope to support their cause.
        </p>
        <i> </i>
        <p>
          <i>The Fathers, Tradition, Expediency</i>, are all pressed into their
          service, to supply the lack of evidence afforded in Scripture; or, as
          is sometimes the case, to nullify and render powerless its direct
          testimony against them. All this I say, is done by those who profess
          to find, in the New Testament alone, a warrant for their
          ecclesiastical systems and organizations. They do not seem to
          perceive, that the very course which they adopt to support their
          claims, affords most conclusive evidence that they are false and vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while some appeal to <i>Tradition</i>, and others to
          <i>Expediency</i>, it is the glory of the Baptists that they act on
          the principle of the sufficiency of the Bible in testing this, as well
          as all other questions relating to religion. Though Jewish antiquity,
          and the Fathers, yield as much or more support to their distinctive
          features, as to those who are most clamorous in demanding submission
          to them, still they prefer to appeal to "the law and to the
          testimony." I announce, as the Sixth Feature of the reform at which
          Baptists aim,<b>
            The restoration of the order of the primitive churches.</b

        <b> </b>
        <p>
          It is certain that primitive church order has been generally
          abandoned, from the fact that so many different organizations exist,
          each claiming to be the gospel church. Now, it is evident that not
          more than one of these dissimilar organizations can be constructed
          after the Scripture model. All that is necessary in testing their
          claims is, to compare them with
          <i>the New Testament description of a gospel church</i>. And any body
          of Christians that is unwilling to be brought to this test must of
          course give up this claim. Let us inquire,
        </p>

            ></font
          >
          We can only obtain satisfactory information on this point from the
          Word of God. The text and its connection present to us the
          circumstances under which the first gospel church was formed. From
          this it will be perceived, that first, the gospel was preached, then
          repentance and baptism were urged upon the hearers; "then they that
          gladly received the Word were baptized; and the same day there were
          added unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued
          steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking
          of bread, and in prayers. And the Lord added daily to the church such
          as should be saved."

          <b
            >1. The Primitive Churches were composed only of professed
            believers. </b
          >Those who "gladly received the word." In all the epistles to the
          churches it will be seen that the members composing them are addressed
          as "believers," "saints," "chosen ones," "partakers of like precious
          faith" with the apostles; and even where their sins are spoken of,
          they are alluded to as "brethren," who had departed from the faith.
          Dr. Dwight says, "There is but one character given in the New
          Testament to those who were church members, and that is the character
          of Christians. There is no mixture of any other character."

          <b
            >2. The Primitive churches were composed only of baptized
            believers</b
          >. By baptized, I mean <i>immersed </i>believers. "They that gladly
          received his word were immersed." This is the translation—in the
          common version we have only a transliteration. Let me, on this point,
          give you a few authorities for this translation, as there are some who
          deny its correctness—none, however, of any eminence as scholars.
        </p>
        <p>
          The learned Bossuet says: "Baptism was performed by plunging. In fine,
          we read not in Scripture that baptism was otherwise administered; and
          we are able to make it appear, that for thirteen hundred years baptism
          was thus administered throughout the whole church, as far as
          possible."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Doddridge says: "'Buried with him by baptism.' It seems the part
          of candor to confess that here is an allusion to the manner of
          baptizing by immersion, which was the primitive mode."
        </p>
        <p>
          John Wesley says: "'Buried with him,' alluding to the ancient manner
          of baptizing by immersion."
        </p>
        <p>
          Whitby, author of a Commentary on the New Testament and more than
          forty other learned works, says: "It being so expressly declared here,
          that we are buried with Christ in baptism, by being buried under
          water, and the argument to oblige us to a conformity to his death, by
          dying to sin, being taken from hence; and this immersion being
          observed by all Christians for thirteen centuries; and the change of
          it into sprinkling without any allowance from the Author of this
          institution, being that which the Romanist still urges to justify his
          refusal of the cup to the laity; it were to be wished that this custom
          might be again of general use."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chalmers says: "The original meaning of the word baptism is
          immersion; and we doubt not that the general style of administration
          in the apostles' days was by an actual submerging of the whole body
          under water."
        </p>
        <p>
          Archbishop Tillotson says: "Anciently those who were baptized were
          immersed and buried in water, to represent their death to sin; and
          then did rise up out of the water to signify their entrance upon a new
          life."
        </p>
        <p>
          I might go on and fill a volume with similar quotations, from every
          scholar of any note who has ever written upon the subject. In addition
          to this, every lexicon of note gives it a meaning, which signifies
          either an <i>immersion </i>into an element, or a complete overwhelming
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident, also, from the narration of
          <i> circumstances connected with baptism in the New Testament</i>,
          that immersion was the primitive mode.
        </p>
        <p>Christ, when he was baptized, came up out of the water.</p>
        <p>
          When Philip baptized the eunuch, he went down into the water with him,
          in order to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle Paul, in alluding to baptism, twice calls it a burial, and
          once a burial and resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          All who became members of the primitive churches were admitted by
          immersion; and as none were admitted but believers, none but believers
          were immersed.
        </p>
        <b> </b>
        <p>
          <b

            but those who were immersed.</b
          >
          Though they were, at the time of their conversion, members of the
          Jewish nation, or, as a Paedobaptist would say, of the Jewish church,
          and had been circumcised in their infancy, still they must be immersed
          before becoming members, or enjoying the privileges of a Christian
          church. Yes, even though they had been proselytes to the Jewish
          religion, and were circumcised after they arrived at maturity, they
          must still be immersed, when they professed faith in Christ, before
          they could sit down at the Lord's table. It is admitted by all, to
          have been the practice of the primitive churches, to receive none but
          the baptized to the Lord's table.

          <b>4. The primitive churches were independent in their government.</b>
          All the members were on an equality in each church, and each church
          was on the same equality with every other church. There were no
          bishops, in the sense in which that term is used by Roman Catholics,
          Episcopalians, and Methodists. There were no church sessions,
          presbyteries, assemblies, synods, or conferences. Advisory councils,
          having no power to legislate, were sometimes called to give counsel in
          difficult matters. But
          <i
            >individual churches possessed supreme authority to administer
            discipline, and transact their own business. </i

          <i>The first Paedobaptist church was the Church of Rome</i>. I presume
          I need not stop here to show that the Romish church does not conform
          to the Scripture model. All Protestants will affirm that she does not;
          and any one who will read the Bible will be convinced of it. Let me
          remind them, however, that in nothing is her dissimilarity to gospel
          churches more palpably manifest than in her infant baptism; and in
          this thing all Paedobaptists are treading in her path, while not one
          of them is conformed to the New Testament pattern. For,
        </p>
        <b> </b>
        <p>
          <b>1. They are not composed of the same materials.</b> They number
          among their members, others than professed believers. Every
          <i> Paedobaptist </i>church holds that the children of believers, when
          they are baptized, are members of the church, and form a part of it. I
          substantiated this assertion by numerous quotations from printed
          documents, in my lecture on the "Spirituality of Christ's Kingdom." I
          need not, therefore, repeat them here. But I remark, in addition to
          this, that
          <i
            >conversion is not necessarily a qualification for membership in
            most Paedobaptist churches</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          With <i>Episcopalians</i>, admission to full church privileges is
          granted to those who have been <i>confirmed</i>. The requirements for
          this service are thus stated in their Book of Common Prayer: "The
          Church has thought good to order, that none shall be confirmed but
          such as can say the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten
          Commandments, and can also answer to such other questions as in the
          Short Catechism are contained." The conditions of admission being thus
          made, irrespective of personal character, it cannot be expected that
          the Episcopal church will bear a comparison with that of primitive
          times. Indeed, it will be perceived that
          <i
            >all that is needed is a good memory, in order to be confirmed as a
            member of that church</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <i>Presbyterians </i>acknowledge in their standard, that "the
          visible church consists of all those throughout the world that profess
          the true religion, <i>together with their children</i>." They further
          say, "Children born within the pale of the visible church, and
          dedicated to God in baptism, are under the inspection and government
          of the church, and are to be taught to read and repeat the Catechism
          the Apostles' Creed, and the Lord's Prayer. They are to be taught to
          pray, to abhor sin, to fear God, and to obey the Lord Jesus Christ.
          And when they come to years of discretion, if they be free from
          scandal, appear sober and steady, and to have sufficient knowledge to
          discern the Lord's body, they ought to be informed it is their duty
          and privilege to come to the Lord's supper."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in all this there is nothing said about <i> regeneration</i>,
          <i>repentance</i>, or <i>faith</i>. The late Dr. Chalmers, a
          distinguished Presbyterian minister, maintained that it was "wrong to
          say that none but the pious should be admitted to partake of the
          sacraments," while, for the decent regulation of the church, "it is
          well that the visibly profane or profligate are kept away." As to the
          duty of a minister to the "great majority of our species," who are
          "neither of the profligate or the pious," his business is, "not to
          exclude them, but to warn them."
        </p>
        <p>
          A church formed on such principles as these certainly cannot claim to
          be identical with the primitive churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Methodist body, it is held that a religious society is "a
          company of men, having the form and seeking the power of godliness,
          united in order to pray together, to receive the word of exhortation,
          and to watch over one another in the Lord, that they may help each
          other to work out their salvation." "There is one condition previously
          required of those who desire admission into these societies—a desire
          to flee the wrath to come, and to be saved from their sins." It is
          well known that persons who give no evidence of conversion are often
          allowed, and even urged, to become "class members;" and these
          "seekers," as they are termed, are admitted to the Lord's table. It is
          not necessary according to the Discipline, that a man should give
          evidence of conversion. It is certainly not impossible for unconverted
          men to fulfill a term of probation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus, in almost every Paedobaptist church it may be seen, that
          <i
            >conversion is not absolutely insisted on as a condition of
            membership on the part of adult applicants</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what shall we say of their <i>infant membership</i>? We frequently
          hear of the "children of the covenant," and the "children of the
          church," from Paedobaptist pulpits, but
          <i>do we hear anything of this kind in the New Testament? </i>Do we
          find unconverted men addressed as members of the church in primitive
          times, or young persons urged to fulfill baptismal vows, made for them
          by their parents, when they were unconscious infants? No, no! We see
          parents urged to bring their children up in "the nurture and
          admonition of the lord," but we nowhere find this duty enforced by any
          allusion to vows made at the dedication of their children in baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, those who united with the primitive churches came into them
          <i>voluntarily</i>. It was not necessary to look about, and see who
          were "free from scandal," and tell them that it was "their duty and
          privilege to come to the Lord's table;" but, constrained by the love
          of Jesus Christ, they voluntarily sought to profess his sacred name.
          "Here is water, what hinders me to be baptized?" "If you believe with
          all your heart, you may."
        </p>
        <b> </b>
        <p>
          <b
            >2. Paedobaptists do not receive their members by the same
            initiatory rite that the primitive churches did.</b
          >
          The primitive churches received their members by immersion. This was
          the act by which they publicly "put on Christ" before the world. A
          great many Paedobaptist authors acknowledge that the primitive saints
          were immersed, and that immersion is the proper signification of the
          terms which are used to designate the ordinance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to those already quoted, I remark that
          <i> Calvin </i>says: "Here we perceive how baptism was administered
          among the ancients; for they immersed the whole body in water."
        </p>
        <p>
          Bishop Taylor says: "The custom of the ancient churches was not
          sprinkling, but immersion; in pursuance of the sense of the word in
          the commandment, and the example of our blessed Savior."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we know that Paedobaptist churches receive the majority of their
          members, not by immersion, but by sprinkling. Some may be immersed,
          but it is only after every argument to dissuade them from it has
          failed.
          <i
            >The practice of these churches is sprinkling, the exceptions are
            immersion</i
          >. In the primitive churches there was "one Lord, one faith, one
          baptism;" and that was immersion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, is a striking dissimilarity between all Paedobaptist
          churches and the primitive churches. The latter were composed of
          immersed believers. The former are composed of a mixed multitude of
          believers and unbelievers, sprinkled, poured, and immersed. The
          language addressed to the primitive churches cannot be addressed to
          them. "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
          on Christ." Have infants put on Christ? "Therefore we are buried with
          him by baptism into death." Can any Paedobaptist minister address his
          church thus? "Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen
          with him through faith of the operation of God." Can this language be
          appropriately addressed to a Paedobaptist church? No! so far from it,
          many Paedobaptists do not like to read it in their Bibles.
        </p>
        <p>
          But still further; a Paedobaptist preacher cannot stand up, in a
          Paedobaptist community, and address unconverted men as the primitive
          disciples did: "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you." They have
          been baptized, as they call it, already. From all this it is evident
          that Paedobaptist churches are very dissimilar to the churches in the
          times of the apostles, and to the teachings of the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is a wide dissimilarity between Paedobaptist churches and the
          primitive churches, in reference to the <i>Lord's Supper</i>. In the
          <i
            >primitive churches, all who were baptized, and members of the
            church, were admitted to the Lord's table</i
          >. None, who were considered proper subjects of baptism, and who had
          received that rite, were excluded from the communion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Paedobaptists contend that infants are proper subjects of baptism,
          and that sprinkling is the proper mode. Every infant who is sprinkled,
          then, according to their view, is properly baptized, and is a member
          in the visible church and ought, according to their own reasoning, to
          be admitted to the Lord's table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paedobaptists are most inveterate closed communionists. They are very
          eloquent against the bigotry and closeness of the Baptists, for not
          admitting members of Paedobaptist churches to the Lord's table; but
          surely they should not expect us to receive persons whom we consider
          unbaptized, when they will not receive their own baptized members.
        </p>
        <p>
          All whom we consider baptized, and who are members of our churches, we
          receive; so did the primitive churches. But
          <i
            >Paedobaptists have large numbers, whom they consider baptized
            members of their churches, whom they do not admit to the Lord's
            table</i
          >. This is a kind of "closed communion" that we have never practiced.

          They make no appeal to Tradition, the Fathers, or Expediency. They
          simply ask, "What do the Scriptures teach?" They follow the New
          Testament model of a church, and invite all to test them by it. It is
          not strange, therefore, that they confidently appeal to God's Word for
          proof of the correctness of all they do. They take it all from the
          Bible, and therefore they know it can all be found there. Take any
          Scripture account of the course pursued by the apostles, or of the
          practice of gospel churches, and you will find the counterpart in a
          Baptist church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the primitive churches, they are composed of immersed believers.
          <i
            >Show us an instance of the baptism of an infant in the primitive
            churches, and we will then baptize infants</i
          >. But until you do, we will oppose infant baptism as an innovation of
          man, having no divine authority, and therefore sinful, when performed
          in the name of Jehovah.
        </p>
        <i> </i>
        <p>
          <i
            >Like the primitive churches, Baptists admit none to the Lord's
            table but those who are immersed on profession of their faith</i
          >. Show us an instance of a gospel church doing otherwise, and we will
          conform to the model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the primitive churches, Baptists are independent in their
          government. Show us a pope, or bishop, or conference, or synod, or
          presbytery, or council, authorized to govern the church, and we will
          submit to just such authority as you can show us in the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our position in these matters is illustrated by a narrative contained
          in a tract, published by the American Tract Society, entitled "Mick
          Healy, the Bible Reader." Mick had been a strict Roman Catholic for
          fifty years. One day he accidentally found a Bible, and commenced
          reading it. The more he read, the more he neglected the Romish
          service. The priest at length heard of it, and visited Mick, and
          sought to get the Bible from him. Failing in this, he began to
          expostulate with him. He told him he must not read it any more; and
          reminding him that he had not been to confession for a long time, he
          told him he must come and confess, for it was his duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mick held out the Bible to the priest, and said, "Will your reverence
          please show it to me in the Book."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this is just what we say to all the arguments of Paedobaptists.
          They tell us that all Christian parents should have their infant
          children sprinkled. We say, "Will you please show it to us in the
          Book." They tell us that sprinkling will do as well as to go "down
          into the water," and be "buried in baptism," and "come up out of the
          water." We say, "Will you please show it to us in the Book."
        </p>
        <p>
          After some time, Mick united with a Protestant church, and regularly
          attended the Sunday-school. The children used frequently to gather
          round him, and put questions to him, to hear his answers:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, Mick, why don't you now pray to the Virgin Mary?"<br />
          "Because it is not in the Book."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why don't you now confess your sins to Peter and Paul, Mick?" <br />
          "Because it is not in the Book."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why do you believe the Bible to be sufficient to make you wise unto
          salvation, without tradition?" <br />
          "Oh, sure, it is all in the Book."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Must everything in religion be proved by the Bible, Mick?" <br />
          "Yes; whatever is not so, is only moonshine."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now our Paedobaptist friends ask us why we do not sprinkle infants; we
          reply, "It is not in the Book!"
        </p>
        <p>
          They wish to know why we "go down into the water," and immerse those
          who believe, and "come up out of the water." We reply, with Mick, "Oh,
          sure, it is all in the Book."
        </p>
        <p>
          They ask us why we do not admit to the Lord's table those who are
          unbaptized. We reply, "It is not in the Book; and whatever is not in
          the Book is only moonshine."
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to be <i>Bible Christians</i>, and to make our churches Bible
          churches. In upholding Baptist sentiments, we simply aim to perpetuate
          primitive Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We resemble the primitive Christians in another respect—we are
          "everywhere spoken against." This we expect, so long as men follow
          Tradition rather than the Word of God, and are influenced by the
          teachings of men, rather than by the example of Christ. But, when the
          Bible, and especially the Bible faithfully translated, is made the
          standard, then we shall triumph. We make no arrogant assumptions; we
          utter no idle boast; but we simply use the language of humble
          confidence and firm faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          The progress of the Baptist denomination can be arrested only by
          taking the Bible away from the people; for, while they possess that,
          in spite of priests and princes, scaffolds and faggots, tortures and
          death—some will be found, as in all ages some have been found, who
          will contend for primitive simplicity, primitive purity, primitive
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand,
          <i
            >Paedobaptism can only succeed by withholding the Bible from the
            people, or veiling the command to be immersed in an unknown tongue,
            or calling human tradition to support it, and enlisting carnal
            weapons to defend it. </i
          >But its days are numbered; it is in its decline. Its end approaches;
          and soon will be heard the vocal shout, "Babylon the great is fallen,
          fallen," and Rome, and all that is Romish, infant baptism and all,
          shall be destroyed! And so let it be!
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not imagine, from these remarks, that I cherish any feelings of
          animosity toward those who practice infant baptism. No; far from it, I
          sincerely <i>pity </i>them. Especially do I pity the priests and
          ministers who are engaged in defending it. So much labor in vain—so
          much pains for nothing. Has not Christ said, "Every plant which my
          heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up!" Oh, how much
          better to come out on Gospel ground, take the Bible and follow Christ,
          and enjoy the sweet and abiding confidence that you have done what is
          right!
