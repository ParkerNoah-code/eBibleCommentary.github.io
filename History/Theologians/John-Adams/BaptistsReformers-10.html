          "Curse Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, Curse bitterly the
          inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the Lord, to
          the help of the Lord against the mighty." Judges 5:23
        </p>
        <p>
          In almost every work of Reform there have been those who, while their
          judgments have been convinced of the correctness of the views of the
          reforming party, have, nevertheless, ingloriously consulted their own
          ease, and have chosen to occupy a neutral position during the
          struggle, and thus be prepared, at the termination of the conflict, to
          avoid the reproach of the Reformers, if unsuccessful; or share their
          honors, if triumphant.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was this indolent spirit that actuated the inhabitants of Meroz,
          who were anathematized by Jehovah for the course they adopted. Those
          who are here referred to, were Israelites; their nation had been
          mightily oppressed for twenty years by Jabin, the king of Canaan. This
          was during the time that Deborah judged Israel. Wearied with
          oppression, the descendants of Abraham cried unto the Lord for
          deliverance. He heard their cry, and directed them to go forth against
          Sisera, the captain of the host of Jabin, promising to deliver their
          enemies into their hand. The Merozites, desiring to retain the favor
          of the Canaanites, who were very powerful, and yet not wishing to bear
          arms against their brethren, remained at home, and occupied a position
          of shameful neutrality. Meanwhile. the hosts of Israel, under Barak,
          having vanquished their enemies, returned in triumph, with songs of
          thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the indolent, time-serving inhabitants of Meroz, learned that they
          could not reject the claims of their country and their God with
          impunity. God was displeased with them; and instead of permitting them
          to share the triumph of their brethren, he places them under his
          malediction, and directs their own countrymen to bitterly execrate
          them: "Curse Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse bitterly the
          inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the Lord, to
          the help of the Lord against the mighty." The Israelites were engaged
          in God's work—a work of Reform. The Merozites, who should have been
          interested in that work, and assisted in it, refused to do so. For
          this they were cursed by Jehovah. My theme is,<b>
            God's displeasure with those who remain sinfully neutral in a work
            of reform.</b
          >
        </p>
        <b> </b>
        <p>
          In dwelling on this topic, I will present for your consideration a few
          propositions which will serve to elucidate it.
        </p>
        <font color="#008000"><b> </b></font>

          <font color="#008000"
            ><b
              >I. God carries on all Reforms through Human Instrumentality.</b
            ></font
          >
          Ever since man fell, the work of Reform has been going on in the
          world, under the direction of Jehovah; and every work that tends to
          make man better and happier, and bring him back to entire conformity
          to God's will, is really His work, though carried on by human
          instrumentality. Thus, when he would disseminate the knowledge of his
          will and holy character among mankind, he raised up, and prepared, and
          used the <i>Jewish nation</i>, as the instruments, to whom a
          revelation of himself was entrusted.
        </p>
        <p>
          When that nation forgot him, and degenerated into idolatry, he raised
          up <i>prophets </i>to reform them. Elijah, and Isaiah, and Jeremiah,
          were great Reformers. When they, the chosen and peculiar people of
          God, rejected the Messiah, and crucified the Savior as an impostor, he
          did not turn from man, and seek angelic powers; but, through the
          apostles, he called the Gentiles into his kingdom, to be co-workers in
          the world's redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the simplicity of Christianity became corrupted by its connection
          with paganism, in the days of Constantine, he still employed human
          instrumentality to testify against this departure from the faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          When, at a later day, the Romish Church had corrupted every doctrine,
          and polluted, by her unholy touch, every ordinance of the Gospel, he
          raised up Luther, Zwingle, Calvin, and others, as the instruments of
          effecting the Protestant Reformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          When these Reformed churches, still retaining somewhat of the spirit
          of Romanism, formed an unhallowed alliance with the State, and
          enlisted carnal weapons in their support—God brought forth the
          Baptists to assert the spirituality of Christ's kingdom, and the
          rights of conscience, and the great Bible doctrine of
          <i>religions liberty </i>and individual responsibility to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Christian church had forgotten the great command, "Go, teach
          all nations," God raised up William Carey, to draw their attention to
          it, and through him originated the sublime work of Modern Missions
          which bids fair to reform the world, and produce a complete moral
          revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, in every reform, God has used human instrumentality; and thus,
          if infant baptism, and sprinkling be a perversion of his ordinance,
          (as we think, in the preceding Lectures we have clearly shown it to
          be,) he will reform it by human instrumentality.
        </p>
        <font color="#008000"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#008000"
            ><b
              >II. In almost every Work of Reform, some have remained Sinfully
              Neutral.</b
            ></font
          >
          There is a difference, it must be admitted, between sinful enmity or
          direct opposition to a work—and indolent, selfish neutrality. It was
          wrong for the Canaanites to oppress the Israelites; but, it is
          difficult to decide, whether their active opposition was, under the
          circumstances, any more criminal than the inactivity of Meroz. The
          latter knew that it was their duty to aid their brethren. They knew
          they were right, and that they needed assistance; and they knew, also,
          that their neutrality might possibly be the occasion of their defeat.
          Still, they came not up to help them, but left them to struggle on
          alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it has often been, when God's servants have gone forth to engage
          in the work of Reform. The correctness of their principles, the purity
          of their motives, the benevolence of their designs—have forced the
          conviction on many who have witnessed their efforts, that they were
          right; and yet they have never moved a hand to aid them, or uttered a
          word to encourage them, but have contented themselves with occupying a
          merely neutral position. They do not openly oppose the work; they do
          not enroll themselves among its enemies; but they are not prepared to
          make the sacrifices which a noble and manly advocacy of the truth
          demands of them. They fear that they may sustain injury in their
          business, perhaps. The most wealthy and influential members of the
          community are opposed to the reformers, and they will withdraw their
          patronage. Or, they dread the sundering of social ties, it may be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their relatives and friends are committed to that which the Reform
          aims to correct or remove, and they cannot bear the thought of
          arraying themselves against the errors which friends love; they esteem
          their relatives more highly than the truth. Or, the open advocacy of
          what they feel to be right, will subject them to reproach. They will
          be called weak-minded, changelings, fanatical, deserters. Or, they
          will be compelled to unite with a weak body, which is greatly in the
          minority, and heavy burdens will rest upon them. Or, they are not
          certain that the efforts of the reforming party will succeed, and they
          dread the disgrace of a defeat. They forget that
          <i
            >it is more honorable to be defeated while contending for truth,
            than to be victorious on the side of error</i
          >. These things all combine to lead them to practice a time-serving
          neutrality. Like the Merozites, they come not up to the help of the
          Lord, and thus incur his displeasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was thus in the days of Nehemiah, when he gathered the Jews
          together to build the walls of Jerusalem; "The nobles put not their
          necks to the work of the Lord." It was thus in the days of Christ and
          the apostles. Thus it was, also, in later times. Who can tell how
          many, during the fierce persecutions under Antiochus Epiphanes, the
          Romish Papacy, and the English Episcopacy, were led to adopt a neutral
          position, and act in direct opposition to what they knew to be right?
          So it is now; many persons see a thing to be right, and acknowledge it
          to be so; and yet they will not come up to the help of the Lord,
          because they must come up "against the mighty."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it has often been with the Reform in which Baptists are engaged.
          A Baptist congregation has seldom been organized for any length of
          time in a Paedobaptist community, without leading many to the
          conclusion that they were more Scriptural and nearer to the Gospel
          pattern, than the Paedobaptists. While some Christians, acting in
          accordance with such convictions, have submitted to immersion, and
          boldly committed themselves to the cause of truth—others, equally
          convinced of the truth, have continued to practice a time-serving
          neutrality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it may be, perchance, with some who read these Lectures.
          Convinced of the evils of infant baptism, and of the necessity and
          importance of its removal, they may choose, still, not to identify
          themselves with those who are laboring to effect what they feel to be
          right. Like Meroz, they will not come "up to the help of the Lord
          against the mighty."
        </p>
        <font color="#008000"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#008000"
            ><b>III. God is necessarily displeased with such conduct.</b></font
          >
          "Curse Meroz, curse bitterly the inhabitants thereof." All sin is
          offensive to God, and occasions his displeasure; but sins against
          light and knowledge, are especially heinous in his sight. Such is the
          nature of the sin we are contemplating—the neglect of known duty. A
          person may oppose a work of reform from conscientious motives, while
          he believes that work to be wrong; but let him be convinced that
          reform is necessary—that the purity of the Church of Christ, the good
          of souls, and the glory of God are connected with its success, and he
          cannot then oppose it without guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          A man whose judgment is thus convinced about a matter, occupies a far
          different and more responsible position than one who is in doubt
          concerning the propriety of it, or than he himself did before such
          conviction.
          <i
            >He cannot remain in a neutral position, without sinning against
            conscience</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose a Romanist is convinced of the errors of Popery; he could not,
          after such conviction, remain in the Romish church, without the
          additional aggravation of sinning against his conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          So of Paedobaptism, or any other error; when a person is convinced
          that it is wrong it becomes his duty to abandon it, and aid those who
          seek to exterminate it. God is always displeased with half-heartedness
          in his service, and some of the severest denunciations of his Word are
          against those who occupy a merely neutral position.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the exercise of this displeasure, God frequently withdraws the
          smile of his countenance. A sense of obligations violated, and duty
          neglected, prevents the enjoyment of his favor; and whether that duty
          be a great or small one, if willfully neglected, God is displeased and
          the soul feels it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sometimes sends temporal afflictions. A man neglects known duty,
          for fear his business will suffer; God brings reverses and losses upon
          him, against which, with all his cunning, he failed to secure himself.
          He consults the wishes of his friends; they prove false to him. He
          dreads to sever himself from his relatives; God removes them from him
          by death. Or, if none of these calamities come upon him, there are
          other consequences which cannot be avoided. Conscience will upbraid,
          and the mind will often be perplexed, and distracted with anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, in the event of the success of the reforming party, such are
          always objects of shame and contempt. They are regarded as the mere
          chips and straws that float with the current. They are never depended
          upon in times of trial; and thus they often bring upon themselves more
          keen reproach than the true Reformer ever suffers. <i>He </i>endures
          reproach for the Truth's sake; <i>they </i>suffer it justly, for their
          recreancy to the Truth. The <i>Reformer </i>glories in the reproach he
          is called to suffer—it is his honor. <i>They </i>feel that they are
          dishonored, and deserve to be. They are generally disappointed in
          their expectations, and find that their wisdom is but folly, and their
          gain but loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the Merozites. What did they gain by their sinful neutrality?
          While Israel rejoice and triumph, Meroz is dishonored and execrated.
        </p>
        <p>In concluding these Lectures, permit me to address:</p>
        <b> </b>
        <p>
          <b>First, those who are members of the Baptist denomination</b>.
          Brethren, great and important principles are involved in our action.
          Let us be faithful to the trust committed to us. On the propagation of
          our principles in this country, depends all that is dear to us as
          Christians, as Americans, as men.
          <i
            >The Baptist element alone, in our country has preserved religious
            freedom and the rights of conscience</i
          >. Baptists alone, are prepared consistently and successfully to meet
          and oppose those various and gigantic forms of error, which retard the
          progress and prevent the triumphs of the Gospel. Let us stand
          faithfully by those hallowed truths in defense of which myriads have
          gone to the scaffold and the rack, and firm adherence to which dyed
          even American soil with Baptist blood. Let us come up "to the help of
          the Lord against the mighty," and effect a complete and thorough
          reform, by the exaltation of pure Bible truth, unmixed with human
          inventions and the traditions of men!
        </p>
        <b> </b>
        <p>
          <b
            >Secondly, I address a word to those who are Baptists in sentiment,
            but who are not united with Baptist churches.</b
          >
          Many such are found in almost every community. Why do you tarry? Are
          you not copying the conduct of Meroz? Beware, lest you incur God's
          displeasure, by your sinful neglect of known duty. "That servant who
          knew his Lord's will, and did it not, shall be beaten with many
          stripes."
        </p>
        <b> </b>
        <p>
          <b>Thirdly, those not Paedobaptists.</b> There are large numbers in
          Paedobaptist churches who, while they cannot see that immersion is
          essential to baptism, still do not believe that infants ought to be
          baptized. To such I say, You are convinced that the baptism of infants
          is unscriptural and wrong.
          <i
            >Why, then, continue in a church that teaches what you know is
            contrary to the Bible? </i
          >Further, have you been baptized since infancy, yourselves? lf not,
          then, according to your own showing, you have not been scripturally
          baptized, and you are neglecting the first duty of the believer. "He
          who believes and is baptized, shall he saved."
        </p>
        <b> </b>
        <p>
          <b>Finally, to those who are Paedobaptists</b> I would say, If you
          have carefully read the preceding Lectures, you certainly can no
          longer wonder at the importance which Baptists attach to the proper
          <i> subjects </i>and <i>mode </i>of baptism. It is connected with
          views of the spirituality of Christ's kingdom, and individual
          responsibility, that are far from insignificant in their bearings. Be
          not surprised, then, if, moved with love to Christ, and love to the
          souls of men, they labor to induce investigation on this subject among
          Christians, that Paedobaptists may proselyte themselves to Bible
          sentiments. "Prove all things, hold fast that which is good."
