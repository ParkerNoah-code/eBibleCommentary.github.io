        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The proud boasting and the malicious plots of the ungodly come to a
          fearful end. The case of the righteous greatly differs, and calls for
          praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Why do you boast in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God
            endures continually."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Deep is the malignity of the heart which the Spirit has not softened.
          To plot mischief is most vile; but it rests not in devising evil; it
          delights in its sin, and boastingly exults in its shame. How vain is
          this pride! It checks not the operations of God's goodness. This
          attribute will ever live while God lives, and will ever be His
          people's shield. Child of God, believe this and fear not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2, 3, 4.
          <i
            >"Your tongue devises mischiefs, like a sharp razor, working
            deceitfully. You love evil more than good, and lying rather than to
            speak righteousness. You love all-devouring words, O you deceitful
            tongue."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doeg instantly appears. In dark colors his hateful portrait is
          displayed. With crafty calumnies he maligned the servant of the Lord.
          With evil reports he stirred up the king's wrath. This malevolence was
          his delight. He found enjoyment in pouring forth devouring words.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.
          <i
            >"God shall likewise destroy you forever; He shall take you away,
            and pluck you out of your dwelling place, and root you out of the
            land of the living."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who thus propagate malicious lies against God's servants little
          think that they are planning their own ruin. They consider not that
          God's eye watches their secret devices, and that His just wrath will
          surely be aroused. They dig a pit for others, and surely their own
          steps lead to it. Destruction is planned, but it is destruction of
          themselves. No wicked ways can prosper. The end of evil is sure
          misery. Those who would chase others from the earth, will surely find
          that vengeance follows in their rear. How often requital pursues them
          in this time-state! How often in their sufferings do they read their
          sin! How often does the crop of misery prove what seed had been sown!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6.
          <i
            >"The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at
            him."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The righteous diligently observe God's ways. It is a book of wisdom
          full of precious lessons. They mark the outgoings of requiting wrath;
          holy awe fills their hearts. They tremble at the issue of sin's
          course. A sneer can scarcely be repressed at the folly of the
          insulting boaster.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7.
          <i
            >"Look, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted
            in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his
            wickedness."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Pitiable indeed is the man who makes his own arm his strength, and
          rejects the living God. Where is there greater folly than to put
          confidence in a mass of silver and gold? How quickly does it fade
          away, and leave the proud possessor in the straits of poverty!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the height of madness is to regard wickedness as might, and to
          believe that the ways of wickedness lead to success and prosperity.
          The only man who is truly strong, and has enduring treasure, and will
          prevail, is the humble follower of the Lamb.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8.
          <i
            >"But I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God; I trust in
            the mercy of God forever and ever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David discerned how different was his case, and he well knew who made
          him to differ. While Doeg and all of the same vile character was cast
          off as a withered branch, David was verdant and fruitful as an
          olive-tree in most luxuriant soil. He owed his position and his
          verdant boughs, and clusters of rich fruit, to God's abundant mercy,
          and in that mercy was all his trust forever and ever. Stable is this
          foundation of our hopes. Let nothing move us from it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9.
          <i
            >"I will praise You forever, because You have done it; and I will
            wait on Your name; for it is good before Your saints."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such distinguishing mercy requires that every breath should be praise.
          But who can adequately praise God for what He has done, and is doing,
          and will do for His servants? In humble patience let us wait on all
          the attributes which make up His name. Let all God's people see our
          grateful course.
