        <p align="justify">
          Incessant praise is God's undoubted due. Countless are the motives
          which awaken it. May it be the exercise in which our souls unweariedly
          delight!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Praise waits for You, O God, in Zion; and unto You shall the vow
            be performed."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Among God's people in the Zion of His dwelling, praise is ever ready
          to break forth. At every moment, in every circumstance, it strives to
          issue from adoring lips. How happy are God's people if praise is
          happiness; for their happiness flows as a river. They may have been in
          trouble—they may have known affliction's darkest hour—they may have
          felt desertion's misery. In these trials they sought deliverance, and
          vowed to pay the tribute of thanksgiving. Deliverance has come—their
          vows are duly paid. They call upon their souls and all that is within
          them to bless God's Holy name and to remember all His benefits.

          2. <i>"O You who hears prayer, unto You shall all flesh come."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many sweet titles tell of our Lord's abundant goodness. We read of Him
          as a God ready to forgive—as a God who receives sinners. Here He is
          proclaimed as a God who hears prayer. Time would fail to recount all
          the promises which assure us of accepting favor. We are invited—we are
          importuned—to draw near to the mercy-seat by repeated promises that if
          we ask we shall receive. What is the saint's life, but the recital of
          prayers heard and prayers fulfilled! This truth rolls as an unceasing
          flood throughout the pages of the Bible. Oh! for more faith to clasp
          these grand assurances to our hearts. It would make earth one
          communion with heaven—it would show heaven descending unto earth on
          wings of glad reply.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            Why are we so poor and needy, so scanty in grace, so downcast in
            spirit?
          </p></i
        >
        It is because our prayers are faithless. How different would be our
        state if earnest prayer gave God no rest—if wrestling supplications took
        heaven by storm! Then praises would proclaim that God is true; and
        praying lips can never pray in vain. This truth put forth into action
        would make this world a house of prayer. "Unto You shall all flesh
        come."

          <i
            >"Iniquities prevail against me; as for our transgressions, You
            shall purge them away."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The believer is ever conscious of his sin-soiled state. He meekly
          cries, "My sin is ever before me." But still praise super-abounds. He
          knows that Christ has by His one offering purged away all his sins. He
          knows that the blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses from all
          sin. Mindful of this pardon, what praises, what thanksgivings he pours
          forth!
        </p>

          4.
          <i
            >"Blessed is the man whom You choose, and cause to approach You,
            that he may dwell in Your courts; we shall be satisfied with the
            goodness of Your house, even of Your holy temple."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The Book of Life, written before the foundation of the world, is here.
          Blessed indeed are they whose names are therein inscribed! The
          <i>cause</i> of this blessedness is everlasting love—its source is far
          above, out of our sight. But the <i>effects</i> are manifest. The
          happy objects of this love are won and drawn by grace. They cannot
          rest but in the presence of their God; and this they seek in holy
          ordinances, and here their souls are satisfied with tokens of God's
          goodness.

          5-13.
          <i
            >"By awesome things in righteousness will You answer us, O God of
            our salvation; who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth,
            and of those who are afar off upon the sea; which by His strength
            sets fast the mountains, being girded with power; who stills the
            noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the
            people. Those also who dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid of
            Your tokens; You make the outgoings of the morning and evening to
            rejoice. You visit the earth, and water it; You greatly enrich it
            with the river of God, which is full of water; You prepare them
            corn, when You have so provided for it. You water its ridges
            abundantly; You settle its furrows; You make it soft with showers;
            You bless the springing thereof; You crown the year with Your
            goodness; and Your paths drop fatness. They drop upon the pastures
            of the wilderness; and the little hills rejoice on every side. The
            pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over
            with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Prayer calls God to manifest His power—answers are not withheld.
          Terrible is the overthrow of all evil—faith is confirmed, and the
          glory of God is widely seen. His power shines brightly through the
          realms of nature. The operations of His hand declare it. The mighty
          mountains stand fast through His resolve. The raging waves repose at
          His word; morning sweetly smiles, and evening closes on a rejoicing
          world. Refreshing streams irrigate the thirsty soil; abundance richly
          follows; the year displays God's goodness as its diadem; fertility
          follows where His feet are set. Pastures and valleys are luxuriant
          plenty. Praise, then, is His just due. Let all within us praise His
          name.
