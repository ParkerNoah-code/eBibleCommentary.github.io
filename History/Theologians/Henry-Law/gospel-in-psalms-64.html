        <p align="justify">
          The voice of prayer again is heard amid the multitude of afflictions.
          But deliverance shows a smiling face. Foes will fall prostrate and the
          righteous shall rejoice.
        </p>

            >"Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer; preserve my life from fear of
            the enemy. Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
            insurrection of the workers of iniquity."</i

          The Psalmist is here seen as a child of sorrows cradled in distress.
          His daily portion is affliction's bread. He holds a cup filled to the
          very brim with trouble. He cannot stir but amid snares and hostile
          threats. On every side the enemy shows a front of menace. But he has
          his refuge. It is near. It is secure. It is the mercy-seat to which
          prayer brings him near. Who will dread trouble when such remedies are
          at hand! Foes may have cruel malice in their hearts, but all their
          malice will prove blessings in disguise when they convey on wings of
          prayer to God's immediate presence. Thus cruel distress is often made
          the means of boundless good. So it was with David. In his worst
          straits he could look up and cry, 'Preserve my life, O God, from fear
          of the enemy.' He knew that the wicked laid their secret plots, and
          that the workers of iniquity were planning to rise up against him. But
          no fears disturbed his peace when he could appeal to God to spread His
          sheltering wings around him, and to hide him in His pavilion, from the
          machinations of insurgents.

          <i
            >Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot
            their arrows, even bitter words; that they may shoot in secret at
            the perfect; suddenly they shoot at him, and fear not. They
            encourage themselves in an evil matter; they commune of laying
            snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? As they plot their
            crimes, they say, "We have devised the perfect plan!" Yes, the human
            heart and mind are cunning.</i

          In warfare the <i>sword</i> is a mighty weapon. It inflicts deadly
          wounds and drives back the attacking foe. So, also, <i> arrows</i> do
          destructive work. The Psalmist felt these weapons were arrayed against
          him in the malice of attacking words. Sharp as the sword were their
          tongues, piercing as the arrows were their words; secret was the
          ambush, and suddenly they rushed out to fight. They hold malicious
          counsels. They flatter themselves that darkness would conceal their
          plots. In disregard of the all-seeing Eye they vainly question, 'Who
          shall see us?' They use, also, every endeavor to malign. They strive
          to discover some evil which they may bring to light, and use in
          slander against the objects of their hate. Who can fathom the evil of
          their thoughts, the evil of their hearts? Truly this evil is a deep
          well.

            >"But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be
            wounded. So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon
            themselves; all that see them shall flee away."</i

          If our hope sprang only from this world, our hands might hang down in
          despair. If help came only from the sons of men, helpless indeed our
          state would be. How soon would we be trampled down by overwhelming
          hosts; how soon would Satan send forth his legions to sweep us into
          uttermost destruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But God is our hope, our help, our strength; therefore unfailing
          victory must be on our side. He will bend His bow, and His arrows
          never fail to reach their mark, and to discomfit the insulting hosts.
          In a moment, when they least expect defeat, like Sennacherib's hosts,
          they shall lie as dead men. Like Pharaoh's army, they shall be
          overwhelmed and no more seen. God does not need to call in new
          implements of ruin; their own tongues shall put forth destructive
          power. Self-wounded, self-ruined, self-destroyed, they shall exhibit a
          spectacle so fearful that frightened spectators shall dread their very
          sight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9-10.
          <i
            >"And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
            they shall wisely consider His doing. The righteous shall be glad in
            the Lord, and shall trust in Him; and all the upright in heart shall
            glory."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Awe shall be widely spread when such requital is beheld. The hand of
          the Lord shall be conspicuous, and shall be reverently acknowledged.
          Intelligence shall perceive that God's mind has been the directing
          cause, and God's power accomplished the overthrow. Happy thankfulness
          shall pervade the hearts of the righteous. They shall rejoice not so
          much in the misery of the wicked and at their total overthrow, as that
          God's work shall be thus manifestly seen, that praises should adore
          Him, and all glory be ascribed to Him.
