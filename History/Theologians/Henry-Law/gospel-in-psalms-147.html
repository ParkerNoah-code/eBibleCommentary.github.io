        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Exhortations call to praise our God. Let our grateful hearts
          rejoicingly obey.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Praise the Lord; for it is good to sing praises to our God; for it
            is pleasant; and praise is lovely."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It cannot be too earnestly enforced that praise is our duty, our joy,
          and our becoming exercise. Let happy experience testify this truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2-3.
          <i
            >"The Lord builds up Jerusalem; He gathers together the outcasts of
            Israel. He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          He brought the captive Jews from Babylon. Thus He showed by expressive
          type that He will not permit the enemy to hold the Church in enduring
          bondage. Sorrow and mourning may be long their lot, but at His
          bidding, joy will bud forth, and every wound be healed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.
          <i
            >"He tells the number of the stars; He calls them all by their
            names."</i

        <p align="justify">
          We are thus taught that nothing can surpass His knowledge. The starry
          firmament sparkles with innumerable orbs. All are known to Him. So we,
          our persons, our matters, are all unmistakable to His omniscient eye.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-6.
          <i
            >"Great is our Lord, and of great power; His understanding is
            infinite. The Lord lifts up the meek; He casts the wicked down to
            the ground."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In His wisdom He reads every character. He knows the meek and exalts
          them. He knows the wicked and debases them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-9.
          <i
            >"Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praise on the harp to our
            God; who covers the heaven with clouds, who prepares rain for the
            earth, who makes grass to grow upon the mountains. He gives to the
            beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We cannot too frequently exhort to praise. The merciful dealings in
          nature are a fruitful topic. Behold the heavens robed in their
          clothing of clouds, the rain descending to fertilize the earth, the
          summits of the hills clad in verdure, and praise the hand which thus
          dispenses plenteousness. Behold the beasts of the forests and the
          ravens in their lofty nests. His hand provides their food. Let then
          His hand be praised.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10-11.
          <i
            >"He delights not in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure
            in the legs of a man. The Lord takes pleasure in those who fear Him,
            in those who hope in His mercy."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Lord has no delight in animal or bodily strength of frame. He
          looks to the inner man, and smiles on faith and fear. May such graces
          ever appear in us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12-13.<i>
            "Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion. For He has
            strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children
            within you."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Church cannot be too fervent in praise. The strength of protecting
          bulwarks, the happiness of the inhabitants within, all call for
          grateful adoration.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          14-20.
          <i
            >"He makes peace in your borders, and fills you with the finest of
            the wheat. He sends forth His commandment upon earth; His word runs
            very swiftly. He gives snow like wool; He scatters the hoarfrost
            like ashes. He casts forth His ice like morsels; who can stand
            before His cold? He sends out His word, and melts them; He causes
            His wind to blow, and the waters flow. He shows His word to Jacob,
            His statutes and His judgments to Israel. He has not dealt so with
            any nation; and as for His judgments, they have not known them.
            Praise the Lord."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All blessings come from the bountiful hand of God and merit praise.
          His will pervades the length and breadth of the earth, ordering all
          things and enforcing obedience. But the blessing of blessings is His
          revealed Word. This is now circulated in almost all the languages of
          the world. We are abundantly favored with the inestimable boon. Let us
          gratefully use it, and adore the gracious Giver. Praise the Lord.
