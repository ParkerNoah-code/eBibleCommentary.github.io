          <font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>Psalm 145</b></font>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Praise pervades this hymn. God's various claims are duly expounded.
          May they so influence our hearts that much fruit may ripen!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"I will extol You, my God, O King; and I will bless Your name
            forever and ever. Every day will I bless You; and I will praise Your
            name forever and ever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such is the hearty resolve of faith. May it in truth be our very life.
          Happily will flow the days which are preparation for the home in which
          praises never ebb.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.
          <i
            >"Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and His greatness is
            unsearchable."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Who can measure the infinitude of the Lord! But as we praise, the
          topic will delightfully expand. Eternity will not exhaust it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.
          <i
            >"One generation shall praise Your works to another, and shall
            declare Your mighty acts."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The praise of God endures with earth's continuance. The Lord's seed
          shall never be extinct, and the work of praise will be their ever
          living joy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-7.
          <i
            >"I will speak of the glorious honor of Your majesty, and of Your
            wondrous works. And men shall speak of the might of Your terrible
            acts; and I will declare Your greatness. They shall abundantly utter
            the memory of Your great goodness, and shall sing of Your
            righteousness."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The theme exceeds all utterance. Let all efforts be made to do justice
          to it; still the greatness, the majesty, the goodness, the
          righteousness of the Lord, will scarcely be touched in their outlines.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8.
          <i
            >"The Lord is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and
            of great mercy."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The believer's experience testifies to this precious truth. Where sin
          abounds, grace much more abounds. Our need and misery awaken constant
          compassion. If provocations roused just wrath, we would speedily be
          cast off. Every moment proves that God is rich in forbearing mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9.
          <i
            >"The Lord is good to all; and His tender mercies are over all His
            works."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Surely goodness and mercy follow us each day. All things show His
          tender love.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10-12.
          <i
            >"All Your works shall praise You, O Lord; and Your saints shall
            bless You. They shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom, and talk
            of Your power; to make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, and
            the glorious majesty of His kingdom."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The saints delight in extolling the name of their glorious King.
          Superabundant is the theme presented by His dominion. His throne is
          universal empire. His scepter is unbounded sway.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13.
          <i
            >"Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and Your dominion endures
            throughout all generations."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          From everlasting to everlasting He sits upon the throne of unlimited
          sovereignty. From everlasting to everlasting His praises shall
          resound.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          14.
          <i
            >"The Lord upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who are
            bowed down."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us pursue our heavenward path leaning on our Beloved. When we
          stumble He will uphold; when we fall He will upraise us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15-18.
          <i
            >"The eyes of all wait upon You; and You give them their food in due
            season. You open Your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living
            thing. The Lord is righteous in all His ways, and holy in all His
            works. The Lord is near to all those who call upon Him, to all who
            call upon Him in truth."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All sustenance comes from His bountiful goodness. His open hand pours
          down plenteousness on earth. Holiness is His glorious attribute.
          Holiness is stamped on all His works. May the impress on our brow be,
          Holiness to the Lord! Precious is the thought that the ear nearest to
          us is the ear of our God, ever waiting to hear and to relieve our
          need.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19-21.
          <i
            >"He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him; He also will
            hear their cry, and will save them. The Lord preserves all those who
            love Him; but all the wicked will He destroy. My mouth shall speak
            the praise of the Lord; and let all flesh bless His holy name
            forever and ever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Precious indeed is the promise that the desire of His servants shall
          be fulfilled. Salvation shall be their heritage. No harm shall injure
          those who love Him. But the wicked shall be utterly consumed. May the
          concluding resolve be the inhabitant of our hearts! Let universal
          blessings be ascribed to our Heavenly Father in Christ Jesus.
