        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The mercy of the Lord is largely illustrated, and due praises are
          invoked.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-3.
          <i
            >"O give thanks to the Lord; for He is good; for His mercy endures
            forever. O give thanks to the God of gods; for His mercy endures
            forever. O give thanks to the Lord of Lords, for His mercy endures
            forever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In every name, under every title, in every attribute let our God be
          magnified, honored, glorified; and let the constant chorus exalt His
          ever-enduring mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4-9.
          <i
            >"To Him who alone does great wonders; for His mercy endures
            forever. To Him who by wisdom made the heavens; for His mercy
            endures forever. To Him who stretched out the earth above the
            waters; for His mercy endures forever. To Him who made great lights;
            for His mercy endures forever. The sun to rule by day; for His mercy
            endures forever. The moon and stars to rule by night; for His mercy
            endures forever."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His works of creation excite incessant praise. Infinite wisdom orders
          the whole plan. Behold the earth with all its wonders rearing its head
          above the waters. Behold the skies glorious by day, by night studded
          with lovely orbs. Surely every object bids the chorus to magnify
          ever-enduring mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10-16.<i>
            "To Him who smote Egypt in their firstborn; for His mercy endures
            forever. And brought out Israel from among them; for His mercy
            endures forever. With a strong hand, and with a stretched-out arm;
            for His mercy endures forever. To Him who divided the Red Sea into
            parts; for His mercy endures forever. And made Israel to pass
            through the midst of it; for His mercy endures forever. But
            overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea; for His mercy endures
            forever. To Him who led His people through the wilderness; for His
            mercy endures forever."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Review again His terrific judgments in Egypt. The firstborn lie dead,
          and mighty deliverance rescues His chosen people. The sea divides to
          present a dry path. Pharaoh is overwhelmed. Every incident in the
          story awakens again a tribute to ever-enduring mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          17-22.
          <i
            >"To Him who smote great kings; for His mercy endures forever. And
            slew famous kings; for His mercy endures forever. Sihon king of the
            Amorites; for His mercy endures forever. And Og the king of Bashan;
            for His mercy endures forever. And gave their land for an heritage;
            for His mercy endures forever. Even an heritage unto Israel His
            servant; for His mercy endures forever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Mark the victorious march of the beloved people. Mighty kings resist
          in vain. They lick the dust and perish. Their fair borders become the
          abode of the victorious host. Again every circumstance prompts the
          acknowledgment that His mercy endures forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          23-26.
          <i
            >"Who remembered us in our low estate; for His mercy endures
            forever; and has redeemed us from our enemies; for His mercy endures
            forever. Who gives food to all flesh; for His mercy endures forever.
            O give thanks unto the God of heaven; for His mercy endures
            forever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the signal mercies given unto ourselves especially awaken this
          chorus. Redemption is ours from all our enemies. Glory is ours forever
          and ever. Who will not shout aloud, We give thanks unto You, O God of
          heaven; we gratefully acknowledge, Your mercy endures forever!
