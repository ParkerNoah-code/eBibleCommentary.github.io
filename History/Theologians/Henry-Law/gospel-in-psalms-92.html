          Here strong exhortations enforce the duty of praise. Motives for such
          adoration are specified. May they tune our hearts to luxuriate in like
          pastures of joy!

            >"It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord, and to sing praises
            to Your name, O Most High; to show forth Your lovingkindness in the
            morning, and Your faithfulness every night, upon an instrument of
            ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn
            sound."</i

          Thanksgiving raises the heart above this lower scene. It is the melody
          which sounds in heaven. It should be the happiness of earth. Our
          mercies are boundless and unmerited. For each, warm praise should be
          uplifted.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But here our powers wane. Let us pray that the Spirit may revive and
          strengthen them. Let gratitude to God brighten the dawn of day. Let
          the last sounds of evening bear testimony to His faithfulness. Thus
          let each day declare that loving and faithful is the Lord. Every
          faculty and every means of harmony should be summoned to give aid to
          heaven-taught praise.

          A mighty motive impels the believer's heart. It is experience of God's
          wondrous dealings. Marvels of love are shown in creation, providence,
          and grace. The believer knows that all things work together for his
          good. He doubts not that goodness and mercy will follow him all the
          days of his life; that victory over all foes and impediments is before
          him; and that at last he shall reign in triumph. Can he realize these
          truths and not exult in praises?

            >"O Lord, how great are Your works! and Your thoughts are very deep.
            A brutish man knows not; neither does a fool understand this. When
            the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity
            flourish; it is those who shall be destroyed forever. But You, Lord,
            are most high forevermore. For, lo, Your enemies, O Lord, for, lo,
            Your enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be
            scattered."</i

          Ignorance of God's power encompasses the world in darkness. The
          ungodly show a flourishing appearance. They spring up in multitudes.
          But their prosperity is short-lived. God speaks and nothingness
          becomes their grave. All who oppose Him have a fruitless toil. They
          labor only to insure destruction.

            "But you have made me as strong as a wild bull. How refreshed I am
            by your power! With my own eyes I have seen the downfall of my
            enemies; with my own ears I have heard the defeat of my wicked
            opponents."

        <p align="justify">
          The ungodly will surely perish. So surely will the godly triumph.
          Mighty strength shall be supplied, which shall level mountains of
          hindrances. Joy and gladness shall be their portion. They shall
          receive the unction of the Holy One. Where are their foes? They are
          brought low. What sound reaches the ear? It is the wailing of hopeless
          agany.

          12-15.
          <i
            >"The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; he shall grow
            like a cedar in Lebanon. Those who are planted in the house of the
            Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bring
            forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; to show
            that the Lord is upright; He is my rock, and there is no
            unrighteousness in Him."</i

          Images of verdure and fertility depict the beauteous prosperity of the
          righteous. We learn too in what soil they are rooted. They are planted
          in the house of the Lord. They live in heavenly fellowship. They
          realize God's presence. They delight in His ordinances. Their
          fruitfulness is that of the choicest trees. Their last days shall be
          their best. Their works of age shall exceed those of youth. This
          assurance comes from the character of their God. Like the rock, He
          cannot be moved; and His uprightness ratifies His word. Security
          promised is security enjoyed.
