        <p align="justify">
          Repentance and contrition find vent in confession and prayer. May
          these holy exercises be the home of our souls!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. <i>"Unto You, O Lord, do I lift up my soul."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sweet are the hours of communion with God. At every moment we may draw
          near. The way stands widely open through the rent veil. Christ's body
          broken and His streaming blood procure immediate access. But true
          prayer is not formality. It is soul-work. In it the world and all its
          cares and vanities are left behind. Faith spreads rejoicing wings and
          soars above the heaven of heavens. The man of prayer lifts up his
          soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2, 3.
          <i
            >"O my God, I trust in You; let me not be ashamed; let not my
            enemies triumph over me. Yes, let none that wait on You be ashamed;
            let those be ashamed who transgress without cause."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is faith's holy privilege to deal unreservedly with God; to open
          out its real condition; to call Him to witness that all vain
          confidences are renounced, and that all trust rests on Him. Such may
          fearlessly supplicate that no disappointments may cause shame; and
          that no foes may humble them. Those who lift up the soul to God will
          lift up the head above all the fears of men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith, also, is an expansive grace. Its arms embrace all true
          believers. It strives that others should share its blessedness. But it
          well knows that shame must be the sinner's doom.
          <i
            >There can be no excuse for sin. No cause provokes it. The sinner
            sins because it is his nature and his will.

          <i
            >"Show me Your ways, O Lord; teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your
            truth, and teach me; for You are the God of my salvation; on You do
            I wait all the day. Remember, O Lord, Your tender mercies and Your
            loving kindnesses; for they have been ever of old."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith is emboldened to ask great things from knowledge of the
          character and works of God. It can appeal, 'You are the God who willed
          and wrought salvation for me; it is Your purpose and decree to save me
          to the uttermost. Hence You have given Jesus for me, and me to Jesus.'
          It can look back to a long train of tender mercies from the earliest
          days. It rejoices to count them out before the Lord. It plies the
          argument, 'You have been very gracious. You are the same. Oh! be
          gracious now'; and on these cogent grounds it bases the prayer, "Show
          me Your ways; lead me, teach me." I am blind, and prone to err. Open
          my eyes clearly at each moment to discern Your will. Take my
          outstretched hand and guide me safely in salvation's path. All the day
          I need Your help, and seek it; all the day be my ready guide.

          In the case of the ungodly, sins forgotten by him are not sins
          forgiven. In the case of the believer, sins forgiven by God are not
          obliterated from his memory. The believer often reviews his course
          from earliest years; he reads and re-reads the annals of the past.
          They are dark, and stained with countless sins and countless
          aggravations. He is humbled to the dust. But he remembers Jesus, and
          God's boundless love in Him. He flees from the court of justice to the
          throne of grace. He pleads, nor pleads in vain, that God would deal
          with him in accordance with the covenant of grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8, 9.
          <i

            the way. He will guide the meek in judgment; and He will teach the
            meek His way."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When prayer pauses, faith gathers strength in meditation. It reflects
          that God is love, and faithfulness, and truth. It refreshes itself at
          this deep well of consolation. God's goodness calls; His promises
          assure. Therefore no sinner, coming in penitence and faith, may fear
          rejection. A ready welcome will be granted. The teaching Spirit will
          guide wisely. All who are truly humbled and thus wear the livery of
          the chosen flock will tread assuredly salvation's road.

          May grace be ever ours to adhere closely to the everlasting covenant;
          to base all our hopes on Christ, its surety, in whom all its terms are
          fully satisfied, and who, by His Spirit, reveals its message to us.
          May the like grace enable us to study diligently His holy precepts,
          and to keep our feet most steadily in their path. Then how blessed
          will be our earthly course! All God's dealings with us, though
          sometimes dark to sense , will issue from unfailing love, and prove
          that His Word is immovable as the everlasting hills.

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Prayer cannot long be silent. The burden of sin will press again. It
          will again appear in aggravated colors. Its magnitude deepens the
          sense of need of pardon. It proves that there is no remedy but in free
          grace. It clearly sees that God's glory is His forgiveness of all sin
          through the blood and righteousness of Christ. It therefore descends
          more lowly in contrition's valley, and importunes more loudly that God
          would gain glory in the way of pardon. Great, indeed, is our iniquity.
          May we confess our miserable state, and not remit our cries, that
          God's glory may be great in blotting all out!

        <p align="justify">
          We do not err when we discern Christ Jesus as the high and full
          response. In Him each grace was perfect. In His earthly course His
          holy reverence was supreme. He ever knew by heavenly light His
          appointed path. His calm serenity was never ruffled. And He looked
          onward to the blissful time when His seed in countless multitudes
          should reign undoubted heirs of earth. All His children are conformed
          to His image. With lowly awe they reverence their God. His fear
          restrains the movement of their minds. His Spirit guides their steps.
          Their souls are kept in perfect peace. And in a little while the full
          delights of the millennial reign shall cause their cup to overflow.

          There are heights and depths of truth in the everlasting covenant
          which unaided man can neither reach nor fathom. The Gospel-scheme is a
          wondrous volume. No eye without God's light can rightly read its
          pages. But to all who tremble at the Word, the enlightening Spirit
          comes. He opens out the hidden mysteries. He draws aside the veil and
          shows the secret transactions in the courts of heaven; and all the
          wondrous achievements of Christ's life and death. The enraptured soul
          sees truths which angels ponder with amazement. Who can describe the
          ecstasies of this knowledge? But all the pupils in this school of
          light have one mark; they fear the Lord.

        <p align="justify">
          15, 16.
          <i
            >"My eyes are ever toward the Lord; for He shall pluck my feet out
            of the net. Turn to me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate

        <p align="justify">
          When we can realize possession of the true principles of faith, we may
          claim all its privileges. Faith's eye is fixed on God. It swerves not
          from its polar star, therefore it reaps the rich abundance of the
          promises. Deliverance from every snare is pledged. Therefore with eye
          never turning from God, the believer walks securely through a path
          beset with snares. As it moves onward it is constant in petition. It
          often feels that loneliness and trouble depress, that friends are few,
          and sorrows many; but it faints not. It has firm trust that God will
          tenderly regard; that mercy will never fail; that no billows will
          overwhelm true faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          17, 18.
          <i
            >"The troubles of my heart are enlarged; O, bring me out of my
            distresses. Look upon my affliction and my pain, and forgive all my
            sins."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The believer's day varies, as the surface of the sea. There are
          periods of lulling calm, then the billows swell and raise gigantic
          breakers. There is insight that SELF can give no help. There is the
          immediate cry to GOD, who alone can rescue. But while attention is
          implored to pains of mind and body, the <i>deepest misery</i> is
          especially remembered. There is no anguish like the sense of sin.
          Therefore the constant prayer, 'Forgive all my sin.' We may urge this
          with all boldness and all hope, for the precious blood cleanses from
          all sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19, 20.
          <i
            >"Consider my enemies, for they are many; and they hate me with
            cruel hatred. O keep my soul, and deliver me; for I put my trust in
            You."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The believer might indeed tremble, if he went forth alone to his daily
          conflict; for many are his foes, and bitter their cruel hate. Nothing
          can soothe their vengeful hostility. No pity melts within their
          breasts. But the believer has omnipotent aid beside him. If foes are
          many, the help is infinite. The humble plea, "I trust in You," will
          bring all heaven to the rescue. The trusting soul will indeed be kept.
          "O Lord, increase our faith."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          21.
          <i>"Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on You."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No grace was ever perfect but in the holy, harmless Son of God.
          Integrity was indeed the belt of His loins, and uprightness the
          sandals of His feet. But hatred of sin, and honesty of purpose, must
          be the inhabitants of our hearts. These graces prompt and strengthen
          prayer; but they are no valid grounds, claiming acceptance. For faith
          instantly looks from them to God, and adds, "I wait on You, from You
          only comes my help."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          22.<i> "Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We may boldly ply this heaven-taught prayer with our eyes fixed on
          Jesus. He is made unto us redemption from every trouble and from every
          sin. He has bought us as His own, with His most precious blood. He
          will keep us, He will bless us, as His purchased flock. Soon shall we
          know the full blessedness of this redemption. He will claim the
          purchased kingdom for His purchased flock, and they shall live and
          reign forever on redeemed ground, beneath the banners of redemption.
          Blessed Lord, hasten the time! Fully redeem Your Israel!
