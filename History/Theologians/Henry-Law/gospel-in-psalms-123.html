          Contempt and derision should quicken our flight to the mercy-seat.
        </p>

          <i>"Unto You lift I up my eyes, O You who dwell in the heavens."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist holds in his hand a cup overflowing with bitter waters of
          distress. But he knows from whom relief can be obtained. He looks
          away—He looks aloft—He looks on high—He looks to the heaven of
          heavens—He looks to his God and Father in Christ Jesus. High indeed is
          His glorious throne, but the eye of faith can reach it. It sees seated
          thereon His Father invested with all abundance of power, and beaming
          with all smiles of love. Let us fear no trouble, which brings us to
          this light.

        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
            masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress;
            so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until He has mercy upon
            us."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A homely similitude shows the intense and patient watchings of faith.
          The devoted servant diligently observes his master. He studies to
          learn his will. His desire is to execute his wishes. So faith is ever
          studious to ascertain what God would have us to do. It looks upward,
          not doubting that God will guide with His eye. Faith, also, is very
          patient. It humbly waits until mercy is given. He who thus watches
          will surely find that mercy in due time will radiantly shine forth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-4.
          <i
            >"Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us; for we are
            exceedingly filled with contempt. Our soul is exceedingly filled
            with the scorning of those who are at ease, and with the contempt of
            the proud."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The cry for mercy is strong and importunate. It will not cease until
          mercy's wings flutter around. It is especially urged by the
          contemptuous bearing of the ungodly. They scornfully deride the humble
          followers of the Lamb. But great will be the change, when the proud
          are cast into outer darkness, and the lowly raised to their eternal
          thrones. Let us be the true followers of the meek and lowly Jesus,
          that we may dwell with Him forever.
