        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The temporal prosperity of wicked men soon vanishes. True happiness is
          the portion of the godly. May such be our lot!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"Do not fret because of evil-doers, neither be envious against the
            workers of iniquity; For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,

          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wisdom here speaks from the high throne. Prosperity may smile at the
          bright circumstances of the wicked. But let not our eyes view
          grudgingly. How long will it continue? Their mirthful day is as the
          life of the frail grass. Its greenness is for a little moment; it soon
          dies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i

            and verily you shall be fed. Delight yourself also in the Lord; and
            He shall give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the
            Lord; trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass. And He shall
            bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your judgment as
            the noon-day."</i

        <p align="justify">
          We see here the path in which true blessedness abounds. It is here
          depicted as unwavering faith—the exercise of every Christian grace,
          the choice of God as all delight, and total surrender of our ways to
          Him. Then no good thing will be withheld. Every holy desire will be
          gratified. God will maintain our cause. No clouds of calumny shall
          obscure our righteous dealings. Our integrity shall brightly shine as
          the sun at midday.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

            of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked
            devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not
            yourself in anyway to do evil."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The happiest posture of the soul is calm repose in God—a patient trust
          in His all-ruling hand. The natural heart may feel the stir of
          irritation, when evil plans obtain success. Let grace prevail to
          deaden such motions, and to guide far from outbreaks of vexation.
        </p>

            they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked
            shall not be; yes, you shall diligently consider his place, and it
            shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall
            delight themselves in the abundance of peace."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Envy will die, if the true end of evil be remembered. Their transient
          joy leads to uttermost woe. Their little flare subsides in blackness
          of darkness forever. But what sweet prospects shine before the meek
          servants of the Lord! What precious promises allure them! We look for
          the new heavens and the new earth, where righteousness dwells. We know
          that yet a little while and He who shall come will come, and will not
          tarry. Then the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of
          the Lord and of His Christ, and we shall reign with Him forever and
          ever!

          <i
            >"The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes upon him with his
            teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him; for He sees that his day is
            coming. The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their
            bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of
            upright conversation. Their sword shall enter into their own heart,
            and their bows shall be broken."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are tempted to repine when all is bright around the wicked. We are
          more tempted to despond when their malignity is rampant. But how
          different will be our feeling when we discern that all their malice is
          their own injury! The Lord's hand so rules their violence, that their
          blows fall on themselves; their swords are sheathed in their own
          hearts; they fight against themselves; they shall fall self-slain.
          When faith sees things in true light, it will be no more sad. No fears
          will trouble. Security will be realized.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16, 17.
          <i
            >"A little that a righteous man has is better than the riches of
            many wicked. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but the
            Lord upholds the righteous."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The blessing of the Lord gives worth to riches, and dignifies the
          poorest lot. With the Lord's smile the humble table is rich; without
          it the tables of the wealthy contain no comfort. Soon the wicked will
          be crushed, while the righteous rise to glory!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          18, 19, 20.
          <i
            >"The Lord knows the days of the upright; and their inheritance
            shall be forever. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time; and in
            the days of famine they shall be satisfied. But the wicked shall
            perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs;
            they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All good is pledged to the sons of God in time and through eternity.
          The plenty granted to the wicked only fattens them for the day of
          slaughter. As curling smoke soon vanishes, so shall they disappear.
          May these warnings not be lost! May the Spirit bring the promises with
          power to our hearts!

            mercy and gives. For such as are blessed of Him shall inherit the

        <p align="justify">
          If abundance flows into the coffers of the wicked, it soon flows out;
          destitution then comes in. Help from others must be sought; and
          dishonesty holds back repayment. The righteous, from his humble store,
          is able to be kind and generous. The blessing of the Lord is on them,
          and shall place them as heirs of that world where all things are new.
          But the curse devotes the wicked to eternal woe.

            the Lord upholds him with His hand."</i

          What precious truths here offer comfort! Our path seems sometimes to
          be dark; but let us seek the Spirit's guidance, and plead this
          promise, which ensures right direction, and God's smile upon our path.
          Our weak steps too often totter, and Satan seems ready to cast us
          down; but help from heaven is near. We are not left to lie in mire of
          sin. We are not finally cast off. God's hand uplifts us, and gives
          sure support until life's journey ends.

          The Psalmist states the experience of a long life. Kindness and
          liberality are signs of grace. The good man leaves a legacy of
          blessing to his children. The smile of the Lord shines upon children's
          children.

            loves judgment, and forsakes not His saints; they are preserved
            forever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. The righteous

          The Spirit multiplies grand promises to enrich the followers of
          Christ. What a cluster here sparkles! The love of God will always beam
          upon their path. No real desertion shall ever leave them helpless.
          Security is the realm in which they dwell. The full inheritance of
          faith is theirs. Eternity is the measure of their happiness. May the
          Spirit fix these truths upon our hearts, and help us mightily to
          depart from evil, and to do good! May our holiness be sure evidence
          that we have received grace!

          Here is the portrait of the blessed Jesus. Grace was ever poured upon
          His lips. His words were perfect wisdom. His heart was love without
          alloy. His feet were ever steadfast in untainted holiness. Such is our
          bright example. May our distinction ever be the mouth of wisdom, the
          innocent tongue, the heart of love, the upright walk!

          The words are primarily predictive of our ever-blessed <i> Head</i>.
          Spies marked His words and ways. The cry was, Crucify Him! Crucify
          Him! A mock trial preceded condemnation. But iniquity could not
          prevail. He rose the Conqueror of death. He mounted to the right hand
          of God.

          The <i>servants</i> must not expect to find more kindness. But let not

          A vivid picture shows how short-lived is ungodly prosperity. We see a
