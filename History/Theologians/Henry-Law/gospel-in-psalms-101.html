        <p align="justify">
          Rules are prescribed for godly government. Advice is given to those
          who exercise authority. May all take heed; for to each some influence
          belongs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"I will sing of mercy and judgment; unto You, O Lord, will I sing.
            I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when will You come
            unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Praise is the inhabitant of the godly heart. The Psalmist engages that
          songs to the Lord shall be his glad employ. Mercy and judgment compose
          the happy theme. To think of God's mercy is the delight of delights.
          To utter its praise is a foretaste of heaven. Judgment, also, claims
          its place. The Lord is not slow to vindicate what is the right. His
          righteous dealings should be magnified continually.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the mercy and the judgment, which are the attributes of the Lord,
          should also be the characteristics of magisterial rulers. Those who
          are invested with the exercise of authority should realize that they
          are ordained by God to represent Him. Therefore His mode of governing
          should be their studied pattern. But left to themselves men are poor
          and ignorant and weak. Every man in his best estate is altogether
          vanity. Hence our prayer for the teaching and indwelling of the Spirit
          should be earnest and incessant. Oh, when will You come unto me? His
          presence is light and strength and power. It never is denied to those
          who truly serve and seek Him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He who has My commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves Me. And
          he who loves Me shall be loved of My Father, and We will come to him,
          and take up Our abode with him. Thus the pious man looks up for
          heavenly aid, and resolves that he will act with wisdom and
          discretion. He will diligently watch that no flaw shall stain his
          godly walk. His heart shall be wholly given to the Lord; and the heart
          is the rudder of all conduct.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"I will set no wicked thing before my eyes; I hate the work of
            those who turn aside; it shall not cleave to me."</i

        <p align="justify">
          He will guard the portal of every sense. If evil is before him, he
          will close his eyes, lest some pollution should gain entrance. He will
          utterly abhor the works of those who deviate from the path of piety.
          Their work shall be shunned with disgust.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know a wicked
            person.</i
          >"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The world abounds with self-willed and perverse rebels. They submit to
          no righteous rule. These shall be banished from the sight of the
          righteous. No wicked man shall be among their friends. Their joy shall
          be in the select company of the godly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-8.
          <i
            >"Whoever privily slanders his neighbor, him will I cut off; he who
            has a high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. My eyes shall
            be upon the faithful of the land, that he may dwell with me who
            walks in a perfect way, he shall serve me. He who works deceit shall
            not dwell within my house; he who tells lies shall not tarry in my
            sight. I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may
            cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Truth and uprightness shall adorn their attendants. The faithful and
          the holy shall have office in their house. Wickedness shall be utterly
          expelled. Surely here is a picture of the blessed household of the
          King of kings. It is written, Your people shall be all righteous; they
          shall inherit the land forever, the branch of My planting, the work of
          My hands, that I may be glorified. If earthly rulers should be
          surrounded by a godly retinue, surely this rule will order the
          celestial court. Have we by faith put on the garment of salvation, the
          spotless robe of Christ's obedience? Have we received the Spirit to
          sanctify each movement of our hearts? Such is the glorious company of
          the celestial home.
