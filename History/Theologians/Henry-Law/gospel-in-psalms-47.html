        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          A view is presented of the kingdom of Christ most gloriously
          established, and universal praises are evoked.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"O clap your hands, all you people; shout to God with the voice of
            triumph. For the Lord most High is awesome; He is a great King over
            all the earth."</i

        <p align="justify">
          A note of rapturous prediction pervades this hymn. The day of glory is
          anticipated, when angels' voices shall proclaim that the kingdoms of
          this world have become the kingdoms of our God, and of His Christ, and
          He shall reign forever and ever. The word is now verified, "In You
          shall all the families of the earth be blessed." The Jewish Church
          shall expand her arms to embrace the called of the Gentiles—and they
          are received as fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of
          His promise in Christ. The Lord is magnified in all His power and
          majesty—the terribleness of His vengeance over all who yielded not
          obedience to His sway is dreadfully displayed—and on His head are
          crowns of supremacy over all the earth. Oh! day of gladness, and
          unspeakable delight! The happy subjects of these joyful realms are
          stirred up to show their ecstasy by every sign. We, also, in prospect
          of such happiness, should shout our praises and proclaim our triumph.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3, 4.
          <i
            >"He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
            feet. He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of
            Jacob whom He loved."</i
          >

        <p align="justify">
          Many and mighty were the enemies of Christ's kingdom—long and fierce
          was the conflict. At times the ungodly seemed to prevail, and the palm
          of victory seemed to be in their hands. But now Christ is gloriously
          triumphant. His foes all lick the dust; the feet of His people trample
          upon the subjugated hosts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The division of Canaan among the tribes was proof of His providential
          care. The same care still guards all temporal matters for us. As Jacob
          excelled Esau in his inherited blessings, so Christ's people inherit
          all good things—things present and things to come. Christ loves them
          with an everlasting love; He loves them and rejoices over them to do
          them good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5, 6, 7.
          <i
            >"God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
            Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing
            praises. For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with
            understanding."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Christ is now exhibited in another aspect of His glory, that
          thanksgiving may be more fervently awakened. He is presented to the
          eye of faith as ascending to the heaven of heavens, to take His seat
          on the right hand of the Majesty of high. Attending angels shout, and
          welcoming hosts re-echo the glad sound. Are conquerors thus welcomed
          when they return in triumph—and shall not all tokens of joy sound the
          praises of Jesus returning from His glorious victory?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us, for whom the victory is achieved, sing praises; yes, sing
          praises with understanding. Let us thoroughly discern the causes of
          our joy. It is because Jesus has vanquished our every foe; has
          gloriously accomplished our full redemption—has finished the
          undertaken work, and has saved us with an everlasting salvation. Let
          us ponder the work until its length and breadth be fully grasped; and
          let every discovery stir us up to sing praises with understanding.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8, 9.
          <i
            >"God reigns over the heathen; God sits upon the throne of His
            holiness. The princes of the people are gathered together, even the
            people of the God of Abraham; for the kings of the earth belong to
            God; He is greatly exalted."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Joy would ever brighten in the dwellings of the righteous, if the
          truth were always before their eyes, that God sits supreme upon the
          throne of His holiness. The kings of the earth are mighty, but all
          their power is derived from Him. As shields they give protection, but
          His hand is over all. Greatly He is exalted. Let Him be greatly
          extolled. Let us sing praises, sing praises, with understanding.
