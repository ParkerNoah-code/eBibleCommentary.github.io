        <p align="justify">
          We are enjoined to give earnest heed to the words spoken from heaven.
          A dark display of Israel's ingratitude and rebellion follows. God's
          repeated and abundant mercies seem only to awaken evil. May the sad
          example be a profitable warning!

            of my mouth. I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark
            sayings of old; which we have heard and known, and our fathers have
            told us. We will not hide them from their children, showing to the
            generation to come the praises of the Lord, and His strength, and
            His wonderful works that He has done. For He established a testimony
            in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our
            fathers, that they should make them known to their children; that
            the generation to come might know them, even the children which
            should be born; who should arise and declare them to their
            children."</i

          This introduction claims especial notice. We often crave audience of
          God. He here calls us to incline our ears to His instruction. Let us
          be quick to hear. His revelation is the truth of truths, the light of
          light, the joy of joys, wisdom in the highest. Not only should we
          read, and mark, and learn; we should impress these doctrines on our
          offspring. Fathers should teach their children; and children's
          children should in turn transmit.

            heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God. The
            children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in
            the day of battle. They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to
            walk in His law; and forgot His works, and His wonders that He had
            shown them."</i

          Bible-study quickens grace. By pondering God's works of old,
          confidence will strengthen and hope become more bright. We shall
          tremble, also, at the dreadful iniquity of Israel's sons. They
          quenched the recollection of the repeated mercies, which blessed their
          fathers. Armor was provided for them, but they refused to stand firm,
          and fled before their foes. They closed their eyes, and would not see
          His arm extended for their help.

            to pass through; and He made the waters to stand as n heap. In the
            daytime also He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a
            light of fire. He split the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them
            drink as out of the great depths. He brought streams also out of the
            rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers."</i

          A recapitulation follows of the wonders which cradled the childhood of
          His people. In this history, God's character—His love, His might—is
          written as with a sunbeam. No enemies could crush. No perils could
          destroy. Impossibilities vanished. He made the waters of the deep to
          be a highway for their feet. The mighty billows stood as a wall on
          their right hand and on their left. That their journey might be safe,
          a cloud from heaven preceded their march by day, and a canopy of fire
          shone over them at night. Does thirst oppress them? The hard rock
          opens its flinty sides, and refreshing streams flow in their rear.
          Miracle followed miracle, proclaiming His unceasing care.

          <i

            the wilderness. And they tempted God in their heart by asking food
            for their lust. Yes, they spoke against God; they said, Can God
            furnish a table in the wilderness? Behold, He smote the rock, so
            that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can He give
            bread also? can He provide flesh for His people? Therefore the Lord
            heard this, and was angry; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and
            anger also came up against Israel; because they believed not in God,
            and trusted not in His salvation, though He had commanded the clouds
            from above, and opened the doors of heaven, and had rained down
            manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the bread of heaven.
            Man ate angels' food; He sent them food to the full."</i

          Can it be that such miracles of love could fail to melt their hearts;
          and that such evidence of fatherly guardianship should allow rebellion
          still to live! Alas! abundant kindness awakened superabundant sin!
          They sneered at past lovingkindness. They allowed that their thirst
          had been relieved; but they doubted whether food could similarly be
          provided! Can we marvel that God's wrath went forth, and that fire
          raged in their camp?
          <i>
            While we bless God for His goodness, let us remember that to
            hardened rebels He is a consuming fire.

            brought in the south wind. He rained flesh also upon them as dust,
            and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea. And He let it fall
            in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. So they
            ate, and were well filled; for He gave them their own desire; they
            were not estranged from their lust."</i

          How striking is this instance of God's forbearance! Tender compassion
          checks the outbursts of just vengeance. Instead of punishing, He
          gratifies their impious desires. He sent the food which they believed
          He could not grant. He multiplied it beyond their power to gather.
          They fed until their appetite was more than sated.

            came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the
            chosen men of Israel. For all this they sinned still, and believed
            not for His wondrous works."</i

          Let presumptuous rebels tremble. Wrath may linger, but delay is not
          forgiveness. In due time it will blaze forth, and terrible will be the
          results. The dreadful sequel shows this truth. While they feasted,
          vengeance fell. The richest and the mightiest found no refuge in their
          high estate. They perished with the lowest in the camp. But the hard
          hearts, unmelted by the plenty, and unappalled by wrath, grew more
          daring in rebellious feeling. They had no confidence in His goodness,
          no fear of His anger. Reprobate is the case which neither mercy nor
          sternness leads to submission.

            trouble. When He slew them, then they sought Him; and they returned
            and enquired early after God. And they remembered that God was their
            rock, and the high God their redeemer. Nevertheless they flattered
            Him with their mouth, and they lied to Him with their tongues. For
            their heart was not right with Him, neither were they steadfast in
            His covenant."</i

          Their troubles were continued. The scourge drove them to seek relief;
          but their outward change was not inward conversion. In semblance they
          became other men; but the same features were behind the mask. With
          utterance they seemingly drew near; but falsehood dwelt on their lips.
          They were not slow to promise; but their unstable minds were like the
          leaking sieve. They made a covenant; but it was only to break it.

        <p align="justify">
          38-41.
          <i

            destroyed them not; yes, many times He turned His anger away, and
            did not stir up all His wrath. For He remembered that they were but
            flesh; a wind that passes away, and comes not again. How often they
            provoked Him in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert! Yes,
            they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of
            Israel."</i

        <p align="justify">
          But still compassion is not utterly exhausted. Our God is infinite in
          all His attributes. He pitied them still, and held back the arm
          uplifted to destroy. He remembered their utter feebleness. For a
          little season only they sojourned on earth. We hear the wind, but it
          soon is gone. So from this scene they would be quickly taken, and
          their places would be no more found. To enumerate their sins exceeds
          all power. So, also, to enumerate God's acts of goodness. While we
          shudder at their vileness, let us adore forbearing mercy.

            wonders in the field of Zoan; And had turned their rivers into
            blood; and their floods that they could not drink. He sent different
            kinds of flies among them; which devoured them; and frogs, which
            destroyed them. He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and
            their labor to the locust. He destroyed their vines with hail, and
            their sycamore trees with frost. He gave up their cattle also to the

          Great had been their deliverance. They well knew God's terrible acts
          upon their foes. He had shown that all instruments of vengeance
          subserved His will. All creation at His bidding would arise to plague.
          Their annals were the record of His power to avenge. But vain was the
          lesson. Provocation was their rule.

            indignation, and trouble, by sending destroying angels among them.
            He made a way for His anger; He spared not their soul from death,
            but gave their life over to the pestilence; and smote all the
            first-born in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles

          The evidence is clear that God, who delights in mercy, can righteously
          execute severity. Ah, sin! what have you done? Let us ponder and be
