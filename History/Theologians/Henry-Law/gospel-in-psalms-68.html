        <p align="justify">
          Happy was the occasion of this hymn. David was permitted to see the
          joyful day when the ark, the type of the blessed Jesus, was brought to
          its resting-place in Zion. It was a fit occasion for joy and gladness;
          and joy and gladness were largely manifested. The hymn thus used looks
          back to the history, and looks onward to the time when Jesus, having
          subdued all foes, ascends in triumph to the heaven of heavens. God's
          mercies are throughout abundantly proclaimed. May we realize these
          mercies, and call upon our every faculty to give praise!

            hate Him flee before Him. As smoke is driven away, so drive them
            away; as wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the
            presence of God. But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice
            before God; yes, let them exceedingly rejoice."</i

          God's glory is most dear to all His people. It is their anguish when
          His name is blasphemed and His cause reviled. Therefore their constant
          aspiration that God would arise and gird Himself with strength, and
          drive His foes into perdition. The prayer continually goes up that
          this ruin may be complete. Let smoke ascend in thick clouds and darken
          all the view. Let now a breeze arise; the mass immediately dissolves,
          and vanishes from sight. So let the enemies of God be driven into
          nothingness. As the wax seems to be a solid mass, but instantly
          dissolves and flows away when heat is applied, so let these enemies
          melt and be nowhere found; but let the righteous rejoice in God's
          gladdening favor; let there be no bounds to their exulting praise.

            dwelling is holy. God places the lonely in families; he sets the
            prisoners free and gives them joy. But for rebels, there is only
            famine and distress."</i

          How abundant are the topics of our praise! Who can reach the
          heights—who can fathom the depths—who can measure the infinitudes of
          the incommunicable name, Jehovah! This tells His glory as the cause of
          His own being, as the giver of life to all who live. Above the heaven
          of heavens He sits, thus surpassing all thoughts of glory. We cannot
          praise Him according to His greatness, but let us praise Him according
          to our abilities. But though He is thus infinitely great, He
          condescends to look in pity on the feeblest and weakest of our race;
          He supplies parental support to poor orphans; He does not permit the
          widow to be oppressed; He causes the inmates of the house to rejoice
          in happy fellowship, and mutually to supply each other's need; He
          delivers from captivity those who have been bound with fetters, and
          leads forth His people from Egyptian bondage.

          It is faith's happy exercise to fly back and ponder all God's gracious
          dealings from the birth of time. On all there is inscribed the
          evidence of His gracious care. All His attributes are manifested
          planning and executing mercies for His people. In the work past we
          have assurance of His present care and of His never-failing
          providence. He who loved the fathers of our family still loves with
          the same love, and will love forever. The Psalmist reverts to God's
          wondrous goodness as He preceded His people through the wilderness.
          The redemption from Egypt's bondage is a pledge of our redemption from
          the captivity of sin and Satan. The awesome marvels displayed on
          Sinai, when the Mount trembled, and terror shook all hearts, teach us
          to this day to regard with awe the majesty of our God.

          Did God supply the need of the camp? Did manna never cease to fall and
          the stream to trickle? So to the present hour His bounty sustains and

          It is not the Lord's will that His goodness should be disregarded or
          unacknowledged. Therefore in every age He has raised up faithful men
          to bear record of His grace and love. How earnestly should we pray
          that He would supply a band of faithful ministers, and give them the
          tidings that they should proclaim. Then all enemies will flee, and the
          weakest will be enriched with spoil.

          The Lord's people sometimes lie in depths of degradation, and their
          hands are soiled by servile work. In Egypt the children of Israel were
          debased to the drudgery of the lowest slaves; but the time of vile
          service passed away, and they shone brightly as the honored and
          admired upon earth. They changed their garbs of degradation for the
          splendor of magnificent estate. When in Canaan, God appeared in their
          behalf, and the frightened kings fled in vain for concealment; then
          they shone forth arrayed in panoply of royal state; the snow-capped
          mountain glittering beneath the sun's rays was an emblem of their high
          supremacy. Believers now may be poorly clad in clothing of corruption;
          but yet a little while, and their corruptible shall put on
          incorruption, and they shall shine arrayed in glory far brighter than
          the sun in his strength.

          Zion is here presented to admiration as far surpassing in beauty all
          surrounding heights. This Zion is a type of the Church of Christ.
          Where shall we find words to commend its all-surpassing beauty? It is
          beautified with the glories of salvation, and shines as the chosen,
          the beloved, the honored of the Lord. How utterly vain is the
          self-exaltation of other institutions! how contemptible their puny
          efforts to aggrandize themselves! They are of the earth and earthy,
          and with the earth shall be laid low. The Church is of heaven and
          heavenly. It is the chosen abode of God. God is in the midst of her,
          therefore she shall not be moved. He dwells forever in her as His
          favored abode. Never will He leave her or desert her. Salvation is her
          walls and bulwarks. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but God will
          rest forever in His loved abode.

          The terrors of Sinai are an instructive study. God is represented as
          moving in majestic procession, attended by countless hosts of angels.
          Let us clasp to our hearts the precious knowledge that He sends forth
          these spirits to be our constant guardians and to minister to our
          protection. The ark ascending Zion's hill has a prophetic voice. It
          foreshadows our Jesus returning to take His seat at God's right hand,
          the mighty Conqueror over sin and death and hell, and all the legion
          who had fought against Him. The cruel enemy who had subjugated man is
          dragged as a captive fast bound to our Lord's victorious chariot. The
          Conqueror receives for His people the gifts and graces which He had so
          gloriously won; He pours down sanctifying graces into His people's
          hearts, that so their hearts may be a fit abode for the indwelling
          God.

            the head of His enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goes
            on still in his trespasses. The Lord said, I will bring again from
            Bashan; I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea;
            that your foot may be dipped in the blood of your enemies, and the

          The goodness of our God each day heaps blessings on us so vast that we
          can scarcely bear the load; for each, responsive thanks should swell
          to heaven. His crowning blessing is eternal salvation and deliverance
          from the grasp of death. Let us study the title—"God of our
          salvation." Let us study the blessing—Escape from "the issues of
          death." But while His people thus live and are thus saved, what
          terrors overwhelm the wretched multitudes who reject His offers of
          pardon and of life! What dreadful images predict their doom!

          worship should exhibit God in the wonders of His grace and love, His
          power and glory. We should attend the service of the sanctuary with
          hearts intent to learn saving lessons of redemption's design and work.

          Every faculty and every arrangement should be devoted to render due

          used to teach the truth that devotion should engage all our powers.
          Now that the true light shines and symbols have passed away, the
