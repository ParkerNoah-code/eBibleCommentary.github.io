        <p align="justify">
          Praise is the Psalmist's sweet employ. God's claims to praise are
          stated. May they attune our hearts to sing the heavenly theme!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul. While I live will I
            praise the Lord; I will sing praises to my God while I have my
            being."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Gratitude demands that praise should be our untiring exercise. Its
          performance brings delight. Happy are the hours thus consecrated. Thus
          earth assimilates to heaven, where Hallelujahs are the constant sound.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-4.
          <i
            >"Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
            there is no help. His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth; in
            that very day his thoughts perish."</i

          It is a natural tendency to be influenced by external facade. Hence it
          is a common fault to court the favor of the rich and great. We are
          prone to lean on their support, and to look to them for help. But
          every man in his best estate is empty worthlessness. The Lord speaks,
          and thrones crumble. The Lord speaks, and the palace is exchanged for
          the grave. Tibni diesâ€”Omri reigns. The grandest prince is but dust;
          and to dust he must return.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-7.
          <i
            >"Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is
            in the Lord his God; who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
            that therein is; who keeps truth forever. Who executes judgment for
            the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry."</i

        <p align="justify">
          While men are emptiness, sufficiency abounds in God. Happy are those
          who find safe shelter in His covering wings. Think of His boundless
          power. The heavens, the earth, and all therein are the creation of His
          will. Precious is His treasury of promises. Not one of them shall ever
          fail. Their payment may be desired at the mercy-seat, and surely they
          will be redeemed. Many foes oppress His servants, but their efforts
          are impotent. The cause of the righteous is vindicated. None prevail
          against them. All their need, also, is supplied. They lie down in
          green pastures; beside still waters they repose.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8-10.
          <i
            >"The Lord frees the prisoners; the Lord opens the eyes of the
            blind; the Lord raises those who are bowed down; the Lord loves the
            righteous. The Lord preserves the strangers; He relieves the
            fatherless and widow; but the way of the wicked He turns upside
            down. The Lord shall reign forever, even your God, O Zion, to all
            generations. Praise the Lord."</i

          Precious lessons are learned from contemplating God's gracious
          dealings. His people are born in the prison-house of Satan. God
          removes the shackles; they go forth free. They are blind by nature. He
          opens their eyes to see all the wonders of redeeming love. Heavy
          burdens often oppress them. He enables them to lay aside every weight
          so as to run with patience the heavenward road. He delights to cheer
          them with manifestations of His love. They are strangers and pilgrims
          in an enemy's land. He is their constant guardian. In family
          destitution He brings relief. But just wrath burns fiercely against
          His adversaries forever and forever. God shall reign inhabiting the
          praises of His people. Bless the Lord, O our souls. Amen.
