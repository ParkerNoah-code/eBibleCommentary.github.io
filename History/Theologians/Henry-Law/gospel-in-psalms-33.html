        <p align="justify">
          All praise is due to God, for all He is—for all that He has done. May
          we begin the praise which shall not end!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2, 3.<i>
            "Let the godly sing with joy to the Lord, for it is fitting to
            praise him. Praise the Lord with melodies on the lyre; make music
            for him on the ten-stringed harp. Sing new songs of praise to him;
            play skillfully on the harp and sing with joy."</i

        <p align="justify">
          When we realize the blessings of salvation, we must feel that every
          breath should praise the Lord; and our whole life should be
          thanksgiving. We should awaken every power, and enlist all art to
          magnify His name. This service is God's due, and should be duly
          rendered.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4, 5.
          <i
            >"For the word of the Lord is right; and all His works are done in
            truth. He loves righteousness and judgment; the earth is full of the
            goodness of the Lord."</i

          His Word, His works call loudly for this tribute. They dazzle with the
          luster of perfection. It must be so, for they spring from a fountain
          which is pure holiness. Survey the earth in all its marvelous variety.
          Each object, seen by faith's enlightened eye, shows the impress of
          benevolence.

        <p align="justify">
          6, 7, 8, 9.
          <i
            >"The Lord merely spoke, and the heavens were created. He breathed
            the word, and all the stars were born. He gave the sea its
            boundaries and locked the oceans in vast reservoirs. Let everyone in
            the world fear the Lord, and let everyone stand in awe of him. For
            when he spoke, the world began! It appeared at his command."</i

        <p align="justify">
          We adore the glory of the eternal Trinity. We adore the Word,
          co-eternal and co-efficient with the Father. By Him were all things
          made, and without Him was not anything made that was made. We adore
          the Spirit moving upon the face of the waters. We adore triune
          omnipotence. Without effort or tedious process the word is spoken, and
          all creation bolts into life, confirmed in perfect beauty. Who will
          not reverence such glorious power? Throughout earth's length and
          breadth, man's posture should be reverence and awe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10, 11.
          <i
            >"The Lord brings the counsel of the heathen to nothing; He makes
            the devices of the people of no effect. The counsel of the Lord
            stands forever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations."</i

        <p align="justify">
          But man in proud madness plots against Almightiness. The result has
          ever been the same. God's glory shines more gloriously. Opponents
          perish in shame and merited confusion. So it must ever be. The glories
          of eternity, the hallelujahs of the ransomed, will proclaim that all
          His purposes have triumphed; that all His plans have prospered; that
          all His people are forever saved; that all His foes are brought to
          nothing.

        <p align="justify">
          Among the multitudes of earth, happy are those who reject all idols
          and all vain confidence, and choose the Lord to be their God. They are
          blessed beyond what word can speak, or thought conceive. They are the
          loved from eternity. They are the called of the Spirit. They choose
          Him because He first chose them. They fly to Him, because He bends
          their will, and gives them power.

        <p align="justify">
          13, 14, 15.
          <i
            >"The Lord looks from heaven; He beholds all the sons of men. From
            the place of His habitation He looks upon all the inhabitants of the
            earth. He fashions their hearts alike; He considers all their
            works."</i

        <p align="justify">
          An eye from heaven pervades the world. It penetrates all space and
          looks internally into every breast. There is no heart which His hand
          framed not. And every step is exposed to His omniscience.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16, 17.
          <i
            >"The best-equipped army cannot save a king, nor is great strength
            enough to save a warrior. Don't count on your warhorse to give you
            victory—for all its strength, it cannot save you."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Real strength is not in earthly things. Those who seek help below the
          heavens seek it from a source too low. God only is real power. Much
          more will they find disappointment who trust to self in matters of
          salvation. Christ wrought it out. Christ only gives.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          18, 19.
          <i
            >"Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon those who fear Him, upon those
            who hope in His mercy; to deliver their soul from death, and to keep
            them alive in famine."</i

        <p align="justify">
          God's children have most beautiful lineaments (or features). They
          reverently fear; they confidently trust. They are well known in
          heaven. He who gave grace, discerns it. They may be brought into
          distress, but they come forth uninjured. At last they reach the haven
          of eternal life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          20, 21, 22.
          <i
            >"Our soul waits for the Lord; He is our help and our shield. For
            our heart shall rejoice in Him; because we have trusted in His holy
            name. Let Your mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we hope in
            You."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith is a happy grace. Indeed, no true joy lives except as springing
          from this root. Is it not joy to feel equipped against every foe? What
          can injure those who have God for their shield? What can effectually
          resist those who have God for their help?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But in all joy faith is most humble. In its most lofty song, it bows
          the knee. In its most happy hope it cries for mercy. Let Your mercy, O
          Lord, be upon us, according as we hope in You. Such is our prayer. Let
          speedy answers come!
