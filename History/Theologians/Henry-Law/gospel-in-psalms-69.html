        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist is involved in intensity of misery. The severest troubles
          in every form assail him. The downfall of his enemies is foreshadowed,
          and the conclusion of the hymn is praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"Save me, O God; for the waters have come in to my soul. I sink in
            deep mire, where there is no standing; I have come into deep waters
            where the floods overflow me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The picture is exhibited of a drowning man. He sinks in overwhelming
          waters. There is no standing for his feet. There is no rescue for him
          from immediate ruin and a watery grave. In this scene of misery we see
          the man over whom the waves of affliction pitilessly break.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the picture mainly represents the blessed Jesus. What sorrow ever
          was like His sorrow when He trod earth's path in human guise! Satan
          assailed Him with his utmost fury. No rest, no respite was permitted.
          This arch foe, also, stirred up ungodly men to wound Him with all the
          darts of malice and of rage. Jesus well knew that 'earth' could bring
          no help. He looked above, and prayed; "Save me, O God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.
          <i
            >"I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; my eyes fail while I
            wait for my God."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Incessant supplications tested His powers of utterance. He ceased not
          to pour forth cries. He looked above for support. He watched for
          replies until His failing eyes were dim.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4-5.
          <i
            >"Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my
            head; those who would destroy me, being my enemies wrongfully, are
            mighty; then I restored that which I took not away. O God, You know
            my foolishness; and my sins are not hidden from You."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Jesus appeals to God that all this enmity, proceeding from such a host
          of mighty foes, was utterly without a cause. The persecution was
          wrongful malice. He did no wrong. His work was to render good for
          evil. He here allows that, though guiltless in Himself, He stood
          before God as laden with all the follies and all the sins of His
          people. He received the burden transferred by God to Him, and
          acknowledged His <i> imputed</i> guilt.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6-8.<i>
            "Let not those who wait on You, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for
            my sake; let not those who seek You be confounded for my sake, O God
            of Israel. Because for Your sake I have borne reproach; shame has
            covered my face. I have become a stranger to my brethren, and an
            alien unto my mother's children."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A new petition is preferred. Its intensity is seen by the strong
          expressions in which God is invoked; as the Lord God of hosts, clothed
          with universal power; as the God of Israel, loving His people with
          everlasting love. The petition is that the righteous who wait on God
          and seek His face should never be disheartened or cast down by sight
          of the troubles which were so multiplied. He deeply felt that
          reproaches were heaped upon Him; but feeling that they arose from His
          faithfulness to God, He drew encouragement from them in His approaches
          to the mercy-seat. Reproaches for the cause of God are highest honor.
          <i
            >God's smile will more than compensate for all the sneers of man.</i
          >
          But it is a grievous trial when those who are brought up in the same
          home, and are most closely joined by ties of blood, stand apart and
          evidence their alienation. Jesus knew this trial. His own brethren
          believed not on Him. The children brought up in His reputed father's
          house did not uphold Him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9-12.
          <i
            >"For the zeal of your house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of
            those who reproached You have fallen upon me. When I wept, and
            chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. I made
            sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them. Those who
            sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the
            drunkards."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Intensity of zeal for true religion often occasions the derision of
          the wicked. The disciples remembered this word when they witnessed
          Christ's indignation in the polluted Temple. How keenly, also, were
          Christ's feelings moved when He heard His Father's name blasphemed. No
          pious conduct could check the impious sneer. Every kind of insult met
          Him. Even those who sat in the seats of justice refrained not their
          lips from slander, and the very drunkards made Him the jest of their
          insulting songs.

          <i>How keen must have been the sufferings of the Lamb of God.</i> Let
          us do not forget that they were all endured for us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13.
          <i
            >"But as for me, my prayer is unto You, O Lord, in an acceptable
            time; O God, in the multitude of Your mercy hear me, in the truth of
            Your salvation."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We draw sweet profit from affliction's cup when prayer is quickened by
          it, and trouble has no depths from which the face of God may not be
          seen. Therefore prayer is plied in the assurance that acceptance will
          not be denied. The time is always acceptable. Answers are always ready
          when supplications plead the name of Jesus. "He ever lives to make
          intercession for us." God's mercy, also, and His covenant engagements,
          are prevailing pleas. Mercy ceases to be mercy, truth fails, if
          faithful prayer should not be heard.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          14-15.
          <i
            >"Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be
            delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters. Let
            not the water flood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up,
            and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Troubles are again compared to deep and overwhelming water-floods, but
          God's helping hand is able to extricate from all the mire and all the
          depths; and prayer wrestles that this hand would help.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16.
          <i
            >"Hear me, O Lord; for Your lovingkindness is good; turn to me
            according to the multitude of Your tender mercies."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Love is here seen as the source and origin of all God's gracious
          dealings. He loves, therefore He withholds nothing that is good; He
          loves, therefore He crowns us with lovingkindness. He has revealed His
          name as Love. On that name we may rest all our supplications.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His name, also, is Merciful. He is rich in mercy. His mercy reaches
          unto the heavens. His mercy endures forever. His mercies exceed all
          number; and as is their number, so is their tenderness. They will
          never fail, who pray to be dealt with according to the multitude of
          God's tender mercies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          17-18.
          <i
            >"And hide not Your face from Your servant; for I am in trouble;
            hear me speedily. Draw near to my soul, and redeem it; deliver me,
            because of my enemies."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When troubles darken around, it is faith's province to seek the light
          of God's countenance. If clouds should veil God's smile, trouble would
          indeed oppress. Faith knows this well, and is earnest for speedy help.
          If answers have long delay, then affliction is affliction indeed. But
          faith will follow God with cries, that He would in mercy draw near. It
          pleads; 'The enemy is near; come quickly to my help.' Such pleading
          will prevail. For sure is the promise, "Draw near to God, and He will
          draw near to you."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19.
          <i
            >"You have known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor; my
            adversaries are all before You."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The believer's heart is comforted by the knowledge that his God is
          ever by his side. A voice is ever ringing in his ear, "Do not fear
          not, for I am with you." God's eye surveys his path. His ear receives
          his every breathing. He marks his every circumstance. All the
          malevolence of adversaries is clearly known. Therefore help in every
          hour of need may surely be expected.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          20-21.
          <i
            >"Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness; and I
            looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for
            comforters, but I found none. They gave Me also gall for My food;
            and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But still reproaches inflict painful wounds. Jesus drank this cup. His
          holy nature would peculiarly feel the painful touch of hellish malice.
          In our afflictions, also, the sympathy of friends gives sweet relief.
          This was denied to Jesus. In His deepest woe no human arm was
          stretched to help Him. The Spirit here takes us distinctly to the
          Cross. We see the fulfillment of this cruel mockery when, to the
          parched lips of Jesus, they extended a sponge filled with vinegar, and
          put it to His mouth. What misery was ever like His misery! But His
          sufferings were vicarious, and by His stripes we are healed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          22-24.
          <i
            >"Let their table become a snare before them; and that which should
            have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. Let their eyes be
            darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to
            shake. Pour out Your indignation upon them, and let Your wrathful
            anger take hold of them."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Spirit proceeds to predict the terrible vengeance which must fall
          upon Christ's foes. The believer reads the terrible decree, and meekly
          bows his head. He humbly acquiesces in the Lord's predicted wrath. He
          knows that God is love, and that in love He will do all things well.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us turn from the appalling picture, blessing from our hearts our
          gracious Lord, who saves His people from all the penalties of sin;
          and, waiting for His return from heaven, "whom God raised from the
          dead, even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          25.
          <i

            tents."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Judas stands as a dreadful monument of the fulfillment of this verse.
          In his miserable case we learn how surely the predicted wrath will
          come. There may be respite, but respite is not a full pardon. What God
          has righteously announced He will most righteously perform. What Truth
          has uttered shall be truly done. Let the ungodly take warning. The
          unrighteous shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the
          righteous into life eternal. Indignation and wrath, tribulation and
          anguish, are the sinner's inevitable doom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          26.
          <i
            >"For they persecute Him whom You have smitten; and they talk to the
            grief of those whom You have wounded."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The main feature of their sin is effort to destroy the cause of
          Christ. It pleased the Lord to bruise Him. He was smitten by the hand
          of <i>justice</i> for our iniquities; He was wounded for our
          transgressions; but the malice and hostility of <i>man</i> added great
          burdens to His crushed spirit. The persecution of Jesus extends to the
          persecution of all His members. The arresting voice checks Paul in his
          infuriate career; "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"
        </p>

          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is their miserable case that they are permitted to go on from sin
          to sin, and thus to fill up the measure of their iniquity. The decree
          has gone forth, "They are joined to idols; let them alone." No melting
          word softens their obdurate hearts; no converting grace turns them
          from the downward path. They never reach the happy land, in which all
          are clad in the beauties of God's righteousness. Their names cannot be
          found in the book of the living or in the catalogue of the righteous.

        <p align="justify">
          Jesus confesses that He stands among men despised and rejected—a very
          worm, and no man; but He well knew that He would be delivered from the
          oppressive burden of vicarious suffering, and raised to salvation's
          highest throne. He looked onward from the day, when His lips uttered
          humble and mournful prayer, to the day of triumphant gladness, when
          thanksgiving will be the endless song.

          How condescending is the heart of God! The praises of His people are
          His chosen abode. While formal service without sincerity and warmth
          finds no acceptance, the voice of thanksgiving fills heaven with
          grateful fragrance. The humble followers of the Lamb mark such
          acceptance, and profit by such experience. They see how Jesus was
          upheld; they see how favor smiles upon His grateful followers; and
          they rejoice in the joy of their fathers in the faith. Happy are those
          who seek God, who make His word and will their constant study, and who
          in their every step follow hard after Him! They shall not be
          disappointed. Spiritual life shall now uplift them; eternal life shall
          soon be their glorious crown. For this earnestly have they prayed even
          in the prison-house of this poor flesh. Their prayer has not been in
          vain. The Lord has heard them. Their desires have obtained success.

          In prospect of God's saving mercies to His people, all the universe

          what praise can reach the glories of the prospect? Prosperity shall be
          granted to the earthly Zion; but such security was but a dim outline
          of the glories of the New Jerusalem. There the chosen seed shall dwell
          forever. There those who love His name shall have unending bliss.
          Their praises shall be vast as eternity, for every moment will give
          fresh cause for praise.
