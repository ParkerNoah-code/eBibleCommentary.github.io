        <p align="justify">
          Pious anticipation might exclaim—Surely, when Jesus comes to bless
          this earth, adoring welcomes will receive Him. Surely each heart will
          call Him to its throne; each knee will bow; each tongue will shout His
          praise; thanksgivings will encircle Him. Those who thus reason little
          know

          <i>the devil's power and man's rebellious wickedness.</i> The Spirit's
          eye foresees the black reality. Among the heathen rage shall be
          rampant. The favored nation shall plot destruction. How base, how vain
          is this iniquity! It may well be asked, What prompts this hatred? Why
          does this frenzy madden?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.

        <p align="justify">
          Those who occupy earth's highest seats are fiercest to oppose Jesus.
          The Herods and Pilates take determined stand. The council of the
          priests and elders meet in secret assembly. In the beginning it was
          so. The same hatred has defiled succeeding thrones and courts. Against
          whom is this rage? Tremble, O earth, turn pale, you heavens. This fury
          assails the Lord Jehovah and His beloved Son. The Father sends the Son
          anointed by the Spirit to be the promised Savior, to execute the
          all-saving offices of Prophet, Priest, and King, to bless the Church
          with every blessing. And earth's chiefs combine to tread Him beneath
          insulting feet. Give ear! this is their frantic cry—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.
          <i
            >"Let us break their chains," they cry, "and free ourselves from
            this slavery."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Self-will rejects restraint. Pride will not yield to rule.
          Licentiousness surmounts all barriers. Conceited reason lifts up
          defiant head. The gentle scepter of Christ's kingdom, His sweet, His
          light, His easy, and His loving yoke, are hated as chains which
          restrain and cords which fetter. When Jesus came, earth raised the
          cry, "We will not have this man to reign over us." It still resounds.
          When will man learn that widest liberty is true submission to the
          Gospel sway? He is a free man whom the Son makes free.<i>
            He is a slave in whom unbridled lusts and passions rule.
          </i>

          But can proud man prevail? Can he drive back the ocean's might with a
          feather? Can he lift up his puny hand, and bid the sun conceal its
          rays? Can he with straws bind the hurricane? Can he lay mountains low,
          exalt the valleys, and change the laws of nature? Can he scale heaven
          and dethrone our God? Such, doubtless, is his frantic will. But give
          ear again;

            in derision."</i

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Let us lift up our eyes to God. He sits upon His throne on high; while
          earth is all unsettled, wild in mad menace, He reigns in calm repose.
          The Spirit here takes images from human feeling to depict His
          unruffled contempt. God laughs derisively, when puny efforts dash
          their feebleness against overpowering strength. Thus God shows
          undisturbed disdain of human fury.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.<i>
            "Then shall He speak to them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore
            displeasure."</i

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          God may be silent long; but patience is not impunity. Reprieve brings
          not release. When the appointed time comes, the floodgates open and
          wrath overflows. Who can conceive these terrors? What must His
          displeasure be? Who can endure when His anger issues forth? What
          weeping, what wailing, what anguish, what gnashing of teeth, when God
          arises to execute due judgment on His foes!

            6. "Yet have I set My King upon My holy hill of Zion."
          </p>
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          In spite of earth's malignant rage, God manifests His King. He called
          His Son to be the heir of all things. Upon His shoulder supreme
          government is laid. His hand receives the scepter of universal reign.
          He announces, "All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth." Who
          can resist? Who can withstand? Our Jesus is God's King—by choice, by
          appointment, by will, and by sovereign decree. Now He spiritually sits
          enthroned on Zion's holy hill.<i>
            He reigns supreme in every true believer's heart. </i
          >He is invited by rejoicing love. Lift up your heads, O you gates, and
          be you lift up, O portals of my soul, and the King of glory shall come
          in. He enters, and all heaven follows in His train. He enters, and
          establishes the kingdom of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy
          Spirit. This present reign on Zion's holy hill is now open to the eye
          of faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the day quickly comes when Jesus' throne shall be universally
          conspicuous. The wicked cannot hinder. Their rage can interpose no
          barrier. God has spoken. It must be. It must soon be. "Then the moon
          shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall
          reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His ancients
          gloriously."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7.<i>
            "I will declare the decree; the Lord has said unto me, You are My
            Son; this day have I begotten You."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Oh, wondrous thought! Before the birth of time, eternal councils
          willed the well-being of man. A covenant of grace was firmly made. We
          live in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised
          before the world began. Jesus, in His love for souls, in tender zeal
          to fill our hearts with joy, and to cause streams of peace to flow,
          announces the decree. By His Spirit He unfolds it. In His Word He
          writes the record. Here He displays important articles.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It was decreed that honor should await Him as God's co-eternal Son.
          For a brief period His deity was hidden. In outward appearance He
          differed little from the sons of men. Occasionally heavenly rays broke
          forth; but the sun's brightness was eclipsed. Thus, as man, He
          suffered and died. The resurrection-morn arrives. He strides forth the
          mighty conqueror of death and hell. The glorious rising has a glorious
          voice. With trumpet-tongue it tells the wondering world, Jesus is
          God's Son! this day removes all doubt! this day unveils Him! The
          Father has begotten Him—Another morn will brightly shine. Greater
          manifestations rapidly come on. Amid all glory Jesus will be shown
          again as God's co-equal, co-eternal Son. Who then can shake His
          kingdom's firm supports?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8.<i>
            "Ask of Me, and I shall give You the heathen for Your inheritance,
            and the uttermost parts </i
          >of <i>the earth for Your possession."</i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Another article of the covenant is stated. Christ's kingdom shall
          exceed all bounds. The outcast heathen shall bend the knee. Earth's
          uttermost extent shall call Him Lord. But this shall be in answer to
          His prayer. In heaven the Son shall prosecute His entreaty. With
          supplication He shall urge His claims. His pleading shall recite His
          part performed—the ransom paid—the kingdom bought—all hindrances
          removed. He shall thus ask, and He shall thus obtain. Blessed Jesus,
          extend Your wounded hands! Let not the Father rest until earth's
          length and breadth shall own Your rule!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9.
          <i
            >"You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in
            pieces like a potter's vessel."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The covenant, moreover, states that all Christ's enemies shall lick
          the dust. Hate may continue. Opposition may oppose. But oh! how vain!
          Behold His might. A rod of iron is wielded by His hands. It breaks and
          cannot be withstood. Opposing strength is brittle as the potter's
          clay. He strikes, and it lies shattered atoms. Thus shall His kingdom
          trample down all foes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10.<i>
            "Be wise now, therefore, O you kings; be instructed, you judges of
            the earth."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          But wrath yet <i>lingers</i>. Space for repentance is given. Let it be
          duly used. A warning voice arrests earth's great ones in their mad
          career. It bids wisdom to awake, and sit submissively at Jesus' feet.
          The truest sage is a meek learner in the school of grace.
          <b>To know Christ truly is the crown of knowledge.</b>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          11.<i> "Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Knowledge leads surely in the paths of <i>service</i>.
          Gospel-obedience is a blessed walk. It is the happy union of all
          grace. Strictest submission goes hand in hand with filial reverence.
          The cup of joy is mixed with tenderest dread of error.<b>
            Love fears. Fear loves.</b
          >
          Joy trembles, and trembling is glad.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12.
          <i
            >"Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish from the way, when
            His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all those who put
            their trust in Him."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Mercy still warns. It points to Jesus. It exhorts to give Him homage,
          because it is His due—to worship Him to whom all praise belongs—to
          love Him who has so loved us as in our stead to die. It forbids delay.
          Until our hearts be wholly His, we totter on destruction's brink!
          <i> One spark </i>of kindled wrath excludes forever from salvation's
          way. What, then, will be their doom against whom
          <i>wrath in full fury</i> blazes?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sweet melody concludes this hymn. It speaks of blessedness. It tells
          where true happiness now and forever dwells. It is in faith. Faith is
          the saving and the happy grace. It tightly clings to Christ. It trusts
          Him at all seasons for all things. Oh! may this blessed state be ours.
          Truly blessed it is!
