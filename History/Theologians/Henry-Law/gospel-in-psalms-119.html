        <p align="justify">
          Here is a glowing picture of the pious heart. Here is the inner life
          of those who sit on the high eminence of blessedness, and rank among
          the blessed of the Lord. The question cannot be repressed, Who are
          they to whom such dignity belongs? The clear reply here meets us, They
          are the undefiled in the way; they walk in the law of the Lord. It is
          a solemn truth, that the path of life is through a miry road. Our
          steps are in pollution's land. How, then, can our feet be undefiled!
          How can our garments be unsoiled! We cannot guide ourselves. Unaided,
          we stumble into sloughs of defilement. But all help is near. Jesus is
          at hand to keep us by His mighty power. Let us lean on His supporting
          arm at every step, and when we fall let us rise and wash our robes in
          His all-cleansing blood. So may we ever be among the undefiled in the
          way; and let the law of the Lord, lovely in purity, glorious in
          holiness, perfect in love, be the path in which our feet advance.
          Jesus is our model and our all. God's law was in His heart; He was its
          living portrait.

        <p align="justify">
          Again, we learn that holiness is blessedness. Let our constant prayer
          grow stronger, Lord, what will You have us to do? The reply is, Study
          the testimonies. They speak from heaven, loud as the thunder, clear as
          the light, sweet as the celestial songs. Let us thus seek His will,
          with our whole hearts united in the one pursuit.

          3. <i>"They also do no iniquity; they walk in His ways."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The blessed cannot consent to evil. They flee the downward path. They
          shun it with extreme abhorrence. Their hearts entirely love the
          heavenward way. They cling to it with undeviating tread. Their onward
          progress is always upward. Thus they advance in happiness towards
          heaven.

          4. <i>"You have commanded us to keep Your precepts diligently."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He who desires our good at all times issues with authority His
          sovereign commands. They enjoin us to adhere with diligence to the
          tract which His Word marks out. In strict obedience is real and
          unfailing happiness. To obey is heaven begun.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. <i>"Oh that my ways were directed to keep Your statutes!"</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But when the heart is willing the flesh is weak. Proneness to err
          still threatens to mislead. Hence incessant desires besiege Heaven
          that directing grace may ever guide aright.

        <p align="justify">
          Shame and confusion are the wages of those who disregard God's will.
          If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts and knows all
          things. If our hearts condemn us not, we shall lift up our heads in
          joy.

          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The blessed man is ever a pupil in God's school. He desires to learn
          the ways of righteousness. Thus upright praises will ever flow from
          his lips.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Firm are his resolves, but he well knows that utter weakness may
          consist with strong desires. Experience has taught that when we would
          do good evil is present. He knows that real strength is heaven-born;
          therefore earnest cries implore that God at all times would uphold
          graciously. He hates putting away.

          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Peculiar temptations plot against the young. Passions are strong;
          experience is weak. Satan assails with unremitted are. But still there
          is escape. Abundant records speak of holy youths. They have pursued
          one course. God's Word has been their compass. By this guidance they
          have diligently steered through all the waves of peril.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Sincerity is here avowed. Blessed are those who can thus truly appeal
          to God. May our conscience ever bear witness that no portion of the
          heart has been given to ungodly ways! But still God's help is asked,
          that the way may be so hedged up that no outlet to forbidden paths may
          be found. We may run well and yet may stumble.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a precious truth that God's Word is a sure antidote to sin. If
          this is treasured in the heart, if it stands as a guard before the
          portals, evil cannot enter. May we ever be thus garrisoned!

          The blessed man will ever bless and ever pray. His constant cry will
          be, Send out Your light and Your truth, that they may lead me.

          He will learn that he may teach. His heart, filled with the Word, will
          overflow and fertilize all who are within his reach.

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Word is a bright sunbeam in the soul. Riches do not so much
          exhilarate the worldling as the revelation of God's ways delight and
          gladden the blessed man.

        <p align="justify">
          Do we seek happiness? It is to be found in constantly pondering the

          children!

        <p align="justify">
          Lovely light may beam upon us, and wondrous scenes surround; but the
          gain is none if sightless eyes survey. By nature we are thus blind;
          unless God grants sight, we cannot behold the wonders which His law
          contains. Let us weary heaven with cries for enlightening grace. When
          the command goes forth, Let there be light, there will be light.

        <p align="justify">
          Here we are pilgrims in a foreign land. As such we need guidance.
          God's Word will show the right path and keep us in it. Let us pray
          that this word may brightly illumine our way. If we walk in darkness,
          it is because we do not see the light.

          Weak and wavering desires should be utterly eschewed. The true child
          of God so longs for the precious Word, that his soul seems scarcely
          able to contain the swelling feeling. Unless the presence of God's
          Word relieves, he can scarcely live.

          We have heard who are the blessed. We have now the portrait of the
          cursed. They proudly wander from the everlasting way. Their straying
          feet rush to destruction. God's rebuke descends, and the rebuke is
          ruin.

        <p align="justify">
          The pious are generally regarded with scorn in this fallen world. It
          is a grievous trial. When we are conscious that contempt is incurred
          by adhering to God's Word, we may humbly pray for its removal.

        <p align="justify">
          Men of exalted rank too often slander the servants of the Lord. But a

          Such meditation is most precious. It is a boundless expanse of
          happiness. It is a treasury of counsels to guide throughout life's
          course. May we be thus happy and thus wise!

          The soul by nature rises not to heaven; unaided from on high it
          grovels in the mire of earth. Hence the wisdom of constant prayer,
          that spiritual life may expand wings for upward flight. Many promises
          give prospect of success.

          Our desire for intelligence in God's precepts cannot be too earnest.

          Periods recur when the soul is heavy laden. When thus powerless,

        <p align="justify">
          Grievous evidence of the fall is seen in the tendency to misrepresent
          and to deceive. The devil was a liar from the beginning; and his
          progeny inherits his propensities. Let us strive to be the followers
          of Him who is emphatically the truth. For this purpose let us pray
          that God would write His law of uprightness on our hearts.

          False ways will indeed be eschewed by the blessed man. The way of

          The believer, conscious of ignorance, ever seeks divine instruction.

          It is the immovable persuasion of faith that no word of God's mouth

          Exaltation to earth's greatness cannot raise the soul to sanctity. The

          The experienced saint is always conscious of his frequent errings.
          Unless the Good Shepherd seeks the straying sheep, it will wander
          farther from the fold. Therefore prayer is made to God to restore the
          soul from devious paths. This prayer is enforced by the profession
          that God's commandments abide in the heart.
