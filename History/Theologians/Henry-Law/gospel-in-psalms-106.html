        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Praise opens and concludes this instructive Psalm. The context is dark
          in frightful displays of the rebellion and ingratitude of God's
          people. Bright manifestations of sparing and forgiving grace finally
          appear.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"Praise the Lord. O give thanks to the Lord; for He is good; for
            His mercy endures forever. Who can utter the mighty acts of the
            Lord? who can show forth all His praise?"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By precept and by example we should strive to awaken songs of
          thanksgiving. A glorious theme animates our minds. Goodness and mercy
          invite attention. This goodness is unsearchable. This mercy swells as
          an ocean without shore. Vain, then, are our utmost efforts to lift up
          adequate strains. If we possessed all the powers of all the angelic
          hosts, and all the tongues of all who ever breathed, and if they were
          expanded in one perpetual utterance, they could not measure the due
          expanse. But the more we strive the more we shall succeed.

            >"Blessed are those who keep judgment, and he who does righteousness
            at all times."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is no blessedness apart from walking in the fear of God. Let our
          feet ever traverse this righteous path.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4-5.
          <i
            >"Remember me, O Lord, with the favor that You bear to Your people;
            O visit me with Your salvation; that I may see the good of Your
            chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, that I
            may glory with Your inheritance."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This aspiration is offspring of heaven. Let us ever look to God to
          raise us to this height of blessedness. The terms exhort us to fix our
          delighted gaze on the happiness of God's chosen. Salvation is their
          property. They realize the pledged enjoyment. But still the
          blessedness and glory of this inheritance exceed all thought. God, who
          gave the heirs of salvation to His dear Son, and who gave His Son for
          them, will with Him also freely give them all things. They are the
          true inheritors of earth. They soon shall be the inhabitants of
          celestial homes, and eternity will not exhaust their bliss.
        </p>

          <i
            >"We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we
            have done wickedly. Our fathers understood not Your wonders in
            Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of Your mercies; but
            provoked Him at the sea, even at the Red Sea."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This salvation springs from grace. No merit wins it. We are poor
          sinners, even as our fathers were. Look back to the deliverance from
          Egypt. All the tokens of love and tender compassion destroyed not the
          seeds of iniquity in the favored nation. Marvelously brought through
          the Red Sea, they showed proofs that evil still rankled in their
          hearts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8-11.
          <i
            >"Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make
            His mighty power to be known. He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it
            was dried up; so He led them through the depths, as through the
            wilderness. And He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,
            and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. And the waters covered
            their enemies; there was not one of them left."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Patience still endured. Mercy held back the arm of vengeance. Support
          and deliverance still magnified His glorious name. They were led
          safely through the depths of the sea. They were rescued from the
          cruelty of their enemies, while the returning waters overwhelmed the
          foes. Every child of Israel was saved; every child of Egypt died.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12-15.
          <i
            >"Then believed they His words; they sang His praise. They soon
            forgot His works; they waited not for His counsel; but lusted
            exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. And He
            gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such lovingkindness for a moment melted them; hymns of praise
          resounded. But their goodness was like the morning cloud, as the early
          dew it passed away. In the wilderness they murmured, because their
          lust for food was not indulged. They impiously tempted God. He granted
          their desire, but the food in their mouths was impoverishment in their
          hearts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16-18.
          <i
            >"They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
            Lord. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the
            company of Abiram. And a fire was kindled in their company; the
            flame burned up the wicked."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They treated their appointed leaders with contempt, and scoffed at
          their authority. Terrible punishment ensued. The gaping earth
          swallowed up the rebels. Devouring flames consumed their substance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19-22.
          <i
            >"They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the molten image. Thus
            they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eats
            grass. They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in
            Egypt; wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
            Red Sea."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          At Horeb they dethroned Jehovah, and exalted as their god the image of
          a calf. Their hearts relapsed into the idolatry of Egypt. The mighty
          wonders which marked their deliverance from that tyrannic sway were as
          a forgotten tale. Let us chide our souls to treasure up the memory of
          all His benefits.

          23.<i>
            "Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His
            chosen stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, lest
            He should destroy them."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God's patience had been tried to the extremest point. Just vengeance
          reared its head. But Moses interposed. He sought the Lord. He humbled
          himself in dust and ashes, and prayed that mercy might still be
          glorified. The prayer of faith is heard, and longer space is given to
          the rebellious host. Let us learn in faith to cry for others. Such
          sympathy is welcomed in the courts above. God turned the captivity of
          Job when he prayed for his friends.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          24-27.<i>
            "Yes, they despised the pleasant land; they believed not His word;
            but murmured in their tents, and hearkened not to the voice of the
            Lord. Therefore He lifted up His hand against them, to overthrow
            them in the wilderness; to overthrow their seed also among the
            nations, and to scatter them in the lands."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Reports were brought of the luxuriant beauty of their future home. But
          incredulity derided, and haughty scoffs sneered. The promise which
          secured this great inheritance was treated as an empty word. We see an
          dreadful picture of the terrible evil which by nature depraves man's
          heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          28-31.
          <i

            of the dead. Thus they provoked Him to anger with their inventions;
            and the plague broke in upon them. Then Phinehas stood up, and
            executed judgment; and so the plague was stayed. And that was
            counted to him for righteousness unto all generations
            forevermore."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The filthy pleasures of idolatry enticed them. They reveled in guilty
          scenes of impurity, and feasted on the idol-offerings. Unblushing
          iniquity shunned not the light. Phinehas in holy zeal rushed to
          vindicate God's honor. He hastened to deal extraordinary punishment.
          Thus he gave evidence that faith was the inhabitant of his heart. By
          this righteous act he obtained acknowledgment that he was a
          Spirit-taught believer. Let us be diligent to give evidence that faith
          is our living principle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          32-33.
          <i
            >"They angered Him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill
            with Moses for their sakes; because they provoked his spirit, so
            that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips."</i

        <p align="justify">
          When water failed again their provocation so exceeded that even the
          meek spirit of Moses was ruffled. He spoke in petulance, and for a
          moment yielded to temptation. Sin in God's most faithful servants is
          sin still, and calls for tokens of displeasure. Moses suffered keenly.
          The decree went forth that his feet should never tread the longed-for
          Canaan.

            commanded them; but were mingled among the heathen, and learned
            their works. And they served their idols; which were a snare to
            them. Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,
            and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their
            daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land
            was polluted with blood. Thus were they defiled with their own
            works, and went a whoring with their own inventions."</i

          Surely when they rested in all the comforts of their desired abode
          their walk would be undeviating obedience. Surely happiness and love
          would be the inhabitants of their dwellings. Alas! what is man? They
          spared the idolaters whom they were commanded to destroy. They
          intermingled with their services, and adopted their abominable vices.
          They devoted their own children to accursed devils. The blood of
          impious sacrifices stained their hands. No sin appalled them.

            Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
            subjection under their hand. Many times He delivered them; but they
            provoked Him with their counsel, and were brought low for their
            iniquity. Nevertheless He regarded their affliction when He heard
            their cry; and He remembered for them His covenant, and repented
            according to the multitude of His mercies. He made them also to be
            pitied of all those that carried them captives."</i

          Extraordinary judgments followed. Invaders subjugated their land.
          Oppressed, they cried again, and were delivered only to sin more.

          The result should stimulate us to be more diligent in prayer and
          praise. Let all within us cry, Save us, good Lord, and we will bless
          Your name. Dangers are always near. Sacred records warn us. Our
          experience confirms the truth. It is madness to hope for safety from
          our own vigilance or strength. They fall who trust in such unstable
          ground. Let our eyes be ever on the Lord, so shall we triumph in His
          praise.
