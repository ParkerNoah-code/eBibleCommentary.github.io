          <font color="#ff0000"><b>Psalm 131</b></font>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist avows his deep humility. Exhortation to hope in God is
          added.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty; neither do I
            exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
            Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned
            of his mother; my soul is even as a weaned child."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Humility is a lovely grace. When the God-man trod this earth this was
          His robe. No ostentation marked His lowly walk. Hear His enchanting
          words; "I am meek and lowly in heart." Hear the Apostle's appeal; "I
          beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ." If Jesus thus
          trampled upon pride, shall we, poor dust and ashes, lift up haughty
          heads?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Take, also, the example of the noble Paul. Early in his career he
          professes that he was the least of the Apostles, not worthy to be
          enrolled in their company. As he grew in grace he deepened in
          knowledge of unworthiness. He declared that he was less than the least
          of all saints. Just before he receives the crown of martyrdom we hear
          his bewailing voice; Sinners, of whom I am chief. If we had like
          grace, we should similarly despise self. He who is deeply instructed
          in the treachery and corruption of his own heart, will always esteem
          others better than himself. His soul will be deeply conscious of its
          utter need. Like a helpless babe it will look for support from a
          parent's care.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. <i>"Let Israel hope in the Lord from henceforth and forever."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No hope may repose on self, yet all hope is the believer's portion. He
          can look up to God, whose tender sympathy feels with our every woe.
          Let us pray that our hope may never fail, but daily strengthen more
          and more. It will soon end in glorious reality. Israel's hope will
          soon be Israel's glory. The lovely prospect will soon be actual
          possession. Expectation will be more than satisfied.
