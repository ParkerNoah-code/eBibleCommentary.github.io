          Intercession is our duty and our privilege. Trust in God secures
          success. May we be encouraged to pray and not to faint!

            >"May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may the name of the
            God of Jacob defend you. May He send you help from the sanctuary,

          David desires entreaties for himself, and suggests petitions for his
          praying people. He was tossed on the waves of ever-swelling trouble.
          At home and abroad, there was the incessant noise of war. He knew the
          only source of true success. He excites others to besiege heaven for
          him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In his kingly office he was a clear type of Christ. In this type
          David's great Lord and Son stoops to solicit prayer. He stands before
          us as one in need; troubles grow thick around Him; the whole artillery
          of hell assails; He looked to heaven, and asks others to desire
          audience for Him. We can look back and see how answers came. All the
          perfections of God which constitute His name came forth in His behalf.
          The God of Jacob was His shield. The heavens opened. A ministering
          angel hastened to uphold the prostrate God-man.

          3.<i>
            "Remember all Your offerings, and accept Your burnt sacrifice."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In this petition faith looks onward to the great redeemer. Jesus
          indeed made offering to God. He offered Himself the victim upon the
          altar. He laid down His life a whole burnt-sacrifice. He fulfilled all
          which every blazing altar and every bleeding victim had prefigured; He
          was not spared. Avenging wrath descended, and fullest penalty was
          inflicted. Justice presented scales, and they received their whole
          demands.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is our joy to know that the shed blood prevailed. Each faithful
          suppliant can remind our God that full atonement has been made for
          every sin; that all due wrath has been expended on our surety; that
          His death is our death; His sufferings are our sufferings; His payment
          is our payment; the curse inflicted upon Him is our redemption. We may
          kneel joyfully before the throne, and with assurance cry, "remember
          the offering of the dying Jesus; accept the burnt-sacrifice of the
          atoning Lamb."

        <p align="justify">
          The heart of Christ is fixed on God's glory. He cries, "Your law is
          within My heart." His burning desire was that all God's attributes
          should receive honor from His work. This glory is secured when mercy
          and truth meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each other. All
          His desire shall be accomplished. He shall see of the travail of His
          soul and shall be satisfied. Success shall gloriously crown His work.
          The Gospel-scheme shall triumph.

          <i
            >"We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God we
            will set up our banners; the Lord fulfill all your petitions."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Church beholds salvation won and all desires of Christ fulfilled.
          It is a wondrous, precious, glorious sight. God is honored; Christ is
          magnified; sinners are saved. What is the feeling which breaks forth?
          It is joy—joy unspeakable and full of glory. Let every heart be glad,
          let every lip sing praise. In knowledge of this manifested glory let
          us unfold the banner; let us press to the ranks of the redeemed; let
          us march in happy fellowship to Immanuel's land.

            His holy heaven with the saving strength of His right hand."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The life in the believer's soul, his clear perception of redemption's
          truth, his realizing views of deep interest in Christ, leave no doubt
          that Christ was heard in all His prayers, and that God put forth all
          the strength of His right hand to bring Him through His work. Oh!
          blessed knowledge of all precious truth!

        <p align="justify">
          7, 8.
          <i
            >"Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember
            the name of the Lord our God. They were brought down and fell; but
            we have risen, and stand upright."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The folly of carnal confidence is next portrayed. Except the Lord be
          on our side, the multitude of warlike equipment are as the chaff
          before the wind. The Lord speaks, and Pharaoh and his hosts fall an
          easy prey to the unsparing sea, while Israel, relying on their God,
          stand conquerors on the shore, and sing the song of triumph.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Holy Spirit! open our eyes to see our nothingness in ourselves! Our
          best is worthless. May we shun all fancied righteousness, and fix
          adoring thoughts on the great name and saving work of Jesus!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9. <i>"Save, Lord! let the King hear us when we call."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Salvation should be the first and foremost, the sum and substance, of
          our every desire. What will all earth, and all earth's treasures, and
          all earth's pleasures profit, except our souls be saved! For salvation
          let our cry besiege heaven's gates. Happy the thought that on the
          throne a King is seated who never casts out prayer! Let us come
          boldly, and pray diligently. Calling in Christ's name, we cannot fail.
          We have a motto for this day and evermore—"Save, Lord! let the King
          hear us when we call."
