          <font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>Psalm 124</b></font>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          All deliverance is freely given by the hand of God. To Him let
          grateful blessings ever be ascribed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-5.
          <i
            >"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel
            say; If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose
            up against us; then they would have swallowed us up quick, when
            their wrath was kindled against us; then the waters would have
            overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul; then the
            proud waters would have gone over our soul."</i
          >

        <p align="justify">
          Many are the adversaries of God's children. They are headed by the
          arch-enemy, the devil. He is depicted as a lion for strength, a
          serpent for subtlety, a dragon for fierceness. He is aided by
          followers who are a legion for multitude. Tender feeling is a stranger
          to such foes. Like the waters of an overwhelming flood, they would
          work utter desolation. Their malice must succeed, if One mightier than
          the strong one interposed not. But the Lord is ever near to support
          His people. Vain is all hostility. His aid is perfect victory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6.
          <i
            >"Blessed be the Lord, who has not given us as a prey to their
            teeth."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The soul is represented as a defenseless lamb trembling in the fangs
          of a ravenous beast, ready to mangle, eager to devour. But rescue
          intervenes. So our Heavenly Father delivers from the teeth of the
          devouring lion. Let grateful thanks be devoutly given.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7.
          <i
            >"Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers;
            the snare has broken, and we have escaped."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Another image represents the soul entangled in the fowler's net. A
          kind hand brings escape. When the case seems to be hopeless, mercy
          gives freedom. Again let praises shout aloud.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8.
          <i
            >"Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and
            earth."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Surely we must perish if earth only rendered aid. But the great
          Creator who sits on the throne of omnipotence puts forth His might in
          our defense. This power is an impregnable fortress of defense. Let us
          thank Him, bless Him, and adore.
