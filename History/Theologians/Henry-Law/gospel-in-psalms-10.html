        <p align="justify">
          The main feature in this psalm is the foul portraiture of evil. Prayer
          follows in full confidence that God will arise and judge. May the
          Spirit raise hatred of evil in our hearts!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Why do You stand afar off, O Lord? why do You hide Yourself in
            times of trouble?"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is much weakness in the strongest faith. It is prone to sink
          when billows swell and storms descend. Trials assume desertion's form.
          Darkness seems to imply that God cannot be near. The sun eclipsed
          seems gone forever. <i>But faith in weakest hours still prays</i>, and
          meekly questions, 'Why is it so?'
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"The wicked in his pride persecutes the poor; let them be taken in
            the devices that they have imagined."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Spirit proceeds to draw a full-blown portrait of sin. The mask is
          withdrawn. The monster is dragged forth to light. The hideous features
          are revealed. The Spirit's pen cannot exaggerate. The dark colors are
          not too dark. The deep ingredient of the wicked heart is pride. This
          scorns the humble followers of the Lamb, and seeks to trample them
          beneath insulting feet. But often do oppressive schemes recoil, and
          plots involve self-ruin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.
          <i
            >"For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, and blesses the
            covetous, whom the Lord abhors."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In arrogance the wicked boasts that his desires shall prosper. And who
          can hinder him? He loves the hoarders of ill-gotten gains. In spite of
          God's abhorrence, they are his delight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.
          <i
            >"The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek
            after God; God is not in all his thoughts."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His haughty attitude vaunts independence. He does not stoop to study
          God's will. He is no suppliant at wisdom's gate. God is not the
          substance of each thought, but rather rashness says, "There is no
          God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.
          <i
            >"Yet they succeed in everything they do. They do not see your
            punishment awaiting them. They pour scorn on all their enemies."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          His every step insults both God and man. His dim eye grovels on the
          ground. It has no power to pierce the heavens and read God's will. His
          insolence condemns his foes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6, 7.
          <i
            >"He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, for I shall never
            be in adversity. His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud;
            under his tongue is mischief and vanity."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In self-complacency he thinks prosperity must last forever, and evil
          days can never come. He cannot speak without floods of evil issuing
          forth. His words are open curses and insidious falsehoods.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8.
          <i
            >"They lurk in dark alleys, murdering the innocent who pass by. They
            are always searching for some helpless victim."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Evil words lead on to evil deeds. He craftily devises murderous acts.
          He narrowly observes the poor and feeble, thirsting for their blood.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9, 10.
          <i
            >"Like lions they crouch silently, waiting to pounce on the
            helpless. Like hunters they capture their victims and drag them away
            in nets. The helpless are overwhelmed and collapse; they fall
            beneath the strength of the wicked."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Sometimes as a beast of prey he crouches for a desperate spring;
          sometimes as a crafty huntsman he spreads entangling nets. By every
          art he seeks to execute his hateful plots.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11.
          <i
            >"He has said in his heart, God has forgotten; He hides His face; He
            will never see it."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          False thoughts of God deceive him. Impunity persuades him that God
          disregards. He flatters himself that omniscience does not observe him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12.
          <i

            humble."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          These sights of sin impel believers to the mercy-seat. They turn away.
          They look above. They seek their God. They tell out their fears. They
          ask His help. They commit the persecuted to His care. They stir Him up
          to have them in remembrance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13, 14, 15.
          <i
            >"Why do the wicked condemn God? He has said in his heart, You will
            not require it. You have seen it; for You behold mischief and spite,
            to requite it with Your hand; the poor commits himself to You; You
            are the helper of the fatherless. Break the arm of the wicked and
            the evil man; seek out his wickedness, until You find none."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How vain the atheistic thought that God sits still in unconcern! From
          His high throne He ponders all the ways of men. In right time He will
          avenge His honor. The helpless shall indeed be helped; the boastful
          arm of wickedness shall be shattered. All evil shall be dragged to
          light; no sin shall go unpunished.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16.
          <i

            of His land."</i

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Glorious light shines forth. The throne of God is set. He rules, He
          reigns, in majesty supreme forever. His enemies are all destroyed.
          Throughout the blissful realm no trace of evil can be found. His happy
          subjects now lift up the head. One shout is heard, Glory, glory to our
          God!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          17, 18.
          <i
            >"Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will prepare
            their heart, You will cause Your ear to hear; to judge the
            fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more
            oppress."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Good Lord, increase our faith in the power and prevalence of prayer!
          The eternal world will show that supplication never desired in vain.
          Grace prompts the desire, inspires the words, prepares the heart, and
          gives the full reply. When God comes forth to answer and to help, what
          can feeble flesh avail! It perishes forever. From this view of the
          wickedness of the wicked, their righteous doom, the glories of the
          coming kingdom, let us bless Him who has delivered us from the wrath
          to come, and called us to His kingdom and glory!
