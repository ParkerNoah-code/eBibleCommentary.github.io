        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This ode of triumph celebrates our exalted Head. May we thus sing on
          earth by faith, and lengthen out the strain through endless days!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"The king shall rejoice in Your strength, O Lord; and in Your
            salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! You have given him his
            heart's desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips."</i

          We fall far short of this psalm's precious teaching if we restrict our
          musings to the type. Let David first be seen rejoicing in his royal
          crown, but let him soon fade before the rising of the King of kings.
          Here we may bathe our souls in the deep waters of Christ's truth. For
          the joy set before Him, He endured the cross, despising the shame. But
          the joy then in prospect is joy now fully realized. He sits rejoicing
          on the Father's right hand. The conflict is past; the battle is
          fought; the victory is won; every peril is escaped; every foe is
          vanquished. He has been strong to conquer, and He ascribes the
          strength to God's empowering hand. Salvation is achieved; it is
          salvation through the will and help of God, and in it greatly He
          exults. The utmost desires of His heart are granted. He could not wish
          nor ask for more. The cup of gladness overflows.

        <p align="justify">
          During the struggle and the deep abasement, God ever went before Him,
          strewing blessings in His path; God's goodness ever paved His way. And
          now He is crownedâ€”crowned as Conqueror, crowned as King. High is the
          throne on which He sits; omnipotent is the scepter which He wields.
          The government is placed upon His shoulders. All power is given to Him
          in heaven and in earth. Happy the subjects of this triumphant Lord!

        <p align="justify">
          In deepest agony He cried to God, who was able to save Him from death,
          and His prayer was heard. The word is fulfilled, "With long life will
          I satisfy Him, and show Him my salvation." Our High Priest appears,
          and His happy testimony is, "I am He who lives and was dead; and
          behold I am alive forevermore, Amen, and have the keys of hell and of
          death." He is the resurrection and the life. He is our life. All who
          are one with Him have for their portion the everlasting life of glory.

          5, 6, 7.
          <i
            >"His glory is great in Your salvation; You have laid honor and
            majesty upon him. For You have made him most blessed forever; You
            have made him exceeding glad with Your countenance. For the king
            trusts in the Lord; and through the mercy of the Most High he shall
            not be moved."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The Spirit multiplies to show Christ's present blessedness. Great is
          His glory through God's saving hand. He is heir of all the majesty
          which heaven can give. He is God over all, blessed forevermore.
          Blessed Himself, He holds all blessings for His people. We, also, are
          blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Him. But
          what is His all-surpassing joy? It is to bask forever in His heavenly
          Father's smile. If He has sympathy with us, should not we, also, have
          sympathy with Him? If our sorrows are His sorrows, should not His joy
          be ours? It is added that His joy is the fruit of faith. He trusted
          and is thus exalted. Let us believe and we shall similarly triumph.

          <i
            >"You will capture all your enemies. Your strong right hand will
            seize all those who hate you. You will destroy them as in a flaming
            furnace when you appear. The Lord will consume them in his anger;
            fire will devour them. You will wipe their children from the face of
            the earth; they will never have descendants. Although they plot
            against you, their evil schemes will never succeed. For they will
            turn and run when they see your arrows aimed at them."</i

          Jesus arises from His throne to consummate His final victory. Then
          obstructing refuges shall fail. They shall call upon rocks and
          mountains to conceal. They shall flee into every hiding-place which
          terror can devise. But wrath shall drag them forth. Fearful images
          portray their hopeless ruin. They shall agonize as in the flames of
          burning ovens. Fire shall seize them as its prey. Unceasing anguish
          shall devour them. How vain will be their flight when the arrows of
          the Most High pursue them! When that day shall come, may we be on the
          Conqueror's side!

        <p align="justify">
          Such is the fitting chorus to this song of triumph. Let every
          believer's voice call Jesus to His final exaltation. When that great
          day shall come, may we lift up the voice and celebrate His glorious
          power! Let us exalt Him now in heart, by life, in lip, by every
          faculty, and at each moment. Let the eternal song be no new song to
          us!
