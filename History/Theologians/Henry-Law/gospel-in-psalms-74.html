        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Hostile invasion had brought ruin into the city. Grim desolation
          frowns where once the Temple magnificently stood. The outrage of the
          enemy is plaintively described. Importunity calls upon God to
          interfere, and confidence is expected that light would arise in
          darkness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"O God, why have You cast us off forever? why does Your anger smoke
            against the sheep of Your pasture? Remember Your congregation, which
            You have purchased of old; the tribe of Your inheritance, which You
            have redeemed; this Mount Zion, where You have dwelt."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist thus writes with mournful eye fixed on the ruined city,
          and especially on the desolations of the Temple. In bitterness of
          heart he cries aloud to God. He seems to expostulate, 'Can it be that
          these miseries signify our final desertion!' The believer thus flies
          to the mercy-seat when adverse oppression casts him into the depths of
          grief. Let it be noted in what terms the aid of God is supplicated.
          His people are depicted as the sheep of His pasture. God is thus
          reminded of His tender office as the good and great Shepherd, who will
          never fail to tend His flock, and to protect them from all foes. They
          are described, also, as the congregation which He had purchased. Can
          Jesus ever forget the company for whom He shed His precious blood, and
          whom He bought at such high price out of the hands of their enslaving
          foes? They are described, moreover, as the portion assigned by the
          measuring-rod to be His inheritance—the possession which will be His
          pride and His glory. They are called, moreover, the Mount of His
          abode. Never will He withdraw His presence. He will always abide in
          them, and they in Him. Safe indeed must they be who thus can claim an
          interest in God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-4.
          <i
            >"Lift up Your feet unto the perpetual desolations, even all that
            the enemy has done wickedly in the sanctuary. Your enemies roar in
            the midst of Your congregations; they set up their banners for
            signs."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The cry is earnest that God would no longer tarry, but advance to view
          the Temple's sad state. With noisome tumult the insulting foe had
          burst upon the assembled worshipers, and hostile banners had been
          erected in most holy places. This wretchedness is spread before the
          Lord. The feeling is deep that such iniquity would not be permitted to
          prevail.

        <p align="justify">
          5-8.
          <i
            >"A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick
            trees. But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with
            axes and hammers. They have cast fire into Your sanctuary; they have
            defiled by casting down the dwelling place of Your name to the
            ground. They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together;
            they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land."</i

        <p align="justify">
          It is high privilege in any way to be permitted to promote the
          interests of true religion. Fame rested on those who felled the trees
          of Lebanon to aid the erection of the Temple. Substance and tools are
          never better expended than in raising the sanctuary in which God will
          be worshiped and His name proclaimed. No honor will be theirs whose
          parsimony expends on luxury and self-indulgence the means which might
          erect or beautify sanctuaries for holy worship. The Psalmist witnessed
          the destruction of what piety had raised, and the noble works of
          former zeal a prey for the devouring flames. But neglect may gradually
          accomplish what violence may rapidly effect. May such neglect be ever
          absent from us!

          The eyes of the disconsolate in Jerusalem no longer rested on tokens
          that God was in their midst. The symbols of His presence had
          disappeared in smoldering heaps. The voices of accredited ministers no
          longer spoke in the Lord's name. No cheering predictions gave hope
          that this misery would soon brighten into former joys. Grievous indeed
          was such trial.

          <i
            >No greater misery can oppress any people than to be deprived of
            godly teachers.

        <p align="justify">
          10-11.
          <i
            >"O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy
            blaspheme Your name forever? Why do You withdraw Your hand, even
            Your right hand? pluck it out of Your bosom."</i

          In such extremity of anguish prayer presents a ready refuge. All other
          help seems utterly to fail. But though the Temple be in ruins, God
          lives and loves, and is very near. He can repair the ruin; He can
          revive the services. To Him let approach be made. However hopeless the
          case may seem, let prayer be made, and all will be well.

          When all is desolate, faith brightly sparkles. It sings amid
          surrounding ruins. It looks above all to God, overruling all things
          for His glory and His people's good. It is assured that through all
          the earth, in all events, His people will be safely guarded.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13-15.
          <i
            >"You divided the sea by Your strength; You broke the heads of the
            dragons in the waters. You broke the heads of leviathan in pieces,
            and gave him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness. You
            cleaved the fountain and the flood; You dried up mighty rivers."</i

          God's wonders of old are the joy and comfort and support of His people
          in all ages. They read in them His constant love and His unfailing
          strength. The perils of the Church of old seemed to exclude all hope.
          But out of the furnace of Egypt He led forth His oppressed people. The
          sea parted and opened a safe passage for their feet. The monsters of
          the deep could do no hurt. They perished as the host advanced. The
          carcasses of mangled foes were cast along the shore. Did waters fail?
          Did the vast multitude look in vain for means to relieve their thirst?
          Did the parched wilderness afford no ray of hope? God graciously
          appeared. He gave the word. The smitten rock opened, and gushing
          streams flowed forth. He who worked these wonders in olden times, is
          still the same in tender love, in watchful care, in all-controlling
          power. He has raised His people from extreme desolation. He still will
          be their Savior.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16-17.
          <i
            >"The day is Yours, the night also is Yours; You have prepared the
            light and the sun. You have set all the borders of the earth; You
            have made summer and winter."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The works of creation teach as clearly as the works of providence and
          grace. In the realm of nature how wondrous are the changes which
          occur. The day brightly shines, but shadow soon overcasts the scene,
          and night in thick darkness hides all things from view. Again the
          morning dawns, the night and shadows flee away, and joy and gladness
          smile on the face of the awakened world. The wealth and rich
          luxuriance of summer robes earth with beauty—makes it as Eden's garden
          of delights, and fills it with the melody of heaven. But bright days
          shorten—winter comes, and strips the fields and groves and gardens of
          their bright attire, and binds the babbling streams in fetters of ice.
          All these changes are the work of God. We are thus taught that
          changes, also, will mark the course of grace. It may not always be a
          summer-day. But faith knows that receding summer will return, and
          winter has its limits. Earth, also, has varying climates. God sets all
          the borders of the earth. Happy is it to mark His overruling hand, and
          to know well that He has done and will do all things well.

          18.

            foolish people have blasphemed Your name."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith will remind God that the persecution of the godly is war against
          His kingdom. It will stir up God to bear in mind that His people are
          His chosen heritage. To touch them is to touch the apple of His eye.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19-23.
          <i
            >"O do not deliver the soul of Your turtle-dove to the multitude of
            the wicked; do not forget the congregation of Your poor forever.
            Have respect unto the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are
            full of the habitations of cruelty. O let not the oppressed return
            ashamed; let the poor and needy praise Your name. Arise, O God,
            plead Your own cause; remember how the foolish man reproaches You
            daily. Do not forget the voice of Your enemies; the tumult of those
            who rise up against You increase continually."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Church is here set before God under the tender image of a
          turtle-dove—timid and meek amid scenes of desolation. The gentle bird
          seems to enlist all sympathies. So God is moved to pity His
          disconsolate people. The Psalmist concludes with earnest cries for God
          to arise, to maintain His own cause, to extinguish all the cruelty and
          oppression of the wicked. Let the conclusion in our hearts be deep
          assurance that, though distress may be very great, God is still near,
          and will in due time manifest Himself for their comfort and
          deliverance.
