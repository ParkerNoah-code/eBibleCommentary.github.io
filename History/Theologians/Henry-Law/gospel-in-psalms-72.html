          <font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>Psalm 72</b></font>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This Psalm presents especial grandeur and magnificence. In the first
          instance we have a description of the glorious reign of Solomon. But
          this reign soon fades before the sublimities of the reign of Jesus,
          the glowing words portraying it in a diversity of aspects. An
          appropriate ascription of glory concludes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Give the king Your judgments, O God, and Your righteousness to the
            king's son."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The aged monarch looks with fervent interest on his successor. Well
          did he know that prosperity must be the gift of God, that no talents
          or possessions could prevail unless God upheld him. It is a blessed
          thing to know that every good and perfect gift is from above. David
          especially supplicates that justice and equity might be the rule of
          the young monarch's reign, and that all his doings might be ordered by
          desire to execute God's will.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2-3.
          <i
            >"He shall judge Your people with righteousness, and Your poor with
            judgment. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the
            little hills, by righteousness."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The prayer is scarcely uttered before fulfillment is realized. The
          people are represented as prospering under righteous government—all
          orders of subordinate officers are represented as conducing to the
          peace and happiness of the subjects.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But a far greater than Solomon is here. We see our blessed Jesus
          seated on the throne of David, and wielding the scepter of His
          righteousness. His scepter indeed is a righteous scepter. All events
          regulated by Him bring peace and comfort to those who receive Him as
          their Lord and King. He will so govern that those who hold office in
          this world shall own His sway, and shall be guided according to His
          good pleasure to subserve the interests of His cause.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4-5.
          <i
            >"He shall judge the poor of the people, He shall save the children
            of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. They shall
            fear You as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all
            generations."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The poor and needy seem to be Christ's especial care. They may have
          little of the things of earth, but Christ's smile and blessing marks
          them heirs of all things. Men may oppress them. But this mighty King
          will break the oppressor's rod.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This prediction finds its grand fulfillment when Jesus triumphs on the
          cross, and rises from the grave the mighty Conqueror of sin and Satan.
          The perfecting of His kingdom is next declared. He shall never lack
          subjects who, while they love Him, still serve with filial reverence.
          While the world lasts, His kingdom shall abide, and when the world
          passes away His kingdom shall shine forth in everlasting brightness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6-7.
          <i
            >"He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass; as showers that
            water the earth. In His days shall the righteous flourish; and
            abundance of peace so long as the moon endures."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A sweet and graphic emblem shows the fertilizing refreshment which His
          people shall receive. Let the eye look upon the pastures over which
          the scythe has passed. They seem brought low, they show no sign of
          fertility. But when the gentle rain descends and genial showers fall,
          how quickly will vitality spring up, and plenty flourish around. So
          our great King will visit the depressed hearts of people by His
          presence, by His Spirit, by His Word. Then sweet revivals shall occur,
          and grace uplift a joyous head.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The beauties of His kingdom are exceeding great. His people are all
          righteous, and all the fruits of righteousness abound in them,
          especially the fruits of peace. "Peace I leave with you, My peace I
          give to you." The world may be in terrible commotion, but peace
          sweetly sings in the believer's heart—a peace which passes all
          understanding, a peace which this world can neither give nor take
          away. The King of Israel is "the Prince of Peace."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8-9.
          <i
            >"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river
            unto the ends of the earth. Those who dwell in the wilderness shall
            bow before Him; and His enemies shall lick the dust."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Omnipotence is the property of our great King. His dominion extends
          precisely as His will directs. Sometimes we seem to fear that His
          subjects are a little flock. But He has His hidden ones, and He shall
          see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied. The wildest nations
          shall be subdued when He is pleased to send His truth into their
          hearts; and those who oppose His sway shall lie low in shame. Come,
          Lord Jesus, reign in the midst of Your enemies!
        </p>
        <p align="justify"></p>
        <p align="justify">
          10-11.
          <i
            >"The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the
            kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. Yes, all kings shall fall
            down before Him; all nations shall serve Him."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These words receive a striking confirmation in the historian's page.
          The ships of Tarshish and of the neighboring isles come laden with
          their treasures to enrich King Solomon. Superabundance has poured in
          to give supplies to render the Temple the glory of the world. The
          Queen of Sheba comes in person to render her homage, and her train is
          splendid with presents from her land.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus, also, when Jesus lies a newborn babe at Bethlehem, Magi from the
          East are guided to His lowly dwelling, and spread their offerings at
          His feet. In after days Isaiah prolongs this prophecy that kings shall
          be Your nursing fathers and their queens Your nursing mothers. Does
          the historian relate that in fulfillment of these words, all the kings
          of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom and
          that he reigned over all kings from the river even unto the land of
          the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt; and shall we doubt that
          universal sway shall be our Lord's dominion, and that the crown of all
          shall be assigned to Him?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12-14.
          <i
            >"For He shall deliver the needy when he cries; the poor also, and
            him who has no helper. He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall
            save the souls of the needy. He shall redeem their soul from deceit
            and violence; and precious shall their blood be in His sight."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have here a sweet picture of the peaceful reign of Solomon;
          benevolent care protected all his subjects; their petitions found him
          ever ready to give audience; cruelty and oppression were checked, and
          all injury to them was regarded as the highest crime.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How sweetly do we see Jesus here! His subjects may be low in earthly
          state, their abode may be in the midst of poverty and need, but no
          earthly degradation lowers them in His esteem. They all have instant
          access to Him; and when their cry proclaims their need, His melting
          heart brings full deliverance. They may be permitted to suffer from
          deceit and violence, but their souls are safe in His redeeming arms.
          They may expire amid the martyr's pains, but injury to them is injury
          to Himself. He keeps them as the apple of His eye.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15-17.
          <i
            >"And He shall live, and to Him shall be given of the gold of Sheba;
            prayer also shall be made for Him continually; and daily shall He be
            praised. There shall be a handful of corn in the earth upon the top
            of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon; and
            they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. His name
            shall endure forever; His name shall be continued as long as the
            sun; and men shall be blessed in Him; all nations shall call Him
            blessed."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Other kings grow old; their strength declines, they go down to the
          grave. David, when he had served his generation, fell on sleep. Not so
          our glorious King. Immortality is His property—eternal days are the
          duration of His reign. It is the joy of His willing subjects to
          present their offerings to Him, and prayer continually encircles His
          high throne. His subjects, also, shall marvelously increase. The seed
          of His truth sown in places unlikely to yield fruit shall bring forth
          abundantly, as corn cast on the top of barren tops of mountains shall
          sometimes gladden with signs of fertility. The crowded city, also,
          shall be thronged with converts—they shall spring up as among the
          grass, as willows by the watercourses. Ages shall run their course;
          but while the sun hangs out its glorious light, the name of Jesus
          shall be magnified, and nations blessed by His favor, upheld by His
          power, and magnified in His might shall honor Him as the one source of
          blessedness, and shall adore Him forever as the blessed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          18-19.
          <i
            >"Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone does
            wondrous things. And blessed be His glorious name forever; and let
            the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This glorious hymn can have but one conclusion. Doxology must be its
          end! But how can we praise Him enough to whom alone the wonders of
          redemption appertain? forever and forever let blessings magnify His
          glorious name. Throughout the length and breadth of earth may His
          glory be resplendent! May our grateful hearts respond, "Amen and
          Amen!"
