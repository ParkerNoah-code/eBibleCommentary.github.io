        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Here <b>two portraits</b> are presented to our view. The godly man
          appears. His walk is holy, happy, fruitful, prosperous, heavenward—The
          ungodly is entirely diverse. His course is worthless, and his end is
          woe. Spirit of God, grant now Your light!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. <i>"Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel </i>of
          <i>the ungodly, nor stands in the way </i>of
          <i>sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful."</i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          All praise be to the grace of God that in this world of widespread sin
          some lovely spots are seen. There are the heirs of life. Born from
          above, to God they live. Abhorrence of all evil is their grand
          distinction. The godless have their schemes, their pleas, their plots,
          their evil counsels. In such vile course the blessed ones never walk.
          They resolutely shun the hateful path. Sinners have their chosen way.
          How broad! how thronged! what multitudes move down the sad decline! In
          this the blessed ones have no part. They hate the filth. They keep
          their feet unsoiled. Wickedness has its topstone. Scorn and derision
          proceed to mock God's word, Christ's work, and all the lowly followers
          of the Lamb. Too many love the sneering seat, and impious jests find
          sympathizing smiles. Such company is counterpart of hell. The blessed
          man sits not in such fellowship. We here are taught that
          <i>in sin there is gradation</i>. Let us flee the first step. The
          rolling stone descends with quickening speed.

          <i
            >"But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law he
            meditates day and night."</i
          >
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">The godly man has his delights</p></b>. His cup
        is crowned with joy. His table is spread with richest pleasures. The
        Scriptures are his soul-refreshing feast. They gladden him with views of
        God as his own God; Christ as his own Savior; the Spirit as his guide
        and sanctifying Comforter; heaven as his home forever; and all things
        ordered for his well-being. The morning light invites him to this sacred
        page. In the day his thoughts cling closely to it. The evening's shadows
        and night's wakeful hours call to rejoice in this treasury of truth.

            3. "And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
            brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not
            wither; and whatever he does shall prosper."
          </p>
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          Behold the tree on the brook's verdant bank, whose roots drink
          constantly the flowing stream! The laden branches bend with plenteous
          fruit. Unfading freshness decks the leaves. No lovelier object adorns
          nature's field. It is a picture of the godly man.
          <b>Deep springs of grace supply his inner life.</b> The fruits of
          righteousness, which are the Spirit's work, abound. His fertility of
          holiness is rich, and large, and real. The Lord is truly with him; and
          where the Lord is, there is every good. Of Joseph it is sweetly said,
          "The Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand." Of David we
          read, "He went on and grew great, and the Lord God of hosts was with
          him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.<i> "The ungodly are not so; but are like the chaff</i>
          <i>which the wind drives away."</i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The scene is changed. The ungodly widely differ. Nature shows, also,
          their picture. The fruitful tree gives place to chaff—light, barren,
          hollow, worthless—the refuse of the barn-floor. It yields no profit.
          It is cast out, the sport of winds. Driven away, it leaves no trace
          behind. Such are the godless. They minister no grace. They benefit no
          souls. None gain by conversation with them. Unstable, they are tossed
          by every changing wind. Temptations drive them headlong. Terrible is
          their final doom. Jesus comes, "Whose fan is in His hand, and He will
          throughly purge His floor, and gather His wheat into the garner; but
          He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.<i>
            "Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment, nor sinners
            in the congregation of the righteous."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Judgment is near. The Judge stands at the door. The great white throne
          will soon be set. The dead shall be judged out of those things which
          are written in the books according to their works. They cannot flee
          the dread tribunal. There is no escape. No mask can hide their guilt.
          Their sins are all recorded. No<i> </i>blood blots out the stains.
          They plead no Savior's merit. They have no interest in the saving
          cross. No solid ground sustains their feet. They cannot stand.
          Undefended, they receive the dreadful sentence, 'Depart! you cursed
          ones!' Thus they are cast far from the congregation of the righteous.
          May we live ever with this last scene before us, and never rest until
          clear evidence is ours that we have happy place in "the general
          assembly and church of the first-born, who are written in heaven."
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            6. "For the Lord knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the
            ungodly shall perish."
          </p>
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          Amid all their trials, sorrows, pains, reproaches, let the righteous
          lift up rejoicing heads. The eye of God rests on their way. He called
          them to the narrow road. He upholds their feeble steps. He safely
          leads them to the glorious end. Unfailing watchfulness surrounds them.
          But the broad road, with its unrighteous throng, goes down assuredly
          to hell.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Holy Spirit, give us the portion of the blessed man! May we escape the
          doom of the ungodly!
