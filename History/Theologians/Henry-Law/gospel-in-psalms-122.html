          The beauty and the glory of the Church of Christ are here typically
          represented. Let prayer be fervent for the Church.

          Joy gladdened the Israelite's heart when invited to proceed in happy
          company to the appointed worship at Jerusalem. He would rejoice in the
          hope of seeing the royal city and the Temple of his God. His spirit
          would exult in prospect of joining in the prayers and praises of the
          sanctuary. Gladness would largely revel when he exclaimed, Our feet
          shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem! Similar is the pious joy
          with which every true believer hastens to the Church's festivities. It
          is celestial happiness to join in common prayer, to lift up the voice
          in common praise, and to hear the proclamation of the glorious truths
          of Christ's gospel. But what lips can tell the joy of entering the New
          Jerusalem; and seeing our God face to face, and joining in the
          everlasting hallelujahs? With this bright prospect gladdening our
          souls may we go on our way rejoicing!

          3. <i>"Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together."</i>

        <p align="justify">
          Nothing could exceed the magnificence of the city of God. It abounded
          with all that art and wealth could contribute. Thus it stood the
          admiration of the world. Its perfect arrangements present a faint
          image of the glory of the New Jerusalem. The Spirit, by the pen of the
          enraptured John, describes the glorious scene. But splendid images
          cannot reach the reality.
          <i>To know what heaven is, heaven must be entered.</i> May we rejoice
          in the thought that each day brings us nearer to it!

            >"Where the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, to the testimony
            of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. For there are
            set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David."

        <p align="justify">
          Three times each year the males of the house of Israel were enjoined
          to attend the solemn feasts, to enter the Temple, which contained the
          testimony of the Lord, and there to bless His holy name. The day
          approaches when all who have rejoiced in Christ shall meet in the New
          Jerusalem. They shall come from the east and from the west, from the
          north and from the south, with joy and gladness, with thanksgiving,
          and the voice of melody. Let us see to it that we, also, shall have
          our place in this innumerable multitude. Believers are kings and
          priests now unto God. Then shall the promise be fulfilled, I say unto
          you, That you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son
          of man shall sit on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit upon
          twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
        </p>

          6-7.
          <i
            >"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; those shall prosper who love you.
            Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces."</i

        <p align="justify">
          We are exhorted to be constant in our prayers, that God's choicest
          blessings may descend upon the Church and make it fit for the
          inheritance of glory. Prayers for others are true prayers for
          ourselves. When we seek mercy on the Church in general, mercy will be
          given to us, as to all the members of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8-9,
          <i
            >"For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be
            within you. Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek
            your good."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Two grand motives are assigned for these prayers, the love of our
          brethren and our delight in the glory of God. May these motives ever
          swell in our hearts. Asking peace for others, we shall enjoy peace
          ourselves. If we honor God, He will honor us.
