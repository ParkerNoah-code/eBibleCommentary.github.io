        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Foes without number press upon the speaker. Prayer is his refuge.
          Calmly he sleeps. His fears are gone. Speak, Lord, that thus our
          hearts may ever rest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.<i> "O Lord, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me!"</i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The first scene shows the monarch flying from his heartless son.
          Absalom advances with rebellious hosts. The outcast father looks upon
          the swelling billows of foul treason. Increasing numbers hunt his
          life. He sees, and he appeals to God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here, also, our Jesus may be heard. The powers of darkness are
          combined. Hell and its legions terribly assail. Wicked men do their
          worst wickedly. On all sides troubles multiply. Many voices cry
          "Crucify." The servant follows in the suffering path. The true
          believer often will but moan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in
            God."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Affliction has the aspect of <i>desertion</i>. Many reason that God's
          favor surely would disperse these cloudsâ€”His voice could quickly
          scatter all the ills. David thus persecuted seems to be cast off. Here
          is <i>the scoff of Calvary</i>. "He trusted in God; let Him deliver
          Him now, if He will have Him. The thieves also, who were crucified
          with Him, cast the same in His teeth."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.
          <i
            >"But You, O Lord, are a shield for me; my glory and the lifter up
            of my head."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In darkest days faith shines with brightest glow. In the wild storm it
          looks to God and sings. No weapon can succeed against it. God, even
          God Himself, surrounds His children as a shield.
          <b>The shaft which touches them must pierce through God! </b>Welcome,
          also, reproach and ridicule and scorn. No disgrace can soil their
          name. They are renowned among the sons of men. Their glory is their
          God. No billows can submerge them. God, even their own God, lifts up
          their heads. From deepest waters Jesus rose to God's right hand. Where
          the Head is, there too shall the members be.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.<i>
            "I cried to the Lord with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy
            hill."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The voice of the insulting foe may loudly cry; but faith outcries. It
          has direct admission to the courts above. The blood-bought way is ever
          open. The interceding <i>Spirit prompts</i> the appeal. The mediating
          <i>Son presents</i> it. The <i>Father</i> on His throne
          <i> receives</i> it. Heaven opens, streams of answering blessings flow
          down. No case is desperate to him whose call can bring almightiness to
          his aid. Here is our Jesus. In the days of His flesh, He offered up
          prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto Him who
          was able to save Him from death, and was heard in that He feared.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.<i>
            "I laid down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The battlefield and the besieged fort present no downy couch. The
          alarms of war invite not to repose.<i> </i>But GOD
          <b>is a pillow to the head of faith!</b> David lies down, His sleep is
          sweet. He arises with renewed strength. But deeper truth sounds in
          these words. Jesus calmly falls asleep. The new-made grave receives
          Him to its bed. On the third day He casts off sleep. He appears and
          testifies, God did not leave My soul in hell, nor suffer His Holy One
          to see corruption. So, also, believers fall asleep in Him. Short is
          the night of death. Soon shall they awake and shout, "O grave! where
          is your victory? O death! where is your sting?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6.<i> "I am not afraid of ten thousand enemies who surround</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">me on every side."</p>

        <p align="justify">
          Faith is a fearless grace. It has quick ears to hear the voice of
          Heaven. It quickly catches the often repeated word, "Fear not, for I
          am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God." Let man come on,
          boastful of numbers, and vain-glorious in the arm of flesh; faith
          meets the hosts, strong in the Lord, making mention only of His name.
          The victory is sure. Jesus never lost a battle. No follower of His
          will ever fall.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7.<i>
            "Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God; for You have smitten all my
            enemies upon the jaw; You have broken the teeth of the ungodly."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Grace marvelously works. It begets fearless confidence. And confidence
          begets increasing prayer. Trust knows no fear, and shuns presumptuous
          indolence. It grows more importunate in prayer. It gives no rest to
          God. It knows its safety; and therefore it cries, "Save me, O my God."
          Past experience supplies both arguments and hope. You have brought
          shame and confusion on all vaunting foes; therefore, now arise and
          save.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8.<i>
            "Salvation belongs to the Lord; Your blessing is upon Your
            people."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Triumphant is the final chorus. It tells of God rich in salvation.
          Salvation is His property. He willed it. He provided it. He holds it.
          He gives it according to His sovereign purpose. It is deliverance from
          every peril. It is exaltation to the heights of heaven. His blessing
          ever rests upon His people. It gives them all things and never fails.
          Lord, save us, and we shall be saved. Bless us, and we shall be
          blessed! Amen.
