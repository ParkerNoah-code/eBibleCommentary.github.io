        <p align="justify">
          To the believer there is much joy in present state. There is, also,
          bright hope of rising to eternal life. May this joy and hope be our
          abiding portion!

          The Spirit draws aside the veil, and shows that Jesus is mainly
          present in this psalm. May we peruse it walking by His side, listening
          for His voice! He who was emphatically a Man of Sorrows was
          emphatically a man of faith. As such He was, also, a man of prayer. In
          all the trials of His low estate, the mind of Jesus rested on His God.
          When perils came as a devouring flood, He looked upward for preserving
          aid. Happy the members who trust and pray in the meek spirit of their
          Head!

          2, 3.
          <i
            >I said to the Lord, "You are my Master! All the good things I have
            are from you. The godly people in the land are my true heroes! I
            take pleasure in them!"</i

          Jesus professes that His inmost soul claims God as His God. Happy are
          our souls when they respond, O God, You are our God. The blessed state
          of God is perfect; it is infinite; the heaven-high pyramid cannot
          receive a higher stone. Redemption's work, which manifests His glory,
          cannot augment His bliss. Let not the foolish thought be ours that we
          can enlarge infinitude. We read the wondrous word, that from
          everlasting, Wisdom's delights were with the sons of men. In the days
          of Christ's flesh, the calm retreat of Bethany, the converse with His
          chosen followers, reflect this truth. Blessed be God, there still are
          saints on earth! Blessed are they who hold communion with them.

          <i
            >"Their sorrows shall be multiplied who hasten after another god;
            their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their
            names into my lips."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How prone is man to cast away the true and living God, and with
          deluded mind to rush to idol-worship! To multiply gods is to multiply
          sorrows. They are all devils, and their work is to torment. The godly
          man abhors their offerings, and spurns their very names. There was an
          offering of blood which Jesus offered; may we delight in it as all
          salvation.

          <i
            >"The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup; You
            maintain my lot. The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places;
            yes, I have a goodly heritage."</i

          Our blessed Jesus more than walked patiently in all His path below.
          There was joy set before Him which gladdened His every step. In Christ
          God is our God forever. Can we desire more?
          <i>How rich is this portion!</i> How reviving is our cup! How can we
          bless His grace enough who has called us to this ennobling state?
          <i>Angels</i> are ours to guard us.

          <i>Providences</i> are ours to secure our bliss. The
          <i>God-Man's blood</i>

          is ours to wash out every sin. A <i>righteousness</i> is prepared to
          robe us for the courts above. <i>Heaven</i> is promised as our endless
          home. We have a goodly heritage.

          Jesus bears the sweet name of Counselor, and sweetly does He execute
          His office. He sends His Spirit to admonish and gently to direct. This
          is His gracious work. To Him be all the praise. He adds instruction in
          times of silence and of solitude, when the world is far away. He
          visits the deep recesses of the heart. He communes with the secrets of
          the soul, and deeply writes His lessons of pure wisdom. Let us again
          say, "Bless the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8, 9.
          <i
            >"I have set the Lord always before me; because He is at my right
            hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory
            rejoices; my flesh also shall rest in hope."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The mind of Jesus ever rested on God's will. He came to earth, He
          lived, He worked, He died to glorify His Father. He knew that God was
          ever by His side. He feared not the assaults of men or devils. His
          cause could never totter. He surely marched to triumph. Therefore in
          all His trials His heart was tranquil and His lips sang praise. He
          knew indeed that He must hang a dead man on the Cross; He must exhaust
          death's bitter cup. But His tomb was bright in prospect that the
          <i>dark bed</i> would soon be left. All His members share this trust.
          May this faith be largely ours! The eye that ever looks for God may
          ever see Him. He is ever near, and near to help. Can he be moved on
          whose right hand God stands?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10.
          <i
            >"because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let
            your Holy One see decay."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Spirit here foreshows the glorious truth that death could not
          detain our Lord. Christ breaks the icy shackles; He leaves the short
          imprisonment. No corruption taints the sacred body. He stands again
          alive on earth. Infallible proofs demonstrate that He who was dead is
          now alive. Except the Lord's near coming should prevent it, we too
          must sleep the sleep of death. We are not screened from corruption.
          Decay will riot on these frames. But short will be death's triumph.
          The trumpet will sound. Corruption shall put on incorruption.
        </p>

          11.
          <i
            >"You will show me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of
            joy; at Your right hand there are pleasures forevermore."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The heart of Jesus was sustained by joys before Him; joys in His
          Heavenly Father's throneâ€”joys which should have no end. Shall not we
          too lift up expectant heads? The voice of truth assures us, "The glory
          which You gave Me, I have given them." Thought staggers. Minds are
          narrow to embrace the bliss; but faith entirely believes. Hope bounds
          toward the fulfillment. Happy the hours which flow in meditation on
          fullness of joy and pleasures with God forevermore! To gaze on this
          glorious prospect is heaven begun. What will the reality bestow? Lord
          grant that we may quickly know!
