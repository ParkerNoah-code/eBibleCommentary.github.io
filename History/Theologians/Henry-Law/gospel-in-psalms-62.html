        <p align="justify">
          Firm confidence in God is here avowed. He is commended as a high
          fortress of protection. The ruin of the ungodly is foreshown;
          exhortations to trust in God follow, with recognition of His precious
          attributes. May we be enabled to adopt His language as the feeling of
          our souls!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"Truly my soul waits upon God; from Him comes my salvation. He only
            is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be
            greatly moved."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Amid all tossing conflicts and disturbing alarms, the Christian has a
          home of sweet repose. He can recline on God, and feel that everlasting
          arms are underneath him. This, amid all the troubles of his troubled
          life, was David's sweet experience. He looked not to man; he conferred
          not with flesh and blood. He knew that from God only sure protection
          came. With overflowing joy he testifies, "He only is my rock and my
          salvation. He is my defense." A rock high above all foes, immovable
          against all assaults—salvation to the very uttermost from all the
          menaces of man, from all the miseries of sin, from all the accusations
          of conscience, from all the powers of Satan. Sheltered in Him, he had
          no fears that he should be cast down; he might tremble when hard
          pressed, but he well knew that he should not be greatly moved.

          3-4.
          <i
            >"How long will you imagine mischief against a man? You shall be
            slain, all of you; you shall be as a bowing wall, and as a tottering
            fence. They only consult to cast him down from his excellency; they
            delight in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse
            inwardly."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          From his high munition he expostulates with his crafty foes. He
          foresees that their schemes will soon be overthrown—that all their
          boasted prowess shall be crushed in ruins, as the wall falls whose
          foundations are undermined, and as the weak fence which shakes beneath
          the slightest touch. He avows his knowledge of their inward
          character—their plot to subvert those whom God has exalted. Falsehood
          and curses are their constant means of mischief.
        </p>

          5-7.
          <i
            >"My soul, wait only upon God; for my expectation is from Him. He
            only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be
            moved. In God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength,
            and my refuge, is in God."</i

          By easy transit he reverts to God, and realizes his own happy state.
          He calls upon his soul to utterly reject all other trust, and to make
          God its only resting place. Faith glows in brighter blaze, and renews
          expressions to testify the firmness of such hope. He recently had
          stated that he had no fears of being "greatly moved;" but now he
          rejoices in the persuasion that he shall not be moved at all. What God
          was to David, the same is He yesterday, today, and forever. Let us fan
          by all means this persuasion into the strength of full assurance. Then
          we shall lift high our heads above surrounding troubles.

        <p align="justify">
          Faith ever strives to win others to partake in its delights. Here
          others are exhorted at all times to repose their confidence in God.
          Let them restrain no feeling. Let them hide no distress. Let them pour
          forth all their woes. Let their inmost need be referred to Him. Let
          their whole hearts be opened to His view. He will not turn away. He
          will give audience. His arms will be a sure and ready refuge.

          <i
            >"Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a
            lie; to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than
            vanity. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery; if
            riches increase, set not your heart upon them."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Disappointment is the lot of those who turn from God to man. No sure
          help can ever be derived from such source. Survey our total race from
          highest station to the lowest grade. Weigh them together in the
          balances of truth. How worthless is their accumulated weight! One
          inscription marks them all—"Vanity of vanities. All is vanity."

        <p align="justify">
          If wealth is hoarded, and iniquitous means obtain it, let the heart
          scorn it. There is no real help in it.

          11-12.
          <i
            >"God has spoken once; twice have I heard this, that power belongs
            to God. Also unto You, O Lord, belongs mercy; for You render to
            every man according to his work."</i

          Blessed be God, He has revealed Himself! Again and again His
          attributes are set before us. Let them be our constant study and our
          constant trust. They tell us of His POWER. It is omnipotent. Is it not
          then sure protection? They tell us of His MERCY. It has no bounds.
          Will it not extend to us? They tell us, also, that soon the JUDGMENT
          will be set and the books opened, and we shall be judged out of those
          things which are written in the books, according to our works.
