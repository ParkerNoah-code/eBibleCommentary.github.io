        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Persecution in another form here agitates the Psalmist's mind. A
          fearful picture of the persecutors' hate is next exhibited. Confidence
          in their ruin is expressed. God surely will maintain the righteous
          cause.
        </p>

            "Justice—do you rulers know the meaning of the word? Do you judge
            the people fairly? No, all your dealings are crooked; you hand out
            violence instead of justice."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          If any seat should be preeminently conspicuous in honest equity, it is
          the tribunal of justice. But when the cause of God has called for
          righteous judgment, how often has iniquity perverted the decree! David
          found no acquittal from the courts of Saul. Mark, also, the Sanhedrin
          and the unstable judge who administered the Roman law! Spotless
          innocence did not avert unrighteous condemnation. No guilt was found;
          freedom from shadow of blame was allowed; but the sentence was, 'Let
          him die.' Crucifixion was decreed. Happy are those who look to Him
          whose right hand is full of righteousness, and look to the tribunal
          where the plea "Christ died" cannot be urged in vain, but ensures not
          acquittal only, but exaltation to the throne of glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-5.
          <i
            >"The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray as soon as
            they be born, speaking lies. Their poison is like the poison of a
            serpent; they are like the deaf adder that stops her ear; which will
            not listen to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Injustice and cruelty are here traced to the first cause of original
          corruption. These noxious streams issue from an evil spring. These
          hateful berries hang on branches rotten to the core. Men are shaped in
          iniquity; in sin do mothers conceive their offspring. If heavenly
          grace comes not mercifully to renew, convert, and sanctify, a corrupt
          offspring cannot fail to move in paths of corruption. Mark what issues
          from the nursery—proneness to depart far from God; tendency to
          fabricate untruth, and to misrepresent, and to delight in lies. Their
          words contain all venom. The viper's poison is the emblem of their
          destroying tongues. To all instruction they are deaf. As the adder
          with closed ears is unmoved by sweetest melody, so they are touched
          not by the silver notes of God's enchanting word.

            >"Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; tear out, O Lord, the
            fangs of the lions! Let them vanish like water that flows away; when
            they draw the bow, let their arrows be blunted. Like a slug melting
            away as it moves along, like a stillborn child, may they not see the
            sun. God will sweep them away, both young and old, faster than a pot
            heats on an open flame."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The Spirit here, to support and console afflicted saints, gives strong
          assurance of approaching vengeance. The weapons of their foes shall be
          broken. Their power of evil shall gradually be brought to nothing, as
          waters lessen when they flow away. They may bend the bow, and prepare
          the arrows, but these implements shall take no effect. Graphic images
          of weakness portray their utter impotency to prosecute their schemes.
          Wrath shall break suddenly upon them, and sweep them from the earth,
          as the fury of an unexpected whirlwind. Quickly will they perish, even
          more quickly than the blazing fuel can warm a caldron.

            >"The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he shall
            wash his feet in the blood of the wicked."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When God's holy indignation is thus conspicuously displayed, the godly
          should thankfully recognize God's just displeasure. Pity for the
          miserable offenders they should feel, but joy in God's glory should
          prevail. The blood of the wicked should be as a fountain, in which
          their feet should wash, and as a warning to walk more warily.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11.
          <i
            >"So that a man shall say, truly there is a reward for the
            righteous; truly He is a God who judges in the earth."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The truth will brightly shine, and compel acknowledgment that the
          righteous shall at last inherit manifestations of favor, and God's
          unerring tribunal will righteously dispense justice. When the great
          white throne is set, may we receive the welcome, "Come, blessed
          children of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
          foundation of the world."
