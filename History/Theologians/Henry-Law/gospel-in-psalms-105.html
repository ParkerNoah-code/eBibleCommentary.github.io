        <p align="justify">
          An earnest call invites to universal praise. The story of God's
          dealings with His ancient people is used to quicken this hymn.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-4.
          <i
            >"O give thanks to the Lord; call upon His name; make known His
            deeds among the people. Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him; talk of all
            His wondrous works. Glory in His holy name; let the heart of those
            rejoice who seek the Lord. Seek the Lord, and His strength; seek His
            face evermore."</i

        <p align="justify">
          It is a blessed task to seek the Lord rejoicingly in praise.
          Supplications should be intermixed. Prayer should awaken praise, and
          praise enliven prayer. God's mighty deeds afford large scope. It
          should be incessant joy to recall His wonders, and to encircle them
          with outbursts of adoring hymns. Thus let us seek the Lord, and
          magnify His strength, and come into His presence.
        </p>

            the judgments of His mouth; O seed of Abraham His servant, you
            children of Jacob His chosen. He is the Lord our God; His judgments
            are in all the earth."</i

          Memory is a precious gift. It places past events in vivid light. Let
          our minds be as a well-written narrative of Israel's story. The
          especial call here is to the lineal seed of Abraham. But if we are
          Christ's, then we are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
          promise. In His dealings with the fathers of the Church we may trace
          our interest in His care.

          <i
            >"He has remembered His covenant forever, the word which He
            commanded to a thousand generations; which covenant He made with
            Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac; and confirmed the same to Jacob
            for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant; saying, To you
            will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; when
            they were but a few men in number; yes, very few, and strangers in
            it."</i

          In the plenitude of His grace He called Abraham from the land of
          idolatry to be the progenitor of a mighty nation. He blessed him with
          rich and large promises, and He solemnly confirmed the same to the son
          in whom his seed was called. He decreed that His covenant should
          endure from age to age. He especially declared that a lovely portion
          of this earth should be their abode; Free grace alone was the moving
          motive of this favor. At that time Abraham's household was but a
          little band, small and homeless. In the promised Canaan we may behold
          our heavenly rest. Let faith clasp the assurance that in due time this
          rest shall be our everlasting portion.

            another people, He permitted no man to do them wrong; yes, He
            reproved kings for their sakes; saying, Touch not My anointed, and
            do My prophets no harm."</i

          The early story shows them strangers and pilgrims upon earth. They
          wandered from place to place. They were regarded with jealousy by the
          potentates of this world. Constant perils threatened their
          destruction. But God was their shield. He permitted no violence to
          injure.

          <i
            >"Moreover, He called for a famine upon the land; He broke the whole
            staff of bread. He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold
            for a servant; whose feet they hurt with fetters; he was laid in
            iron; until the time that His word came; the word of the Lord tried
            him. The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and
            let him go free. He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his
            substance; to bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his
            senators wisdom."</i

          They were cradled and nurtured in perilous providences. Famine
          oppressed them. A favorite son was carried as a slave to Egypt. He was
          immured in prison and shackled in galling chains. But he emerged to
          sit beside the monarch on his throne, and to guide the rulers with
          wise counsels. At every point in this story let us pause and marvel;
          but at no pause let praise be silent. For love to His chosen is
          preeminently shown. The sun at times might be obscured; but soon the
          rays resumed their power. Let, then, the truth delight our hearts, I
          have loved you with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness
          have I drawn you.

          Constraining circumstances brought Jacob and his household into Egypt.
          Here God's smile crowned them with prosperity. Their numbers rapidly
          increased. The surrounding natives witnessed their growing power.
          Jealousy was quick to see where strength resided.

          God allowed the vile passions to intensify. The king's heart was
          hardened and his eyes were blinded. He did not see the all-directing
          hand of God. Crafty schemes were devised to extirpate. Impiety strove
          by subtle arts to keep them low.

          When God has a purpose to accomplish He raises suitable instruments.
          His work can never fail because means are insufficient. Is it not
          written, that of the very stones He can raise up children unto
          Abraham! So He called Moses and Aaron to their destined posts. They
          came forth fearless of the tyrant, and exhibited credentials that they
          were sent of heaven.

            He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against
            His word. He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
            Their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of their
            kings. He spoke, and there came different sorts of flies, and lice
            in all their coasts. He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in
            their land. He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, and broke
            the trees of their coasts. He spoke, and the locusts came, and
            caterpillars, and them without number, and ate up all the herbs in
            their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. He smote also
            all the first-born in their land, the chief of all their
            strength."</i

          Terrible plagues afflicted the persecuting land. With appalling deeds
          God showed His wrath. The sun concealed its light. Darkness spread its
          thickest pall around. The trembling people sat in more than midnight
          gloom. The waters of their noble river flowed in blood and poison. All
          nature warred against them, and encircled them in hopeless ruin.
          Noisome reptiles filled their houses with distress. There was no
          escape. Herbage withered. The fruits of the field were blasted. Death
          entered into every dwelling, and loud cries bewailed the smitten
          first-born. God, who never lacks means to save, now sent forth
          instruments to destroy.

          His chosen people left their bondage enriched with treasures and
          invigorated with health. Egypt, which had exulted in oppression, was
          more delighted to witness their departure.

            night. The people asked, and He brought quails, and satisfied them
            with the bread of heaven. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed
            out; they ran in the dry places like a river. For He remembered His
            holy promise, and Abraham His servant. And He brought forth His
            people with joy, and His chosen with gladness; and gave them the
            lands of the heathen; and they inherited the labor of the people;
            that they might observe His statutes, and keep His laws. Praise the
            Lord."</i

          It is sweet profit to contemplate God's gracious care of Israel in the
          wilderness, and the power with which He planted them triumphant in the
          promised land. There can be no limits to the praise thus swelling in
          the heart. By day a cloudy covering was their screen; by night it
          brightened into a vast luminary. At their request fowls fell in
          abundance round the camp. Water from the smitten rock flowed for them.
          Not one word of promise failed. Goodness and mercy followed their
          advancing steps, until they reaped the plenty of their promised home.
          Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
