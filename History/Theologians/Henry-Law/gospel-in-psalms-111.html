        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Praise is the one theme of this enrapturing Psalm. Various motives
          call to this homage. May they all excite response in our adoring
          hearts!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Praise the Lord. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, in
            the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Praise is the tribute which never can be fully paid. Beginning in
          time, it will swell throughout eternity. Not only should our lips
          rejoice in this grace; we should exhort others to the godly exercise.
          Precept should enforce the duty; example should mark out the path.
          This praise should issue from hearts overflowing with grateful love.
          Shame on all meager utterance and all cold expression! The whole
          heart, with every affection, should be rapturously engaged. We should
          thus testify our love, not only in seasons of retirement, but publicly
          in the assemblies of the sanctuary.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2-4.
          <i
            >"The works of the Lord are great, sought out by all those who have
            pleasure in them. His work is honorable and glorious; and His
            righteousness endures forever. He has made His wonderful works to be
            remembered; the Lord is gracious, and full of compassion."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Calls to praise exceed all number. The works of His hands ever supply
          matter. They are a treasure-house of wonders. They are worthy of our
          constant study. The more we discover, the more we shall find fullness
          of delight. As our pleasure expands, the more praise should blaze as a
          flaming torch. His works, also, are all worthy of Himself. They
          reflect the glory of His righteousness. This feature is indelibly
          stamped on all. As time rolls on these works endure. The remembrance
          of them has immortal life. From generation to generation they declare
          His essence, and testify that grace and tenderness ever flow from His
          throne.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-6.
          <i
            >"He has given food to those who fear Him; He will ever be mindful
            of His covenant. He has shown His people the power of His works,
            that He may give them the heritage of the heathen."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Ample provision satisfies the needs of His people. Tender care watches
          over them. In all this marvelous arrangement, these gracious dealings
          proclaim Him as our faithful Father. The everlasting covenant in
          Christ secures unfailing blessings. This covenant never can be broken.
          Therefore the stream of blessings never can be stopped. Special
          wonders were exhibited to His chosen people of old. The heathen were
          driven out, that His people might occupy the promised inheritance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-8.
          <i
            >"The works of His hands are verity and judgment; all His
            commandments are sure. They stand fast forever and ever, and are
            done in truth and uprightness."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The works of the Lord are echoes to the glories of His word. They are
          the accomplishment of His sure promises. They are bright mirrors in
          which we may read His verity and judgment. No power of opposing foes
          can contravene His decrees. While we read His truth in all the wonders
          of His hand, let us abound more in grateful thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9-10.
          <i
            >"He has sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His
            covenant forever; holy and reverend is His name. The fear of the
            Lord is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all those
            who do His commandments; His praise endures forever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The bright crown of His works is the redemption of His people. This is
          the substance of His everlasting covenant. It is our wisdom to regard
          with awe the marvels of His dealings. Let us fear and love. Let us
          love and praise.
