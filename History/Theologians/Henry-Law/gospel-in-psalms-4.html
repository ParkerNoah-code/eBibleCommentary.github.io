          <font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>Psalm 4</b></font>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This psalm begins with prayer. Solemn admonition and earnest
          entreaties follow. Then the believer's chief good appears in contrast
          to the lot of the ungodly. May that chief good be richly ours!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness; You have enlarged
            me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my
            prayer."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Acquaintance with God brings mighty help to prayer. Strong arguments
          flow from experience. "You are my righteousness" is a prevailing
          motive. The believer stands pardoned through grace, and richly robed
          in Jesus' merits. One with Christ, he appears as free from guilt as
          God's own Son. He, also, can boldly point to past deliverances. Many
          had been his difficulties, but the chains were loosened, and God set
          him free. He thus gains courage for urgent prayers, and he learns the
          art of winning mercies. He plies it well.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"How long, O men, will you turn my glory into shame? How long will
            you love delusions and seek false gods?"</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          True grace is pitiful of sin's mad ways, and seeks occasion to
          remonstrate. The service of God is glory. The wicked scorn it as
          contemptible. What folly can be worse! Their hearts delight in this
          world's empty bauble. They greedily pursue a mocking shadow. Wisdom
          expostulates, How long! When will such madness have an end!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.<i>
            "But know that the Lord has set apart him who is godly for Himself.
            The Lord will hear when I call unto Him."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          There is a truth which annihilates such folly. God has a chosen seed.
          Eternal destination marks them as His own. They are godly because the
          Spirit seeks and calls and works most mightily within them. They are
          severed from the world as wheat from chaff, as gold from dross, as
          sheep from goats, as jewels from the quarry's dust. They are
          distinguished with most precious grace, especially with the gift of
          prayer. They often call, and never call in vain. Know this, O sons of
          men, and cease your fruitless opposition.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.<i> "Stand in awe, and sin not; commune with </i>your

          <i>own heart upon your bed, and be still."</i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Wise precepts here instruct. Ponder the greatness, the majesty, the
          power, the glory of Jehovah. Tremble in awe of His almightiness. Let
          holy dread repress each rebel thought. His arm is raised against all
          sin. Flee sin, then, as most sure destruction. Search the recesses of
          your treacherous hearts. Detect their secret whispers. Nip evil in its
          earliest bud. In still retirement, in night's tranquil hours, become
          acquainted with yourselves. Thus learn the happy art of checking
          wicked words. Become expert in silence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. <i>"Offer the sacrifices </i>of
          <i>righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord."</i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          In worship let all formality be unknown. Outward service is vain show
          except the<i> </i>heart and all its powers grow warm. Those who
          worship God must worship Him in spirit and in truth. Do not trust in
          your holiest acts. Sin soils them all. Your best is worth nothing! No,
          rather, it is a filthy rag before God's eyes. When all is done, your
          trust must be in God's tender mercy, in forbearing grace, in pardoning
          love, in the atoning blood. There is no hope for man but in the work
          of Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6.<i>
            "There are many who say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift up
            the light </i
          >of <i>Your countenance upon us."</i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The restless worldling is ever craving and is ever void. Conscious of
          inward emptiness, he seeks contentment which he never finds. The
          flowers plucked soon wither in the hand. The sigh is frequent, "Ah!
          that I knew where happiness resides!" Believers know that all delights
          are in God's smile, in a sense of His reconciled love, in His abiding
          favor, in the sight of His glory in the face of Jesus Christ. This is
          the joy of joys, the heaven of heavens. For this incessant prayer
          should be made. Shine, gracious Lord! Cause darkness to flee far away!
          Let Your bright beams bring light and floods of peace. May we ever
          revel in the rich joy of the Gospel's tidings!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7.<i>
            "You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their
            corn and their wine increased."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Let the world scorn. Believers are the happy men. David's experience
          is their common lot. Their happiness is inward—the heart is its
          seat—it is implanted by God. It is real, substantial, and abiding. It
          laughs to scorn the transient merriment which earth's plenty gives.
          Excitement may follow the abundant harvest; revelry may exult in the
          luxuriant vintage; but the flare is momentary, and sinks in gloom. It
          is from earth, and earthly. The joy of the Lord is like the
          Giver—pure, perfect, and eternal.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8.<i>
            "I will both lay down in peace and sleep; for You alone, O Lord,
            make me to dwell in safety."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          How sweet is the peace resulting from God's smile! No rage of earth or
          hell can ruffle it. In all disquietudes it is unmoved repose. What God
          bestows, no power can disturb. His gift is safety. Safe then are His
          people. Such is the Spirit's teaching in this psalm. May our hearts be
          able to respond, 'Our glad experience attests these truths!'
