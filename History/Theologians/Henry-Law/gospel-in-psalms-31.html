        <p align="justify">
          The believer's security is in God in every trial, through life, and in
          death. May we be kept by His mighty power through faith unto eternal
          life!

            me in Your righteousness."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The voice from the cross decides that we have here the thoughts and
          feelings of our blessed Lord. In the exercise of faith He leads the
          way. In prayer for favors He is our example. It is good to tell our
          God how fully we rely on Him. We may be bold to ask deliverance on the
          plea of righteous covenant and holy promises.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2, 3.
          <i
            >"Bow down Your ear to me; deliver me speedily; be my strong rock,
            for a house of defense to save me. For You are my rock and my
            fortress; therefore, for Your name's sake, lead me, and guide
            me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The grace to be importunate in prayer is very precious, and should be
          diligently cultivated. Faith deals familiarly, and supplicates that
          God would take the attitude of an earnest listener, and drink in every
          cry, and speedily arise to help. Faith rightfully expects that God
          would be true to the character which He has revealed. It argues, God's
          glorious perfections will be tarnished if the believer strays
          unguided.

          The blessed Jesus was exposed to many crafty wiles, but never were His
          feet entangled. Snares on all sides beset us. Conscious of inability
          to extricate ourselves, let us look to the strong to put forth a
          mighty hand, most mightily to extricate us.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Let us bless Jesus that His dying lips have given special sanctity to
          these words. How many since have thus breathed their last breath? May
          they be our constant utterance, for we know not what word may be our
          last. When we assuredly believe that God has redeemed us by His Son's
          precious blood, and are persuaded that His holy Word is truth, we may,
          without one fear, commit our spirits to His care. The custody is safe.
          He must be greater than God, who plucks our souls from His protecting
          hands.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6, 7, 8.
          <i
            >"I have hated those who regard lying vanities; but I trust in the
            Lord. I will be glad and rejoice in Your mercy; for You have
            considered my trouble; You have known my soul in adversities; and
            have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet
            in a large room."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Many vain cheats are impudent to deceive us. Riches, honor, titles,
          reason, intellect, invite us to rely on their aid. But they are empty
          bubbles. Their promises are fraud. The believer flees with abhorrence
          from those who walk in these deceits. He has a large volume of
          experience. In trouble he has found that God's thoughts were on him.
          All his adverse circumstances have been lovingly regarded. In all his
          ways of sorrow God has been by his side. Deliverance and enlargement
          have been near. Great mercy has been shown; great gladness will
          acknowledge it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9, 10.
          <i
            >"Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; my eye is
            consumed with grief, yes, my soul and my belly. For my life is spent
            with grief, and my years with sighing; my strength fails because of
            my iniquity, and my bones are consumed."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Our first thoughts here are thoughts of Jesus. He bore our sins; on
          Him our every iniquity was laid. He stood before God, laden with all
          our sins. By imputation, He was a mass of guilt. This would be acute
          anguish to His soul. Grief would be His constant comrade. Sorrow would
          plough furrows on His brow. Declining strength would show the
          increased woe. He would often sigh, "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I
          am in trouble."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here, also, is the anguish of the conscience-stricken. When sin is
          once seen in all its hideous sinfulness, when guilt before God is once
          discovered, the misery would drive reason from its seat, unless the
          grief found vent in cries for mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11, 12, 13.
          <i
            >"I was a reproach among all my enemies, but especially among my
            neighbors, and a fear to my acquaintance; those who saw me outside
            fled from me. I am forgotten as a dead man, out of mind; I am like a
            broken vessel. For I have heard the slander of many; fear was on
            every side; while they took counsel together against me, they
            devised to take away my life."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The Spirit vividly foreshows the sufferings of Jesus when He was
          despised and rejected of men. His chosen followers forsook Him and
          fled. He was carried as a dead man to the tomb. He was regarded as a
          broken piece of pottery worthless for further use. The Jews conspired
          to destroy Him. Nothing could allay their malice. Their cry was
          urgent, 'Let Him be crucified.'
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Much of this cruel usage was experienced by the <i>type</i>. David
          fled as an outcast. Conspirators laid plots. Evil counselors took evil
          counsel. Similar enmity burns against every true disciple. Outward
          restraints may bind, but the inward hatred is the same.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          14. <i>"But I trusted in you, O Lord; I said, You are my God."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God is the refuge of His people in all ages. To Him they fly. In Him
          they are secure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15.
          <i
            >"My times are in Your hand; deliver me from the hand of my enemies,
            and from those who persecute me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is a flood of comfort in the thought that God's unfailing
          providence orders all our matters. Each event is surely ordered. If
          without Him no sparrow falls, surely without Him no evil prevails
          against us. His hand is over all. He can deliver from each foe's
          malice, and each persecutor's rage. Knowing this, let us direct our
          prayer to Him, the only source of help.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16, 17, 18.
          <i
            >"Make Your face shine upon Your servant; save me for Your mercies'
            sake. Let me not be ashamed, O Lord; for I have called upon You; let
            the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. Let the
            lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly
            and contemptuously against the righteous."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The misery of the godly is the absence of the smile of heaven. The
          soul cannot be still while such darkness and such chill continues. It
          knows that the Lord can instantly cause brightness to return. Hence
          the strong petition, "Make Your face shine." This light is full
          salvation. Therefore faith adds, "Save me for Your mercies' sake."
          God's mercy is the only plea, but it is mighty and prevails.
          <i>Mercy implored is mercy won. </i>Grace ceases to be grace if it
          rejects the supplicant's cry.

          <i>Prayer will never hang down its head abashed. </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          But a day of confusion quickly comes. Wicked lips spoke with proud
          contempt against the blessed Jesus.
          <i>Excuse will fail before the great white throne. </i>Shame will then
          close their lips. When slander assails us, let us reflect, How short
          is this day of evil! We shall sing loudly, while the lips of lies are
          only opened to bewail.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19.
          <i
            >"Oh how great is Your goodness, which You have laid up for those
            who do not fear; which You have wrought for those who trust in You
            before the sons of men!"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Grateful experience cannot be silent. Exclamation will break forth. In
          the midst of trials, comforts more than abound. God's treasure-house
          is full of joys. The believer finds that the store exceeds all
          thought, and baffles praise. He can only shout, 'How great is Your
          goodness!' Truly, it is great as God is great. To measure the
          infinitudes of grace is to measure God Himself. His precious dealings
          towards His favored children are often so conspicuously displayed,
          that enmity itself cannot deny that God is truly with them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          20.
          <i
            >"You shall hide them in the secret of Your presence from the pride
            of man; You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife
            of tongues."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When haughty man insults, and tongues send forth poison darts, the
          child of God has a sure hiding place. His God is present. He screens
          himself behind His sheltering wings. He enters the inmost curtains of
          a secreting tent. He is hidden in light. It is a great mystery. None
          can explain but those who feel it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          21.
          <i
            >"Blessed be the Lord; for He has shown me His marvelous kindness in
            a strong city."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such, doubtless, would be David's feeling when he reigned in Zion;
          and, doubtless, such would be His praise. But this is especially the
          believer's song. He has a strong city. God has appointed salvation for
          walls and bulwarks. He enters into Christ. He sits secure in an
          impregnable fort. No foe can pass the gates. No might can make
          impression on the walls. The foundations are exceedingly strong. The
          towers over-top the skies. Serene in His fortress he learns many
          lessons, and feasts on precious truths. They all speak of mercy,
          grace, love; and all these sweet displays are wonderful. Wondrous
          indeed the kindness which looked on miserable rebels, and sent Jesus
          to seek and save! Wondrous the scheme! Wondrous the effects! Wonder of
          wonders that we should have interest in it! We can only cry, "Blessed
          God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          22.
          <i

            nevertheless You heard the voice of my supplications when I cried to
            You."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The movements of the believer's mind are quite a paradox. Gleams of
          sunshine follow the cloudy gloom. He fears amid all confidence; he
          trusts amid all misgivings. He speaks in haste; but still his soul is
          tranquil steadfastness. He thinks that he is utterly rejected; but
          still he prays. He believes that all hope is gone; but answers come to
          every cry.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Abundant motives call to the love of God; not least His constant care
          of His true children, and His sure vengeance on proud foes. Let us
          trust, and we are safe. They who transgress shall surely be requited.
        </p>

          24.
          <i

          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Trust must rely only on our God. All other confidences are empty
          vanity. They who thus trust may cast away all fear. Let them meet
          every trial bold as the lion. Courage will become more courageous.
          Strength from above will make the heart more strong.
