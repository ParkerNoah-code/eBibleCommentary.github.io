          Manifold blessings belong to those who fear the Lord. May we gaze on
          the display until it is our own realized enjoyment!
        </p>

          <i
            >"Blessed is everyone who fears the Lord; who walks in His ways."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The fear of the Lord is an inestimable gift. Let it be sought with our
          whole hearts. Let it be diligently nurtured. It comes from above. It
          is the Spirit's work. It is the herald of a train of countless
          blessings. It is evidenced by close adherence to the Gospel-rule.
          Those who fear God will dread the slightest wandering from His path.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"For you shall eat the labor of your hands; you shall be happy, and
            it shall be well with you."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The grace of fear will work diligence in all appointed works.
          Indolence is a mark of gracelessness. Abundant fruit follows Christian
          toil. No good thing shall be withheld. True happiness fills the hearts
          which tremble at the Word. God will cause the sunshine of prosperity
          to brighten in their homes. Who will not pray, Lord, give us this
          blessed fear! As heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy
          towards those who fear Him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.
          <i
            >"Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of your house;
            your children like olive-plants round about your table."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Not only shall prosperity attend the customary employ of the hands,
          but domestic joys shall be dispensed as the Lord thinks well. His
          blessing will fill the cup of family happiness to overflowing.
        </p>

          4-6.
          <i
            >"Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that fears the Lord.
            The Lord shall bless you out of Zion; and you shall see the good of
            Jerusalem all the days of your life. Yes, you shall see your
            children's children, and peace upon Israel."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Spiritual blessings shall especially be multiplied. The prosperity of
          the Church shall be seen, and shall augment the bliss. Converts shall
          spring up as among the grass, as willows by the watercourses. They
          shall fly as doves to their windows. Lord grant these blessings, and
          may our eyes behold the peace of Your children! So shall we love and
          praise You more and more! Let us ever bless the Holy Spirit for thus
          alluring us to Gospel-walk. The picture is enchanting. The real
          enjoyment exceeds description.
