        <p align="justify">
          The Psalms thus close. But praise shall never end. Let praise be the
          constant ecstasy of all our powers and all our time. Eternity will
          prolong, but never end the strain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Praise the Lord. Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the
            firmament of His power."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Exhortation still stirs up praise. Worthy, indeed, is the Lord to be
          praised throughout the universe. Let His praise be heard in the public
          service of His house, where His saints assemble to magnify His name.
          Let it swell in the highest heavens, where angelic hosts and all the
          redeemed lift up their joyful voices in adoring strains.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to His
            excellent greatness."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Mighty indeed are God's acts in creation, providence, and grace.
          Creation is a volume replete with wonders. They surpass all power to
          enumerate. They exceed all admiration. Providence is wonderful in
          showing His mind in constant operation. But redemption causes love to
          overflow in wonder. It excites our loudest shouts. To estimate its
          exceeding preciousness the eternal kingdom must be reached. The
          innumerable multitude must be joined before we can fully realize that
          all sin is washed away, and every transgression pardoned, and the
          law's curse removed, and righteousness divine bestowed as the
          resplendent robe of heaven. Then will be the joy of knowing that mercy
          has brought us to the journey's end; that endless rest is reached and
          endless hallelujahs placed upon the lips. Then shall eternal bliss
          flow on; then shall the realm of glory shout endlessly the Redeemer's
          praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-5.
          <i
            >"Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet; praise Him with the
            psaltery and harp. Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him
            with stringed instruments and organs. Praise Him on the loud
            cymbals; praise Him on the high-sounding cymbals."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the days of Levitical type and shadow, musical instruments of every
          form and power contributed to swell the melody. Now, when spiritual
          service takes its enlightening place, let every rational faculty make
          our hallelujahs sweet and loud. Are may sing and spirituality still
          live.
        </p>

          6.
          <i
            >"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the
            Lord."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Fitting is the grand conclusion of this book of hymns and odes and
          spiritual songs. Let us obey the just command. Every breath is God's
          free gift. Let every breath fly upward on the wings of adoration. But
          all our efforts can scarcely reach the outlines of due praise. May the
          Lord inspire us more and more! May we thus prepare to praise Him
          better when we cast our crowns before His throne. Praise the Lord!
          Amen and Amen.
