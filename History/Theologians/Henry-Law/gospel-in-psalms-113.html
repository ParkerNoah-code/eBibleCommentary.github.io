          Praise continues to be the happy theme. Contemplation of God's majesty
          and greatness and goodness tend largely to kindle this flame. Let us
          meditate until warmth glows and praise blazes within!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"Praise the Lord. Praise, O you servants of the Lord, praise the
            name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time
            forth and forevermore."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The servants of the Lord are addressed. They are called to their
          richest enjoyment. Those who serve the Lord prove how they love His
          service by ever telling the glories of His name. It is the
          constellation of His attributes, and each attribute presents a
          boundless ocean of delight. Praise, also, must be endless. Through
          endless being those who know and love Him will never cease to revel in
          this joy. Praise is as eternal as the love which kindles it.

          <i

            Lord's name is to be praised."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Is there a spot on earth which is not witness of God's goodness? Is
          there a region of the globe in which this homage should not abound? Is
          there a living being who is not a partaker of His tender mercies? Is
          there a mother's son who should not testify thanksgiving? From east to
          west, from pole to pole, the constant sound should be adoring praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4-6.
          <i
            >"The Lord is high above all nations, and His glory above the
            heavens. Who is like the Lord our God, who dwells on high, who
            humbles Himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the
            earth!"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What is all the pride, and pomp, and pageantry of earth! All nations
          and all nations' greatness is a mere bauble when placed beside Him.
          What property is there which is not the gift of His sovereign hand?
          Behold His throne. It is high in the heaven of heavens. From it He
          looks down in condescension on angels and on men. The more we wonder
          that He thus should stoop, the more we should exalt Him with extolling
          lips.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-9.
          <i
            >"He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of
            the ash-heap; that He may set him with princes, even with the
            princes of his people. He makes the barren woman to keep house, and
            to be a joyful mother of children. Praise the Lord."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God's gracious eye regards even the lowliest of men with providential
          care. Joseph rises from the dungeon to sit beside the King. David is
          exalted from the sheepfold to the throne of Israel. Sarah rejoices as
          the mother of him in whom the promised seed should come. Rachel and
          Hannah are filled with maternal joy. There is nothing too hard for our
          Lord to do. No gift is too good for His bounty to impart. "Praise the
          Lord" was the first note. "Praise the Lord" is now the last. "Praise
          the Lord" should be our utterance first, midst, and last in time and
          throughout eternity.
