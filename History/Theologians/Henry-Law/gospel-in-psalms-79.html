          The ruins of the Temple and the cruelties of the insulting foe impel
          to the mercy-seat. Promises of praise are uttered. In the depths of
          distress may we thus seek and vow!

        <p align="justify">
          With tearful eye the pious Israelite beholds the desolation of his
          hallowed places. He would move mournfully amid the ruins of his
          beloved city. Can it be that the Temple has thus fallen! Can it be
          that the protecting walls are thus laid low! Have the heathen thus
          triumphed! Is the chosen city thus deserted! Such thoughts of anguish
          naturally arise amid the desolate scene.

            fowls of the heaven, the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the

            and there was no one to bury them."</i

          Cruel carnage marked the invader's course. The slaughtered were
          exposed to vilest indignities. Devouring birds mangled the neglected
          corpses; ravenous beasts rioted in the abundance of their prey. Blood
          flowed in copious streams, and no survivors could bury the dead.

          The neighboring nations, who once viewed Jerusalem as the perfection
          of strength and beauty, and feared her as the mistress of the earth,
          now sneered at her fallen state. No tender pity softened their hearts.
          Derision sat upon their lips.

          The period of calamity seemed endless. It is traced to its real cause.
          God's displeasure has poured down these miseries. The cry goes up to
          Him for intermission. It cries, Let not Your anger be thus prolonged;
          let it not burn like an unextinguishable flame. It is our wisdom when
          lying in the depths of sorrow thus to plead.

          Prayer beseeches God to mark that the triumphant nations were also
          enemies to Him. They did not know His majesty and glory. They had
          never acknowledged Him as their God. It is the province of faith to
          appeal to God that we are truly His, and that those who hate us honor
          not His glorious name.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8-9.

            mercies speedily meet us; for we have been brought very low. Help
            us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; and deliver
            us, and purge away our sins, for Your name's sake."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The remembrance of former iniquities should ever be before our eyes.
          Our cry should be that mercy would heal these wounds. Our only plea
          should be that God would thus glorify His great name, and make us
          monuments of His redeeming powers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10-12.
          <i

            among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of Your
            servants which is shed. Let the sighing of the prisoner come before
            You; according to the greatness of Your power preserve those who are
            appointed to die; and render to our neighbors seven-fold into their
            bosom their reproach, with which they have reproached You, O
            Lord."</i

          Let not the sneer prevail that God has cast off His own. Rather let
          His glory be conspicuous in the ruin of the blood-stained foes. Let
          the plaintive wails of the captives prevail, and let the death-doomed
          find deliverance.

          The happy result shall be constant flow of grateful praises from
          generation to generation. A ransomed flock shall magnify the Lord.
