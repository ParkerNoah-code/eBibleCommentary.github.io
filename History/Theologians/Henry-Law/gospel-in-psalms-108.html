        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist professes immovable resolve to make praise his incessant
          joy. He prays for support against all opponents, and avows his
          confidence in full reply.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with
            my glory. Awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By nature the heart is fickle, roving, inconstant. What it seeks
          today, it shuns tomorrow. But grace brings a blessed change. All the
          affections are then firmly fixed on God. We love Him because He has
          first loved us. Love in the heart cannot but be praise on the lips.
          The tongue, which is man's glory, as his distinction from the brute
          creation, will be consecrated to Him. It is our glory when it gives
          glory to the Lord. Not the tongue only, but all means within our reach
          will be pressed into this service. From the earliest dawn praise will
          be heard. Returning consciousness shall resume the work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-4.
          <i
            >"I will praise You, O Lord, among the people and I will sing
            praises to You among the nations. For Your mercy is great above the
            heavens, and Your truth reaches to the clouds."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Praise will not be limited to the retirement of the closet. It will
          sound aloud when pious congregations meet. From the lips of
          missionaries it will traverse distant lands. The theme is ever grand.
          Never can it weary. It tells of mercy which is higher than the heights
          above, and of truth which is as unassailable as the pinnacles of
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-6.
          <i
            >"Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Your glory above all the
            earth; that Your beloved may be delivered; save with Your right
            hand, and answer me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No efforts can sufficiently exalt our God. When we have striven to our
          utmost power we have scarcely reached the borders of our theme. Let
          prayer, also, be intermingled. We should supplicate deliverance from
          every foe, and answers to our every cry.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-10.
          <i
            >"God has spoken in His holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
            Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. Gilead is mine;
            Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is
            my lawgiver; Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe;
            over Philistia will I triumph. Who will bring me into the strong
            city? who will lead me into Edom?"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith remembers that a holy God has dealt out holy promises. These
          give abundance of unwavering assurance. The Psalmist looks around and
          sees what conquests he has obtained over surrounding cities and
          peoples. Thus he fears not though strong cities may yet remain in open
          defiance. He will reign in triumph over mightiest potentates.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11-13.
          <i
            >"Will not You, O God, who have cast us off? and will not You, O
            God, go forth with our hosts? Give us help from trouble; for vain is
            the help of man. Through God we shall do valiantly; for He it is
            that shall tread down our enemies."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No fears should weaken. Faith is assured that God, who has given help,
          will help to the end. For a little time the enemy may seem to succeed.
          Brief is the appearance. Final victory is sure. But let there be no
          trust in an arm of flesh. Human policy and resolves are slender props.
          Man in his best estate is the shadow of a shade. But if God upholds,
          strong and valiant will be the arm, and triumphs will be near. Shall
          we not praise, and pray, and trust, knowing that the Lord of hosts is
          with us, and that omnipotence is our sword? Let faith go forth and
          behold the servants of the Lord doing valiant exploits in the
          Christian warfare, and marching over the necks of their enemies to the
          triumphant throne of glory.
