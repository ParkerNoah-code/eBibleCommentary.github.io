        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Marvelous deliverance follows continued patience. Others are thereby
          quickened to act faith. God's goodness is unspeakable. Christ is the
          end of the law. Earnest supplication is awakened by a sense of
          surrounding evil. Strong desire follows that confusion may overwhelm
          the cruel mockers, while gladness and praise cheer the godly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2, 3.
          <i
            >"I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined to me, and heard
            my cry. He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry
            clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. And He
            has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God; many shall
            see it and fear, and shall trust in the Lord."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Patience is a precious grace. O Lord, increase it in us. Like love, it
          suffers long, and suffers not in vain. The tree shaken by winds, the
          vine well-pruned, becomes abundant in rich fruits. The Lord arises at
          the earnest cry, and brings a rescue. Tribulation is as a horrible
          pit, beset with terribleness, and presenting no escape. It is as the
          miry clay in which the shackled feet move heavily. How sweet the
          change when the Lord's rescuing hand brings help! Then a firm pavement
          courts advance, and forbids all halting and backsliding. Unencumbered
          climbers nimbly tread the upward path. The path, also, resounds with
          joy. The song of praise which had been silent again breaks forth; and
          the Lord's name is duly magnified. The happy result is not confined to
          the emancipated pilgrim. Many observe not only the believer's fall,
          but also the evidences of God's goodness towards him. They see that
          God's blessing truly rests upon His people—awe fills their minds, and
          they are led to make the Lord their trust.

          The observers see where true blessedness resides. It is discovered to
          be far from the haughty, whose confidence is in self, and whose
          devious wanderings are amid falsehoods and deceits.

            and Your thoughts which are toward us; they cannot be reckoned up in
            order to You; if I would declare and speak of them, they are more
            than can be numbered."</i

          An obvious reflection cannot be restrained. God's mercies in
          providence and grace exceed all powers to number, all eloquence to
          unfold. His thoughts are ever devising wondrous works in our behalf.
          His mighty hand is ever outstretched to accomplish His gracious plans.
          Where is a God like our God? Our praises cannot reach His goodness.
          Let us love and adore Him more and more.

          <i
            >"Sacrifice and offering You did not desire; my ears You have
            opened; burnt-offering and sin-offering You have not required. Then
            I said, lo, I come; in the volume of the book it is written of Me. I
            delight to do Your will, O my God; yes, Your law is within my
            heart."</i

          As illustration that God's gracious thoughts exceed all limits, the
          work of redeeming love, the everlasting covenant decreed in the
          councils of heaven, the coming of the Son in the likeness of sinful
          flesh, His abrogation of all typical shadows, are particularized.
          Christ, by His Holy Spirit speaks; no doubt obscures this truth. The
          Apostle to the Hebrews declares it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the sacrifices of the Jewish Church there was no finality. They
          pointed to the Gospel-fulfillment. Every dying victim bleeding on
          every altar pointed to Jesus hanging on the accursed tree. The blood
          streaming from each sacrifice foreshadowed the all-cleansing blood of
          Calvary. But in the shadow there was no genuine atonement. By Christ
          alone is full atonement made, and everlasting expiation rendered. To
          accomplish this redeeming work, the Savior must assume our nature. A
          body must be prepared for Him. As in the law, the willing servant
          testified by boring of the ear his devotedness to his master's
          service; so in the volume of eternal decrees, and in the pages of
          Scripture, Christ's willing work is testified. Redemption was the
          Father's will. To do this will was Christ's intense delight. Father,
          we bless You for Your love, the cause of all salvation. Precious
          Jesus, we bless You for Your love which undertook and finished the
          glorious work!

          9, 10.
          <i
            >"I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; lo, I
            have not refrained my lips, O Lord, You know. I have not hidden Your
            righteousness within my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and
            Your salvation; I have not concealed Your loving-kindness and Your
            truth from the great congregation."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As Jesus fulfilled the <i>priestly</i> office by the sacrifice of
          Himself, so He fulfills His work as <i>prophet</i>. By His lips, by
          the announcement of His servants, taught and aided by His Spirit, the
          righteousness of God is proclaimed from age to age. No veil conceals
          the glorious mysteries of salvation. The whole scheme is traced to its
          grand source. The lovingkindness and truth of God is duly set forth.
          Happy are those who are privileged to hear from faithful lips the
          words of life! Happy those who gladly embrace them, and
          <i
            >ascribe salvation to the sovereign will and gracious purpose of the
            divine Jehovah!

          There is no sweeter encouragement in prayer than the knowledge that
          the whole work of redemption has been fully accomplished by our
          mystical Head; and that all the mercies of the covenant of grace are a
          purchased possession. The believer may draw near with boldness and
          claim the guardian care, not only of lovingkindness but also of truth.
          Believers are in peril at every moment; but at every moment the
          mercies for which Christ has paid the price of His most precious death
          are near; and lovingkindness and truth are continually ready to
          uphold.

          <i
            >"For innumerable evils have surrounded me; my iniquities have taken
            hold of me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the
            hairs of my head; therefore my heart fails me."</i

          To the eye of faith the blessed Jesus here conspicuously appears. "All
          we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own
          way, but the Lord has laid on Him the iniquities of us all." "He was
          made sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the
          righteousness of God in Him." Thus He stands before God,
          <i>by imputation</i> as the greatest sinner ever seen on earth. He
          denies not His sin-laden position. He accepts all the iniquities of
          all His people, as truly His own. He acknowledges their grievous
          weight. They so depress Him that He cannot raise His eyes. In numbers
          they exceed all power to count. In devout consciousness of the
          immensity of relief, with what fervor will the believer bless His
          burden-bearer—His sin sustainer—the Lamb of God, who takes away his
          sin!

          Emboldened by the plea that all guilt is transferred to Christ, the
          believer urgently implores deliverance, and craves immediate aid from
          his God. May the Lord increase our faith, that we may wrestle in full
          assurance that all the provisions of the covenant of grace are truly
          ours!

            to destroy it; let them be driven backward, and put to shame, who
            wish me evil. Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame who
            say to me, Aha, aha!"

          This petition is prophetic. It foresees the final overthrow of
          Antichrist, and all the opposing hosts of darkness. The seed of the
          woman shall surely bruise the serpent's head. The Gospel has gone
          forth conquering and to conquer. Voices in heaven shall assuredly
          proclaim, "The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our
          Lord, and of His Christ; and He shall reign forever and ever."<i>
            His enemies shall lick the dust. </i
          >The dreadful cry will be heard, "Hide us from the face of Him who
          sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb." Blessed are those
          who have fled for refuge to the wounded side of Jesus! They are
          delivered from the wrath to come. When weeping, and wailing, and
          gnashing of teeth, are the one sound of woe, they will commence the
          everlasting hymn of praise!

          The character of the rejoicing company is distinctly drawn. They seek
          the Lord; they love His salvation. It is their grand desire to know
          more of Christ; they forsake all to follow Him; they strive to grow in
          grace, and in His knowledge; and their whole hearts delight in the
          salvation which He so dearly purchased, and so freely gives. Their joy
          is to exalt the Lord, and lift high His praise.

          Deep consciousness of poverty continually abides. In us, that is in
          our flesh, there dwells no good thing. Yet we are rich and have all
          things in the gracious care of our God. His thoughts of love are ever
          on His people. He is their help and their deliverer, and their cry
          gives Him no rest, "Make no tarrying, O my God."
