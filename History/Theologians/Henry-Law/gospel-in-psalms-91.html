        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Internal textual evidence establishes that the apprehension of near
          sickness and the approach of pestilence awakened this Psalm. Firm
          confidence is expressed in God's protecting power. May we find Him a
          very present help in all our troubles!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide
            under the shadow of the Almighty."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The Ark behind the veil was regarded as the symbol of God's presence.
          Common gaze penetrates not the secret place. In general men do not
          strive for acquaintance with God. They do not seek Him in Christ. But
          those who thus find Him will ever cling to Him with strengthening
          grasp. They will rest in Him as in a calm and cool abode. His shadow
          will ward off the fiery darts of Satan, and avert the hot persecution
          of the ungodly.

        <p align="justify">
          Faith makes bold profession. It casts off fear, and avows that in God
          it finds a safe retreat—a sure protection—an almighty friend. This
          confidence will never be disappointed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-6.
          <i
            >"Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from
            the harmful pestilence. He shall cover you with His feathers, and
            under His wings shall you trust; His truth shall be your shield and
            rampart. You shall not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for
            the arrow that flies by day; nor for the pestilence that walks in
            darkness; nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Troubles are enumerated such as are common to this mortal lot. But
          trust in God exalts above their fatal reach. The fowler may lay hidden
          snares, but they shall not entrap. The noxious pestilence shall
          inflict no deathful wound. The Almighty shall extend His covering
          wing. His faithful promises shall uphold the combatant in the hour of
          battle. By night, by day, the dwelling shall be impervious to plague.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There may be a literal reference to the deliverance of Israel's sons,
          and their exemption from all contact with harm when plagues laid low
          the Egyptian hosts. There may be spiritual reference to the
          deliverance of God's children from the destroying attacks of Satan.
          But one truth is undeniable. The real happiness and safety of true
          believers is emphatically assured, and we are exhorted to pray for
          sustaining faith, and in all perils to trust without one fear.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-10.
          <i
            >"A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right
            hand; but it shall not come near you. Only with your eyes shall you
            behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because you have made the
            Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, your habitation; there
            no evil shall befall you, neither shall any plague come near your
            dwelling."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Other terms are added to strengthen assurance. Those who by faith
          repose on God shall surely be upheld. Though troubles be multiplied,
          they shall never be cast off. In much apparent peril they shall be
          really safe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11-12.
          <i
            >"For He shall give His angels charge over You, to keep You in all
            Your ways. They shall bear You up in their hands, lest You dash Your
            foot against a stone."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This promise is distinctly addressed to Jesus. As such the devil
          quoted it, and Jesus heard without rejection. If we are one with
          Jesus, the promises which were poured upon His head will flow down to
          us, and will invest us in security.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13-16.
          <i
            >"You shall tread upon the lion and adder; the young lion and the
            dragon shall you trample under feet. Because He has set His love
            upon Me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high,
            because he has known My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will
            answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and
            honor him. With long life will I satisfy him, and show him My
            salvation."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The same encouraging strain still sounds. All who have set their love
          on God, and all who know His name, may claim fulfillment. They shall
          have deliverance in every day of trouble. God will honor them in time,
          and honor them with a long life, even forever and ever. Happy indeed
          are the people who thus dwell in the secret place of the Most High.
