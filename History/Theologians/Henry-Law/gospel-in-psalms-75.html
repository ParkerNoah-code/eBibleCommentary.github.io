          Notes of thanksgiving introduce this hymn. Resolution is professed to
          minister right government. Promises of renewed praise are added.

          It is a joyful exercise to render thanks unto the Lord. Why is not
          this our main employ? We rob our souls of much delight when lips are
          silent and not indulging in this happy work. What cause have we for
          never-ceasing adoration? God's wondrous works in providence and grace
          are always loudly speaking. Every moment brings new tokens of His
          loving-kindnessâ€”they tell us that He is always near in manifestation
          of His name, which is the united display of His wisdom, power, and
          love. Let us draw near to Him in praise. He will draw near to us and
          cause His presence to be felt.

          These words can leave no doubt that they proceed from one invested
          with supreme authority. A throne was his seat, a scepter was in his
          hands. David is thus before us, rescued from his many perils, and
          raised to be the King of Israel. No exaltation is evinced. His one
          desire is to execute the rule of righteousness. We see, also, our
          Jesus. The scepter of His kingdom is a right scepter. Righteousness is
          His rule, both in and for His people.

            >"The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved; I bear up
            the pillars of it. I said to the fools, Do not deal foolishly; and
            to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn. Do not lift up your horn on
            high; speak not with a stiff neck. For promotion comes neither from
            the east, nor from the west, nor from the south."</i

          David had seen the kingdom in weakness and confusion, without
          stability and strength, under the evil sway of Saul. That which should
          have a sure foundation was shifting and unstable as the sand. He
          profited by this sad misrule, and he resolved to regulate the empire,
          so as to sustain it in righteous ways. When will men learn that
          <i>all wickedness is folly! </i>None are truly wise, but those who
          seek wisdom in the Word of God, and strive to embody its holy precepts
          in their daily walk. David exhorted his subjects to depart from evil's
          ways, and thus to become truly wise. He saw, also, that
          <i
            >pride was at the root of all their wrong judgments and wrong
            conduct. </i
          >He called on them to walk humbly with their God, and to see clearly
          that all true honor comes from Him. Let us receive and treasure the
          sure word, "Those who honor Me I will honor."

          <i
            >"But God is the judge; He puts down one, and sets up another. For
            in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is
            full of mixture; and He pours out of the same; but the dregs thereof
            all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink
            them."</i

        <p align="justify">
          God's mode of dealing is often wrapped in mystery. We fail to
          understand why one is elevated to the highest rank, while others seem
          to waste their days in poverty, obscurity, and low estate. But no
          misgivings should arise. It should be firmly fixed in our persuasions
          that in all these matters God's hand prevails. Thus, also,
          afflictions, sorrows, trials are all appointed by the same unerring
          wisdom. His hand holds a cup which is mixed in accordance with His
          righteous will. According to His good pleasure He causes the sons of
          men to drink from it. But what will be the portion of the wicked? Let
          them tremble. They are forewarned that they must wring out the dregs
          indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish forever.

            Jacob. All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the
            horns of the righteous shall be exalted."</i

          In conclusion, we have the bright resolve of faith to uplift the voice
          of praise, to discountenance all evil, to proclaim the misery of God's
          adversaries, and the blessedness of His people. May this be our
          resolve, this our holy employ, until faith shall end in sight and hope
          in full reality! Grant it, O our God, for the sake of our beloved
          Savior, Jesus Christ!
