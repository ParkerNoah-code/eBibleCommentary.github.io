        <p align="justify">
          Two witnesses proclaim God's glory. His <b>Works</b> and

          <b>Word</b> harmoniously respond. May the joint testimony teach us!

          <i
            >"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His
            handiwork. Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night shows
            knowledge."</i

          Debased and senseless is the mind which creation's wonders fail to
          touch. Survey the canopy above our heads. It is magnificent in all
          which constitutes beauty and splendor in perfection. From morn to
          night light strides along its azure path, illumining the world. When
          evening's shades prevail, the stars hang out their countless lamps,
          and stud with spangles the brilliant skies. We marvel; we admire. We
          trace the great Creator's skill and reverently adore. It must be a
          mighty mind who planned this exquisite machinery. It must be mighty
          power which framed these glowing orbs, and gave them their appointed
          courses. They could not will their own formation. They could not array
          themselves with brightness. It must, also, be gracious benevolence
          which arranged such lovely helps and solace for us. On all the heavens
          God's glory is inscribed. The skies in all their parts show what His
          hands have wrought. The record never ceases. Day follows day,
          repeating the instruction. Night succeeds to night, telling the great
          Creator's praise.

        <p align="justify">
          3, 4, 5, 6.
          <i
            >"They speak without a sound or a word; their voice is silent in the
            skies; yet their message has gone out to all the earth, and their
            words to all the world. The sun lives in the heavens where God
            placed it. It bursts forth like a radiant bridegroom after his
            wedding. It rejoices like a great athlete eager to run the race. The
            sun rises at one end of the heavens and follows its course to the
            other end. Nothing can hide from its heat."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The lessons of the skies are universal. Wherever man breathes, in
          torrid or in frigid zones, the canopy of day and night speaks the same
          voice. Throughout earth's length and breadth the heavens teach plainly
          the invisible things of God, even His eternal power and Godhead. Let
          the sun's voice especially be heard. The heavens are His splendid
          tent. In the dawn he breaks forth arrayed in gladness, as a joyous
          bridegroom. He strides along stately in giant-strength. He girds all
          heaven in his path, and with his all-penetrating rays searches earth
          in all its parts. In all his course, in all his might, one is his
          witness. God is my Maker. Worship Him. So then they are without excuse
          who do not read God in creation's volume. The Spirit by the mouth of
          Paul declares their guilt, and passes just sentence, and seals their
          reprobation. The Spirit, also, adopts these terms to show the Gospel's
          progress through all lands. Let this inspirit missionary zeal!

          7 - 11.
          <i
            >"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The decrees
            of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple. The
            commandments of the Lord are right, bringing joy to the heart. The
            commands of the Lord are clear, giving insight to life. Reverence
            for the Lord is pure, lasting forever. The laws of the Lord are
            true; each one is fair. They are more desirable than gold, even the
            finest gold. They are sweeter than honey, even honey dripping from
            the comb. They are a warning to those who hear them; there is great
            reward for those who obey them."</i

          From the witness of God's WORKS there is an easy transit to the
          witness of His <b>WORD</b>. Both spring from the same source; both
          spread abroad the same truthâ€”God's glory. Six distinct titles here
          designate the Word. Each bears a separate character, and each
          describes a separate effect. How worthy is this glorious Word of
          constant study! Let it be read on bended knee until all its efficacy
          molds our hearts. None are so wise and happy as the Bible-taught. This
          study is the richest feast. It regales the soul far more than sweetest
          dainties can please the palate. It gives wise warning for our every
          hour. Obedience is wise blessedness.

          12, 13.
          <i
            >"Who can understand his errors? cleanse me from secret faults. Keep
            back Your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have
            dominion over me; then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent
            from great transgression."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Every step which strays from the strict path of perfect love is error.
          Who can count up these countless deviations! They far exceed the
          ocean's sands. They may be hidden from man's eye, but all are patent
          to omniscient scrutiny. Let the thought drive us to the all-atoning
          blood, and prompt the earnest prayer, Cleanse me, O Jesus, cleanse.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Especially let us seek grace to keep us from bold sins of mad
          presumption against God's rule. Indulged, they soon establish habits
          which rule with tyrant's force; and may lead to sin against the
          Spirit, for which no pardon can be found.

          Precious, indeed, will be this psalm if it thus leads to wrestling
          hold of Christ, who is all strength and all redemption to us.
