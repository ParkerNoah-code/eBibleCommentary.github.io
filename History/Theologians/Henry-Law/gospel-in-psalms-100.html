        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This hymn has been, and still is, the delight of Christian hearts. Its
          pervading note is a call to adoring praise. Praise is due to our God,
          because of His sovereignty, and His tender care. May praise ever fill
          our hearts and dwell on our lips!
        </p>

          1-2.
          <i
            >"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all you lands. Serve the Lord
            with gladness; come before His presence with singing."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Throughout the length and breadth of the earth the praises of God
          should be the joyful sound. The feeling should be mighty in our
          hearts, and should swell in no feeble strain. It should be our chief
          joy to render service to the Lord. His people are called to dwell in
          realms of happiness. Their whole existence should give a good report
          of His gracious dealings. His worship should be their constant
          pleasure-ground; it should resound with notes of melody and
          thanksgiving. Eternity will be too short fully to recount His praise.
          Let us not shorten our joy by neglecting to begin on earth.

          It is good to call others to the knowledge of the Lord. This is a
          wondrous theme, and well demands our utmost powers. In the first place
          we should commend His glorious supremacy. But who can tell His essence
          as God! His name is opened out to us in His blessed attributes. Each
          calls us to proclaim Him in varied terms. We live on earth; wondrous
          is the thought! Where did we acquire our being? His will called us
          from nothingness to be living souls. The breath of life is entirely
          His gift. Let us never forget that we are His by creative power. But
          we are His forever by His covenant-engagements. He has chosen us to be
          His favored flock. He has selected us to be the sheep of His pasture.
          It is through His distinguishing grace that we are brought to revel in
          the rich pastures of Gospel-truth, and to draw water with joy out of
          the wells of salvation.

          <i
            >"Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with
            praise; be thankful to Him, and bless His name. For the Lord is
            good; His mercy is everlasting; and His truth endures to all
            generations."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Shall we not then throng His courts with praise, and cause His
          sanctuary to resound with adorations! Again and again topics of praise
          abound around us. With joyful lips let us speak of all His goodness.
          It is <i>unsearchable, unmerited, infinite, everlasting. </i>Let us
          here begin the testimony which can never end. From age to age His
          truth shall live; from age to age let joyful lips proclaim it! Amen.
