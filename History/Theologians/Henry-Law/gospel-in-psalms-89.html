        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This Psalm is bright in praises for the countless mercies of our God,
          especially for faithfulness to His covenants. Prayer is added. May we
          with joyful hearts adopt this tone!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever; with my mouth will
            I make known Your faithfulness to all generations. For I have said,
            Mercy shall be built up forever; You shall establish Your
            faithfulness in the very heavens."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Mercy is a theme for everlasting praise. Faithfulness cannot be
          adequately commended. Mercy and truth go hand in hand to consummate
          salvation. Mercy and truth shall ever be the song of the redeemed. May
          they be our song now!
        </p>

            servant. Your seed will I establish forever, and build up your
            throne to all generations."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have here the glad announcement that a covenant is established by
          God with Jesus, the Son of David. This covenant secures the perpetuity
          of the chosen seed. It stands forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-6.<i>
            "And the heavens shall praise Your wonders, O Lord; Your
            faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. For who in the
            heaven can be compared to the Lord? who among the sons of the mighty
            can be likened unto the Lord?"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Due praise awaits the Lord for these His wonders. It shall commence on
          earth. It shall be lengthened throughout the days of heaven. These
          wonders are great beyond all thought. They spring from the unchanging
          heart of Him, who is the great I AM.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-10.
          <i
            >"God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to
            be held in reverence of all those who are about Him. O Lord God of
            hosts, who is a strong Lord like You? or to Your faithfulness round
            about You? You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves arise, You
            still them. You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain;
            You have scattered Your enemies with Your strong arm."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Should not filial fear, and holy reverence encircle the throne of God?
          Mark His might. Is the earth full of commotion? If He speaks,
          stillness reigns. If He displays His power, His enemies vanish, as
          smoke before the wind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11-14.
          <i
            >"The heavens are Yours, the earth, also is Yours; as for the world
            and its fullness, You have founded them. The north and the south You
            have created them; Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Your name. You
            have a mighty arm; strong is Your hand, and high is Your right hand.
            Justice and judgment are the habitation of Your throne; mercy and
            truth shall go before Your face."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Survey the universe. It is the work of His hands. From north to south
          creation recognizes Him as sovereign Lord. Thus great is His power.
          Great, also, are all His attributes. Justice and judgment are His
          abode. Mercy and truth precede His steps.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15-18.
          <i
            >"Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound; they shall walk,
            O Lord, in the light of Your countenance. In Your name shall they
            rejoice all the day and in Your righteousness shall they be exalted.
            For You are the glory of their strength; and in Your favor our horn
            shall be exalted. For the Lord is our defense; and the Holy One of
            Israel is our King."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Blessed indeed are they whose ears receive the gospel's joyful sound.
          Their walk is bright, for God shines on them. In His Name and in His
          righteousness they are exalted. He is the glory of their strength. In
          Him security surrounds them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19-23.
          <i
            >"Then You spoke in vision to your Holy One, and said, I have laid
            help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the
            people. I have found David My servant; with My holy oil have I
            anointed him. With whom My hand shall be established; My arm also
            shall strengthen him. The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the
            son of wickedness afflict him. And I will beat down his foes before
            his face, and plague those who hate him."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here Jesus is most gloriously revealed. He is called of God to be our
          uttermost salvation. He is anointed as our Prophet, Priest, and King.
          No enemy shall prevail against Him. May we receive Him in all His
          offices, and powers, and work, and thus be seated on the pinnacle of
          safety.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          24-29.
          <i
            >"But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him; and in My Name
            shall his horn be exalted. I will set his hand also in the sea, and
            his right hand in the rivers. He shall cry to Me, You are my Father,
            my God, and the Rock of my salvation. Also I will make him my
            firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. My mercy will I keep
            for him forevermore, and My covenant shall stand fast with him. His
            seed also will I make to endure forever, and his throne as the days
            of heaven."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the delight of faith to contemplate Jesus thus exalted by
          Jehovah's power to the throne of salvation. The Father proclaims Him,
          'You are My Son, this day have I begotten You.' His voice responds,
          'You are My Father, My God, and the Rock of My salvation.' The promise
          goes forth, 'I will make His seed to endure forever.' Eternal glory
          shall be the sure property of all who believe in Him. Shall we not
          laud Him with all the faculties that we possess; and trust Him at
          every moment of our time!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          30-37.
          <i
            >"If his children forsake My law, and walk not in My judgments; If
            they break My statutes, and keep not My commandments; Then will I
            visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with
            stripes. Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from
            him, nor permit My faithfulness to fail. My covenant will I not
            break, nor alter the thing that has gone out of My lips. Once have I
            sworn by My holiness, that I will not lie to David. His seed shall
            endure forever, and his throne as the sun before Me. It shall be
            established forever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in
            heaven."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is sadly foreseen, that His children will ofttimes be
          transgressors, and stray from gospel-paths. God will mark their
          iniquities, and due chastisement shall recall them to His ways. But
          still their rejection shall not be final. Lovingkindness will not
          expire. The covenant shall abide secure. Jehovah's oath shall not be
          broken. Not one of Christ's seed shall perish. His throne shall never
          totter. It shall abide, as the moon in the firmament. It shall appear
          as the rainbow, the pledge that no deluge shall return.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          38-45.
          <i
            >"But You have cast off and abhorred, You have been angry with Your
            anointed. You have made void the covenant of Your servant; You have
            profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. You have broken down
            all his hedges; You have brought his strongholds to ruin. All those
            who pass by the way plunder him; he is a reproach to his neighbors.
            You have set up the right hand of his adversaries; You have made all
            his enemies to rejoice. You have also turned the edge of his sword,
            and have not made him to stand in the battle. You have made his
            glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. The days of
            his youth have You shortened; You have covered him with shame."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The scene is here changed. To all appearance David's kingdom is
          brought very low. His enemies are allowed to triumph. His days are
          shortened, and shame covers the land. All things indicate desertion.
          Such is the case in the spiritual kingdom. But though sins may bring
          dark days, the sun still rules in heaven. The covenant may not screen
          from temporal distress, but it secures eternal life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          46-52.
          <i
            >"How long, Lord? will You hide Yourself forever? shall Your wrath
            burn like fire? Remember how short my time is; why have You made all
            men in vain? What man is he who lives, and shall not see death?
            shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Lord, where
            are Your former loving kindnesses, which You swore to David in Your
            truth? Remember, Lord, the reproach of Your servants; how I bear in
            my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people; With which Your
            enemies have reproached, O Lord; with which they have reproached the
            footsteps of Your anointed. Blessed be the Lord forevermore. Amen,
            and Amen."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith has undying root in the believer's heart. Cast down, it is not
          cast off. It can still send forth the voice of prayer. It can still
          call God to look down graciously. It can implore that sufferings may
          be pitied, and cruelty rebuked. Deliverance thus sought will be given.
          The mercies of the covenant stand as a rock, and the rejoicing spirit
          will soon shout, 'Blessed be the Lord forevermore! Amen and Amen.'
