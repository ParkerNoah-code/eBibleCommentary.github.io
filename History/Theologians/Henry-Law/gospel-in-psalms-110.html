        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          A magnificent display of the exaltation and sovereignty of Christ as
          High Priest of the Church is exhibited. It is delightful to study this
          glorious office. The contemplation tends to sanctify. May it mold us
          into heavenly likeness!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make Your
            enemies Your footstool."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us give thanks for every revelation of Christ. We can only see Him
          as the Father by the Spirit shall withdraw the veil. But here we are
          invited to contemplate His glorious session at the right hand of all
          preeminence. There He wields the scepter of universal supremacy. In
          mad rebellion many foes defy; but they must lie prostrate at His feet.
          The word is everlasting truth. Those My enemies that do not want Me to
          reign over them, bring here and slay them before Me. When His
          chariot-wheels of triumph shall crush the enemies, may we shout
          loyally, Lo! this is our God; we have waited for Him; He will save us!
        </p>

          <i
            >"The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion; rule You
            in the midst of Your enemies."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The all-conquering instrument of this triumph is the proclamation of
          His truth from Zion, the type of His Church. This word when applied by
          the Spirit rides gloriously. No sophistry of man can gainsay. The rock
          is softened, and the heart of enmity melts into love. Thus in the
          midst of enemies the omnipotence of His kingdom rules. May this weapon
          beat down every hostile feeling of rebellious nature. Let our constant
          desire be, 'Come in, You to whom we vow allegiance. Take to Yourself
          Your great power, and reign within us as ruler of every thought.
        </p>

            >"Your people shall be willing in the day of Your power, in the
            beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning; You have the dew
            of Your youth."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The Lord well knows His own. "They were Yours, and You gave them to
          Me." When He utters His attractive call they flock to Him on delighted
          wings. They swiftly fly as doves to their windows. Shining in the
          beauties of holiness, He attracts and captivates. His converts are
          innumerable, as the morning dewdrops of the lawn. They shall be
          multiplied as the sparkling gems which descend at dawn from heaven.

            >"The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest forever
            after the order of Melchizedek."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Endless glories adorn our blessed Lord. As He is our King, so, also,
          He is our Priest. The Father's oath invests Him as successor of
          Melchizedek. As our Priest He brings Himself the all-atoning victim to
          the altar of the cross. As our Priest He enters the Holy of Holies,
          and sprinkles the expiating blood. As our Priest He bears our names
          upon His heart. As our Priest He blesses us with all the blessings
          which heaven can bestow. Jesus, we adore You as our High Priest
          forever.

          <i
            >"The Lord at Your right hand shall strike through kings in the day
            of His wrath. He shall judge among the heathen, He shall fill the
            places with the dead bodies; He shall wound the heads over many
            countries. He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall
            He lift up the head."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All the powers of heaven encircle His banner. Throughout the world His
          triumphs shall be known. Those who have raised the rebel-arm shall be
          ground to powder. In His all-glorious work sustaining refreshment
          shall cheer Him. For the joy that was set before Him He endured the
          cross, despising the shame, and has set down at the right hand of the
          throne of God. What brook can more invigorate the thirsty traveler?
          Streams of reviving joy are flowing by our side. The invitation has
          gone forth, Drink, yes drink abundantly, O beloved!
