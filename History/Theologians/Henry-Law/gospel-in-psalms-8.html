        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          God's name is excellent in all His works, but especially in Christ. O
          God! reveal Your name to us. The Spirit, who gave these words, gives
          their interpretation by the lips of Jesus and an Apostle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth! You
            have set Your glory above the heavens."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          How precious is the right of faith to claim an interest in God! It
          would be vain to say that the Lord is Lord unless we could annex, "O
          Lord <b>our</b> Lord." But in His own Son God gives Himself to us.
          Each true believer may exult, "This God is our God forever and ever."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What thought can grasp God's glory! Its dazzling brightness defies the
          sight of mortal eye. Its breadth and length, its depth and height,
          exceed all space. It more than fills the universe and soars above the
          heaven of heavens. None less than God can grasp this knowledge. But
          earth is chosen as the favored spot of wondrous revelation. His name
          is here made manifest in the face of Jesus Christ. Throughout earth's
          wide expanse His name is gloriously sounded. All other knowledge fades
          in comparison. We stand amazed at the surpassing excellence!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"From the lips of children and infants You have ordained praise
            because of Your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          We do not know what circumstance in David's life prompted these words,
          but our minds revert to a most interesting scene. In Jerusalem young
          children throng our blessed Lord. Tender voices raise the shout,
          "Hosanna to the Son of David." Jesus reminds the angry priests that
          the cry was prefigured in their Scriptures. "Have you never read, Out
          of the mouths of babes and nursing infants You have ordained praise?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We see, also, this word inscribed on the Gospel's mighty course. How
          poor, how weak, how feeble in themselves are the messengers of grace!
          They go forth as infants against hosts of giants, as David against
          Goliath. Against them the wit, the learning of the world combine in
          strong array. The Gospel's voice seems tiny to compete, but it
          prevails. The idols of the world succumb. The most clever arguments of
          vain philosophy, the mightiest efforts of conceited reason, the Dagons
          of skill and learning lick the dust. The enemy is stilled. Opposing
          lips are mute. There is a power in God's own truth, proclaimed by
          feeblest lips, before which Satan and his legion and all the
          disputants of earth must ever quail. Let no true minister of Christ
          complain that he is weak. He is strong in speech whom God instructs.
          He will prevail by whose mouth the Spirit deigns to utter truth.

          3, 4.
          <i
            >"When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon
            and the stars, which You have ordained; what is man, that You are
            mindful of him, and the son of man, that You visit him?"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When we uplift our eyes to the sparkling canopy of a clear night, what
          wonders excite admiration! The moon revolves in brilliant majesty.
          Countless orbs, each perhaps the center of its own system, stud the
          expanse with luster.<b> What must their great Creator be! </b>How far
          that power must surpass conception which willed them into being!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But, marvel of marvels! that great power looks with tender care on
          man! Low as he is, and vile and base, and stained with all iniquity,
          yet God loves him, ever tends him with most watchful eye, and visits
          him with all the blessings of salvation!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But Jesus is seen here. He is pre-eminently the Son of man. He is born
          one of our family, bone of our bone, flesh of our flesh. As such, He
          condescends to our low level. He is made in all points like us, sin
          only excepted. As such, He needed heavenly aid. As such, He was upheld
          and supported during His earthly course, and borne victorious through
          all His trials.

        <p align="justify">
          5, 6, 7, 8.
          <i
            >"For You have made him a little lower than the angels, and have
            crowned him with glory and honor. You made him to have dominion over
            the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet; all
            sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field; the fowl of the
            air and the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths
            of the seas."

        <p align="justify">
          The decree names Jesus as the heir of all things. When He arose from
          deepest depths of degradation, He proclaimed, "All power is given to
          Me in heaven and in earth." And in a little while, His glorious
          kingdom will be established here, and earth, with all who breathe
          life's breath, the total universe, with all that it contains, shall
          own His sway. In the name of Jesus every knee shall bow; every tongue
          shall confess that He is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In this our present tabernacle we groan, being burdened, looking for
          the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior. May we by faith
          and prayer and every holy grace hasten His coming! Then will the
          chorus swell with rapturous praise through all the redeemed earthâ€”
