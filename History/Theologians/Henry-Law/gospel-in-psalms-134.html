        <p align="justify">
          The ministers of the sanctuary are exhorted to bless the Lord. In
          response blessings are invoked on the speaker.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

            >"Behold, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, which by
            night stand in the house of the Lord. Lift up your hands in the
            sanctuary, and bless the Lord."</i

          Public worship is a perpetual ordinance. From age to age God's
          faithful servants will frequent His house and join in common prayer
          and praise. It will be their delight meekly to listen to the
          proclamation of His truth. Those who lead in the outward form should
          precede, also, in inward grace. Those who conduct the hymns of praise
          should be foremost in offering heartfelt thanksgivings. In the early
          Church the lighted sanctuary was not a silent place during the hours
          of night. We have a sweet emblem here of the white-robed congregation,
          from whose lips unceasing hallelujahs sound. May we soon join the
          hallowed service!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.<i>
            "The Lord, who made heaven and earth, bless you out of Zion."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The ministers of the sanctuary are supposed to give response. The
          grateful reply is, May He, whom we are thus exhorted to bless, pour
          blessings upon you. How vast must be the blessings which descend from
          Him who is the omnipotent Creator of the universe! Infinity is the
          measure of His goodness. All mercies surely come in accordance with
          His heavenly decree. But it is from Zion that His blessings go forth.
          Zion typifies the Church of which the blessed Jesus is the High
          Priest. In Him God blesses His people with all blessings in heavenly
          places. He who spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us
          all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?
          Heavenly Father, we bless You for Jesus; evermore bless us in Him!
