        <p align="justify">
          Continual is the call to praise our God. May the call never fail to
          warm our hearts!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Praise the Lord. Sing to the Lord a new song, and His praise in
            the congregation of saints."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who can become weary of God's praise would find heaven's work a
          tedious task. Let us praise Him in our closets, in our private hours.
          Let us praise Him, also, when we frequent the congregation of public
          worshipers. Thus, when we leave earth, we shall change our place, but
          not our work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2, 3.
          <i
            >"Let Israel rejoice in Him who made him; let the children of Zion
            be joyful in their King. Let them praise His name in the dance; let
            them sing praises unto Him with the timbrel and harp."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Can we restrain praises to our God when we remember that He gave us
          being, and faculties to conceive His goodness and laud His name? Let
          us remember, also, that as King of kings and Lord of lords He reigns
          for us, and should reign in us. When this joy swells warmly in our
          hearts, it will be manifested by all our powers, and throughout all
          our time.

          4.
          <i
            >"For the Lord takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the
            meek with salvation."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the wonder of wonders that the great and glorious God should
          stoop to regard such creatures as we are. But wonder is immeasurably
          magnified when we are taught that thoughts of us, are pleasure to Him.
          Let gratitude constrain our hearts to praise without measure and
          without end. Not only does He take pleasure in His people, He
          beautifies the meek with salvation! Meekness is their lovely
          characteristic. This grace proves them to be followers of Him who
          avows Himself as meek and lowly in heart. Beautiful robes of salvation
          are prepared for them. These garments are heavenly in structure, fit
          for the Bride, the Lamb's wife, suited to adorn the palace of our God.

          5.
          <i
            >"Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their
            beds."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Abundant cause impels the saints to praise. They have received grace
          as foretaste of glory. Let them realize this, and let them sing aloud
          as if their promised state filled their hearts with foretaste. Let not
          the shades of night entirely suppress this happy exercise. In the
          night season, let not praises be wholly silent. When the earthly
          tabernacle molders in the bed of death, the liberated spirit will sing
          with full intelligence and joy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6-9.
          <i
            >"Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
            sword in their hand; To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and
            punishments upon the people; To bind their kings with chains, and
            their nobles with fetters of iron; To execute upon them the judgment
            written; this honor have all His saints. Praise the Lord."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Great is the power of the Word when uttered by praising lips. It will
          subdue all the enemies of Christ's.
