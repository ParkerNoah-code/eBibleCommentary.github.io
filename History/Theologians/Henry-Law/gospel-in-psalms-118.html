          A song of praise is here added to our stores. Motives to this exercise
          claim attention. In many portions Christ is distinctly seen. May He
          thus become dearer to our hearts!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-4.
          <i
            >"O give thanks to the Lord; for He is good; because His mercy
            endures forever. Let Israel now say, that His mercy endures forever.
            Let the house of Aaron now say, that His mercy endures forever. Let
            those now who fear the Lord say, that His mercy endures forever."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Our sluggish hearts cannot be too thankful for exhortations to sing of
          mercy. All classes, all ranks should be incessantly earnest in this
          duty. Let God's ministering servants lead the hymn. Let all the
          company of believers respond, "His mercy endures forever."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-7.
          <i
            >"I called upon the Lord in distress; the Lord answered me, and set
            me in a large place. The Lord is on my side; I will not fear; what
            can man do to me? The Lord takes my part with those who help me;
            therefore shall I see my desire upon those who hate me."</i

          Faith hears Christ in these professions. He speaks not in His own
          person only, but as representing all His people. Let us, then, cast
          away all fear. God in Him and He in us is triumph over every foe.

            it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.
            All nations compassed me about; but in the name of the Lord will I
            destroy them. They surrounded me; yes, they compassed me about; but
            in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. They compassed me about
            like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns; for in the name
            of the Lord I will destroy them."</i

          To trust in the Lord is help and victory. To trust in man is to walk
          on a quicksand. May the Lord raise us above such folly! Our great Head
          here testifies for Himself and for His followers, that though His
          enemies might be countless in number and terrible in sting, they must
          vanish before the presence of the Lord.

            me. The Lord is my strength and song, and has become my salvation.
            The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the
            righteous; the right hand of the Lord does valiantly. The right hand
            of the Lord is exalted; the right hand of the Lord does
            valiantly."</i

          We should be grateful for these precious assurances. Mighty, indeed,
          is our main adversary, but he is as nothing before the Lord. In our
          God we have all strength and all salvation. His right hand will fight
          mightily and triumphantly in our behalf. Thus the voice of
          thanksgiving shall be heard in our homes.

            Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go into them, and I
            will praise the Lord; this gate of the Lord, into which the
            righteous shall enter. I will praise You; for You have heard me, and

          We are again warned that, though our feet stand on the rock of
          salvation, we are not beyond the reach of trials. But let nothing
          shake our confidence. The praises of the Lord shall yet be our song.

            in it."</i

          Christ is again manifest. He has been, and He still is, the despised
          and rejected of men. But He is the foundation on which His Church
          rests, and the ornament of the beautiful fabric. It was a glorious day
          when, rising from the dead, He was displayed as the Son of God. It is
          indeed to each believer a glorious day when He shines in their hearts
          as all their salvation.

            "Save now, I beseech You, O Lord; O Lord, I beseech You, send now
            prosperity. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; we have
            blessed you out of the house of the Lord. God is the Lord, who has
            shown us light; bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of
            the altar. You are my God, and I will praise You; You are my God, I
            will exalt You. O give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good; for His
            mercy endures forever."</i

          Shall we not bless Him who comes in the name of the Lord? Shall we not
          bring our hearts and souls as a willing sacrifice to Him? While we
          live let us bless and serve Him. This will be our glad occupation
          throughout eternity. Let the song now begin which never can conclude,
          "His mercy endures forever."
