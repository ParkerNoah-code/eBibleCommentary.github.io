        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Exhortation to thanksgiving is the first note of this Psalm. Various
          motives follow. Man is exhibited in diverse straits and difficulties,
          and God appears in the plenitude of His grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"O give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endures
            forever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Calls to thanksgiving cannot be too frequently renewed. Overflowing
          streams of mercy follow the redeemed during all their days. Each
          instance has a voice loudly crying, Give thanks, give praise. Let our
          heartstrings be strained to the utmost to lift up adoration.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2-3.
          <i
            >"Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He has redeemed from the
            hand of the enemy; and gathered them out of the lands, from the
            east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Surely this will be the constant note of all who realize redemption.
          They once were in bondage to the power of darkness, but are rescued by
          the mighty arm of Jesus. The Savior has shattered the scepter of their
          arch-enemy. He has opened their prison-doors, and has translated them
          into the kingdom of their God. Loud should be their present song. Soon
          shall they be gathered safely to their eternal home; and the great
          multitude, which no man can number, of all nations and kindreds, and
          peoples, and tongues shall upraise the universal Hallelujah!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4-9.
          <i
            >"They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no
            city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
            Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them
            out of their distresses. And He led them forth by the right way,
            that they might go to a city of habitation. Oh that men would praise
            the Lord for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the
            children of men! For He satisfies the longing soul, and fills the
            hungry soul with goodness."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is a graphic description of wanderers and exiles. In it we see
          the children of Israel in their tedious journeyings; but it especially
          portrays the outcast condition in which the redeemed often mourn.
          Their souls are tossed on restless billows. They wander and stray.
          They long for repose, but they find it not. They are exposed to every
          peril. They require support, and know not how to obtain it. At last
          they turn to God, and direct their cries to Him. He speedily arises,
          and their difficulties vanish. Oh that the saints would feel that He
          is guiding them aright, and that soon their end will be welcome
          admission to the heaven of heavens! A new chorus follows; Oh that men
          would praise the Lord for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to
          the children of men. All desires are satisfied. Goodness meets all
          cravings. God's wonder-working hand has strewn blessings around.

            "Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, being bound in
            affliction and iron; because they rebelled against the words of God,
            and contemned the counsel of the most High; Therefore He brought
            down their heart with labor; they fell down, and there were none to
            help. Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and He saved
            them out of their distresses. He brought them out of darkness and
            the shadow of death, and broke their bands in sunder. Oh that men
            would praise the Lord for His goodness, and for His wonderful works
            to the children of men! For He has broken the gates of brass, and
            cut the bars of iron in sunder."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Forgetful of all God's goodness, His people are prone to scorn His
          counsels, and to rebel against His gracious authority. The sure
          consequence is due chastisement. The rejection of His easy yoke leads
          to the darkness of the prison-house, and to the shackles of the iron
          chains. But still there is hope. God lives, mighty to deliver; to Him
          they cry, and deliverance comes on speedy wings. Let the chorus sound
          again; Oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness, and for His
          wonderful works to the children of men. His people rejoice in liberty;
          the prison-gates are burst asunder; the bars of iron are shattered.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          17-22.
          <i
            >"Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their
            iniquities, are afflicted; their soul abhors all manner of food; and
            they draw near to the gates of death. Then they cry to the Lord in
            their trouble, and He saves them out of their distresses. He sent
            His word, and healed them, and delivered them from their
            destruction. Oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness, and
            for His wonderful works to the children of men! And let them
            sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works with
            rejoicing."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Senseless men will rush into transgression. Many afflictions follow.
          The wasted body rejects all nourishment. At last prayer revives, and
          prayer is a prevailing power. God's word, which commanded sickness,
          commands the return of health. Again the chorus soundsâ€”again
          thanksgivings multiply; Oh that men would praise the Lord for His
          goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men. And let
          them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works
          with rejoicing. Let His altar be laden with utterances of adoring
          love. Thus let merited misery vanish in incense of pious joy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          23-27.
          <i
            >"Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great
            waters; these see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the
            deep. For He commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts its
            waves. They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the
            depths; their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and
            fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end."</i

        <p align="justify">
          One of nature's most astounding scenes here meets us. The sea is
          lashed into terrific fury. The staggering mariners are bewildered.
          Where did this terror come from? What is the cause of this dismay? The
          Lord sent forth His voice. The obedient billows reflect His will. They
          raise gigantic heads; they threaten to invade the highest heights of
          heaven. Again they descend, as if to search the lowest depths, and to
          penetrate into its deepest caverns. The affrighted mariners no longer
          can retain firm step. They tremble with the trembling ship, and no
          resources give relief.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          28-32.
          <i
            >"Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble, and He brings them out
            of their distresses. He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves
            are still. Then are they glad because they are quiet; so He brings
            them to their desired haven. Oh that men would praise the Lord for
            His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!
            Let them exalt Him also in the congregation of the people, and
            praise Him in the assembly of the elders."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God sits above the tempest's rage. To Him in their terror the shipmen
          cry. He never turns from prayer. He hears, and lulls the storm. Behold
          His mighty power! His will softens the raging lion into the gentle
          lamb. We are reminded of our Jesus in the storm on the Sea of Galilee.
          He rebuked the winds and waves, and perfect calm ensued. The rejoicing
          mariners see God's wondrous hand, and reach in safety the haven which
          they sought. A sea of perils often threatens to engulf believers. But
          let them pray and trust. Their souls need fear no shipwreck. The glad
          chorus again sounds rapturously; Oh that men would praise the Lord for
          His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men! Let
          them exalt Him also in the congregation of the people, and praise Him
          in the assembly of elders. Let them praise Him in the secret of their
          chambers; let them praise Him when His assembled people celebrate holy
          worship.

          <i
            >"He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the water-springs into dry
            ground; a fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of those
            who dwell there. He turns the wilderness into a standing water, and
            dry ground into water-springs. And there He makes the hungry to
            dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; and sow the
            fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. He
            blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly, and does not
            allow their cattle to decrease. Again, they are diminished, and
            brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. He pours
            contempt upon princes, and causes them to wander in the wilderness,
            where there is no way. Yet sets He the poor on high from affliction,
            and makes his families like a flock."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The earth sees vicissitudes of fertility and famine. The waters of the
          rivers cease. The verdant fields become a barren waste. Again the
          wilderness is fertilized by springs. The fields receive the seed. The
          grapes hang in clusters. The mightiest princes are brought low. The
          poor and needy are crowned with plenty. These wonders are wrought by
          God's hand. All things obey His word. They are recorded for our
          admonition.

            stop her mouth. Whoever is wise, and will observe these things, even
            they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord."</i

        <p align="justify">
          God's people ponder these wondrous works. With joy and gladness they
          recognize His hand; while the wicked must hang down their heads in
          silence. Let God's dealings be our constant study. They give marvelous
          instruction. The crowning lesson is, that God is loving, faithful,
          true.
