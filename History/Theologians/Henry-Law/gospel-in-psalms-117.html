        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This Psalm is brief, but who can estimate its unbounded preciousness?
          It was given by inspiration of God. May the Spirit use it to
          invigorate our grace!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"O praise the Lord, all you nations; praise Him, all you
            people."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Warm desire should swell in every heart that due praise to God should
          be as the surrounding atmosphere. Throughout the world no creature
          lives who is not daily laden with blessings from the Creator's hand.
          Sad it is that the blinded eye sees not the gracious Giver, and the
          silent lips give no acknowledgment. This thought should quicken
          missionary zeal. Warm should be our efforts to send the messengers of
          truth throughout the length and breadth of earth. The constant desire
          should be to tell of God's love in Jesus, and to invite to the cross.
          Hearty praise will then sound loudly from ransomed souls.
        </p>

          2.
          <i
            >"For His merciful kindness is great toward us and the truth of the
            Lord endures forever. Praise the Lord."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The merciful kindness of the Lord is a boundless theme. We see it
          inscribed on all the works of creation. We see it shining in the
          glories of redemption. What could have been done more for His people
          that the Lord has not done for us? The great God, even Jesus, is our
          full salvation. There is pardon in His precious blood for every sin.
          There is a covering robe in His righteousness for every transgression.
          There is sanctification and renewal in His Spirit for our cold hearts.
          The cup of grace, of mercy, and of love truly overflows. It could
          scarcely hold another drop. The promises of the covenant are all yes
          and amen in Christ. Could God give more? Let, then, our grateful cry
          ever swell, Praise the Lord.
