        <p align="justify">
          Attention is again called to the greatness and glory of Christ's
          kingdom. Exhortations to worship Him suitably follow. May the Spirit
          write them on our hearts!

          <i
            >"The Lord reigns; let the people tremble; He sits between the
            cherubims; let the earth be moved."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The Gospel-note here sounds again. The Holy Spirit delights to
          proclaim Jesus seated supreme upon His throne. This thought is an
          overflowing cup of joy. It presents strong consolation. Oh! that He
          might reign in us, and make our hearts His chosen home. But with this
          comfort awe should be intermixed. We should tremble lest any rebel
          passion should dispute His rule. This fear should keep us lowly in
          submission. His high seat too is a throne of grace. It is foreshadowed
          by the mercy-seat, over which the cherubim spread their wings. Let us
          adore Him as our King. Let the whole earth be one activity of service.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2-3.
          <i
            >"The Lord is great in Zion; and He is high above all the people.
            Let them praise Your great and awesome name; for it is holy."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The greatness of our King exceeds all thought. His might is truly
          omnipotent. His will is irresistible. Therefore His name is awesome,
          and no foe can stand against Him. If He speaks, opponents crumble into
          very dust. But holiness reigns simultaneously with His greatness. He
          is holy in working salvation for His people. He is holy in executing
          vengeance on His adversaries.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4-5.
          <i
            >"The King's strength also loves judgment; You establish equity, You
            execute judgment and righteousness in Jacob. Exalt the Lord our God
            and worship at His footstool; for He is holy."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our mighty King, the strength of His people, takes especial delight in
          vindicating the cause of the oppressed. In His kingdom righteous
          dealings are the rule. Mighty motives urge us to fall low before Him,
          and to adore Him as the Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Hosts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6-7.
          <i
            >"Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call
            upon His name; they called upon the Lord, and He answered them. He
            spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; they kept His testimonies, and
            the ordinance that He gave them."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          We are encouraged to worship by the example of the holiest saints of
          old. Consider Moses and Aaron. They were servants who ministered to
          Him. Regard Samuel. His life was consecrated to render service. It was
          their delight, also, to pour out their hearts in prayer. Did they pray
          in vain? That could not be. The Lord's ears were ever open to their
          cry, and ready answers flew on the wings of love. He was ever near to
          hold communion with them. Out of the overshadowing cloud His, commands
          were heard, and reverence hastened to obey.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8-9.
          <i
            >"You answered them, O Lord our God; You were a God that forgave
            them, though You took vengeance on their inventions. Exalt the Lord
            our God, and worship at His holy hill; for the Lord our God is
            holy."</i
          >

        <p align="justify">
          But still the favored people were but men. In sin they were conceived.
          Therefore they often started aside as a broken bow. Thus they were
          brought into grievous straits, and God's displeasure could not be
          withheld. But still He was a God ready to pardon. Where sin abounded
          forgiving mercy abounded much more. Can we refrain to adore, to
          worship, and to praise! We rob our souls of their most hallowed joy
          when we are slow to revel in this exercise. It is Godlike
          condescension that His ears are open to our feeble strains of worship.
          Shall He be willing to accept our worthless tribute, and shall we
          reluctantly present it? Forbid it, every feeling of our hearts!
