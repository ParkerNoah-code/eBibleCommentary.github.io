        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Church is commended as beloved of God. Neighboring nations flock
          to it. It is a spring of refreshing joys.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1 . <i>"His foundation is in the holy mountains." </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The eye seems to rest on the Temple, the type of God's Church. It
          stands securely, for it is based on the noble hill of Zion. But what
          is the stability of the material fabric, compared to that of the
          spiritual edifice? Of the former it was said, Not one stone shall be
          left upon another. The latter is built upon the foundation of prophets
          and apostles, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone. The
          gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
            Jacob."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Zion was the spot which the Lord chose and regarded with especial
          favor. So the Lord loves the Church, and every member of it. Happy is
          the man who can realize, 'Jesus loved me and gave Himself for me. He
          has loved me with an everlasting love; therefore with loving kindness
          He has drawn me.' The response follows, 'I love Him because He first
          loved me.' May our souls ever bathe in the ocean of Christ's
          unfathomable love!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. <i>"Glorious things are spoken of You, O city of God."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No eloquence can sufficiently commend the Church. What can be added to
          the assurance that she is recognized as the Bride, the Lamb's Wife?
          She was beloved by the Heavenly Bridegroom before time began, with a
          love which cannot know a change. She is endowed by Him with all He
          has, and with all He is. He has placed all the promises as a treasure
          in her hands. His angels watch around her. His providences guide and
          defend her path. His righteousness is her beauteous robe, rendering
          her fit to shine forever in the palace of the heavenly King. Her seat
          is prepared beside Him on His throne. It would exhaust all time to
          give a brief survey of the glories which adorn her.

          <i
            >I will record Egypt and Babylon among those who know me—also
            Philistia and Tyre, and even distant Ethiopia. They have all become
            citizens of Jerusalem! And it will be said of Jerusalem, "Everyone
            has become a citizen here." And the Most High will personally bless
            this city. When the Lord registers the nations, he will say, "This
            one has become a citizen of Jerusalem."

        <p align="justify">
          The influx of Gentile converts to the Church is here predicted. They
          shall come from countries which had been noted for their hostility.
          The Lord shall send forth His mighty Spirit. He shall soften their
          hearts and open their eyes, and enlighten their understanding, and
          lead them as willing captives to receive the Gospel yoke. They shall
          spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water-courses. One
          shall say, I am the Lord's; another shall call himself by the name of
          Jacob, and shall surname himself by the name of Israel. And when at
          last the Book of Life is opened, it shall be found that multitudes
          from all climates have been gathered into the Church of the living
          God.

          7.
          <i
            >"As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there;
            all my springs are in you."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Joy and gladness shall be in her midst. She shall come to the Lord
          with thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. No element of happiness
          shall be absent. The Lord's presence near—His presence
          forevermore—shall be her inexhaustible ocean of delight. Sweetly it is
          said, 'In His presence is the fullness of joy; at God's right hand
          there are pleasures forevermore.' Let us now respond, 'Rejoice in the
          Lord always; and again I say, Rejoice. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and
          all that is within me bless His holy name.'
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Deep and ever fresh are the springs from which we may here draw
          salvation. Let our tent be always pitched beside this overflowing
          well. Let us bless His holy name that we have been born again and
          adopted into the Church of the firstborn, whose names are written in
          heaven. Happy is the present portion; what will be the endless
          realization!
