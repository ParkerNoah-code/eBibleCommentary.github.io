        <p align="justify">
          The Church is here exhibited as in the depths of grievous trouble. But
          faith reviews the mercies of past days before it bewails present
          sufferings. Confidence in God is then professed, and prayer pleads
          with fervent zeal.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"O God, we have heard it with our own earsâ€”our ancestors have told
            us of all you did in other days, in days long ago: You drove out the
            pagan nations and gave all the land to our ancestors; you crushed
            their enemies, setting our ancestors free. They did not conquer the
            land with their swords; it was not their own strength that gave them
            victory. It was by your mighty power that they succeeded; it was
            because you favored them and smiled on them."</i

          The study of God's dealings with His people sweetly quickens faith.
          What strength is gained by pondering the subjugation of the heathen
          tribes, the victorious march of Israel's hosts, and their grand
          triumphs over all foes! But, did this conquest arise from their own
          might? Their own sword was weak to conquer, their own arm was
          powerless to save. The might of Jehovah was their prowess, the favor
          of the Lord was their prevalence. The Lord fought for them, and they
          were invincible.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Individual believers should constantly review their Ebenezers. A
          marvelous work has been transacted in their souls. Mighty foes have
          fought against them. Weak has been their own strength; yet they have
          prevailed. It is the Lord who has upheld and strengthened them, and
          caused their enemies to flee.

        <p align="justify">
          The believer claims aid as a subject of the Lord of Hosts. You are my
          King; Your scepter is omnipotence. Your word goes forth with absolute
          power. Resistance is vain. Speak, then, one word, and victory ensues.

        <p align="justify">
          Who can resist when God comes forth to help? He is a horn of
          salvation. Creatures thus armed are terrible in fight; so the believer
          advances to sure conquest. Striding onward in the name of the Lord, he
          tramples down opposing enemies. Thus aided he will bruise Satan under
          his feet shortly.

            is you who gives us victory over our enemies; it is you who humbles
            those who hate us. O God, we give glory to you all day long and

          When the Holy Spirit reveals to us our own weakness, and nothingness,
          and sinfulness, all self-confidence is utterly destroyed; our best
          strength is feebleness. To trust in SELF is to lean on a rotten plank.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But still we are invincible, and utter confusion must overwhelm all
          adversaries. Let, then, every moment of each day testify our
          unwavering confidence, and our happy assurance that heavenly
          protection will never fail. Let praise on earth begin, even the praise
          which shall never end.

            our armies. You make us to turn back from the enemy; and those who
            hate us spoil for themselves. You have given us like sheep appointed
            for food; and have scattered us among the heathen. You sell Your
            people for nothing, and do not increase Your wealth by their price.
            You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and a derision to
            those who are round about us. You make us a byword among the
            heathen, a shaking of the head among the people."</i

          In varied and most graphic terms the sufferings of the godly are here
          depicted. Trouble is a needful path. The discipline corrects many
          budding evils, lops off the growths of pride, self-confidence, and
          self-righteousness, leads to the healthy valley of humiliation, and
          fits for the inheritance of the saints in light. Hence we must,
          through much tribulation, enter into the kingdom of heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the furnace of these trials the mourner is prone to write bitter
          things against himself, and to draw fears of God's desertion. But let
          patience have its perfect work; our fathers in the faith have trodden
          this path before us. Observe the great multitude, which no man can
          number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, who
          stand before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes,
          and palms in their hands. These are those who came out of great
          tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the
          blood of the Lamb. Good Lord, purge us, and we shall be clean; wash
          us, and we shall be whiter than snow.

          Enmity is placed between the diverse children of light and darkness.
          The ungodly vent their hate in torrents of reproach. These shafts
          inflict most grievous wounds. The downcast look, the heaving breast,
          bear testimony to the inward pain.

            "All this has happened despite our loyalty to you. We have not
            violated your covenant. Our hearts have not deserted you. We have
            not strayed from your path. Yet you have crushed us in the desert.
            You have covered us with darkness and death."

          Faith may be sorely tried, but still its constancy remains. The tree
          yet lives, though wintry blasts disrobe it. In all distress the mind
          adheres to God. The pledged allegiance is not broken; and the vows of
          love and service are most diligently kept. The heart continues its
          covenanted affections, and the feet turn not from the narrow way of
          life. There is no faltering even in the extremity of misery. The seed
          of the old serpent will not relax in cruelty and venom, and death in
          many shapes may threaten, yet Christian principles will triumph.
          Prison-cells have sounded with the voice of trust, and martyrs at the
          stake have smiled amid their agonies.

          20, 21.
          <i

          The heart is kept steadfast, when persecution is most hot, by the
          reflection that God's eye watches each movement. "How shall I do this
          great wickedness and sin against God?" is a sure check when tempted to
          seek help from other than our God. "You, God, see me" is a thought
          which braces the loins and brings needful strength.

          <i
            >"Yes, for Your sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Persecution and oppression are the heritage of the Lord's followers in
          every age. Those who hate the Lord will not have kindlier feelings
          towards His devoted flock. Since the day when righteous Abel fell by
          his brother's hand, the same persecuting spirit has not ceased its
          cruel work. Alas! what scenes of malignant enmity has this earth
          witnessed; what cries of misery have ascended from the tortured in
          gloomy dungeons and in open martyrdom! If the same opportunities were
          given today, the same cruelties would be re-enacted.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Paul, writing by the Spirit's guidance, warns that the portrait which
          this verse exhibits will represent the persecuted flock until the end
          of time. But encouragement is added. Vain the sword, the stake, the
          prison, and all the train of multitudinous barbarities. "In all these
          things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us." The
          inward joy exceeds all outward pain. While the flesh quivers, the
          spirit sings, None but Jesus." A chariot of agony conveys the happy
          sufferers to fullness of joy and pleasures at God's right hand
          forevermore.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          23, 24, 25, 26.
          <i
            >"Awake, why do You sleep, O Lord? arise, cast us not off forever.
            Why do You hide Your face, and forget our affliction and our
            oppression? For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly
            cleaves to the earth. Arise for our help, and redeem us, for Your
            mercies' sake."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The reality of the misery is not denied. Appearances seem to justify
          the apprehension that God's eye no longer rests on the oppressed. But
          still faith lives, and grows bolder in wrestling importunity. It will
          not let God go. Its cries are redoubled for early support. No merit is
          pleadedâ€”no, all unworthiness is allowed. Deliverance is implored, but
          only on the ground that God is rich in mercy. In the lowest depths
          faith looks up to God, as the Father of all mercies, as delighting in
          mercy, whose mercy endures forever, and the cry ascends, "Send help
          according to the multitude of Your tender mercies." Happy are those
          who boldly urge the prevailing plea, "Redeem us for Your mercies'
          sake."
