          Warm expressions show the intense longing of the soul for God. The joy
          of public ordinances is set forth; confidence is added in the final
          triumph of the righteous, and final ruin of their foes. May we thus
          follow after God!
        </p>

          1, 2.
          <i
            >"O God, You are my God; early will I seek You; my soul thirsts for
            You; my flesh longs for You in a dry and thirsty land, where there
            is no water; to see Your power and Your glory, so as I have seen You
            in the sanctuary."</i

          They are seated on the highest throne of joy, and revel in the
          sweetest sunshine of delight, who know that God is their sure
          possession. They who hold Him as their own by the hand of faith have
          greater riches than earth can give, and surer property than this world
          can amass. And can it be that WE may enjoy this treasure? By the faith
          of Jesus we have this privilege of glorious possession. We may thus
          say with David, "O God, You are my God;" and again, "This God is our
          God forever and ever." We may pour out our hearts in the darkest hours
          of desertion, "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" Those who
          have thus found the pearl of great price will be always intent to
          realize their joy. With morning light they will be eager to rejoice in
          this joy.

          David adds, "Early will I seek You." May He who is the first have our
          first thoughts! David was now an outcast in a dreary wasteland, and
          far from the Temple with its holy rites. The land was barren,
          unrefreshed by fertilizing streams of service. David had worshiped in
          the might of faith, and thus through outward means had drawn near to
          see Him who is invisible. He ardently longed for return of these
          blessings; with all his powers he longed to be in near approach to
          God.

          <i
            >"Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
            praise You. Thus will I bless You while I live; I will lift up my
            hands in Your name."</i

          Life is a wonderful gift. It links us to eternity. But what is life
          without the favor of our God?<i>
            If we receive not grace, we cannot inherit glory. We only tread a
            dreary passage to a world of woe.
          </i>

          God's lovingkindness is the gift of gifts. In thought of this, the
          Psalmist vows that praise should ever be streaming from his lips, and
          that in adoring love he would raise adoring hands.

          5-7.
          <i
            >"My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
            mouth shall praise You with joyful lips, when I remember You upon my
            bed, and meditate on You in the night-watches. Because You have been
            my help, therefore in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice."</i

          Amid external desolations inward joy can be abundant. The wilderness
          and the solitary place shall be glad; the desert shall rejoice and
          blossom as the rose. The Lord will make the wilderness a pool of
          water, and the dry land springs of water. He will plant in the
          wilderness the choicest of the evergreens.

          As the body craves the support of food, so too the soul has craving
          appetites. But they are all satisfied. The manna falls, and gives
          support and strength. The pilgrim sits down beneath the tree of life.
          Its laden branches present refreshing produce. The fruit is sweet to
          the taste. Those who hunger and thirst after God assuredly shall be
          filled. The richest fruit is ever by their side. When evening shadows
          prevail, the inward light does not expire. When the body needs repose,
          the active mind will hold communion with the Lord, and the
          night-watches be calmed with heavenly meditations. Experience recalls
          past help. The soul nestles beneath the shadow of God's wings, and is
          rightly glad.

          8-10.
          <i
            >"My soul follows hard after You; Your right hand upholds me. But
            those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower
            parts of the earth. They shall fall by the sword; they shall be a
            portion for foxes."</i

          Real desolation is distance from God. This anguish the righteous soul
          cannot endure. With every energy, with every power, it presses after
          its beloved object. It seeks uninterrupted fellowship. But, ah! how
          often is it weak to followâ€”how often do the tottering limbs need to be
          upheld! This help is very near. God extends His right hand, and thus
          the fainting one pursues his course. Divine help enables to draw near
          to God, and to reach the presence which is heaven begun. While the
          believer thus strives and prospers, misery overwhelms the enemies who
          seek his life. God needs not instruments of destruction. They shall be
          overwhelmed, and perish as those whose carcasses are the food of
          beasts of prey.

          A glorious prospect ends this hymn. It is unspeakably blessed; it is
          full of glory. May the prospect encourage us to join ourselves to the
          Lord, and to vow vows in His most holy name.
