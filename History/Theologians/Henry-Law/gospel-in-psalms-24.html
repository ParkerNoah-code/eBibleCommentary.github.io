        <p align="justify">
          Jesus ascends in triumph to His throne in heaven. May we in spirit
          ascend there, and with Him continually dwell!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and
            those who dwell there; for He has founded it upon the seas, and

          A noble chorus ushers in this ode of triumph. Loud acclamations tell
          that God is the great Creator, the sovereign owner of the universe.
          Language contains not a grander sentence than the words first seen
          upon the Bible-page, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the
          earth." He commanded the dry land to appear, and to rest on subsiding
          waters as its supporting column. All nations who throng its surface,
          all animal and vegetable life, all its rich treasures, all its lovely
          beauty, receive their being from His word. He spoke and they were
          made. His rightful lordship is indisputable. We are His, and He made
          us. With what lowly reverence should we bow before Him! How meekly
          should we yield to His supremacy! How constant should our efforts be
          to glorify Him with body, soul, and spirit, which are His!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.
          <i
            >"Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in
            His holy place?"</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He who pervades all space, whose center is everywhere and
          circumference nowhere, is represented to our minds as reigning in an
          especial palace. An earthly city was the type of this heavenly abode.
          The hill of Zion which received the Ark was symbol of His presence.
          Therefore the inquiry, Who shall live and reign forever with the Lord?
          is aptly symbolized by asking, Who shall mount the hill of Zion, and
          have firm footing in the holy place? How studiously should we examine
          our claim to such felicity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4, 5, 6.
          <i
            >"He who has clean hands, and a pure heart; who has not lifted up
            his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the
            blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of His
            salvation. This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek
            Your face, O Jacob."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a grand and everlasting truth, "Without holiness no man shall
          see the Lord." His dwelling is essential purity. No speck of sin can
          enter where He dwells. Therefore no one who ever breathed life's
          breath or trod this earth, except Jesus, can enter by His own right
          and in His own name. His hands alone were never stained by sin. His
          heart alone was one home of unsullied purity. No vain things had
          attraction for His mind. No deceit defiled His spirit. He had full
          claims to all the blessings of the New Jerusalem. Justly He receives
          His due.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But this blessedness belongs not only to the Head; His members share
          with Him. All who by faith are one with Him, all who constitute His
          body, are clean, and pure, and righteous, even as He is. His
          all-cleansing blood forever washes out their many sins. His glorious
          righteousness is reckoned as their very own. His indwelling Spirit
          wholly sanctifies their inner man. Therefore through grace they shall
          ascend the holy hill; hence they shall stand within the holy place.
          This is the chosen generation, the royal priesthood, the holy nation,
          the peculiar people. The Spirit helping, they seek the Lord with all
          the heart, even the face of the great God of Jacob.

          <i
            >"Lift up your heads, O you gates; and be lifted up, you everlasting
            doors; and the King of glory shall come in."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Spirit here exhibits a wonderful picture of our Lord's triumphal
          ascent. We are taught to see Him drawing near attended by multitudes
          of the heavenly host. He reaches the gates of the eternal citadel.
          Admittance is demanded; the portals are summoned to fly open. The
          gates so barred against rebellious man are now commanded to lift their
          heads. It is announced that the King of glory stands outside.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8.
          <i
            >"Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord
            mighty in battle."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The guardians of the portals are represented as responding. They must
          be certified of the claim of Him who thus draws near. They ask,
          Proclaim His name, His purpose, and His right. Why is He free to
          enter? A ready answer cries, "The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord
          mighty in battle." Jesus has returned; He went forth strong in the
          might of His omnipotence to do battle against Satan and hell, and
          death and the grave. The fight is fought, the victory is won. All
          enemies are dashed to pieces. He is here, dragging the captives fast
          bound to His victorious wheels; He comes crowned with all conquest.
          Admit Him. The crown is His by right of Satan's empire demolished. The
          exulting challenge is repeated.

          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">The inquiry, the response, are still the same.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          10.
          <i

            glory."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Look, He is enthroned on the right hand of the Majesty on high. May
          our poor hearts lift up their heads! May He there sit and rule, and
          reign forever!
