          It has been objected by some, who dissent from, nay, I may add, by
          others also, who actually are friends to the present ecclesiastical
          establishment, that the ministers of the Church of England preach
          themselves, and not Christ Jesus the Lord; that they entertain their
          people with lectures of mere morality, without declaring to them the
          glad tidings of salvation by Jesus Christ. How well grounded such an
          objection may be, is not my business to inquire: All I shall say at
          present to the point is, that whenever such a grand objection is urged
          against the whole body of the clergy in general, every honest minister
          of Jesus Christ should do his utmost to cut off all manner of
          occasion, from those who desire an occasion to take offense at us;
          that so by hearing us continually sounding forth the word of truth,
          and declaring with all boldness and assurance of faith, "that there is
          no other name given under heaven, whereby they can be saved, but that
          of Jesus Christ," they may be ashamed of this their same confident
          boasting against us.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an eye to this objection, joined with the agreeableness and
          delightfulness of the subject (for who can but delight to talk of that
          which the blessed angels desire to look into?) that induces me to
          discourse a little on that great and fundamental article of our faith;
          namely, our being freely justified by the precious blood of Jesus
          Christ. "But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
          justified, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of
          our God."
        </p>
        <p>
          The words beginning with the particle but, have plainly a reference to
          something before; it may not therefore be improper, before I descend
          to particulars, to consider the words as they stand in relation to the
          context. The apostle, in the verses immediately foregoing, had been
          reckoning up many notorious sins, drunkenness, adultery, fornication,
          and such like, the commission of which, without a true and hearty
          repentance, he tells the Corinthians, would entirely shut them out of
          the kingdom of God. But then, lest they should, on the one hand, grow
          spiritually proud by seeing themselves differ from their unconverted
          brethren, and therefore be tempted to set them at nought, and say with
          the self-conceited hypocrite in the prophet, "Come not nigh me, for I
          am holier than thou;" or, on the other hand, by looking back on the
          multitude of their past offenses, should be apt to think their sins
          were too many and grievous to be forgiven: he first, in order to keep
          them humble, reminds them of their sad state before conversion,
          telling them in plain terms, "such (or as it might be read, these
          things) were some of you;" not only one, but all that sad catalogue of
          vices I have been drawing up, some of you were once guilty of; but
          then, at the same time, to preserve them from despair, behold he
          brings them glad tidings of great joy: "But ye are washed; but ye are
          sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
          and by the Spirit of our God."
        </p>
        <p>
          The former part of this text, our being sanctified, I have in some
          measure treated of already; I would not enlarge on our being freely
          justified by the precious obedience and death of Jesus Christ: "But ye
          are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
        </p>
        <p>From which words I shall consider three things:</p>
        <p>First, What is meant by the word justified.</p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I shall endeavor to prove that all mankind in general, and
          every individual person in particular, stands in need of being
          justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, That there is no possibility of obtaining this justification,
          which we so much want, but by the all-perfect obedience, and precious
          death of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>First, I am to consider what is meant by the word justified.</p>
        <p>
          "But ye are justified," says the apostle; which is, as though he had
          said, you have your sins forgiven, and are looked upon by God as
          though you never had offended him at all: for that is the meaning of
          the word justified, in almost all the passages of holy scripture where
          this word is mentioned. Thus, when this same apostle writes to the
          Romans, he tells them, that "whom God called, those he also
          justified:" And that this word justified, implies a blotting out of
          all our transgressions, is manifest from what follows, "them he also
          glorified," which could not be if a justified person was not looked
          upon by God, as though he never had offended him at all. And again,
          speaking of Abraham's faith, he tells them, that "Abraham believed on
          Him that justifies the ungodly," who acquits and clears the ungodly
          man; for it is a law-term, and alludes to a judge acquitting an
          accused criminal of the thing laid to his charge. Which expression the
          apostle himself explains by a quotation out of the Psalms: "Blessed is
          the man to whom the Lord imputeth no sin." From all which proofs, and
          many others that might be urged, it is evident, that by being
          justified, we are to understand, being so acquitted in the sight of
          God as to be looked upon as though we never had offended him at all.
          And in this sense we are to understand that article, which we profess
          to believe in our creed, when each of us declare in his own person, I
          believe the forgiveness of sins. This leads me to the
        </p>
        <p>
          Second thing proposed, to prove that all mankind in general, and every
          individual person in particular, stands in need of being justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          And indeed the apostle supposes this in the words of the text: "But ye
          are justified," thereby implying that the Corinthians (and
          consequently all mankind, there being no difference, as will be shown
          hereafter) stood in need of being justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          But not to rest in bare suppositions, in my farther enlargement on
          this head, I shall endeavor to prove, that we all stand in need of
          being justified on account of the sin of our natures, and the sin of
          our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, I affirm that we all stand in need of being justified, on
          account of the sin of our natures: for we are all chargeable with
          original sin, or the sin of our first parents. Which, though a
          proposition that may be denied by a self-justifying infidel, who "will
          not come to Christ that he may have life;" yet can never be denied by
          any one who believes that St. Paul's epistles were written by divine
          inspiration; where we are told, that "in Adam all died;" that is,
          Adam's sin was imputed to all; and lest we should forget to make a
          particular application, it is added in another place, "that there is
          none that doeth good (that is, by nature) no, not one: That we are all
          gone out of the way, (of original righteousness) and are by nature the
          children of wrath." And even David, who was a man after God's own
          heart, and, if any one could, might surely plead an exemption from
          this universal corruption, yet he confesses, that "he was shapen in
          iniquity, and that in sin did his mother conceive him." And, to
          mention but one text more, as immediately applicable to the present
          purpose, St. Paul, in his epistle to the Romans, says, that "Death
          came upon all men, for the disobedience of one, namely, of Adam, even
          upon those, (that is, little children) who had not sinned after the
          similitude of Adam's transgression;" who had not been guilty of actual
          sin, and therefore could not be punished with temporal death (which
          came into the world, as this same apostle elsewhere informs us, only
          by sin) had not the disobedience of our first parents been imputed to
          them. So that what has been said in this point seems to be excellently
          summed up in that article of our church, where she declares that
          "Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam, but it is the
          fault and corruption of every man, that naturally is engendered of the
          offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original
          righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the
          flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and the therefore in
          every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and
          damnation."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been more particular in treating of this point, because it is
          the very foundation of the Christian religion: For I am verily
          persuaded, that it is nothing but a want of being well grounded in the
          doctrine of original sin, and of the helpless, nay, I may say,
          damnable condition, each of us comes into the world in, that makes so
          many infidels oppose, and so many who call themselves Christians, so
          very lukewarm in their love and affections to Jesus Christ. It is
          this, and I could almost say, this only, that makes infidelity abound
          among us so much as it does. For, alas! we are mistaken if we imagine
          that men now commence or continue infidels, and set up corrupted
          reason in opposition to divine revelation merely for want of evidence,
          (for I believe it might easily be proved, that a modern unbeliever is
          the most credulous creature living;) no, it is only for want of an
          humble mind, of a sense of their original depravity, and a willingness
          to own themselves so depraved, that makes them so obstinately shut
          their eyes against the light of the glorious gospel of Christ.
          Whereas, on the contrary, were they but once pricked to the heart with
          a due and lively sense of their natural corruption and liableness to
          condemnation, we should have them no more scoffing at divine
          revelation, and looking on it as an idle tale; but they would cry out
          with the trembling jailer, "What shall I do to be saved?" It was an
          error in this fundamental point, that made so many resist the evidence
          the Son of God himself gave of his divine mission, when he tabernacled
          amongst us. Every word he spake, every action he did, every miracle he
          wrought, proved that he came from God. And why then did so many harden
          their hearts, and would not believe his report? Why, he himself
          informs us, "They will not come unto me that they may have life:" They
          will obstinately stand out against those means God had appointed for
          their salvation: And St. Paul tells us, "that if the gospel be hid, it
          is hid to them that are lost; in whom the God of this world hath
          blinded the eyes of them which believe not, lest the light of the
          glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine upon
          them." 2 Cor.4:3-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be asked, how it suits with the divine goodness, to impute the
          guilt of one man's sin, to an innocent posterity? I should think it
          sufficient to make use of the apostle's words: "Nay, but O man, who
          art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him
          that formed it, why hast thou made me thus?" But to come to a more
          direct reply: Persons would do well to consider that in the first
          covenant God made with man, Adam acted as a public person, as the
          common representative of all mankind, and consequently we must stand
          or fall with him. Had he continued in his obedience, and not eaten the
          forbidden fruit, the benefits of that obedience would doubtless have
          been imputed to us: But since he did not persist in it, but broke the
          covenant made with him, and us in him; who dares charge the righteous
          Judge of all the earth with injustice for imputing that to us also? I
          proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, To prove that we stand in need of being justified, on
          account of the sin of our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          That God, as he made man, has a right to demand his obedience, I
          suppose is a truth no one will deny: that he hath also given us both a
          natural and a written law, whereby we are to be judged, cannot be
          questioned by any one who believes St. Paul's epistle to the Romans to
          be of divine authority: For in it we are told of a law written in the
          heart, and a law given by Moses; and that each of us hath broken these
          laws, is too evident from our sad and frequent experience. Accordingly
          the holy scriptures inform us that "there is no man which liveth and
          sinneth not;" that "in many things we offend all;" that "if we say we
          have no sin we deceive ourselves," and such like. And if we are thus
          offenders against God, it follows, that we stand in need of
          forgiveness for thus offending Him; unless we suppose God to enact
          laws, and at the same time not care whether they are obeyed or no;
          which is as absurd as to suppose that a prince should establish laws
          for the proper government of his country, and yet let every violator
          of them come off with impunity. But God has not dealt so foolishly
          with his creatures: no, as he gave us a law, he demands our obedience
          to that law, and has obliged us universally and perseveringly to obey
          it, under no less a penalty than incurring his curse and eternal death
          for every breach of it: For thus speaks the scripture; "Cursed is he
          that continueth not in all things that are written in the law to do
          them;" as the scripture also speaketh in another place, "The soul that
          sinneth, it shall die." Now it has already been proved, that we have
          all of us sinned; and therefore, unless some means can be found to
          satisfy God's justice, we must perish eternally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us then stand a while, and see in what a deplorable condition each
          of us comes into the world, and still continues, till we are
          translated into a state of grace. For surely nothing can well be
          supposed more deplorable, than to be born under the curse of God; to
          be charged with original guilt; and not only so, but to be convicted
          as actual breakers of God's law, the least breach of which justly
          deserves eternal damnation. Surely this can be but a melancholy
          prospect to view ourselves in, and must put us upon contriving some
          means whereby we may satisfy and appease our offended judge. But what
          must those means be? Shall we repent? Alas! there is not one word of
          repentance mentioned in the first covenant: "The day that thou eatest
          thereof, thou shalt surely die." So that, if God be true, unless there
          be some way found out to satisfy divine justice, we must perish; and
          there is no room left for us to expect a change of mind in God, though
          we should seek it with tears. Well then, if repentance will not do,
          shall we plead the law of works? Alas! "By the law shall no man living
          be justified: for by the law comes the knowledge of sin." It is that
          which convicts and condemns, and therefore can by no means justify us;
          and "all our righteousnesses (says the prophet) are but as filthy
          rags." Wherewith then shall we come before the Lord, and bow down
          before the most high God? Shall we come before Him with calves of a
          year old, with thousands of rams, or ten thousands of rivers of oil?
          Alas! God has showed thee, O man, that this will not avail: For he
          hath declared, "I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goat
          out of thy fold: for all the beasts of the forests are mine, and so
          are the cattle upon a thousand hills." Will the Lord then be pleased
          to accept our first-born for our transgression, the fruit of our
          bodies for the sin of our souls? Even this will not purchase our
          pardon: for he hath declared that "the children shall not bear the
          iniquities of their parents." Besides, they are sinners, and
          therefore, being under the same condemnation, equally stand in need of
          forgiveness with ourselves. They are impure, and will the Lord accept
          the blind and lame for sacrifice? Shall some angel then, or archangel,
          undertake to fulfill the covenant which we have broken, and make
          atonement for us? Alas! they are only creatures, though creatures of
          the highest order; and therefore are obliged to obey God as well as
          we; and after they have done all, must say they have done no more than
          what was their duty to do. And supposing it was possible for them to
          die, yet how could the death of a finite creature satisfy an
          infinitely offended justice? O wretched men that we are! Who shall
          deliver us? I thank God, our Lord Jesus Christ. Which naturally leads
          me to the
        </p>
        <p>
          Third thing proposed, which was to endeavor to prove, that there is no
          possibility of obtaining this justification, which we so much want,
          but by the all-perfect obedience and precious death of Jesus Christ,
          "But ye are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          But this having been in some measure proved by what has been said
          under the foregoing head, wherein I have shown that neither our
          repentance, righteousness, nor sacrifice, no not the obedience and
          death of angels, themselves, could possibly procure justification for
          us, nothing remains for me to do under this head, but to show that
          Jesus Christ has procured it for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here I shall still have recourse "to the law and to the
          testimony." For after all the most subtle disputations on either side,
          nothing but the lively oracles of God can give us any satisfaction in
          this momentous point: it being such an inconceivable mystery, that the
          eternal only-begotten Son of God should die for sinful man, that we
          durst not have presumed so much as to have thought of it, had not God
          revealed it in his holy word. It is true, reason may show us the
          wound, but revelation only can lead us to the means of our cure. And
          though the method God has been pleased to take to make us happy, may
          be to the infidel a stumbling-block, and to the wise opiniator and
          disputer of this world, foolishness; yet wisdom, that is, the
          dispensation of our redemption, will be justified, approved of, and
          submitted to, by all her truly wise and holy children, by every
          sincere and upright Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to come more directly to the point before us. Two things, as was
          before observed, we wanted, in order to be at peace with God.
        </p>
        <p>1. To be freed from the guilt of the sin of our nature.</p>
        <p>2. From the sin of our lives.</p>
        <p>
          And both these (thanks be to God for this unspeakable gift) are
          secured to believers by the obedience and death of Jesus Christ. For
          what says the scripture?
        </p>
        <p>
          1. As to the first, it informs us, that "as by the disobedience of one
          man, (or by one transgression, namely, that of Adam) many were made
          sinners; so by the obedience of one, Jesus Christ (therein including
          his passive as well as active obedience) many were made righteous."
          And again, "As by the disobedience of one man, judgment came upon all
          men unto condemnation;" or all men were condemned on having Adam's sin
          imputed to them; "so by the obedience of one, that is, Jesus Christ,
          the free gift of pardon and peace came upon all men, (all sorts of
          men) unto justification of life." I say all sorts of men; for the
          apostle in this chapter is only drawing a parallel between the first
          and second Adam in this respect, that they acted both as
          representatives; and as the posterity of Adam had his sin imputed to
          them, so those for whom Christ died, and whose representative he is,
          shall have his merits imputed to them also. Whoever run the parallel
          farther, in order to prove universal redemption (whatever arguments
          they may draw for the proof of it from other passages of scripture,)
          if they would draw one from this for that purpose, I think they
          stretch their line of interpretation beyond the limits of scripture.

          2. Pardon for the sin of our lives was another thing, which we wanted
          to have secured to us, before we could be at peace with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this the holy scriptures inform us, is abundantly done by the
          death of Jesus Christ. The evangelical prophet foretold that the
          promised Redeemer should be "wounded for our transgressions, and
          bruised for our iniquities; that the chastisement of our peace should
          be upon him; and that by his stripes we should be healed," Isaiah
          53:6. The angels at his birth said, that he should "save his people
          from their sins." And St. Paul declares, that "this is a faithful
          saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the
          world to save sinners." And here in the words of the text, "Such (or,
          as I observed before, these things) were some of you; but ye are
          washed, &amp;c." and again, "Jesus Christ is the end of the law for
          righteousness to every one that believeth." And, to show us that none
          but Jesus Christ can do all this, the apostle St. Peter says, "Neither
          is their salvation in any other; for there is no other name under
          heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved, but the name of
          Jesus Christ.

        <p>
          How God will be pleased to deal with the Gentiles, who yet sit in
          darkness and under the shadow of death, and upon whom the sun of
          righteousness never yet arose, is not for us to inquire. "What have we
          to do to judge those that are without?" To God's mercy let us
          recommend them, and wait for a solution of this and every other
          difficult point, till the great day of accounts, when all God's
          dispensations, both of providence and grace, will be fully cleared up
          by methods to us, as yet unknown, because unrevealed. However, this we
          know, that the judge of all the earth will, most assuredly, do right.
        </p>
        <p>But it is time for me to draw a conclusion.</p>
        <p>
          I have now, brethren, by the blessings of God, discoursed on the words
          of the text in the method I proposed. Many useful inferences might be
          drawn from what has been delivered; but as I have detained you, I
          fear, too long already, permit me only to make a reflection or two on
          what has been said, and I have done.
        </p>
        <p>
          If then we are freely justified by the death and obedience of Jesus
          Christ, let us here pause a while; and as before we have reflected on
          the misery of a fallen, let us now turn aside and see the happiness of
          the believing, soul. But alas! how am I lost to think that God the
          Father, when we were in a state of enmity and rebellion against Him,
          should notwithstanding yearn in his bowels towards us his fallen, his
          apostate creatures: And because nothing but an infinite ransom could
          satisfy an infinitely offended justice, that should send his only and
          dear Son Jesus Christ (who is God, blessed for ever, and who had lain
          in his bosom from all eternity) to fulfill the covenant of works, and
          die a cursed, painful, ignominious death, for us and for our
          salvation! who can avoid crying out, at the consideration of his
          mystery of godliness. "Oh the depth of the riches of God's love" to us
          his wretched, miserable and undone creatures! "How unsearchable is his
          mercy, and his ways past finding out!" Now know we of a truth, O God,
          that thou hast loved us, "since thou hast not with-held thy Son, thine
          only Son Jesus Christ," from thus doing and dying for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as we admire the Father sending, let us likewise humbly and
          thankfully adore the Son coming, when sent to die for man. But O! what
          thoughts can conceive, what words express the infinite greatness of
          that unparalleled love, which engaged the Son of God to come down from
          the mansions of his Father's glory to obey and die for sinful man! The
          Jews, when he only shed a tear at poor Lazarus' funeral, said, "Behold
          how he loved him." How much more justly then may we cry out, Behold
          how he loved us! When he not only fulfilled the whole moral law, but
          did not spare to shed his own most precious blood for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And can any poor truly-convicted sinner, after this, despair of mercy?
          What, can they see their Savior hanging on a tree, with arms stretched
          out ready to embrace them, and yet, on their truly believing on him,
          doubt of finding acceptance with him? No, away with all such
          dishonorable, desponding thoughts. Look on his hands, bored with pins
          of iron; look on his side, pierced with a cruel spear, to let loose
          the sluices of his blood, and open a fountain for sin, and for all
          uncleanness; and then despair of mercy if you can! No, only believe in
          Him, and then, though you have crucified him afresh, yet will he
          abundantly pardon you; "though your sins be as scarlet, yet shall they
          be as wool; though deeper than crimson, yet shall they be whiter than
          snow."
        </p>
        <p>Which God of his infinite mercy grant, &amp;c.<br /></p>
