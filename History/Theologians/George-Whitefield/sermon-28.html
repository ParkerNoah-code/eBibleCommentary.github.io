          Mark 10:52 -- "And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath
          made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed
          Jesus in the way."
        </p>
        <p>
          When the apostle Peter was recommending Jesus of Nazareth, in one of
          his sermons to the Jews, he gave him a short, but withal a glorious
          and exalted character, "That we went about doing good." He went about,
          he sought occasions of doing good; it was his meat and drink to do the
          works of him that sent him, whilst the day of his public
          administration lasted. Justly was he stiled by the prophet, the sun of
          righteousness. For, as the sun in the natural firmament diffuses his
          quickening and reviving beams through the universe, so, wherever this
          sun of righteousness, the blessed Jesus arose, he arose with healing
          under his wings. He was indeed a prophet like unto Moses, and proved
          that he was the Messiah which was to come into the world, by the
          miracles which he wrought; though with this material difference, the
          miracles of Moses, agreeable to the Old Testament dispensation, were
          miracles of judgment; the miracles of Jesus, who came to bear our
          sicknesses and heal our infirmities, were miracles of mercy, and were
          wrought, not only for the cure of people's bodies, but also for the
          conversion of their precious and immortal souls. Sometimes, one and
          the same person was the subject of both these mercies. A glorious
          proof of this, we have in the miraculous cure wrought upon a poor
          blind beggar, named Bartimeus, who is to be the subject of the
          following discourse, and to whom the words of the text refer. "Jesus
          said unto him, Go thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole. And
          immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way."
        </p>
        <p>
          My design is, First, to make some observations on the matter of fact,
          as recorded by the evangelists. And then,
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, To point out the improvement that may be made thereof. May
          Jesus so bless this following discourse, that every spiritually blind
          hearer may receive his sight, and, after the example of Bartimeus,
          "follow Jesus in the way!"
        </p>
        <p>
          If we would take a view of the whole story, we must go back to the
          46th verse of this chapter, "And they (our Lord and his disciples,
          who, we find by the context, had been conversing together) came to
          Jericho," a place devoted by Joshua to the curse of God; and yet, even
          this place yields converts to Jesus; Zaccheus had been called there
          formerly; and Bartimeus, as we shall hear by-and-by, in all
          probability, was called now. For some good may come even out of
          Nazareth. Christ himself was born there, and his sovereign grace can
          reach and overcome the worst of people, in the very worst of places.
          Jesus came to Jericho. Let not his ministers, if providence points out
          their way, shun going to seemingly the most unlikely places to do
          good, some chosen vessels may be therein. Jesus and his disciples came
          to Jericho. They were itinerants; and, as I have frequently observed,
          seldom stayed long in a place; not that this is any argument against
          the stated settlement of particular pastors over particular parishes.
          But however, our Lord's practice, in this respect, gives a kind of a
          sanction to itinerant preaching, when persons are properly called to,
          and qualified for, such an employ. And I believe we may venture to
          affirm (though we would by no means prescribe or dictate to the Holy
          One of Israel) that, whenever there shall be a general revival of
          religion in any country, itinerant preaching will be more in vogue.
          And it is to be feared, that those who condemn it now, merely on
          account of the meanness of its appearances, would have joined with the
          self-righteous Scribes and Pharisees, in condemning even the Son of
          God himself, for such a practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And as he went out of Jericho with his disciples, and a great number
          of people;" o[clou iJkanou' a great number of mob, or rabble, as the
          High- priests of that generation termed them; for these were the
          constant followers of Jesus of Nazareth; it was the poor that received
          his gospel, the common people heard him gladly, and followed him from
          place to place. Not that all who followed him, were his true
          disciples. No, some followed him only for his loaves, others out of
          curiosity; though some undoubtedly followed to hear, and be edified by
          the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth. Jesus knew this,
          and was also sensible how displeasing this crowding after him was to
          some of the rulers of the Jewish church, who, upon every occasion,
          were ready to say, "Have any of the Scribes and Pharisees believed on
          him?" But, notwithstanding, I do not hear of our blessed Lord's
          sending them home but once; and that was, after they had been with him
          three days, and had nothing left to eat, he saw they were as sheep
          having no shepherd, and therefore had compassion on them, and taught
          them. A sufficient warrant this for gospel-ministers to preach to poor
          souls that follow to hear the word, whatever principle their coming
          may proceed from. At the same time, they should caution people against
          thinking themselves Christians, because they follow Christ's
          ministers. This our Lord frequently did, For there are many that
          followed Jesus, and not follow his ministers, and hear them gladly;
          nay, perhaps do many things, as Herod did, who, it is to be feared,
          will never follow them into the kingdom of heaven. Much people
          followed Jesus out of Jericho, but how many of them were offended in
          him; and afterwards, it may be, cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him."
          Who would depend on popularity? It is like the morning cloud, or early
          dew, that passeth away. But what a press, and seemingly continued
          hurry of business did the blessed Jesus live in! He could not be hid;
          go where he would, much people followed him. He had scarce time to eat
          bread. Happy is it for such who are called to act in a public station
          in the church, and to be more abundant in labors, that their Jesus has
          trodden in this dangerous path before them. Popularity is a fiery
          furnace, and no one, but he who kept the three children amidst
          Nebuchadnezzar's flames, can preserve popular ministers from being
          hurt by it. But we can do all things through Christ strengthening us.
          And I have often thought, that there is one consideration sufficient
          to extinguish, or moderate at least, any excess of joy and
          self-complacence, which the most popular preacher may feel, when
          followed even by the greatest multitudes; and that is this, "How many
          of these hearers will go "away, without receiving any saving benefit
          by my preaching; nay, how many, it may be, will only have their
          damnation increased by it!" As we find many will say at the great day,
          "hast thou not taught in our streets;" to whom Jesus shall answer,
          "Verily, I know you not."
        </p>
        <p>
          But to proceed, "As our Lord went out of Jericho with his disciples,
          and a great number of people, blind Bartimeus, (the son of Timeus) sat
          by the highway-side begging." It should seem that he was a noted,
          though by no means what we commonly call, a sturdy beggar; having no
          other way, as he had lost his sight, to get his bread; his case was
          still the more pitiable, if he was, as some think the name imports,
          the blind son of a blind father. It may be, her begged for his father
          and himself too; and if so, then this may give us light into that
          passage of Matthew 20:22 where we are told, that "two men spake to
          Jesus." It might be father and son, though only one is mentioned here,
          because he only followed Jesus in the way. Thus that holy, judicious,
          and practical expositor of holy writ, Mr. Henry. But however this be,
          he is not blamed for begging, neither should we discommend others for
          so doing, when providence calls to it. It was the unjust steward that
          said, "To beg I am ashamed." It is our pride that often makes us
          unwilling to be beholden; Jesus was not thus minded, he lived, as it
          were, upon alms; the women that followed him, ministered to him of
          their substance. Bartimeus, not being able to dig, begs for his
          living; and, in order to make a better trade of it, sat by the
          highway-side, in all probability, without, or near the gate of the
          city, where people must necessarily pass in and out. But though he had
          lost his sight, he had his hearing perfect; and it should comfort us,
          if we have lost one sense, that we have the use of another, and that
          we are not deprived of the benefit of all. Happy was it for Bartimeus
          that he could hear, though not see. For in all probability, upon
          hearing the noise and clamor of the much people that followed after
          our Lord, his curiosity set him upon inquiring into the cause of it,
          and some one or another told him, "that Jesus of Nazareth was passing
          by;" Jesus of Nazareth, called so, because he was bred there, or out
          of contempt; Nazareth being either a very mean, or very wicked place,
          or both, which made guileless Nathaniel say, "Can any good come out of
          Nazareth?" And what does Bartimeus do when he hears of Jesus? We are
          told, ver.47: "And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he
          began to cry out." This plainly denotes, that though the eyes of his
          body were shut, yet the eyes of his mind were, in some degree, opened,
          so that he saw, perhaps, more than most of the multitude that followed
          after Jesus; for, as soon as he heard of him, he began to cry out;
          which he would not have done, had he not heard of him before, and
          believed also, that he was both able and willing to restore sight to
          the blind. "He began to cry out." This implies, that he had a deep
          sense of his own misery, and the need which he had of a cure; his
          prayers did not freeze as they went out of his lips; he began to cry
          out, that Jesus might hear him, notwithstanding the noise of the
          throng; and he began to cry out, as soon as he heard he was passing
          by, not knowing whether he might ever enjoy such an opportunity any
          more. "He began to cry out, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy upon
          me." The people called him Jesus of Nazareth. Bartimeus stiles him,
          "Jesus, thou Son of David." Thereby evidencing, that he believed him
          to be the Messiah who was to come into the world, unto whom the Lord
          God was to give the throne of his father David, and of whose kingdom
          there was to be no end. "Jesus, thou Son of David;" or, as it is in
          the parallel place of St. Matthew 20:30, "O Lord, thou son of David;"
          of whom it had been long foretold, Isaiah 35, that when he should
          come, "the eyes of the blind should be opened." "Have mercy upon me,"
          the natural language of a soul brought to lie down at the feet of a
          sovereign God. Here is no laying claim to a cure by way of merit; no
          proud, self-righteous, God I thank thee that I am not as other men
          are: not bringing in a reckoning of performances, nor any doubting of
          Jesus' power or willingness to heal him, but out of the abundance of
          the heart, his mouth speaketh, and, in the language of the poor,
          broken-hearted publican, he cries out, "Jesus, thou Son of David, have
          mercy on me." Jesus, thou friend of sinners, thou Savior, who, though
          thou be the true God, wast pleased to become the Son of David, and to
          be made man, that thou mightest seek and save those that were lost,
          have mercy upon me; let thy bowels yearn towards a poor, miserable,
          blind beggar?
        </p>
        <p>
          One would have thought that such a moving petition as this would have
          melted the whole multitude, that heard his piteous cry, into
          compassion, and induced some at least to turn suitors in his behalf,
          or help to carry him to the blessed Jesus. But instead of that, we are
          told, ver.48, that "many charged him." The word in the original seems
          to imply a charge, attended with threatening, and spoken in an angry
          manner. They charged him "to hold his peace;" and it may be,
          threatened to beat him if he did not. They looked upon him beneath the
          notice of Jesus of Nazareth, and were ready enough to ask, whether he
          thought Jesus Christ had nothing else to do but to wait upon him. This
          was, no doubt, very discouraging to blind Bartimeus. For opposition
          comes closest when it proceeds from those who are esteemed followers
          of the Lamb. The spouse complains as of something peculiarly
          afflicting, that her own mother's children were angry with her. But
          opposition only serves to whet the edge of true devotion, and
          therefore Bartimeus, instead of being silenced by their charges and
          threatenings, "cried out the more a great deal, thou Son of David,
          have mercy on me." Still he breaks out into the same humble language,
          and, if Jesus, the Son of David, will have mercy on him, he cares not
          much what some of his peevish followers said of, or did unto him. This
          was not a vain repetition, but a devout reiteration of his request. We
          may sometimes repeat the same words, and yet not be guilty of that
          battalogia, or vain speaking , which our Lord condemns. For our Lord
          himself prayed in his agony, and said twice the same words; "Father,
          if it be possible, let this cup pass from me." Thus Bartimeus, "Jesus,
          thou Son of David, have mercy upon me." And how does the Son of David
          treat him? Does he join issue with the multitude, and charge him to
          hold his peace? Or does he go on, thinking him beneath his notice? no;
          for, says St. Mark, ver 49, "And Jesus stood still," though he was on
          a journey, and it may be in haste (for it is not losing time to stop
          now and then on a journey to do a good office by the way) "and
          commanded him to be called:" why so? To teach us to be condescending
          and kind even to poor, if real beggars, and tacitly to reprove the
          blind, misguided zeal of those who had charged him to hold his peace.
          By this also our Lord prepares the multitude the better to take the
          more notice of the blind man's faith, and of his own mercy and power
          exerted in the healing of him. For there are times and seasons when we
          are called to perform acts of charity in the most public manner, and
          that too very consistently with the injunction of our Savior, "not to
          let our right hand know what our left hand doeth." For there is a
          great deal of difference between giving alms, and exercising acts of
          charity, that are seen of men, and doing them, that they may be seen;
          the one is always sinful, the other often becomes our duty. Jesus
          commanded Bartimeus to be called, "and they called him." Who called
          him? It may be, those who a little before charged him t hold his
          peace. For it often happens, that our opposers and discouragers,
          afterwards become our friends, "When a man's ways please the Lord, he
          makes his enemies be at peace with him." And it is to be wished, that
          all who have charged poor souls, that are crying after Jesus, to hold
          their peace, and to spare themselves, and not be righteous over-much,
          would imitate the people here, and encourage those they once
          persecuted and maligned. "They call the blind man, saying unto him, Be
          of good comfort, ruse, he calleth thee." The words, and manner of
          speaking them, implies haste, and a kind of solicitude for the blind
          man's relief. O! that we might hereby learn to be patient and
          long-suffering, towards opposers. For it may be, that many may oppose
          awakened souls, not out of enmity, but through prejudice and
          misinformation, through ignorance and unbelief, and a real, though
          perhaps false, persuasion, that their relations are going in a wrong
          way. By and by they may be convinced, that Christ is indeed calling
          them, and then they may become real and open friends to the cause and
          work of God; if not, it is our duty to behave with meekness towards
          all, and not to render railing for railing, but contrary-wise
          blessing, knowing that we are thereunto called, that we may inherit a
          blessing; Jesus did not break out into harsh language against these
          opposers, neither did Bartimeus. "Our Lord stood still, and commanded
          him to be called; and they call the blind man; saying unto him, Be of
          good comfort, rise, he calleth thee; and he, casting away his garment,
          rose and came to Jesus." Had Bartimeus not been in earnest when he
          cried, "Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy upon me," he might have
          said, why do you mock me? why bid ye me arise; rise indeed I can, but
          after I am risen, how can I, being blind, find my way unto him? If he
          will come to me, it is well; if not, all you r calling availeth
          nothing, it being impossible for me to find my way. Thus thousands
          now-a-days object to evangelical preachers, saying, Why do you bid us
          come to, and believe on Jesus Christ, when you tell us it is
          impossible of ourselves to turn to God, or to do good works; and that
          no one can come unto him, unless the Father draw him. Is not this like
          the people's calling upon Bartimeus, to arise and come to Jesus, when
          he could not possibly see his way before him? true, it is so; and
          would to God that all who make this objection, would imitate
          Bartimeus, and put forth the strength they have! What if we do call
          you to come, and to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, that you may be
          saved? Does this imply, that you have a power in yourselves to do so?
          No, in no wise, no more than Jesus saying unto Lazarus' dead and
          stinking carcass, "Come forth," implied, that Lazarus had a power to
          raise himself from the grave. We call to you, being commanded to
          preach the gospel to every creature, hoping and praying, that Christ's
          power may accompany the word, and make it effectual to the quickening
          and raising of your dead souls. We also call to you to believe, upon
          the same account as Jesus said unto the lawyer, "do this, and thou
          shalt live;" that you seeing your utter inability to come, might
          thereby be convinced of your unbelief, and be led to ask for faith of
          him, whose gift it is, and who is therefore in scripture emphatically
          stiled the Author, as well as Finisher, of our faith. Add to this,
          that it is your duty to wait at the pool, or to make us of the
          strength you have, in the earnest and steady performance of all
          commanded duty. For though you cannot do what is spiritually good,
          because you want spiritual principles of action, yet ye may do what is
          morally and materially good, inasmuch as ye are reasonable creatures;
          and though doing your duty as you can, no ways deserves mercy, or
          entitles you to it, yet it is the way in which you are required to
          walk, and the way in which God us usually found. While you are
          attempting to stretch out your withered arm, peradventure it may be
          restored; and who knows but Jesus may work faith in you, by his
          almighty power?
        </p>
        <p>
          Bartimeus has set before such objectors an example; O that they would
          once submit to be taught by a poor blind beggar! For he, casting away
          his garment, rose, and blind as he was, came to Jesus; "casting away
          his garment." This seems to be a large coat or cloak, that he wore to
          screen himself from the rain and cold; undoubtedly, it was the most
          necessary and valuable vestment he had, and one would have thought,
          that he should have taken this along with him; but he knew very well,
          that if he did so, it might hang about his heels, and thereby his
          reaching Jesus be retarded at least, if not prevented entirely.
          Valuable therefore as it was to him, he cast it away. The word
          implies, that he threw it from off his shoulders, with great
          precipitancy and resolution, knowing that if he got a cure, which he
          now hoped for, by Christ's calling him, he should never want his
          garment again. And thus will all do that are in earnest about coming
          to Jesus here, or seeing and enjoying him in his kingdom eternally
          hereafter. They will cut off a right hand, they will pluck out a right
          eye, they will leave father and mother, husband and wife, yes, and
          their own lives also, rather than not be his disciples. The apostle
          Paul, therefore, exhorts Christians, to "lay aside every weight, and
          the sin that doth most easily beset them," or hand about their heels,
          as the word in the original imports; alluding to the custom of the
          Romans, who wore long garments. Such a one was this, which Bartimeus
          had wrapped round him. But he, to show that he sincerely desired to
          recover his sight, casting it away, arose and came to Jesus. And what
          treatment did Jesus give him? did he say, come not nigh me, thou
          impudent noisy beggar? No, "he answered and said unto him, What wilt
          thou, that I should do unto thee?" an odd question this, seemingly.
          For did not our Lord know what he wanted? Yes, he did; but the Lord
          Jesus dealt with him, as he deals with us. He will make us acknowledge
          our wants ourselves, that we thereby may confess our dependence upon
          him, and be made more sensible of the need we stand in, of his divine
          assistance. The blind man immediately replies, "Lord, (thereby
          intimating his belief of Christ's divinity) that I might receive my
          sight." Methinks, I see the poor creature listening to the voice of
          our Savior, and with looks and gestures bespeaking the inward
          earnestness of his soul, he cries out, "Lord, that I may receive my
          sight." As though he had said, I believe thou are that Messiah who was
          to come into the world. I have heard of thy fame, O Jesus! And hearing
          the long-wished-for glad tidings of thy coming this way, I cry unto
          thee, asking not for silver and gold, but what thou, thou alone canst
          give me, Lord, that I might receive my sight. No sooner does he ask,
          but he receives. For, verse 52, "Jesus said unto him, Go thy way, thy
          faith hath made thee whole; and immediately he received his sight."
          With the word there went a power; and he that spake light out of
          darkness, saying, "Let there be light, and there was light," commanded
          light into this poor blind beggar's eyes, and behold there was light.
          The miracle was instantaneous; immediately he received his sight. And
          next to a miracle it was, that by breaking into open light all at
          once, he was not struck blind again: but he that gave the sight,
          preserved it when given. O! happy Bartimeus! Thy eyes are now opened,
          and the very first object thou dost behold, is the ever- loving,
          altogether-lovely Jesus. Methinks I see thee transported with wonder
          and admiration, and all the disciples, and the multitude, gazing
          around thee! And now, having received thy sight, why dost thou not
          obey the Lord's command, and go thy way? Why doest thou not haste to
          fetch thy garment, that thou just now in a hurry didst cast away? No,
          no! with his bodily eyes, I believe he received also a fresh addition
          of spiritual sight, and though others saw no form or comeliness in the
          blessed Jesus, that they should desire him; yet he by an eye of faith
          discovered such transcendent excellencies in his royal person, and
          felt at the same time such a divine attraction towards his
          all-bountiful benefactor, that instead of going his way to fetch his
          garment, "he followed Jesus in the way;" and by his actions, says with
          faithful, honest-hearted Ruth, "entreat me not to leave thee; for
          whither thou goest, I will go; where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy
          people shall be my people; and thy God, my God." He followed Jesus in
          the way; the narrow way, the way of the cross; and I doubt not but
          long since he has followed him to his crown, and is at this time
          sitting with him at the right hand of his Father.

          And now, my dear hearers, how find you your hearts affected at the
          relation of this notable miracle which Jesus wrought? Are you not
          ready to break out into the language of the song of Moses, and to say,
          "Who is like unto thee O Lord, glorious in holiness, fearful in
          praises, continually doing wonders!" Marvelous are thy works, O Jesus,
          and that our souls know right well! But we must not stop here, in
          admiring what the Lord did for Bartimeus; this, no doubt, as well as
          other parts of Scripture, was written for our learning, upon whom the
          ends of the world are come; consequently, as was proposed in the
        </p>
        <p>
          Second place, we should see what spiritual improvement can be made of
          this history, upon which we have already been making some remarks.
        </p>
        <p>
          A natural man, indeed, goes no further than the outward court of the
          Scripture, and reads this, and the other miracles of our blessed
          Savior, just in the same manner as he reads Homer's battles, or the
          exploits of Alexander. But God forbid, that we should rest in only
          hearing this matter of fact. For I tell thee, O man, I tell thee, O
          woman, whoever thou art, that sittest this day under a preached
          gospel, that if thou art in a natural state, thou art as blind in thy
          soul, as Bartimeus was in his body; a blind child of a blind father,
          even of thy father Adam, who lost his sight when he lost his
          innocence, and entailed his blindness, justly inflicted, upon thee,
          and me, and his whole posterity. Some think indeed, that thy see; but
          alas! such talk only like men in their sleep, like persons beside
          themselves; the scriptures every where represent fallen man, not only
          as spiritually blind, but dead also; and we no more know, by nature,
          savingly the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, than Bartimeus, when he
          was blind, knew the colors of the rainbow. This, I trust, some of you
          begin to feel, I see you concerned, I see you weeping, and, was I to
          ask some of you, what you want to have done unto you? I know your
          answer would be, that we may receive our sight. And God forbid, that I
          should charge you to hold your peace, as though Jesus would not regard
          you! No, your being made sensible of your natural blindness, and
          crying thus earnestly after Jesus, is a sign at least, that you are
          awakened by his holy Spirit (though it is possible, that you may cry
          with an exceeding bitter cry, as Esau did, and be lost at last);
          however, Christian charity induces me to believe and hope the best; I
          will therefore, in the language of those who afterwards encouraged
          Bartimeus, say unto you, Arise, take comfort for, I trust, Jesus is
          calling you; follow therefore the example of Bartimeus; cast away your
          garment; lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth most easily
          beset you, arise, and come to Jesus. He commands me, by his written
          word, to call to you, and say, "Come unto him, all ye that are weary,
          and heavy laden, and he will refresh you, he will give you rest." Be
          not afraid, ye seek Jesus of Nazareth; behold, he comes forth to meet
          you; ye are now on the highway side, and Jesus, I trust, is passing
          by; I feel his presence, I hope many of you feel it too; O then, cry
          mightily to him, who is mighty and willing to save you; lay yourselves
          at the feet of sovereign grace, say unto him, "Jesus, thou Son of
          David, have mercy on me," in the same frame as Bartimeus did, and
          Jesus will answer you, he will not cast out your prayer; according to
          your faith, so shall it be done unto you. Blind as you are, you shall
          notwithstanding, receive your sight; Satan, indeed, and unbelief, will
          suggest many objections to you, your carnal relations will also join
          issue with them, and charge you to hold your peace; one will tell you,
          that your blindness is too inveterate to be cured; another, that it is
          too late; a third, that though Jesus can, yet he will not have mercy
          upon such poor, blind, despicable beggars, as ye are; but, the more
          they charge you to hold your peace, do you cry out so much the more a
          great deal, "Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on us." Jesus, thou
          Savior, thou friend of sinners, thou Son of David, and therefore a Son
          of man! Gracious words! Endearing appellations! Be encouraged by them,
          to draw nigh unto him. Though David's Lord, yet he is become David's
          Son, after the flesh, that ye through him may be made the sons of God:
          no matter what thou art, O woman, what thou art, O man; though thou
          art literally a poor beggar, think not thy condition too mean for
          Jesus to take notice of; he came into the highways and hedges, to call
          such poor beggars in; or, if you are rich, think not yourselves too
          high to stoop to Jesus; for his is the King of kings; and you never
          will be truly rich, until you are made rich in Jesus; fear not being
          despised, or losing a little worldly honor: one sight of Jesus will
          make amends for all: you will find something so inviting, so
          attracting, so satisfying, in the altogether lovely Lamb of God, that
          every sublunary enjoyment will sicken, and die, and vanish before you;
          and you will o more desire your former vain and trifling amusements,
          than Bartimeus, after he had received his sight, desired to go back
          again and fetch his garment. O that there may be many such blind
          beggars among you this day!
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a great multitude of people following me, a poor worm, this
          day. I rejoice to see the fields thus white, ready unto harvest, and
          to spread the gospel-net amidst so many; but alas! I shall return home
          with a heavy heart, unless some of you will arise and come to my
          Jesus; I desire to preach Him, and not myself; rest not in hearing and
          following me. Behold, believe on, and follow the Lamb of God, who came
          to take away the sins of the world. Indeed, I do not despair of any of
          you, neither am I discouraged, on account of my preaching in the
          highways and hedges; Jesus called Zaccheus; Jesus called Bartimeus, as
          he passed through Jericho; that cursed, that devoted place; and why
          may he not call some of you, out of these despised fields? Is his arm
          shortened, that he cannot save? Is he not as mighty now, and as
          willing to save, even to the uttermost, all that come to the father
          through him, as he was seventeen hundred years ago? Assuredly he is;
          he hath said, and he also will do it, "Whosoever cometh to me, I will
          in no wise cast out." In no wise, or by no means. O encouraging words!
          Sinners, believe ye this? arise then, be of good comfort, for Jesus is
          indeed calling you. Some of you, I trust, have obeyed this invitation,
          and have had a sight of him long ago; I know then, you will bless and
          love him; and if he should say unto you, as he did unto Bartimeus, go
          you your way; your answer would be, we love our master, and will not
          go from him. But suffer ye the word of exhortation:
        </p>
        <p>
          Suffer me to stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance, show that
          you have indeed seen him, and that you do indeed love him, by
          following him in the way; I mean, in the way of the cross, the way of
          his ordinances, and in the way of his holy commandments; for alas! the
          love of many waxeth cold, and few there are that follow Jesus rightly
          in the way; few there are that cast away their garments so heartily as
          they should; some idol or another hangs about us, and hinders us in
          running the race that is set before us. Awake therefore, ye sleepy,
          though, it may be, wise virgins. Awake, awake, put on strength; shake
          yourselves from the dust; arise and follow Jesus more closely in the
          way, than ever you did yet. Lift up the hands that hang down, and
          strengthen the feeble knees. Provide right paths for your feet, lest
          that which is lame be turned out of the way, but rather be ye healed.
          For though the way be narrow, yet it is not long; "though the gate be
          straight, (to use the words of pious bishop Beveridge) yet it opens
          into everlasting life." O that ye may get a fresh sight of him again
          this day! That would be like oil to the wheels of your graces, and
          make your souls like the chariots of Aminadab. It is only owing to
          your losing sight of him, that you go so heavily from day to day. A
          sight of Jesus, like the sun rising in the morning, dispels the
          darkness and gloominess that lies upon the soul. Take therefore a
          fresh view of him, O believers, and never rest until you are
          translated to see him as he is, and to live with him for evermore, in
          the kingdom of heaven. Even so, Lord Jesus, Amen and Amen!<br />
