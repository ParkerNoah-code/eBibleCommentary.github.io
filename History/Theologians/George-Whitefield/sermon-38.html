        <p>John 5:39 -- "Search the Scriptures."</p>
        <p>
          When the Sadducees came to our blessed Lord, and put to him the
          question, "whose wife that woman should be in the next life, who had
          seven husbands in this," he told them "they erred, not knowing the
          scriptures." And if we would know whence all the errors, that have
          over-spread the church of Christ, first arose, we should find that, in
          a great measure, they flowed from the same fountain, ignorance of the
          word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our blessed Lord, though he was the eternal God, yet as man, he made
          the scriptures his constant rule and guide. And therefore, when he was
          asked by the lawyer, which was the great commandment of the law, he
          referred him to his Bible for an answer, "What readest thou?" And
          thus, when led by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil, he repelled
          all his assaults, with "it is written."
        </p>
        <p>
          A sufficient confutation this, of their opinion, who say, "the Spirit
          only, and not the Spirit by the Word, is to be our rule of action." If
          so, our Savior, who had the Spirit without measure, needed not always
          have referred to the written word.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how few copy after the example of Christ? How many are there who
          do not regard the word of God at all, but throw the sacred oracles
          aside, as an antiquated book, fit only for illiterate men?
        </p>
        <p>
          Such do greatly err, not knowing what the scriptures are, I shall,
          therefore,
        </p>
        <p>First, Show, that it is every one's duty to search them.</p>
        <p>
          And Secondly, Lay down some directions for you to search them with
          advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I am to show, that it is every person's duty to search the
          Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the Scriptures, I understand the law and the prophets, and those
          books which have in all ages been accounted canonical, and which make
          up that volume commonly called the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are emphatically stiled the Scriptures, and, in one place, the
          "Scriptures of Truth," as though no other books deserved the name of
          true writings or scripture in comparison of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are not of any private interpretation, authority, or invention,
          but holy men of old wrote them, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fountain of God's revealing himself thus to man-kind, was our fall
          in Adam, and the necessity of our new birth in Christ Jesus. And if we
          search the scriptures as we ought, we shall find the sum and
          substance, the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and end of them, is to
          lead us to a knowledge of these two great truths.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the threats, promises and precepts, all the exhortations and
          doctrines contained therein, all the rites, ceremonies and sacrifices
          appointed under the Jewish law; nay, almost all the historical parts
          of holy scripture, suppose our being fallen in Adam, and either point
          out to us a Mediator to come, or speak of him as already come in the
          flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had man continued in a state of innocence, he would not have needed an
          outward revelation, because the law of God was so deeply written in
          the tables of his heart. But having eaten the forbidden fruit, he
          incurred the displeasure of God, and lost the divine image, and,
          therefore, without an external revelation, could never tell how God
          would be reconciled unto him, or how he should be saved from the
          misery and darkness of his fallen nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          That these truths are so, I need not refer you to any other book, than
          your own hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For unless we are fallen creatures, whence those abominable
          corruptions which daily arise in our hearts? We could not come thus
          corrupt out of the hands of our Maker, because he being goodness
          itself could make nothing but what is like himself, holy, just, and
          good. And that we want to be delivered from these disorders of our
          nature, is evident, because we find an unwillingness within ourselves
          to own we are thus depraved, and are always striving to appear to
          others of a quite different frame and temper of mind than what we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          I appeal to the experience of the most learned disputer against divine
          revelation, whether he does not find in himself, that he is naturally
          proud, angry, revengeful, and full of other passions contrary to the
          purity, holiness, and long suffering of God. And is not this a
          demonstration that some way or other he is fallen from God? And I
          appeal also, whether at the same time that he finds these hurtful
          lusts in his heart, he does not strive to seem amiable, courteous,
          kind and affable [friendly, good-natured, easy-going]; and is not this
          a manifest proof, that he is sensible he is miserable, and wants, he
          knows not how, to be redeemed or delivered from it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here then, God by his word steps in, and opens to his view such a
          scene of divine love, and infinite goodness in the holy scriptures,
          that none but men, of such corrupt and reprobate minds as our modern
          deists, would shut their eyes against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does God in his written word do more or less, than show thee, O
          man, how thou art fallen into that blindness, darkness, and misery, of
          which thou feelest and complainest? And, at the same time, he points
          out the way to what thou desirest, even how thou mayest be redeemed
          out of it by believing in, and copying after the Son of his love.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I told you before, so I tell you again, upon these two truths rest
          all divine revelation. It being given us for no other end, but to show
          our misery, and our happiness; our fall and recovery; or, in one word,
          after what manner we died in Adam, and how in Christ we may again be
          made alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, then arises the necessity of searching the scriptures: for
          since they are nothing else but the grand charter of our salvation,
          the revelation of a covenant made by God with men in Christ, and a
          light to guide us into the way of peace; it follows, that all are
          obliged to read and search them, because all are equally fallen from
          God, all equally stand in need of being informed how they must be
          restored to, and again united with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          How foolishly then do the disputing infidels of this generation act,
          who are continually either calling for signs from heaven, or seeking
          for outward evidence to prove the truth of divine revelation? Whereas,
          what they so earnestly seek for is nigh unto, nay, within them. For
          let them but consult their own hearts, they cannot but feel what they
          want. Let them but consult the lively oracles of God, and they cannot
          but see a remedy revealed for all their wants, and that the written
          word does as exactly answer the wants and desires of their hearts, as
          face answers to face in the water. Where then is the scribe, where is
          the wise, where is the solidity of the reasoning of the disputers of
          this world? Has not God revealed himself unto them, as plain as their
          own hearts could wish? And yet they require a sign: but there shall no
          other sign be given them. For if they believe not a revelation which
          is every way so suited to their wants, neither will they be persuaded
          though on should rise from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this discourse is not designed so much for them that believe not,
          as for them, who both know and believe that the scriptures contain a
          revelation which came from God, and that it is their duty, as being
          chief parties concerned, not only to read but search them also.
        </p>
        <p>I pass on, therefore, in the</p>
        <p>
          Second place, to lay down some directions, how you may search them
          with advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Have always in view, the end for which the scriptures were
          written, even to show us the way of salvation, by Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Search the scriptures," says our blessed Lord, "for they are they
          that testify of me." Look, therefore, always for Christ in the
          scripture. He is the treasure hid in the field, both of the Old and
          New Testament. In the Old, you will find him under prophesies, types,
          sacrifices, and shadows; in the New, manifested in the flesh, to
          become a propitiation for our sins as a Priest, and as a Prophet to
          reveal the whole will of his heavenly Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have Christ, then, always in view when you are reading the word of
          God, and this, like the star in the east, will guide you to the
          Messiah, will serve as a key to every thing that is obscure, and
          unlock to you the wisdom and riches of all the mysteries of the
          kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Search the scriptures with an humble child-like disposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          For whosoever does not read them with this temper, shall in no wise
          enter into the knowledge of the things contained in them. For God
          hides the sense of them, from those that are wise and prudent in their
          own eyes, and reveals them only to babes in Christ: who think they
          know nothing yet as they ought to know; who hunger and thirst after
          righteousness, and humbly desire to be fed with the sincere milk of
          the word, that they may grow thereby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fancy yourselves, therefore, when you are searching the scriptures,
          especially when you are reading the New Testament, to be with Mary
          sitting at the feet of the holy Jesus; and be as willing to learn what
          God shall teach you, as Samuel was, when he said, "Speak, Lord, for
          thy servant heareth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh that the unbelievers would pull down every high thought and
          imagination that exalts itself against the revealed will of God! O
          that they would, like new-born babes, desire to be fed with the pure
          milk of the word! Then we should have them no longer scoffing at
          Divine revelation, nor would they read the Bible any more with the
          same intend the Philistines brought our Samson, to make sport at it;
          but they would see the divine image and superscription written upon
          every line. They would hear God speaking unto their souls by it, and,
          consequently, be built up in the knowledge and fear of him, who is the
          Author thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Search the scriptures, with a sincere intention to put in
          practice what you read.
        </p>
        <p>
          A desire to do the will of God is the only way to know it; if any man
          will do my will, says Jesus Christ, "He shall know of my doctrine,
          whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." As he also speaks
          in another place to his disciples, "To you, (who are willing to
          practice your duty) it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom
          of God, but to those that are without (who only want to raise cavils
          against my doctrine) all these things are spoken in parables, that
          seeing they may see and not understand, and hearing they may hear and
          not perceive."
        </p>
        <p>
          For it is but just in God to send those strong delusions, that they
          may believe a lie, and to conceal the knowledge of himself from all
          such as do not seek him with a single intention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ is the same now, as formerly, to those who desire to know
          from his word, who he is that they may believe on, and live by; and to
          him he will reveal himself as clearly as he did to the woman of
          Samaria, when he said, "I that speak to thee am he," or as he did to
          the man that was born blind, whom the Jews had cast out for his name's
          sake, "He that talketh with thee, is he." But to those who consult his
          word with a desire neither to know him, nor keep his commandments, but
          either merely for their entertainment, or to scoff at the simplicity
          of the manner in which he is revealed, to those, I say, he never will
          reveal himself, though they should search the scriptures to all
          eternity. As he never would tell those whether he was the Messiah or
          not, who put that question to him either out of curiosity, or that
          they might have whereof to accuse him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, In order to search the scriptures still more effectually,
          make an application of every thing you read to your own hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For whatever was written in the book of God, was written for our
          learning. And what Christ said unto those aforetime, we must look upon
          as spoken to us also: for since the holy scriptures are nothing but a
          revelation from God, how fallen man is to be restored by Jesus Christ:
          all the precepts, threats, and promises, belong to us and to our
          children, as well as to those, to whom they were immediately made
          known.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the Apostle, when he tells us that he lived by the faith of the
          Son of God, adds, "who died and gave himself for me." It is this
          application of Jesus Christ to our hearts, that makes his redemption
          effectual to each of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is this application of all the doctrinal and historical parts
          of scripture, when we are reading them over, that must render them
          profitable to us, as they were designed for reproof, for correction,
          for instruction in righteousness, and to make every child of God
          perfect, thoroughly furnished to every good work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dare appeal to the experience of every spiritual reader of holy
          writ, whether or not, if he consulted the word of God in this manner,
          he was not at all times and at all seasons, as plainly directed how to
          act, as though he had consulted the Urim and Thummim, which was upon
          the high- priest's breast. For this is the way God now reveals himself
          to man: not by making new revelations, but by applying general things
          that are revealed already to every sincere reader's heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this, by the way, answers an objection made by those who say, "The
          word of God is not a perfect rule of action, because it cannot direct
          us how to act or how to determine in particular cases, or what place
          to go to, when we are in doubt, and therefore, the Spirit, and not the
          word, is to be our rule of action."
        </p>
        <p>
          But this I deny, and affirm on the contrary, that God at all times,
          circumstances, and places, though never so minute, never so
          particular, will, if we diligently seek the assistance of his Holy
          Spirit, apply general things to our hearts, and thereby, to use the
          words of the holy Jesus, will lead us into all truth, and give us the
          particular assistance we want. But this leads me to a
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth direction how to search the scriptures with profit: Labor to
          attain that Spirit by which they were written.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the natural man discerneth not the words of the Spirit of God,
          because they are spiritually discerned; the words that Christ hath
          spoken, they are spirit, and they are life, and can be no more
          understood as to the true sense and meaning of them, by the mere
          natural man, than a person who never had learned a language can
          understand another speaking in it. The scriptures, therefore, have not
          unfitly been compared, by some, to the cloud which went before the
          Israelites, they are dark and hard to be understood by the natural
          man, as the cloud appeared dark to the Egyptians; but they are light,
          they are life to Christians indeed, as that same cloud which seemed
          dark to Pharaoh and his house, appeared bright and altogether glorious
          to the Israel of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the want of the assistance of this Spirit, that made Nicodemus,
          a teacher of Israel, and a ruler of the Jews, so utterly ignorant in
          the doctrine of regeneration: for being only a natural man, he could
          not tell how that thing could be; it was the want of this Spirit that
          made our Savior's disciples, though he so frequently conversed with
          them, daily mistake the nature of the doctrines he delivered; and it
          is because the natural veil is not taken off from their hearts, that
          so many who now pretend to search the scriptures, yet see no farther
          than into the bare letter of them, and continue entire strangers to
          the spiritual meaning couched under every parable, and contained in
          almost all the precepts of the book of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, how should it be otherwise, for God being a spirit, he cannot
          communicate himself any otherwise than in a spiritual manner to the
          hearts of men; and consequently if we are strangers to his Spirit, we
          must continue strangers to his word, because it is altogether like
          himself, spiritual. Labor, therefore, earnestly for to attain this
          blessed Spirit; otherwise, your understandings will never be opened to
          understand the scriptures aright: and remember, prayer is one of the
          most immediate means to get this Holy Spirit. Therefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixthly, Let me advise you, before you read the scriptures, to pray,
          that Christ, according to his promise, would send his Spirit to guide
          you into all truth; intersperse short ejaculations whilst you are
          engaged in reading; pray over every word and verse, if possible; and
          when you close up the book, most earnestly beseech God, that the words
          which you have read, may be inwardly engrafted into your hearts, and
          bring forth in you the fruits of a good life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do this, and you will, with a holy violence, draw down God's Holy
          Spirit into your hearts; you will experience his gracious influence,
          and feel him enlightening, quickening, and inflaming your souls by the
          word of God; you will then not only read, but mark, learn, and
          inwardly digest what you read: and the word of God will be meat
          indeed, and drink indeed unto your souls; you then will be as Apollos
          was, powerful in the scriptures; be scribes ready instructed to the
          kingdom of God, and bring out of the good treasures of your heart,
          things both from the Old and New Testament, to entertain all you
          converse with. One
        </p>
        <p>
          Direction more, which shall be the last, Seventhly, Read the scripture
          constantly, or, to use our Savior's expression in the text, "search
          the scriptures;" dig in them as for hid treasure; for here is a
          manifest allusion to those who dig in mines; and our Savior would
          thereby teach us, that we must take as much pains in constantly
          reading his word, if we would grow wise thereby, as those who dig for
          gold and silver. The scriptures contain the deep things of God, and
          therefore, can never be sufficiently searched into by a careless,
          superficial, cursory way of reading them, but by an industrious,
          close, and humble application.

          The Psalmist makes it the characteristic of a good man, that he
          "meditates on God's law day and night." And "this book of the law,
          (says God to Joshua) shall not go out of thy mouth, but thou shalt
          meditate therein day and night;" for then thou shalt make thy way
          prosperous, and thou shalt have good success. Search, therefore, the
          scriptures, not only devoutly but daily, for in them are the words of
          eternal life; wait constantly at wisdom's gate, and she will then, and
          not till then, display and lay open to you her heavenly treasures. You
          that are rich, are without excuse if you do not; and you that are
          poor, ought to take heed and improve that little time you have: for by
          the scriptures you are to be acquitted, and by the scriptures you are
          to be condemned at the last day.

          But perhaps you have no taste for this despised book; perhaps plays,
          romances, and books of polite entertainment, suit your taste better:
          if this be your case, give me leave to tell you, your taste is
          vitiated [corrupted, depraved], and unless corrected by the Spirit and
          word of God, you shall never enter into his heavenly kingdom: for
          unless you delight in God here, how will you be made meet to dwell
          with him hereafter. Is it a sin then, you will say, to read useless
          impertinent books; I answer, Yes. And that for the same reason, as it
          is a sin to indulge useless conversation, because both immediately
          tend to grieve and quench that Spirit, by which alone we can be sealed
          to the day of redemption. You may reply, How shall we know this? Why,
          put in practice the precept in the text; search the scripture in the
          manner that has been recommended, and then you will be convinced of
          the danger, sinfulness, and unsatisfacteriness of reading any others
          than the book of God, or such as are wrote in the same spirit. You
          will then say, when I was a child, and ignorant of the excellency of
          the word of God, I read what the world calls harmless books, as other
          children in knowledge, though old in years, have done, and still do;
          but now I have tasted the good word of life, and am come to a more
          perfect knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, I put away these childish,
          trifling things, and am determined to read no other books but what
          lead me to a knowledge of myself and of Christ Jesus.

          Search, therefore, the scriptures, my dear brethren; taste and see how
          good the word of God is, and then you will never leave that heavenly
          manna, that angel's food, to feed on dry husks, that light bread,
          those trifling, sinful compositions, in which men of false taste
          delight themselves: no, you will then disdain such poor entertainment,
          and blush that yourselves once were fond of it. The word of God will
          then be sweeter to you than honey, and the honey-comb, and dearer than
          gold and silver; your souls by reading it, will be filled as it were,
          with marrow and fatness, and your hearts insensibly molded into the
          spirit of its blessed Author. In short, you will be guided by God's
          wisdom here, and conducted by the light of his divine word into glory
          hereafter.<br />
