          Luke 9:23 -- "And he said unto them all, if any man will come after
          me, let him deny himself."
        </p>
        <p>
          Whoever reads the gospel with a single eye, and sincere intentions,
          will find, that our blessed Lord took all opportunities of reminding
          his disciples that his kingdom was not of this world; that his
          doctrine was a doctrine of the cross; and that their professing
          themselves to be his followers, would call them to a constant state of
          voluntary suffering and self-denial.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words of the text afford us one instance, among many, of our
          savior's behavior in this matter: for having in the preceding verses
          revealed himself to Peter, and the other apostles, to be "The Christ
          of God;" lest they should be too much elated with such a peculiar
          discovery of his deity, or think that their relation to so great a
          personage would be attended with nothing but pomp and grandeur, he
          tells then, in the 22nd verse, that "the son of man was to suffer many
          things," in this world, though he was to be crowned with eternal glory
          and honor in the next: and that if any of them or their posterity
          would share in the same honor, they must bear a part with him in his
          self-denial and sufferings. For "He said unto them all, if any man
          will come after me, let him deny himself."
        </p>
        <p>From which words I shall consider these three things:</p>
        <p>
          I. First, The nature of the self-denial recommended in the text; and
          in how many respects we must deny ourselves, in order to come after
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, I shall endeavor to prove the universality and
          reasonableness of this duty of self-denial.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, I shall offer some considerations, which may serve as so
          man motives to reconcile us to, and quicken us in, the practice of
          this self-denial.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, I am to show you the nature of the self-denial recommended
          in the text; or in how many respects we must deny ourselves in order
          to follow Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now as the faculties of the soul are distinguished by the
          understanding, will and affections; so in all these must each of us
          deny himself. We must not lean to our own understanding, being wise in
          our own eyes, and prudent in our own sight; but we must submit our
          short-sighted reason to the light of divine revelation. There are
          mysteries in religion, which are above, though not contrary to our
          natural reason: and therefore we shall never become Christians unless
          we call down imaginations, "and every high thing that exalteth itself
          against the knowledge of God, and bring into captivity every thought
          to the obedience of Christ." It is in this respect, as well as others,
          that we must become fools for Christ's sake, and acknowledge we know
          nothing without revelation, as we ought to know. We must, with all
          humility and reverence, embrace the truths revealed to us in the holy
          scriptures; for thus only can we become truly wise, even "Wise unto
          salvation." It was matter of our blessed Lord's thanksgiving to his
          heavenly father, that he had "hidden these things from the wise and
          prudent, and had revealed them unto babes." And in this respect also
          we must "be converted and become as little children," teachable, and
          willing to follow the Lamb into whatsoever mysteries he shall be
          pleased to lead us; and believe and practice all divine truths, not
          because we can demonstrate them, but because God, "who cannot lie,"
          has revealed them to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence then we may trace infidelity to its fountain head; for it is
          nothing else, but a pride of the understanding, an unwillingness to
          submit to the truths of God, that makes so many, professing themselves
          wise, to become such fools as to deny the Lord, who has so dearly
          bought them; and dispute the divinity of that eternal Word, "in whom
          they live, and move, and have their being:" Whereby it is justly to be
          feared, they will bring upon themselves sure, if not swift
          destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, as we must deny ourselves in our understandings, so must we deny,
          or, as it might be more properly rendered, renounce our wills; that
          is, we must make our own wills no principle of action, but "whether we
          eat or drink, or whatsoever we do, we must do all, (not merely to
          please ourselves, but) to the glory of God." Not that we are therefore
          to imagine we are to have no pleasure in any thing we do: "Wisdom's
          ways are ways of pleasantness;" but pleasing ourselves must not be the
          principal, but only the subordinate end of our actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I cannot but particularly press this doctrine upon you, because it
          is the grand secret of our holy religion. It is this, my brethren,
          that distinguishes the true Christian from the mere moralist and
          formal professor; and without which none of our actions are acceptable
          in God's sight: For "if thine eye be single," says our blessed Lord,
          Matthew 6:22, that is, if thou aimest simply to please God, without
          any regard to thy own will, "thy whole body, (or all thy actions) will
          be full of light;" agreeable to the gospel, which is called light:
          "But if thine eye be evil, (if thine intention be diverted any other
          way) thy whole body, (all thy actions) will be full of darkness,"
          sinful and unprofitable, we must not only do the will of God, but do
          it because it is his will; since we pray that "God's will may be done
          on earth as it is in heaven." And no doubt, the blessed angels not
          only do every thing that God willeth, but do it cheerfully, out of
          this principle, because God willeth it: And if we would live as we
          pray, we must go and do likewise.
        </p>
        <p>
          But farther, as we must renounce our wills in doing, so likewise must
          we renounce them in suffering the will of God. Whatsoever befalls us,
          we must say with good old Eli, "It is the Lord, let him do what
          seemeth him good;": or with one that was infinitely greater than Eli,
          "Father, not my will, but thine be done." O Jesus, thine was an
          innocent will, and yet thou renouncedst it. Teach us, even us also, O
          our Savior! To submit our wills to thine, in all the evils which shall
          be brought upon us; and in every thing enable us to give thanks, since
          it is thy blessed will concerning us!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, we must deny ourselves, as in our understandings and wills,
          so likewise in our affections. More particularly, we must deny
          ourselves the pleasurable indulgence and self-enjoyment of riches: "If
          any man will come after me, he must forsake all and follow me." And
          again (to show the utter inconsistency of the love of the things of
          this world with the love of the Father) he tells us, "unless a man
          forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple."
        </p>
        <p>
          Far be it from me to think that these texts are to be taken in a
          literal sense; as though they obliged rich persons to go sell all that
          they have and give to the poor, (for that would put it out of their
          power to be serviceable to the poor for the future) but however, they
          certainly imply thus much, that we are to sit loose to, sell and
          forsake all in affection, and be willing to part with every thing,
          when God shall require it at our hands: that is, as the apostle
          observes, we must "use the world as though we used it not;" and though
          we are in the world, we must not be of it. We must look upon ourselves
          as stewards, and not proprietors, of the manifold gifts of God;
          provide first what is necessary for ourselves and for our households,
          and expend the rest, not in indulgencies and superfluous ornaments,
          forbidden by the apostle, but in clothing, feeding, and relieving the
          naked, hungry, distressed disciples of Jesus Christ. This is what our
          blessed Lord would have us understand by forsaking all, and in this
          sense must each of us deny himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sensible that this will seem an hard saying to may, who will be
          offended because they are covetous, and "lovers of pleasure more than
          lovers of God;" but if I yet pleased such men, I should not be the
          servant of Christ. No, we must not, like Ahab's false prophets, have a
          lying spirit in our mouths, but declare faithfully the whole will of
          God; and like honest Micajah out of pity and compassion, tell men the
          truth, though they may falsely think we prophecy not good but evil
          concerning them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to proceed: As we must renounce our affection for riches, so
          likewise our affections for relations, when they stand in opposition
          to our love of, and duty to God: For thus saith the Savior of the
          world: "If any man will come after me, and hateth not his father and
          mother, his children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life
          also, he cannot be my disciple." Strange doctrine this! What, hate our
          own flesh! What, hate the father that begat us, the mother that bare
          us! How can these things be? Can God contradict himself? Has he not
          bid us to honor our father and mother? And yet we are here commanded
          to hate them. How can these truths be reconciled? By interpreting the
          word hate, not in a rigorous and absolute sense, but comparatively:
          not as implying a total alienation, but a less degree of affection.
          For thus our blessed Savior himself (the best and purest expositor of
          his own meaning) explains it in a parallel text, Matthew 10:37, "He
          that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; He
          that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me." So
          that when the persuasions of our friends (as for our trial they may be
          permitted to be) are contrary to the will of God, we must say with
          Levi, "we have not know them;" or, agreeably to our blessed Lord's
          rebuke to Peter, "Get you behind me, my adversaries; for you favor not
          the things that be of God, but the things that be of man."
        </p>
        <p>
          Farther, we must deny ourselves in things indifferent; for it might
          easily be shown, that as many, if not more, perish by an immoderate
          use of things in themselves indifferent, as by any gross sin whatever.
          A prudent Christian therefore, will consider not only what is lawful,
          but what is expedient also: not so much what degrees of self-denial
          best suit his inclinations here, as what will most effectually break
          his will, and fit him for greater degrees of glory hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, To conclude this head, we must renounce our own righteousness:
          For, though we should give all our goods to feed the poor, and our
          bodies to be burned, yet, if we in the least depend on that, and do
          not wholly rely on the perfect all sufficient righteousness of Jesus
          Christ, it will profit us nothing. "Christ is the end of the law for
          righteousness to every one that believeth." We are complete in him,
          and him only. Our own righteousnesses are but as filthy rags. We must
          count all things but dung and dross, so that we may be found in him,
          not having our own righteousness, but the righteousness which is of
          God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          And is this the doctrine of Christianity? Is not the Christian world
          then asleep? If not, whence so much self-righteousness, whence the
          self-indulgence, whence the reigning love of riches which we every
          where meet with? Above all, whence that predominant greediness after
          sensual pleasure, that has so over-run this sinful nation, that was a
          pious stranger to come amongst us, he would be tempted to think some
          heathen Venus was worshipped here, and that temples were dedicated to
          her service. But we have the authority of an inspired apostle to
          affirm, that they who live in a round of pleasure, "are dead while
          they live." Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, "Awake thou that
          sleepeth, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light."
          But the power of raising the spiritually dead belongeth only unto God.
          Do thou therefore, O Holy Jesus, who by thy almighty word commandest
          Lazarus to come forth, though he had lain in the grave some days,
          speak also as effectually to these spiritually dead souls, whom Satan
          for many years hath so fast bound by sensual pleasures, that they are
          not so much as able to lift up their eyes or hearts to heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But I pass on to the second general thing proposed, to consider
          the universal obligation and reasonableness of this doctrine of
          self-denial.
        </p>
        <p>
          When our blessed master had been discoursing publicly concerning the
          watchfulness of the faithful and wise steward, his disciples asked
          him, "Speakest thou this parable to all, or only to us?" The same
          question I am aware has been, and will be put concerning the foregoing
          doctrine: for too many, unwilling to take Christ's easy yoke upon
          them, in order to evade the force of the gospel precepts, would
          pretend that all those commands concerning self-denial, and renouncing
          ourselves and the world, belonged to our Lord's first and immediate
          followers, and not to us or to our children. But such persons greatly
          err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of godliness in their
          hearts. For the doctrine of Jesus Christ, like his blesses self, is
          "the same yesterday, today, and for ever." What he said unto one, he
          said unto all, even unto the ends of the world; "If any man will come
          after me, let him deny himself:" and in the text it is particularly
          mentioned that he said it unto them all. And lest we should still
          absurdly imagine that this word all was to be confined to his
          apostles, with whom he was then discoursing, it is said in another
          place, that Jesus turned unto the multitude and said, "If any man will
          come after me, and hateth not his father and mother, yea and his own
          life also, he cannot be my disciple." When our blessed Lord had spoken
          a certain parable, it is said, "the scribes and Pharisees were
          offended, for they knew the parable was spoken against them:" and if
          Christians can now read these plain and positive texts of scripture,
          and at the same time not think they are spoken of them, they are more
          hardened than Jews, and more insincere than Pharisees.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the former part of this discourse I observed, that the precepts
          concerning forsaking and selling all, did not oblige us in a literal
          sense, because the state of the church does not demand it of us, as it
          did of the primitive Christians; but still the same deadness to the
          world, the same abstemious use of, and readiness to part with or goods
          for Christ's sake, is as absolutely necessary for, and as obligatory
          on us, as it was on them. For though the church may differ as to the
          outward state of it, in different ages, yet as to the purity of its
          inward state, it was, is, and always will be invariably the same. And
          all the commands which we meet with in the epistles about "mortifying
          our members which are upon the earth, of setting our affections on
          things above, and of not being conformed to this world;" are but so
          many incontestable proofs that the same holiness, heavenly-mindedness,
          and deadness to the world, is as necessary for us, as for our Lord's
          immediate followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But farther, as such an objection argues an ignorance of the
          scriptures, so it is a manifest proof, that such as make it are
          strangers to the power of godliness in their hearts. For since the
          form and substance of religion consists in recovery from our fallen
          estate in Adam, by a new birth in Christ Jesus, there is an absolute
          necessity for us to embrace and practice the self-denial before spoken
          of. If we are alive unto God, we shall be dead to ourselves and the
          world. If all things belonging to the spirit live and grow in us, all
          things belonging to the old man must die in us. We must mourn before
          we are comforted, and receive the spirit of bondage before we are
          blessed with the unspeakable privilege of the spirit of adoption, and
          with a full assurance of faith can say, "Abba, Father."
        </p>
        <p>
          Were we indeed in a state of innocence, and had we, like Adam before
          his fall, the divine image fully stamped upon our souls, we then
          should have no need of self-denial; but since we are fallen, sickly,
          disordered, self-righteous creatures, we must necessarily deny
          ourselves (and count it our privilege to do so) ere we can follow
          Jesus Christ to glory. To reject such a salutary practice on account
          of the difficulty attending it at first, is but too like the obstinacy
          of a perverse sick child, who nauseates and refuses the portion
          reached out to it by a skillful physician or a tender parent, because
          it is a little ungrateful to the taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had any of us seen Lazarus when he lay full of sores at the rich man's
          gate; or Job when he was smitten with ulcers, from the crown of his
          head to the sole of his foot: And had we at the same time prescribed
          to them some healing medicines, which, because they might put them to
          pain, they would not apply to their wounds, should we not most justly
          think, that they were either fond of a distempered body, or were not
          sensible of their distempers? But our souls, by nature, are in an
          infinitely more deplorable condition than the bodies of Job or
          Lazarus, when full of ulcers and boils: for, alas! "our whole head is
          sick, and our whole heart faint, from the crown of the head to the
          sold of the foot, we are full of wounds and bruises and putrifying
          sores, and there is no health in us." And if we are unwilling to deny
          ourselves, and come after Jesus Christ in order to be cured, it is a
          sign we are not sensible of the wretchedness of our state, and that we
          are not truly made whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even Naaman's servants could say, when he refused (pursuant to
          Elisha's orders) to wash in the river Jordan, that he might cure his
          leprosy, "Father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing,
          wouldst thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he saith to
          thee, wash and be clean?" And may not I very properly address myself
          to you in the same manner, my brethren? If Jesus Christ, our great
          prophet, had bid you to do some far more difficult thing, would you
          not have done it? Much more then should you do it, when he only bids
          you deny yourselves what would certainly hurt you if indulged in, and
          he will give you a crown of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to illustrate this by another comparison: In the 12th chapter of
          the Acts, we read, that "St. Peter was kept in prison, and was
          sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. And behold an
          angel of the Lord came upon him, and smote Peter on the side, saying,
          arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands." But had
          this great apostle, instead of rising up quickly, and doing as the
          blessed angel commanded him, hugged his chains and begged that they
          might not be let fall from his hands, would not any one think that he
          was in love with slavery, and deserved to be executed next morning?
          And does not the person who refuses to deny himself, act as
          inconsistently, as this apostle would have done if he had neglected
          the means of his deliverance? For our souls, by nature, are in a
          spiritual dungeon, sleeping and fast bound between the world, the
          flesh, and the devil, not with two but ten thousand chains of lusts
          and corruptions. Now Jesus Christ, like St. Peter's good angel, by the
          power of his gospel comes and opens the prison door, and bids us "deny
          ourselves and follow him." But if we do not arise, gird up the loins
          of our mind and follow him, are we not in love with bondage, and to we
          not deserve never to be delivered from it?

          Indeed, I will not affirm that this doctrine of self-denial appears in
          this just light to every one. No, I am sensible that to the natural
          man it is foolishness, and to the young convert an hard saying. But
          what says our Savior? "If any man will do my will, he shall know the
          doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." This,
          my dear friends, is the best, the only way of conviction. Let us up
          and be doing; let us arise quickly, and deny ourselves, and the Lord
          Jesus will remove those scales from the eyes of our minds, which now,
          like so many veils, hinder us from seeing clearly the reasonableness,
          necessity, and inexpressible advantage of the doctrine that has been
          delivered. Let us but once thus show ourselves men, and then the
          spirit of God will move on the face of our souls, as he did once upon
          the face of the great deep; and cause them to emerge out of that
          confused chaos, in which they are most certainly now involved, if we
          are strangers and enemies to self-denial and the cross of Christ.
        </p>

          III. Proceed we therefore now to the third and last general thing
          proposed, to offer some considerations, which may serve as so many
          motives to reconcile us to, and quicken us in, the practice of this
          duty of self- denial.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. And the first means I shall recommend to you, in order to reconcile
          you to this doctrine, is, to meditate frequently on the life of our
          blessed Lord and Master Jesus Christ. Follow him from his cradle to
          the cross, and see what a self-denying life he led! And shall not we
          drink of the cup that he drank of, and be baptized with the baptism
          that he was baptized with? Or think we, that Jesus Christ did and
          suffered everything in order to have us excused and exempted from
          sufferings? No, far be it from any sincere Christian to judge after
          this manner: for St. Peter tells us, "He suffered for us, leaving us
          an example that we should follow his steps." Had Christ, indeed, like
          those that sat in Moses' chair, laid heavy burdens of self- denial
          upon us, (supposing they were heavy, which they are not) and refused
          to touch them himself with one of his fingers; we might have had some
          pretense to complain: But since he has enjoined us nothing, but what
          he first put in practice himself, thou art inexcusable, O disciple,
          whoever thou art, who wouldst be above thy persecuted self-denying
          master: And thou art no good and faithful servant, who art unwilling
          to suffer and sympathize with thy mortified, heavenly-minded Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Next to the pattern of our blessed master, think often on the lives
          of the glorious company of the apostles, the goodly fellowship of the
          prophets, and the noble army of martyrs; who by a constant looking to
          the author and finisher of our faith, have fought the good fight, and
          are gone before us to inherit the promises. View again and again, how
          holily, how self-denyingly, how unblameably they lived: And if
          self-denial was necessary for them, why not for us also? Are we not
          men of lie passions with them? Do we not live in the same wicked world
          as they did? Have we not the same good spirit to assist, support, and
          purify us, as they had? And is not the same eternal inheritance
          reached out to us, as was to them? And if we have the same nature to
          change, the same wicked world to withstand, the same good spirit to
          help, and the same eternal crown at the end; why should not we lead
          the same lives as they did? Do we think they did works of
          supererogation? If not, why do not we do as they did? Or why does your
          own church set apart festivals to commemorate the deaths and
          sufferings of the saints, but in order to excite you to follow them as
          they did Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Thirdly, Think often on the pains of hell; consider, whether it is
          not better to cut off a right hand or foot, and pull our a right eye,
          if they offend us (our cause us to sin) "rather than to be cast into
          hell, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." Think
          how many thousands there are now reserved with damned spirits in
          chains of darkness unto the judgment of the great day. And think
          withal, that this, this must be our case shortly, unless we are wise
          in time, deny ourselves, and follow Jesus Christ. Think you, they now
          imagine Jesus Christ to be an hard master; or rather think you not,
          they would give ten thousand times ten thousand worlds, could they but
          return to life again, and take Christ's easy yoke upon them? And can
          we dwell with everlasting burnings more than they? No, if we cannot
          bear this precept, deny yourselves, take up your crosses; how shall we
          bear the irrevocable sentence, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into
          everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels?" But I hope
          those, amongst whom I am now preaching the kingdom of God, are not so
          disingenuous as to need to be driven to their duty by the terrors of
          the Lord, but rather desire to be drawn by the cords of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, Therefore, often meditate on the joys of heaven: think, think
          with what unspeakable glory those happy souls are now encircled, who
          when on earth were called to deny themselves as well as we, and were
          not disobedient to that call: Lift up your hearts frequently towards
          the mansions of eternal bliss, and with an eye of faith, like Stephen,
          see the heavens opened, and the Son of man with his glorious retinue
          of departed saints, sitting and solacing themselves in eternal joys.
          Hark! Methinks I hear them chanting forth their everlasting
          Hallelujahs, and echoing triumphant songs of joy. And do you not long,
          my brethren, to join this heavenly choir? Do not your hearts burn
          within you? As the hart panteth after the water brooks, do not your
          souls so long after the blessed company of these sons of God? Behold
          then a heavenly ladder reached down to you, by which you may climb to
          this holy hill. Let us believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and deny
          ourselves! By this alone, every saint that ever lived ascended into
          the joy of their Lord. And then, we, even we also shall ere long be
          lifted up into the same most blissful regions, there to enjoy an
          eternal rest with the people of God, and join with them in singing
          doxologies and songs of praise, to the everlasting, blessed,
          all-glorious, most adorable Trinity, for ever and ever.
