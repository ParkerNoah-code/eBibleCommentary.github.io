          Matthew 11:28 -- "Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden,
          and I will give you rest."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing is more generally known than our duties which belong to
          Christianity; and yet, how amazing is it, nothing is less practiced?
          There is much of it in name and show, but little of it in the heart
          and conversation; indeed, if going to church, and to the sacrament,
          or, if our being called after the name of Christ, and being baptized
          into that name; if that will make us Christians, I believe all of us
          would have a claim thereto: but if it consists in the heart, that
          there must be an inward principle wrought in us by faith; that there
          must be a change of the whole nature, a putting off the old man with
          his deeds, a turning from sin unto God, a cleaving only unto the Son
          of Righteousness; and that there must be a new birth, and we
          experience the pangs thereof; and that you must feel yourselves weary
          and heavy laden with your sins, before you will seek for deliverance
          from them; if this is to be the case, if there is so much in being
          children of God, alas! how many who please themselves with an outside
          show, a name to live whilst they are dead; and how few that have any
          share in this spiritual state, in this true and living name? How few
          are they who are weary and heavy laden with their sins, and seek to
          Christ for rest? They say, in a formal customary manner, we are
          sinners, and there is no health in us; but how few feel themselves
          sinners, and are so oppressed in their own spirits, that they have no
          quiet nor rest in them, because of the burden of their sins, and the
          weight that is fallen and lays on their minds?
        </p>
        <p>
          Under these burdens, these heavy burdens, they are at a loss what to
          do whereby they may obtain rest; they fly to their works, they go to a
          minister, and he tells them to read, to pray, and meditate, and take
          the sacrament: thus they go away, and read, and pray, and meditate
          almost without ceasing, and never neglect the sacrament whenever there
          is an opportunity for the taking of it. Well, when the poor soul has
          done all this, it still finds no ease, there is yet no relief. Well,
          what must you do then? To lie still under the burden they cannot, and
          to get rid of it then cannot. O what must the burdened soul do! Why,
          goes to the clergyman again, and tells him the case, and what it has
          done, and that it is no better. Well, he asks, have you given alms to
          the poor? Why no. Then go and do that, and you will find rest. Thus
          the poor sinner is hurried from duty to duty, and still finds no rest:
          all things are uneasy and disquiet within, and there remains no rest
          in the soul. And if it was to go through all the duties of religion,
          and read over a thousand manuals of prayers, none would ever give the
          soul any rest; nothing will, until it goes to the Lord Jesus Christ,
          for there is the only true rest; that is the rest which abideth, and
          will continue for ever. It is not in your own works, nor in your
          endeavors: no; when Christ comes into your souls, he pardons you,
          without any respect to your works, either past, present, or to come.
        </p>
        <p>From the words, my brethren, I have now read, I shall</p>
        <p>I. Show you who are the weary and heavy laden.</p>
        <p>II. Inquire what is meant by coming to Christ. And,</p>
        <p>
          III. Conclude with exhorting you to accept of the invitation which the
          Lord Jesus Christ gives unto you to come unto him, with the assurance
          of finding rest.
        </p>
        <p>First, I am to show you, who are the weary and heavy-laden.</p>
        <p>
          And here it will be necessary to consider who are not; and then, to
          consider who they are that are really so.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Those who think themselves good enough, and are pleased that they
          are not so bad as others, these are not weary or heavy laden.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, these Pharisees are not thus troubled; they laugh and jest at
          those who talk of feeling their sins, and think there is no occasion
          to make so much ado about religion: it is to be righteous over-much,
          and the means to destroy yourselves. They think if they do but mean
          well, and say their prayers, as they call them, it is sufficient:
          though they may say a prayer, yea, thousands of prayers, and all the
          while be only offering up the sacrifice of fools. They may call God,
          Father, every day, when it is only mocking of God, and offering up
          false fire unto him; and it would be just for him to serve them, as he
          did Nadab and Abihu, destroy them, cut them off from the face of the
          earth: but he is waiting to be gracious, and willing to try a little
          longer, whether you will bring forth any thing more than the leaven of
          an outward profession, which is not all that the Lord requires; no, he
          wants the heart; and unless you honor him with that, he does not
          regard your mouths, when the other is far from him. You may say over
          your prayers all your lives, and yet you may never pray over one:
          therefore, while you flatter yourselves you are good enough, and that
          you are in a state of salvation, you are only deceiving you own souls,
          and hastening on your own destruction. Come unto him, not as being
          good enough, but as vile sinners, as poor, and blind, and naked, and
          miserable, and then Jesus will have compassion.
        </p>
        <p>
          O ye Pharisees, what fruits do ye bring forth? Why, you are moral,
          polite creatures; you do your endeavors, you do what you can, and so
          Jesus is to make up the rest. You esteem yourselves fine, rational,
          and polite beings, and think it is too unfashionable to pray; it is
          not polite enough: perhaps you have read some prayers, but knew not
          how to pray from your hearts; no, by no means: that was being
          righteous over-much indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when once you are sensible of your being lost, damned creatures,
          and see hell gaping ready to receive you: if God was but to cut the
          thread of life, O then, then you would cry earnestly unto the Lord to
          receive you, to open the door of mercy unto you; your bones would then
          be changed, you would no more flatter yourselves with your abilities
          and good wishes; no, you would see how unable you were, how incapable
          to save yourselves; that there is no fitness, no free will in you; no
          fitness, but for eternal damnation, no free will but that of doing
          evil; and that when you would do good, evil is present with you, and
          the thing that ye would not, that do ye. He knows the secret intent of
          every heart; and this is a pleasure to you, my dear brethren, who come
          on purpose to meet with him, though it be a field. And, however some
          may esteem me a mountebank, and an enthusiast, one that is only going
          to make you methodically mad; they may breathe out their invectives
          against me, yet Christ knows all; he takes notice of it, and I shall
          leave it to him to plead my cause, for he is a gracious Master: I have
          already found him so, and am sure he will continue so. Vengeance is
          his, and he will repay it. Let them revile me; let them cast me out of
          their synagogues, and have my name in reproach, I shall not answer
          them by reviling again, or in speaking evil against them: no, that is
          not the Spirit of Christ, but meekness, patience, long-suffering,
          kindness, &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ye Pharisees, who are going about to establish your own righteousness;
          you, who are too polite to follow the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity
          and truth; you, who are all for a little show, a little outside work;
          who lead moral, civil, decent lives, Christ will not know you at the
          great day, but will say unto you, O ye Pharisees, was there any place
          for me in your love? Alas! you are full of anger and malice, and
          self-will; yet you pretended to love and serve me, and to be my
          people: but, however, I despise you; I, who am God, and knoweth the
          secret of all hearts; I, who am truth itself, the faithful and true
          witness, say unto you, "Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity, into
          that place of torment, prepared for the devil and his angels." Good
          God! And must these discreet polite creatures, who never did any one
          harm, but led such civil, decent lives, must they suffer the vengeance
          of eternal fire? Cannot their righteous souls be saved? Where then
          must the sinner and the ungodly appear? Where wilt thou, O Sabbath-
          breaker, appear, thou, who canst take thy pleasure, thy recreation, on
          the Lord's-day, who refuseth to hear the word of God, who wilt not
          come to church to be instructed in the ways of the Lord? Where will
          you, O ye adulterers, fornicators, and such-like of this generation
          appear? Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge, and them he will
          condemn. Then you will not call these tricks of youth: no, but you
          will call on the rocks and the mountains to fall on you, to hide you
          from the fury and anger of the Lord. Where wilt thou, O man, appear,
          that takes pleasure in making a mock of sin, who despiseth all
          reproof, who throws about thy jests as a madman does fire, and asks
          whether thou art not in sport? Where wilt thou, O man, appear, that
          makes it thy business to preach against the children of the Most High;
          thou, who art inventing methods in order to stop the progress of the
          gospel, and using thy utmost power to quash [squash] the preaching
          thereof; who art raising of evil reports against the disciple of
          Christ, and esteemest them madmen, fools, schismatics, and a parcel of
          rabble? Thou, O man, with all thy letter-learning, wilt surely see the
          judgment seat of Christ, though, perhaps, sorely against your will; to
          be cast by him into eternal fire, a place prepared for the devil and
          his angels. There is a burning tophet kindled by the fury of an
          avenging God, which will never, never be quenched. The devil longs to
          embrace you in his hellish arms, whenever the sentence is past, where
          you must for ever bear the weight of your sin: there is no redemption
          then; the day of grace is past; the door of hope is shut; mercy will
          be no more offered, but you must be shut out from God for ever. O who
          can dwell with everlasting burnings!
        </p>
        <p>
          However you may think of hell, indeed it is not a painted fire; it is
          not an imagination to keep people in awe: then, then you will feel the
          power of the almighty arm. If you will not lay hold on his golden
          scepter, he will break you with his iron rod. O ye Pharisees, who are
          now so good, so much better than others, how will ye stand before
          Christ, when dressed in his glory as judge? You Arians, may now
          despise his divinity; then you shall have a proof of it; he will show,
          that he has all power, and that he was no subordinate God; he will
          show you that he has all power in heaven and earth; that he was King
          of kings, and Lord of lords; that he was the mighty God, the
          everlasting Father; and this power that he has, he will exercise in
          preserving you to no other end, but to punish you forever. Thus you,
          who please yourselves with being good enough now, who are not weary
          and heavy laden with a sense of your sins here, will be weary and
          heavy laden with a sense of your punishment hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Those, my brethren, are not weary and heavy laden with a sense of
          their sins, who can delight themselves in the polite entertainments of
          the age, and follow the sinful diversion of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now they can go to balls and assemblies, play-houses and horse-racing;
          they have no thought of their sins; they know not what it is to weep
          for sin, or humble themselves under the mighty hand of God; they can
          laugh away their sorrows, and sing away their cares, and drive away
          these melancholy thoughts: they are too polite to entertain any sad
          thoughts; the talk of death and judgment is irksome to them, because
          it damps their mirth; they could not endure to think of their sin and
          danger; they could not go to a play, and think of hell; they could not
          go quietly to a masquerade, and think of their danger; they could not
          go to a ball or an assembly in peace, if they thought of their sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so it is proved, even to a demonstration, that these are not weary
          and heavy laden: for if they are not thoughtful about their sins, they
          will never be weary and heavy laden of them. But at the day of
          judgment all will be over; they shall lose all their carnal mirth, all
          their pleasure, all their delight will be gone forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          They will say then of their laughter, it is mad; and of mirth, What
          dost thou? Their merry conceits, and witty jests against the poor
          despised people of God, are then over. Their mirth was but as the
          crackling of thorns under a pot; it made a great blaze and unseemly
          noise for a while, but it was presently gone, and will return no more.
        </p>
        <p>
          They think now, that if they were to fast or to pray, and meditate and
          mourn, they should be righteous over-much, and destroy themselves;
          their lives would be a continual trouble, and it would make them run
          mad. Alas, my brethren, what misery must that life be, where there is
          no more pleasant days, no more balls or plays, no cards or dice, those
          wasters of precious time, no horse-racing and cock-fighting, from
          whence no good ever came, unless abusing God Almighty's creatures, and
          putting them to that use which he never designed them, can be called
          so. How miserable will your life be, when all your joys are over, when
          your pleasures are all past, and no more mirth or pastime? Do you
          think there is one merry heart in hell? One pleasing countenance? Or
          jesting, scoffing, swearing tongue? A sermon now is irksome; the offer
          of salvation, by the blood of Jesus Christ, is now termed enthusiasm;
          but then you would give thousands of worlds, if in your power, for one
          tender of mercy, for one offer of grace, which now you so much
          despise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, you are not weary of your diversions, nor are you heavy laden
          with the sins, with which they are accompanied; but then you will be
          weary of your punishment, and the aggravation which attends it. Your
          cards and dice, your hawks and hounds, and bowls, and your pleasant
          sports, will then be over. What mirth will you have in remembering
          your sports and diversions? I would not have you mistake me, and say,
          I am only preaching death and damnation to you; I am only showing you
          what will be the consequence of continuing in these sinful pleasures;
          and if the devil does not hurry you away with half a sermon, I shall
          show you how to avoid these dangers, which I now preach up as the
          effect of sin unrepented of. I mention this, lest you should be
          hurried away by the devil: but be not offended, if I point our unto
          you more of the terrors which will attend your following these polite
          and fashionable entertainments of the present age, and of not being
          weary and heavy laden with a sense of your sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          They who delight in drinking wine to excess, and who are drunkards,
          what bitter draughts will they have instead of wine and ale? The heat
          of lust will be then also abated; they will no more sing the song of
          the drunkard; no more spend their time in courting their mistresses,
          in lascivious discourse, in amorous songs, in wanton dalliances, in
          brutish defilements: no, these are all over; and it will but prick
          each other to the heart to look one another in the face. Then they
          will wish, that instead of sinning together, they had prayed together;
          had frequented religious societies; had stirred up each other to love
          and holiness, and endeavored to convince each other of the evil of
          sin, and how obnoxious they are to the wrath of God; and the necessity
          of being weary and heavy laden with a sense thereof; that they might
          have escaped the punishment which they suffer, by their following the
          sinful an polite diversions of the age they fell into. But as it was
          against God himself they had sinned, so no less than God will punish
          them for their offenses: he hath prepared those torments for his
          enemies; his continual anger will still be devouring of them; his
          breath of indignation will kindle the flame; his wrath will be a
          continual burden to their souls. Woe be to him who falls under the
          stroke of the Almighty!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus they are not weary and heavy laden with their sins, who can
          follow the polite and fashionable entertainments of the age. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I am to show you what it is to be weary and heavy laden with
          sins. And
        </p>
        <p>
          1. You may be said, my brethren, to be weary and heavy laden, when
          your sins are grievous unto you, and it is with grief and trouble you
          commit them.
        </p>
        <p>
          You, who are awakened unto a sense of your sins, who see how hateful
          they are to God, and how they lay you open to his wrath and
          indignation, and would willingly avoid them; who hate yourselves for
          committing them; when you are thus convinced of sin, when you see the
          terrors of the law, and are afraid of his judgments; then you may be
          said to be weary of your sins. And O how terrible do they appear when
          you are first awakened to a sense of them; when you see nothing but
          the wrath of God ready to fall upon you, and you are afraid of his
          judgments! O how heavy is your sin to you then! Then you feel the
          weight thereof, and that it is grievous to be born.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. When you are obliged to cry out under the burden of your sins, and
          know not what to do for relief; when this is your case, you are weary
          of your sins. It does not consist in a weariness all of a sudden; no,
          it is the continual burden of your soul, it is your grief and concern
          that you cannot live without offending God, and sinning against him;
          and these sins are so many and so great, that you fear they will not
          be forgiven.
        </p>
        <p>I come, Secondly, to show you what is meant by coming to Christ.</p>
        <p>
          It is not, my brethren, coming with your own works: no, you must come
          in full dependence upon the Lord Jesus Christ, looking on him as the
          Lord who died to save sinners: Go to him, tell him you are lost,
          undone, miserable sinners, and that you deserve nothing but hell; and
          when you thus go to the Lord Jesus Christ out of yourself, in full
          dependence on the Lord Jesus Christ, you will find him an able and a
          willing savior; he is pleased to see sinners coming to him in a sense
          of their own unworthiness; and when their case seems to be most
          dangerous, most distressed, then the Lord in his mercy steps in and
          gives you his grace; he puts his Spirit within you, takes away your
          heart of stone, and gives you a heart of flesh. Stand not out then
          against this Lord, but go unto him, not in your own strength, but in
          the strength of Jesus Christ.
        </p>

          And this brings me, Thirdly, to consider the exhortation Christ gives
          unto all of you, high and low, rich and poor, one with another, to
          come unto him that you may have rest. And if Jesus Christ gives you
          rest, you may be sure it will be a rest indeed; it will be such a rest
          as your soul wants; it will be a rest which the world can neither give
          nor take away. O come all of ye this night, and you shall find rest:
          Jesus Christ hath promised it. Here is a gracious invitation, and do
          not let a little rain hurry you away from the hearing of it; do but
          consider what the devil and damned spirits would give to have the
          offer of mercy, and to accept of Christ, that they may be delivered
          from the torments they labor under, and must do so forever; or, how
          pleasing would this rain be to them to cool their parched tongues; but
          they are denied both, while you have mercy offered to you; free and
          rich mercy to come to Christ; here is food for your souls, and the
          rain is to bring forth the fruits of the earth, as food for you
          bodies. Here is mercy upon mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me beseech you to come unto Christ, and he will give you rest; you
          shall find rest unto your souls. O you, my weary, burdened brethren,
          do but go to Christ in this manner, and though you go to him weary,
          you shall find rest before you come from him: let not anything short
          of the Lord Jesus Christ be your rest; for wherever you seek you will
          be disappointed; but if you do but seek unto the Lord Jesus Christ,
          there you will find a fullness of every thing which your weary soul
          wants. Go to him this night; here is an invitation to all you who are
          weary souls. He does not call you, O Pharisees; not, it is only you
          weary sinners; and sure you will not stay from him, but accept of his
          invitation; do not delay; one moment may be dangerous: death may take
          you off suddenly. You know not but that a fit of the apoplexy may
          hurry you from time into eternity; therefore, be not for staying till
          you have something to bring; come in all your rags, in all your
          filthiness, in all your distresses, and you will soon find Jesus
          Christ ready to help, and to relieve you; he loves you as well in your
          rags, as in your best garments; he regards not your dress; no, do but
          come unto him, and you shall soon find rest for your souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          What say you? Shall I tell my Master you will come unto him, and that
          you will accept him on his own terms. Let me, my brethren, beseech you
          to take Jesus without anything of your own righteousness: for if you
          expect to mix anything of yourself with Christ, you build upon a sandy
          foundation; but if you take Christ for your rest, he will be that unto
          you. Let me beseech you to build upon this rock of ages. O my
          brethren, think of the gracious invitation, "Come unto me," to Jesus
          Christ; it is he that calls you; And will you not go?
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, come unto him. If your souls were not immortal, and you in
          danger of losing them, I would not thus speak unto you; but the love
          of your souls constrains me to speak: methinks this would constrain me
          to speak unto you forever. Come then by faith, and lay hold of the
          Lord Jesus; though he be in heaven, he now calleth thee. Come, all ye
          drunkards, swearers, Sabbath-breakers, adulterers, fornicators; come,
          all ye scoffers, harlots, thieves, and murderers, and Jesus Christ
          will save you; he will give you rest, if you are weary of your sins. O
          come lay hold upon him. Had I less love for your souls, I might speak
          less; but that love of God, which is shed abroad in my heart, will not
          permit me to leave you, till I see whether you will come to Christ or
          no. O for your life receive him, for fear he may never call you any
          more. Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; it may be this night the cry may
          be made. Now would you hear this, if you were sure to die before the
          morning light? God grant you may begin to live, that when the king of
          terrors shall come, you may have nothing to do but to commit your
          souls into the hands of a faithful Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, be all
          honor, praises, dominion, and power, henceforth and for evermore.
          Amen, Amen.<br />
