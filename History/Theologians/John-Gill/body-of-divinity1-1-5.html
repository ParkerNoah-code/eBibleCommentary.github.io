        <h2>
          Of the Attributes of God in General, and of His IMMUTABILITY in
          Particular.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The attributes of God are variously distinguished by divines; some
          distinguish them into negative and positive, or affirmative: the
          negative are such as remove from him whatever is imperfect in
          creatures; such are infinity, immutability, immortality, etc. which
          deny him to be finite, mutable, and mortal; and, indeed, it is easier
          to say what God is not, than what he is: the positive, or affirmative,
          are such as assert some perfection in God, which is in and of himself;
          and which in the creatures, in any measure, is from him, as wisdom,
          goodness, justice, holiness, etc. but the distinction is discarded by
          others; because in all negative attributes some positive excellency is
          found. Some distribute them into a &quot;twofold order&quot;, first
          and second: attributes, or essential properties of the &quot;first
          order&quot;, declare the essence of God as in himself, such as his
          simplicity and perfection, infinity and immutability; and attributes,
          or essential properties of the &quot;second order&quot;, which though
          primarily and properly, and naturally, and infinitely, and in a more
          excellent manner are in God, than in creatures; yet secondarily, and
          in an analogical sense, are in them, there being some similitude of
          them in them, of which there is none of the former order in them;
          these are said to be life and immortality, blessedness and glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, some attributes of God are said to be &quot;absolute&quot;, and
          others &quot;relative&quot;: absolute ones are such as eternally agree
          with the essence of God, without respect to his creatures, and are
          expressed by his names, Jehovah, Jah, etc. relative ones are such as
          agree with him in time, with some certain respect to his creatures,
          and are expressed by his being their Creator, Governor, Preserver,
          Redeemer, etc. some are called &quot;proper&quot;, as those before
          mentioned; and others &quot;figurative&quot;, signified by the parts
          of the human body, and the affections of the mind, as observed in the
          preceding chapter: but the more commonly received distinction of the
          attributes of God, is, into the &quot;communicable&quot; and
          &quot;incommunicable&quot; ones; the incommunicable attributes of God,
          are such as there is no appearance or shadow of them in creatures; as
          independence, immutability, immensity, and eternity: communicable
          ones, are such as are common to God, with men; or, however, of which
          there is some resemblance in men, as goodness, holiness, justice, and
          wisdom; yet of these it may be said, that they are incommunicable, as
          they are in God, in whom they are infinite, and cannot, as such, be
          communicated to finite creatures: none but God is essentially,
          originally, underivatively, perfectly, and infinitely good, holy,
          just, and wise. But as God is defined a &quot;Spirit&quot; in
          scripture, as has been observed, I shall endeavor to sort the
          perfections and attributes of God in agreement with that: and with
          respect to his nature, as an uncreated Spirit, may be referred,
          besides his spirituality, and simplicity, already considered, his
          immutability, and infinity, which includes his immensity, or
          omnipresence, and eternity: and with respect to it as active, and
          operative, the life of God, and his omnipotence: and with respect to
          the faculties, as a rational spirit, particularly the understanding,
          to which may belong, his omniscience, and manifold wisdom; and the
          will, under which may be considered the acts of that, and the
          sovereignty of it; and the affections, to which may be reduced, the
          love, grace, mercy, hatred, anger, patience, and long suffering of
          God: and lastly, under the notions of qualities and virtues, may be
          considered, his goodness, holiness, justice, truth, and faithfulness;
          and, as the complement of the whole, his perfection or all
          sufficiency, glory, and blessedness: and in this order I shall
          consider them. And begin with, The Immutability of God; which arises
          from, and is closely connected with his spirituality and simplicity,
          or is what agrees with him, and is necessary to him as a spiritual,
          simple and uncompounded Being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immutability is an attribute which God claims, and challenges as
          peculiar to himself; &quot;I am the Lord, I change not&quot; (Malachi
          3:6). Mutability belongs to creatures, immutability to God only;
          creatures change, but he does not: the heavens and the earth, which he
          has made, are not always the same; but &quot;he is the same
          forever&quot;: the visible heavens are often changing; they are
          sometimes serene and clear, at other times covered with clouds and
          darkness, and filled with meteors, snow, rain, hail, etc. the face of
          the earth appears different at the various seasons of the year, and is
          particularly renewed every spring: it has undergone one great change
          by a flood, and will undergo another by fire; when that, and &quot;the
          works that are therein, shall be burnt up; and the heavens, being on
          fire, shall be dissolved; and the elements shall melt with fervent
          heat&quot;; and &quot;new heavens&quot;, and &quot;a new earth&quot;,
          shall succeed (2 Peter 3:10,12,13), to which changeableness in them,
          the unchangeableness of God is opposed: &quot;All of them shall wax
          old like a garment, as a vesture shall you change them, and they shall
          be changed: but you are the same, and your years shall have no
          end&quot; (Psalm 102:25-27). The sun in the firmament, that great
          luminary, and fountain of light and heat, in allusion to which, God is
          called &quot;the Father of lights&quot;, has its parallaxes, or
          various appearances, at morning, noon, and evening; it has its risings
          and settings; and never rises and sets at the same point in the
          heavens one day in the year, but always varies a little; it is
          sometimes under clouds, and in an eclipse; but &quot;with&quot; God
          &quot;is no variableness&quot;, parallagh, or a parallax; the sun, at
          certain seasons of the year, passes from one tropic, and enters into
          another, as well as casts shades on the earth; but with God there is
          &quot;no shadow of turning&quot;, trophv, of a trope, or tropic; there
          is no mutation nor turning in him, nor shadow of any (James 1:17; Job
          23:13), the inhabitants of Heaven and earth are changeable, even the
          most excellent of them, angels and men: angels in their original
          nature and state, were subject to change, as the apostasy of many of
          them have shown; who have changed both state and place; they
          &quot;kept not their first estate, but left their own
          habitation&quot;, being obliged to the latter, because of the former;
          for sinning against God, they were hurled out of Heaven, and
          &quot;cast down to Hell, and delivered into chains of darkness, to be
          reserved unto judgment&quot; (Jude 1:6; 2 Peter 2:4), the angels which
          stood when the rest fell, are now indeed become impeccable, and are
          firmly settled in their state of integrity; but then this is owing not
          to their own nature, but to the electing grace of God, in Christ, and
          to the confirming grace of Christ, their head, who is the &quot;head
          of all principality and power&quot; (1 Timothy 5:21; Col 2:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Man, at his best estate, his estate of innocence, and integrity, was
          &quot;altogether vanity&quot;: for though not sinful, yet being
          mutable, and left to the mutability of his will, which was his vanity,
          when tempted fell into sin; and though made upright, lost the
          rectitude of his nature; though made after the image of God, soon came
          short of that glory; and though he had dominion over the creatures,
          being in honor, he abode not long, but became like those he had the
          power over; and though placed in the most delightful and fruitful spot
          in all the globe, yet, rebelling against his Maker and Benefactor, was
          driven out from thence by him; and is now a creature subject to
          innumerable changes in life; diseases of various sorts seize his body,
          and change his beauty and his strength, and death at last turns him to
          corruption and dust; he is like the changeable grass of the field;
          flourishes a while, is then cut down, and withers away; but God and
          his &quot;word endure forever&quot; the same (1 Peter 1:24, 25), good
          men are very mutable, both in their inward and outward estate: in
          spiritual affairs; in the frames of their minds, in the affections of
          their souls, in the exercise of grace, in their devotion and obedience
          to God, and worship of him: in temporal affairs; what an instance of
          mutability was Job, in his estate, in his family, and in his health
          and friends? well might he say, &quot;changes and war are against
          me&quot; (Job 10:17), and at length came to his great and last change,
          death; as all men must, even the best of men: indeed, in the future
          state, good men will be no more subject to change; their spirits will
          be made perfect, and sin no more, nor sorrow any more; and their
          bodies, when raised, will remain immortal, incorruptible, spiritual,
          powerful, and glorious; but this will be owing, not to themselves, but
          to the unchangeable grace and power of God: God only is in and of
          himself immutable; and he is unchangeable in his nature, perfections,
          and purposes, and in his love and affections to his people, and in his
          covenant, and the blessings and promises of it; and even in his
          threatenings.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In his nature and essence, being &quot;simple&quot;, and devoid of
          all composition, as has been proved: the more simple and free from
          mixture and composition anything is, the less subject to change. gold
          and silver, being the purest and freest of all metals from
          composition, are not so alterable as others: spirits, being
          uncompounded, and not consisting of parts, are not so changeable as
          bodies; and God, being an infinite and uncreated Spirit, and free from
          composition in every sense, is entirely and perfectly immutable: and
          since he is &quot;eternal&quot;, there can be no change of time with
          him; time does not belong to him, only to a creature, which is the
          measure of its duration; and began when a creature began to be, and
          not before; but God is before all creatures; they being made by him,
          and so before time; he was the same before the day was as now, and now
          as he was before; &quot;even the same today, yesterday, and
          forever&quot;: though he is &quot;the ancient of days&quot;, he does
          not become older and older; he is no older now than he was millions of
          ages ago, nor will be millions of ages to come; his eternity is an
          everlasting and unchangeable &quot;now&quot;; &quot;He is the same,
          and his years shall have no end&quot; (Psalm 102:27; Hebrews 13:8),
          and seeing he is &quot;infinite, immense, and omnipresent&quot;; there
          can be no change of place with him, for he &quot;fills Heaven and
          earth&quot; with his presence; he is everywhere, and cannot change or
          move from place to place; when therefore he is said to &quot;come
          down&quot; on earth, or to &quot;depart&quot; from men, it is not to
          be understood of local motion, or change of place; but of some
          uncommon exertion of his power, and demonstration of his presence, or
          of the withdrawment of some benefit from them: but this will be
          considered more largely under the attribute of omnipresence, in its
          proper place. God is the &quot;most perfect&quot; Being, and therefore
          can admit of no change in his nature, neither of increase nor
          decrease, of addition nor diminution; if he changes, it must be either
          for the better or the worse; if for the better, then he was imperfect
          before, and so not God: if for the worse, then he becomes imperfect;
          and the same follows: a like reasoning is used by Plato, and by
          another ancient philosopher, who asserts that God is good, impassable
          and unchangeable; for whatever is changed, says he, is either for the
          better or the worse; if for the worse, it becomes bad; and if for the
          better, it was bad at first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or if he changes from an infinitely perfect state, to another equally
          so, then there must be more infinites than one, which is a
          contradiction. Again, if any change is made in him, it must be either
          from somewhat within him, or from somewhat without him; if from
          within, he must consist of parts; there must be &quot;another&quot;
          and &quot;another&quot; in him; he must consist of act and power;
          there must be not only something active in him, to work upon him, but
          a passive power to be, wrought upon; which is contrary to his
          simplicity, already established; for, as a Jew well argues, what
          necessarily exists of itself, has no other cause by which it can be
          changed; nor that which changes, and that which is changed, cannot be
          together; for so there would be in it two, one which changes, and
          another which is changed, and so would be compound; which is
          inconsistent with the simplicity of God: if from somewhat without him,
          then there must be a superior to him, able to move and change him; but
          he is the most high God; there is none in Heaven nor in earth above
          him; he is &quot;God over all, blessed forever&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is the immutability of the divine nature to be disproved from the
          creation of the world, and all things in it; as when it is suggested,
          God, from a non-agent, became an agent, and acquired a new relation,
          that of a Creator, from whence mutability is argued: but it should be
          observed, that God had from all eternity the same creative power, and
          would have had, if he had never created anything; and when he put it
          forth in time, it was according to his unchangeable will in eternity,
          and produced no change in him; the change was in the creatures made,
          not in him the Maker; and though a relation results from hence, and
          which is real in creatures, is only nominal in the Creator, and makes
          no change in his nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is the unchangeableness of the divine nature to be disproved by
          the incarnation of Christ; for though he, a divine Person, possessed
          of the divine nature, was &quot;made flesh&quot;, or became man; the
          divine nature in him was not changed into the human nature, nor the
          human nature into the divine, nor a third nature made out of them
          both; was this the case, the divine nature would have been changeable;
          but so it was not; for as it has been commonly said, &quot;Christ
          remained what he was, and assumed what he was not&quot;; and what he
          assumed added nothing to his divine person; he was only &quot;manifest
          in the flesh&quot;; he neither received any perfection, nor
          imperfection, from the human nature; though that received dignity and
          honor by its union to him, and was adorned with the gifts and graces
          of the Spirit without measure, and is now advanced at the right hand
          of God. Nor was any change made in the divine nature by the sufferings
          of Christ; the divine nature is incapable of suffering, and is one
          reason why Christ assumed the human nature, that he might be capable
          of suffering and dying in the room and stead of his people; and though
          the Lord of life and glory was crucified, and God purchased the church
          with his own blood, and the blood of Christ is called the blood of the
          Son of God; yet he was crucified in the human nature only, and his
          blood was shed in that, to which the divine person gave virtue and
          efficacy, through its union to it; but received no change by all this.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God is unchangeable in his perfections or attributes; which, though
          they are the same with himself, his nature and essence, as has been
          observed; yet, considering them separately, they are helps to our
          better understanding of it, and serve particularly to illustrate the
          unchangeableness of it: thus, for instance, he is the same in his
          power as ever; though that has been displayed in various instances, in
          creation, providence, etc. it is not exhausted, nor in the least
          diminished; his hand is not shortened, his strength is everlasting,
          his power eternal, invariably the same: his &quot;knowledge&quot; is
          the same; his &quot;understanding is infinite&quot;, it can be neither
          increased nor lessened; the knowledge of angels and men increases
          gradually; but not so the knowledge of God, he knows no more now than
          he did from all eternity, he knew as much then as he does now; for he
          knows and sees all things together, and at once, in his vast eternal
          mind, and not one thing after another, as they appear in time; things
          past, present, and to come, are all beheld by him in one view; that
          is, which are so with respect to creatures, for with him there is no
          such consideration: his &quot;goodness&quot;, grace, and mercy, are
          immutable; though there has been such a profusion of his goodness to
          his creatures, and so many good and perfect gifts have been bestowed
          on them, it is still the same in him, without any abatement; he is
          abundant in it, and it endures continually the same: and so is his
          grace, which has been exceedingly abundant; he is as gracious and
          merciful as ever; &quot;his mercy is from everlasting to everlasting,
          to them that fear him&quot;; and his faithfulness he never suffers to
          fail; even though men believe not, he abides faithful; and the
          unbelief of men cannot make the faith or faithfulness of God without
          effect. And as he is &quot;glorious&quot; in &quot;holiness&quot;,
          that perfection never receives any tarnish, can never be sullied, but
          is always illustriously the same; there is no unrighteousness in God,
          he cannot change from holiness to unholiness, from righteousness to
          unrighteousness; he is the just one, that neither can nor will do
          iniquity; and so he is unchangeably good, and unchangeably happy, and
          immutable in every perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God is unchangeable in his purposes and decrees, there is a purpose
          for everything, and a time for that purpose; God has determined all
          that ever was, is, or shall be; all things come to pass according to
          the counsel of his will, and all his decrees are unchangeable; they
          are like the laws of the Medes and Persians, and more unalterable than
          they were; they are the mountains of brass Zechariah saw in a vision,
          from whence proceed the providences of God, and the executioners of
          them (Zechariah 6:1), called &quot;mountains&quot; because of their
          immoveableness, and mountains of &quot;brass&quot; to denote their
          greater firmness and stability: immutability is expressly spoken of
          the counsel of God (Hebrews 6:17), the purposes of God are always
          carried into execution, they are never frustrated; it is not in the
          power of men and devils to disannul them; whatever devices and counter
          workings to them may be framed and formed, they are of no avail;
          &quot;the counsel of the Lord stands forever&quot; (Psalm 33:11;
          Proverbs 19:21, 21:30; Isaiah 14:24, 27, 46:10), the purposes of God
          are &quot;within&quot; himself (Ephesians 1:9), and what is in
          himself, is himself, and he can as soon cease to be as to alter his
          mind, or change his counsels; and they are &quot;eternal&quot;
          (Ephesians 3:11) no new thoughts arise in his mind, no new resolutions
          are formed in his breast, no new decrees are made by him; his counsels
          are &quot;of old&quot;; and his purposes are called
          &quot;counsels&quot;, because designs wisely formed by men, are with
          consultation, and upon mature deliberation: and such are the decrees
          of God, they are made with the highest wisdom by him, who is wonderful
          in counsel, and excellent in working, and so are unchangeable: and
          besides, being &quot;all-knowing&quot;, he sees and declares the end
          from the beginning, and nothing unforeseen ever can appear to hinder
          the execution of his intentions and determinations; which is sometimes
          the case with men: and he is &quot;able&quot; to perform whatever he
          resolves upon; there is no lack of wisdom, nor of power in him, as
          often is in men; and he is &quot;faithful&quot; to himself, his
          purposes and decrees; his &quot;counsels of old are faithfulness and
          truth&quot;; or are truly and faithfully performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is the immutability of the decrees of God to be disproved by his
          providences, which are many and various, unsearchable and past finding
          out, and which may seem to differ from, and clash with one another;
          for all the changes in providence, whether with respect to the world
          in general, or with respect to individuals, are according to his
          unchangeable will. Job was a remarkable instance of changes in
          providence, and yet he was fully persuaded of the unchangeable will of
          God in them, and which he strongly expresses; &quot;He is in one mind,
          and who can turn him? and what his soul desires, even that he does;
          for he performs the thing that is appointed for me; and many such
          things are with him&quot; (Job 23:13, 14). Nor is it to be disproved
          by the different declarations of the will of God, what he would have
          observed and done, in the different dispensations of law and gospel.
          God, by Moses, ordered the children of Israel, to observe certain
          laws, rites, and ceremonies, until the time of reformation, and then
          there was a disannulling of them; the heavens and earth were shaken,
          that is, the whole Mosaic economy and dispensation, whereby these were
          removed and laid aside as useless, and other ordinances were fixed, to
          remain until Christ&#x27;s second coming; but then the delivery of the
          one, and the time of their continuance, and the abolition of them, and
          the settling of the other gospel ordinances to remain to the end of
          the world, were all according to the unchangeable will of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is prayer any objection to the immutability of the divine will,
          which is not to be altered by it; for when the mind of God is not
          towards a people to do them good, it cannot be turned to them by the
          most fervent and importunate prayers of those who have the greatest
          interest in him (Jeremiah 15:1), and when he bestows blessings on a
          praying people, it is not for the sake of their prayers, as if he was
          inclined and turned by them: but for his own sake, and of his own
          sovereign will and pleasure. Should it be said, to what purpose then
          is prayer? it is answered, this is the way and means God has
          appointed, for the communication of the blessings of his goodness to
          his people; for though he has purposed, provided, and promised them,
          yet he will be sought unto, to give them to them, and it is their duty
          and privilege to ask them of him; and when they are blessed with a
          spirit of prayer, it forebodes well, and looks as if God intended to
          bestow the good things asked; and which should be asked always with
          submission to the will of God, saying, &quot;not my will, but your be
          done&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God is unchangeable in his love and affections to his people;
          &quot;his love to them is from everlasting to everlasting&quot;,
          without any variation in his own heart, however different the
          manifestations of it may be to them; he ever rests in his love, and
          never alters, nothing can separate from it, he is love itself, and it
          is as unchangeable as himself, &quot;the same today, yesterday, and
          forever&quot;: the fall made no difference in it, though the special
          objects of it fell with Adam, in his transgression, into the depths of
          sin and misery; this hindered not, but God continued his love, and
          manifested it in sending his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for their
          sins, and commended it, and gave a full proof and demonstration of it,
          in the delivery of Christ to death for them, even while they were yet
          sinners: nor does the sinful state and condition they were brought
          into, and continue in from their birth to their conversion, make any
          alteration in his love; but notwithstanding that, for the great love
          with which he loves them, he &quot;quickens them when dead in
          trespasses and sins&quot;; he looks upon them in all the impurity of
          their natural state, and says to them, &quot;live&quot;; and this
          time, as it is a time of life, it is a time of open love (see Eph 2:4,
          5; Ezekiel 16:6-8; Titus 3:3-5).
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor do the hidings of God&#x27;s face from them after conversion,
          prove any change in his love to them; for though he hides his face
          from them, and forsakes them for a moment, in a little seeming wrath,
          to show his resentment at their sins, to bring them to a sense of
          them, to humble them before him, and to cause them to seek his face
          and favor; yet with great mercies he gathers them again to himself, in
          the most tender manner, and with loving-kindness, has mercy on them;
          and, for the strengthening of their faith in his love, swears he will
          not be wroth with them; and declares his loving-kindness to be more
          immoveable than hills and mountains (Isaiah 54:7-10). Afflictions are
          no evidence of a change of affections to them; though he may
          thoroughly chastise them, and, as they may think, severely, yet he
          deals with them but as children; and, like Ephraim, they are his dear
          sons and daughters, and pleasant children, in whom he takes the utmost
          complacency and delight; chastenings are rather proofs of sonship,
          than arguments against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          God&#x27;s rebukes of them are rebukes in love, and not in wrath and
          hot displeasure; though he visits their transgressions with a rod and
          stripes, he does not utterly, nor at all, take away his
          loving-kindness in Christ from them (Jeremiah 31:18, 20; Hebrews
          12:6-8; Revelation 3:19; Psalm 89:32, 33). Nor is the unchangeableness
          of the love of God to his people to be disproved by his being said to
          be angry with them, and then to turn away his anger from them (Isaiah
          12:1), for anger is not opposite to love. Jacob was angry with his
          beloved Rachel, and a father may be angry with his beloved child, and
          love him not the less. Wrath and hatred are opposed to love, which are
          never in the heart of God towards his beloved ones: besides, this is
          said after the manner of men, and according to our apprehension of
          things; the Lord doing somewhat similar to men when they are angry,
          who frown and turn away; and when God frowns in his providence, and
          deserts his people for a while, they judge he is angry, when it only
          shows his discipline at their sins, but not at their persons; and
          then, when he smiles upon them again, and manifests his pardoning
          grace and mercy, they conclude he has turned himself from the
          fierceness of his anger (Psalm 85:2, 3).
        </p>
        <p>
          5. God is unchangeable in his covenant of grace. This was made with
          Christ from everlasting, and stands fast with him; it is as immoveable
          as a rock, and can never be broken; the blessings of it are &quot;sure
          mercies&quot;, flow from the sovereign grace and mercy of God, and are
          sure and firm, being according to his unchangeable will, and are what
          he never repents of, nor revokes; and being once bestowed, are
          irreversible, and never taken away; such as are blessed with them are
          always blessed, and it is not in the power of men and devils to
          reverse them (Romans 11:29, 8:30), the promises of the covenant, which
          are gone out of his mouth and lips are unalterable; what has been said
          of purposes may be said of promises, that they were made before the
          world were, by God, that cannot lie, who is all-wise, all-knowing, and
          all-powerful, and faithful to perform them; and besides, &quot;all the
          promises are yes and amen in Christ&quot;. Nay, even God is
          unchangeable in his threatenings, he watches to bring the evil he has
          threatened, as well as the good he has promised; and he assuredly
          performs the one as the other (Daniel 9:14; Isaiah 1:20; Jeremiah
          23:20).
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is the unchangeableness of God in his word, whether in a way of
          promise or threatening, to be disproved by repentance being ascribed
          to him, which is to be taken in a limited sense, for in some sense it
          is absolutely denied of him (Numbers 23:19; 1 Samuel 15:29). When it
          is spoken of him, it is to be understood improperly and figuratively,
          after the manner of men, he doing like what men do, when they repent,
          that is, undo what they have done; as a potter, when he does not like
          a vessel he has made, breaks it to pieces: so when it repented God
          that he had made man on earth, and Saul king (Genesis 6:6; 1 Samuel
          15:11), he destroyed man from off the earth, whom he had created; and
          took away the kingdom from Saul and his family, and gave it to
          another: in doing which he did not change his mind, but his operations
          and providences, and that according to his unchangeable will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is the immutability of God, in his promises and threatenings, to
          be disproved, by observing, that the promised good, and threatened
          evil, are not always done. For it should be considered, that what is
          promised or threatened, is either absolutely and unconditionally, or
          with a condition: now that anything promised or threatened, absolutely
          and unconditionally, is not performed, must be denied; but if with a
          condition, and that condition not performed, the change will appear to
          be not in God, but in men: and in all such cases where God does not
          what he said he would do, a condition is either expressed or implied
          (see Jeremiah 18:8, 9, 10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus God promised that he would dwell in Zion, in Jerusalem, in the
          temple, and there should be his &quot;rest forever&quot; (Psalm
          132:13, 14), and the people of Israel should dwell in their land, and
          eat the good of it; but then it was provided they were obedient to
          God, and abode in his service and worship, and kept his laws and
          ordinances (Isaiah 1:19), but they failing herein, he departed from
          them, and suffered them to be carried captive: in all which there was
          a change of his dispensations, but no change of his will. He
          threatened the Ninevites with the destruction of their city within
          forty days, that is, unless they repented: they did repent, and were
          saved from ruin, God repenting of what he had threatened; which,
          though a change of his outward conduct towards them, he threatened
          them with, was no change of his will; for both their repentance, and
          their deliverance, were according to his unchangeable will (John 3:4,
          10). Nor is the case of Hezekiah any objection to the immutability of
          God; the outward declaration ordered to be made to him, was, that he
          should &quot;die and not live&quot;; as he must have done quickly,
          according to the nature of second causes, his disease being mortal;
          but the secret will of God was, that he should live &quot;fifteen
          years&quot; longer, as he did; which implies neither contradiction nor
          change: the outward declaration was made to humble Hezekiah, to set
          him a praying, and to make use of means; whereby the unchangeable will
          of God was accomplished.
