        <h2>OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</h2>
        <p>
          As what I shall say hereafter concerning God, his essence,
          perfections, persons, works, and worship, and everything relative to
          him, will be taken out of the sacred scriptures, and proved by them;
          it will be necessary, before I proceed any further, to secure the
          ground I go upon; and establish the divine authority of them; and show
          that they are a perfect, plain, and sure rule to go by; and are the
          standard of faith and practice; and to be read constantly, studied
          diligently, and consulted with on all occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the Scriptures, I understand the books of the Old and of the New
          Testament. The books of the Old Testament, are the five books of
          Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, sometimes
          called the Pentateuch. The historical books: Joshua, Judges, Ruth, the
          two books of Samuel, the two of Kings, the two of Chronicles, Ezra,
          Nehemiah, and Esther; the poetical books, Job, the Psalms, Proverbs,
          Ecclesiastes, and Solomon&#x27;s Song. The prophetic books, the larger
          Prophets: Isaiah, Jeremiah, with the Lamentations, Ezekiel, and
          Daniel; the lesser Prophets: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah,
          Nahum, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The books of the New Testament the four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark,
          Luke, and John, and the Acts of the Apostles; the fourteen Epistles of
          the Apostle Paul; one of James; two of Peter; three of John; one of
          Jude, and the Revelation. These books are commonly called Canonical
          Scripture, because they have been always received by the church into
          the canon, or rule of faith. The books of the Old Testament, by the
          Jewish church; with which entirely agree Josephus&#x27;s account of
          them, and the catalogue of them brought from the East by Melito; and
          the books of both Testaments agree with the account which Origen gives
          of them in his time, and which have always been acknowledged by the
          Christian church; and which testimony of both churches, respecting
          them, deserves our regard, and tends to corroborate their divine
          authority. Now these are the books which the apostle calls, &quot;all
          Scripture&quot;, or the whole of Scripture, said by him to be
          &quot;given by inspiration of God&quot;: which include not only the
          books of the Old Testament, which had been long in being in his time;
          but the books of the New Testament, which were all of them then
          written, excepting the book of the Revelation; since these words of
          his stand in an epistle supposed to be the last that was written by
          him; and however what is said by him is true of what might be written
          afterwards, for the uses he mentions, as well as before.
        </p>
        <p>
          From these must be excluded, as un-canonical, the books that bear the
          name of Apocrypha; which are sometimes bound up with the Bible, to the
          great scandal and disgrace of it; for though there may be some things
          in them worthy to be read, as human writings; there is such a mixture
          of falsehood and impiety, that they cannot by any means be allowed to
          be placed upon an equality with the sacred scriptures. Likewise all
          such spurious books falsely ascribed to the apostles, or to some of
          the first Christians; as, The Gospel of the Infancy of Jesus; The
          Constitutions of the Apostles; Hermes&#x27;s Pastor, etc. which carry
          in them manifest marks of imposture. To which may be added, all human
          and unwritten traditions, pleaded for by the papists; and all dreams
          and visions, and pretended revelations and prophecies, delivered out
          in later ages, by enthusiastic persons. Blessed be God, we have a more
          sure word of prophecy to attend unto; concerning which, I shall,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Observe the divine authority of the Scriptures, or show, that they
          are from God, or inspired by him; they lay in a claim to a divine
          original; and the claim is just, as will be seen. They are called the
          law, or doctrine of the Lord; the testimony of the Lord; the statutes
          of the Lord; the commandment of the Lord; the fear of the Lord; and
          the judgments of the Lord; by the Psalmist David, (Psalm 19:7-9). And
          the prophets frequently introduce their prophecies and discourses, by
          saying, &quot;the word of the Lord came&quot; to them; and with a,
          &quot;thus says the Lord&quot;, (Isa 1:10; Jer 2:1,2). And our Lord
          expressly calls the scripture the word of God, (John 10:35) as it is
          also called, (Heb 4:12). And which God &quot;at sundry times, and in
          divers manners, spoke by the prophets&quot;; and by his Son, and his
          apostles, in later times, (Heb 1:1, 2). And is represented as the
          oracles of God, and may be safely consulted and depended on; and
          according to which men are to speak, (Romans 3:2, 1 Peter 1:11). But
          before I proceed any further, in the proof of the divinity of the
          sacred Scriptures, I shall premise the following things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1a. First, That when we say that the Scriptures are the word of God,
          or that this word is of God; we do not mean that it was spoken with an
          articulate voice by him; or written immediately by the finger of God:
          the law of the Decalogue, or the Ten Commands, indeed, were
          articulately spoken by him, and the writing of them was the writing of
          God, (Exodus 20:1, 31:18, 32:15) in which he might set an example to
          his servants, in later times, to write what might be suggested to them
          by him; that it might remain to be read: it is enough, that they were
          bid to write what he delivered to them, as Moses and others were
          ordered to do, (Deuteronomy 31:19; Jeremiah 30:2; Habakkuk 2:2;
          Revelation 1:11, 19) and what was ordered by the Lord to be written,
          it is the same as if it was written by himself; and especially since
          the penmen wrote as they were directed, dictated and inspired by him,
          and &quot;spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit&quot;; for they
          did not speak and write of their own head, and out of their own
          brains, nor according to their will, and when and what they pleased;
          but according to the will of God, and what he suggested to them, and
          when he inspired them, (2 Peter 1:21).
        </p>
        <p>
          1b. Secondly, Not all that is contained in the scriptures is of God.
          Some are the words of others; yes, some are the speeches of Satan, and
          very bad ones too; as when he suggested that Job was not a sincere
          worshiper of God; and requested he might have leave to do an injury
          both to his property and to his person, (Job 1:9-11; 2:4-6). So when
          he tempted our Lord, and moved him to cast himself down from the
          pinnacle of the temple, and destroy himself; and not succeeding in
          that, urged him to fall down and worship him, (Matthew 4:5, 9). But
          now the penmen of these books, in which these speeches are, were moved
          and directed by the Lord to commit them to writing; so that though
          they themselves are not the word of God; yet that they are written,
          and are on record, is of God; and which was directed to, and done, to
          show the malice, pride, blasphemy, and impiety, of that wicked spirit.
          There are also speeches of bad men, as of Cain, Pharaoh, and others,
          ordered to be written, to discover the more the corruption of human
          nature: and even of good men, as of Moses, David, Jonah, and
          particularly the friends of Job, and their long discourses, in which
          they said not that which was right of God, as Job did; and he himself
          did not say in every speech of his what was right of God; though he
          said more, and what was more correct, than they did; and yet these
          speeches are on record, by divine order, to prove matters of fact, to
          show the weaknesses and frailties of the best of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the writers of you scriptures, as Moses, and the historical
          ones, being eye and ear witnesses of many things they wrote, could
          have written them of their own knowledge, and out of their own
          memories; and others they might take out of diaries, annals, and
          journals, of their own and former times; yet in all they wrote, they
          were under the impulse and direction of God; what to leave, and what
          to take and insert into their writings, and transmit to posterity. So
          that all they wrote may be truly said to be by divine authority. In
          the writings and discourses of the apostle Paul, are several
          quotations out of heathen authors; one out of Aratus, when he was
          discoursing before the wise men at Athens; &quot;as certain, says he,
          of your own poets have said, for we are also his offspring&quot;,
          (Acts 17:28). Another out of Menander; &quot;Evil communications
          corrupt good manners&quot;, (1 Corinthians 15:33). And another out of
          Epimenides, a poet of Crete, a testimony of his against the Cretians,
          who said they were, &quot;always liars, evil beasts, slow
          bellies&quot;; which were produced &quot;ad hominum&quot;, for greater
          conviction; and which he was directed to quote and write in his
          epistles and discourses, for that reason. So that though the words are
          not of God, yet that they were quoted and written, was of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1c. Thirdly, Let it be observed, that not the matter of the Scriptures
          only, but the very words in which they are written are of God. Some
          who are not for organic inspiration, as they call it, think that the
          sacred writers were only furnished of God with matter, and had general
          ideas of things given them, and were left to clothe them with their
          own words, and to use their own style; which they suppose accounts for
          the difference of style to be observed in them: but if this was the
          case, as it sometimes is with men, that they have clear and
          satisfactory ideas of things in their own minds, and yet are at a loss
          for proper words to express and convey the sense of them to others; so
          it might be with the sacred writers, if words were not suggested to
          them, as well as matter; and then we should be left at an uncertainty
          about the real sense of the Holy Spirit, if not led into a wrong one;
          it seems, therefore, most agreeable, that words also, as well as
          matter, were given by divine inspiration: and as for difference of
          style, as it was easy with God to direct to the use of proper words,
          so he could accommodate himself to the style such persons were
          accustomed to use, and which was natural to them, and agreeable to
          their genius and circumstances; and this may be confirmed from the
          testimonies of the writers themselves: says David, one of the writers
          of the Old Testament, &quot;The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and
          his word was in my tongue&quot;, (2 Samuel 23:2).
        </p>
        <p>
          And the apostle Paul speaks of himself, and other inspired apostles of
          the New Testament, he says, &quot;Which things we speak, not in the
          words which man&#x27;s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit
          teaches&quot;, (1 Corinthians 2:13) and it is &quot;the writing&quot;,
          or the word of God as written, that is, &quot;by inspiration of
          God&quot;, (2 Timothy 3:16). But then, 1d. Fourthly, This is to be
          understood of the Scriptures, as in the original languages in which
          they were written, and not of translations; unless it could be
          thought, that the translators of the Bible into each of the languages
          of the nations into which it has been translated, were under the
          divine inspiration also in translating, and were directed of God to
          the use of words they have rendered the original by; but this is not
          reasonable to suppose. The books of the Old Testament were written
          chiefly in the Hebrew language, unless some few passages in Jeremiah,
          Daniel, Ezra, and Esther, in the Chaldee language; and the New
          Testament in Greek: in which languages they can only be reckoned
          canonical and authentic; for this is like the charters and diplomas of
          princes; the wills or testaments of men; or any deeds made by them;
          only the original exemplar is authentic; and not translations, and
          transcriptions, and copies of them, though ever so perfect: and to the
          Bible, in its original languages, is every translation to be brought,
          and by it to be examined, tried and judged, and to be corrected and
          amended: and if this was not the case, we should have no certain and
          infallible rule to go by; for it must be either all the translations
          together, or someone of them; not all of them, because they agree not
          in all things: not one; for then the contest would be between one
          nation and another which it should be, whether English, Dutch, French,
          etc. and could one be agreed upon, it could not be read and understood
          by all: so the papists, they plead for their Vulgate Latin version;
          which has been decreed authentic by the council of Trent; though it
          abounds with innumerable errors and mistakes; nay, so far do they
          carry this affair, that they even assert that the Scriptures, in their
          originals, ought to submit to, and be corrected by their version;
          which is absurd and ridiculous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let not now any be uneasy in their minds about translations on this
          account, because they are not upon an equality with the original text,
          and especially about our own; for as it has been the will of God, and
          appears absolutely necessary that so it should be, that the Bible
          should be translated into different languages, that all may read it,
          and some particularly may receive benefit by it; he has taken care, in
          his providence, to raise up men capable of such a performance, in
          various nations, and particularly in ours; for whenever a set of men
          have been engaged in this work, as were in our nation, men well
          skilled in the languages, and partakers of the grace of God; of sound
          principles, and of integrity and faithfulness, having the fear of God
          before their eyes; they have never failed of producing a translation
          worthy of acceptance; and in which, though they have mistook some
          words and phrases, and erred in some lesser and lighter matters; yet
          not so as to affect any momentous article of faith or practice; and
          therefore such translations as ours may be regarded as the rule of
          faith. And if any scruple should remain on the minds of any on this
          account, it will be sufficient to remove it, when it is observed, that
          the Scriptures, in our English translation, have been blessed of God,
          either by reading them in it, or by explaining them according to it,
          for the conversion, comfort, and edification of thousands and
          thousands. And the same may be said of all others, so far as they
          agree with the original, that they are the rule of faith and practice,
          and alike useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I cannot but observe the amazing ignorance and stupidity of some
          persons, who take it into their heads to decry learning and learned
          men; for what would they have done for a Bible, had it not been for
          them as instruments? and if they had it, so as to have been capable of
          reading it, God must have wrought a miracle for them; and continued
          that miracle in every nation, in every age, and to every individual; I
          mean the gift of tongues, in a supernatural way, as was bestowed upon
          the apostles on the day of Pentecost; which there is no reason in the
          world ever to have expected. Bless God, therefore, and be thankful
          that God has, in his providence, raised up such men to translate the
          Bible into the mother tongue of every nation, and particularly into
          ours; and that he still continues to raise up such who are able to
          defend the translation made, against erroneous persons, and enemies of
          the truth; and to correct and amend it in lesser matters, in which it
          may have failed, and clear and illustrate it by their learned notes
          upon it. Having premised these things, I now proceed to prove the
          claim of the Scriptures to a divine authority, which may be evinced
          from the following things.
        </p>
        <p>1. First, From the subject matter of them.</p>
        <p>
          1a. In general there is nothing in them unworthy of God; nothing
          contrary to his truth and faithfulness, to his purity and holiness, to
          his wisdom and goodness, or to any of the perfections of his nature;
          there is no falsehood nor contradiction in them; they may with great
          propriety be called, as they are, &quot;The Scriptures of truth&quot;,
          and the &quot;Word of truth&quot;, (Daniel 10:21; Eph 1:13). There is
          nothing impious or impure, absurd or ridiculous in them; as in the
          Al-koran of Mahomet; which is stuffed with impurities and impieties,
          as well as with things foolish and absurd: or as in the Pagan
          treatises of their gods; which abound with tales of their murders,
          adulteries, and thefts; and the impure rites and ceremonies, and
          inhuman sacrifices used in the worship of them. But, 1b. The things
          contained in the Scriptures are pure and holy; the Holy Spirit
          dictated them, holy men spoke and wrote them, and they are justly
          called &quot;holy Scriptures&quot;, (Romans 1:2) and plainly show they
          came from the holy God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrines of them are holy; they are doctrines according to
          godliness, and tend to promote it; they teach and influence men to
          deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously,
          and godly: they are indeed, by some ignorant persons, charged with
          licentiousness; but the charge, as it is false, it is easily removed,
          by observing the nature of the doctrines, and the effects of them; the
          precepts the Scriptures enjoin, and the worship they require, are
          strictly holy; the legal part of them is &quot;holy, just, and
          good&quot;, (Romans 7:12). It is holy in its own nature, and requires
          nothing but what is for the good of men, what is but a reasonable
          service to God, and what is just between man and man; it forbids
          whatever is evil, strikes at all sorts of sins, and sets them in a
          just light, exposes and condemns them. And hence it is that there is
          in natural men, whose carnal minds are enmity to God, such a
          backwardness, yes, an aversion to reading the Scriptures; because the
          doctrines and precepts of them are so pure and holy; they choose to
          read an idle romance, an impure novel, or any profane writings and
          histories, rather than the Bible; and from whence may be drawn no
          inconsiderable argument in favor of their being of God. The style of
          the Scriptures is pure and holy, chaste and clean, free from all
          levity and obscenity, and from everything that might be offensive to
          the ear of the chaste and pious. And there are remarkable instances in
          the marginal readings of some passages in the Hebrew text, to prevent
          this; and care should be taken in all translations, to make use of
          language neat and clean; and keep up, as much as may be, to the
          original purity of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          1c. There are some things recorded in the Scriptures, which could
          never have been known but by revelation from God himself; as
          particularly, with respect to the creation of the world, and the
          original of mankind; that the world was made out of nothing; when
          made, how, and in what form and order, and how long it was in making;
          who were the first parents of mankind, when, how, and of what made;
          hence, without this revelation, men have run into strange, absurd, and
          extravagant notions about these things. Yes, the Scriptures inform us
          what was done in eternity, which none but God himself could reveal,
          and make known to men; as the choice of men in Christ to everlasting
          salvation, which was from the beginning; not of their being, nor of
          their conversion, nor of time; but before time, or they or the earth
          were, even &quot;before the foundation of the world&quot;, (Eph 1:4).
          And also the council held between the divine Persons, concerning the
          salvation of man; for as there was a consultation held about making
          him, so about saving him; which may he called the &quot;council of
          peace&quot;, (Zechariah 6:13). When &quot;God was in Christ
          reconciling the world unto himself&quot;, and the scheme of peace and
          reconciliation, and plan of salvation, were formed and agreed upon: so
          the covenant of grace made with Christ from eternity, on the behalf of
          the chosen ones; whose &quot;goings forth in it were of old, from
          everlasting&quot;; covenanting with his Father for them, and agreeing
          to be their Surety and Savior; to become incarnate, and obey and
          suffer for them, and so work out the salvation of them; representing
          their persons and taking the charge and care of them, and of all
          blessings of grace given them, and of all promises made to them, in
          him, before the world began; in which covenant he was set up as
          Mediator, &quot;from everlasting, or ever the earth was&quot;,
          (Proverbs 8:22, 23; Micah 5:2; 2 Timothy 1:9; Ephesians 1:3, 4). All
          which could never have been known unless God himself had revealed
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          1d. There are some things recorded in the Scriptures as to the future,
          which God only could foreknow would be, and foretell with certainty
          that they should be; and which have accordingly come to pass, and
          proves the revelation to be of God. Some of them relate to particular
          persons, and contingent events; as Josiah, who was prophesied of by
          name, as to be born to the house of David, three or four hundred years
          before his birth, and what he should do; &quot;offer up the idolatrous
          priests on Jeroboam&#x27;s altar, and burn men&#x27;s bones on
          it&quot;; all which exactly came to pass, see (1 King 13:2) compared
          with (2 King 23:17, 20). Cyrus, king of Persia, also was prophesied of
          by name, more than two hundred years before his birth, and what he
          should do; what conquests he should make, what immense riches he
          should possess; and that he should let the captive Jews go free,
          without price or reward, and give orders for the rebuilding their
          temple; all which was punctually fulfilled, (Isaiah 44:28, 45:1-3, 13;
          see Ezra 1:1-4). Others relate to kingdoms and states, and what should
          befall them; as the Egyptians, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,
          Assyrians, Babylonians, and others; of whose destruction Isaiah and
          Jeremiah prophesied, and who now are no more, have not so much as a
          name on earth: and particularly many things are foretold concerning
          the Jews; as their descent into Egypt, abode and bondage there, and
          coming from thence with great riches; which was made known to their
          great ancestor Abraham, before they were, (Genesis 15:14; see Exodus
          12:35, 40, 41) their captivity in Babylon, and return from thence
          after seventy years, (Jeremiah 29:10, 11; see Daniel 9:2) and all
          their miseries and afflictions in their last destruction, and present
          state, are prophetically described in Deuteronomy 28:1-68 and their
          exact case, for about nineteen hundred years, is expressed in a few
          words; as well as their future conversion is prophesied of (Hosea 3:4,
          5).
        </p>
        <p>
          But especially the prophecies concerning Christ, are worthy of notice;
          his incarnation and birth of a virgin; the place where he should be
          born; of what nation, tribe, and family; his sufferings and death, his
          burial, resurrection, ascension to Heaven, and session at the right
          hand of God: all which are plainly pointed out in prophecy; and which,
          with many other things relating to him, have had their exact
          accomplishment in him. To which might be added, predictions of the
          calling of the Gentiles, by many of the prophets; and the abolition of
          paganism in the Roman empire; the rise, power, and ruin of antichrist;
          which are particularly spoken of in the book of the Revelation; great
          part of which prophetic book has been already fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          1e. There are some things in the Scriptures, which, though not
          contrary to reason, yet are above the capacity of men ever to have
          made a discovery of; as the Trinity of persons in the Godhead; whose
          distinct mode of subsisting is mysterious to us; the eternal,
          generation of the Son of God, which is ineffable by us; his
          incarnation and birth of a virgin, under the power of the Holy Spirit,
          which is wonderful and amazing; the union of the human nature to his
          divine person; which is, &quot;without controversy, the great mystery
          of godliness&quot;: the regeneration of men by the Spirit of God, and
          the manner of his operation on the souls of men; which, on hearing of,
          made a master of Israel say, &quot;How can these things be?&quot; and
          the resurrection of the same body at the last day, reckoned by the
          Gentiles incredible; and which things, though revealed, are not to be
          accounted for upon the principles of nature and reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          1f. The things contained in the Scriptures, whether doctrines or
          facts, are harmonious; the doctrines, though delivered at sundry
          times, and in divers manners, are all of a piece; no yes and nay, no
          discord and disagreement among them; the two Testaments &quot;are like
          two young roes that are twins&quot;; to which some think they are
          compared in Song of Solomon 4:5, 7:3 and to the Cherubim over the
          mercy seat, which were of one beaten piece, were exactly alike, and
          looked to one another, and both to the mercy seat; a type of Christ,
          who is the foundation of the apostles and prophets, in which they
          unite, and both agree to lay; the apostle Paul said none other things
          than what Moses and the prophets did say should be. And as to
          historical facts, what seeming contradictions may be observed in any
          of them, are easily reconciled, with a little care, diligence, and
          study; and some of these arise from the carelessness of transcribers
          putting one word or letter for another; and even these instances are
          but few, and not very material; and which never affect any article of
          faith or practice: such care has divine providence taken of these
          peculiar and important writings, which with the harmony of them show
          them to be of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Secondly, The style and manner in which the Scriptures are written,
          is a further evidence of their divine original; the majesty in which
          they appear, the authoritative manner in which they are delivered; not
          asking, but demanding, attention and assent unto them; and which
          commands reverence and acceptance of them; the figures used to engage
          hereunto are inimitable by creatures; and such as would be daring and
          presumptuous for any but God to use, with whom is terrible majesty;
          such as, &quot;Hear, O heavens&quot;, and &quot;I will speak&quot;,
          (Deuteronomy 32:1; Isaiah 1:2) the sublimity of the style is such as
          exceeds all other writings: Longinus, an heathen orator, who wrote
          &quot;upon the Sublime&quot;, admired some passages in the writings of
          Moses, particularly (Genesis 1:3). That early composition, the book of
          Job, abounds with such strong and lofty expressions as are not to be
          found in human writings, especially the speeches Jehovah himself
          delivered out of the whirlwind, (Job 38:1- 41:34) the book of Psalms
          is full of bright figures and inimitable language, particularly see
          (Psalm 18:715, 29:3-10, 113:3-8, 139:7-12). The prophecies of Isaiah
          are fraught with a rich treasure of divine elocution, which surpasses
          all that is to be met with in the writings of men; and it is
          remarkable, that in some of the inspired writers, who have been bred
          up in a rustic manner, are found some of the most grand images, and
          lively picturesque, and highest flights of language, as in Amos the
          herdsman, (Amos 4:13, 9:2,6).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Thirdly, Another argument for the divine authority of the
          Scriptures may be taken from the penmen and writers of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3a. Many of these were men of no education, in a low station of life,
          and were taken from the flock, or from the herd, or from their nets,
          or other mean employments; and what they wrote, both as to matter and
          manner, were above and beyond their ordinary capacities, and therefore
          must be of God; what they wrote could not be of themselves; but they
          &quot;spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          3b. They lived in different times and places, and were of different
          interests and capacities, and in different conditions and
          circumstances; and yet they were all of the same sentiment, they speak
          and write the same things, deliver out the same truths and doctrines,
          and enjoin the same moral duties of religion, and the same positive
          precepts, according to the different dispensations under which they
          were; and this shows that they were dictated, and influenced in all,
          by the same Spirit of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3c. They were holy and good men, partakers of the grace of God; and
          therefore could never give into an imposture, nor deliver out a known
          lie, nor obtrude a falsehood upon the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. They appear to be plain, honest, and faithful men; they conceal
          not their own failings and infirmities; so Moses published his own
          weaknesses and mistakes, and spared not the blemishes of his family;
          not of his more remote ancestor Levi, in the case of the Shechemites;
          nor of his immediate parents, their illegal marriage; nor of his
          favorite people the Israelites, their rebellion and obstinacy, and
          idolatry: and the same may be observed of other inspired writers.
        </p>
        <p>
          3e. They were unselfish men; they sought not popular applause, nor
          worldly wealth, nor to aggrandize themselves and their families.
          Moses, when it was offered to him, by the Lord, to make of him a great
          nation, and cut off the people of Israel for their sins, refused it
          more than once; preferring the public good of that people to his own
          advantage; and though he was king in Jeshurun, he was not careful to
          have any of his posterity to succeed him in his office; and though the
          priesthood was conferred on Aaron his brother, and his sons, yet no
          other provision was made for his own family, than to attend the lower
          services of the tabernacle in common with the rest of his tribe: and
          of this disposition were the apostles of Christ, who left all, and
          followed him; and sought not the wealth of men, nor honor from them;
          but, on the contrary, exposed themselves to reproach, poverty,
          vexation, and trouble; yes, to persecution, and death itself; which
          they would never have done, had they not been fully satisfied of their
          mission of God, and of their message from him; and therefore could not
          be deterred from speaking and writing in his name, by the terrors and
          menaces of men, and by all the afflictions, bonds, and persecution,
          and death in every shape, which awaited them. In short, the writers of
          the Scriptures seem to be men that neither could be imposed upon
          themselves, nor sought to impose on others; nor would it have been
          easy, had they been bad men, to have succeeded, had they attempted it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Fourthly, Another argument may be drawn from the many wonderful
          effects the sacred writings, attended with a divine power and
          influence, have had upon the hearts and lives of men. Many have been
          converted from error, superstition, and idolatry, and from a vicious
          course of life, to embrace and profess the truth, and to live a holy
          life and conversation, upon reading the Scriptures, or hearing them
          explained; and even some of great natural parts and learning, who
          could not easily be prevailed upon to relinquish former tenets and
          practices, had they not had full and clear conviction of them. This
          &quot;Word of God has been quick and powerful, sharper than a
          two-edged sword&quot;; it has pierced and penetrated into the recesses
          of the heart, and laid open the secrets of it; it has been the means
          of enlightening the mind, quickening the soul, regenerating and
          sanctifying the heart, and of producing faith, and every other, grace
          in it, and of strengthening, comforting, and reviving the spirits of
          the people of God when in distress, by afflictions, or Satan&#x27;s
          temptations; so that every good man has a testimony within himself of
          its divine authority; see (1 John 5:9,10).
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Fifthly, The testimony bore to the Scriptures by miracles,
          abundantly confirm the genuineness of them, and that they are of God;
          such as were done by Moses, and the prophets of the Old Testament, and
          by the apostles of the New; even such as are above, and contrary to
          the laws of nature, and are beyond the power of a creature to perform,
          and which only Omnipotence itself could work: now these God would
          never do to establish the character of impostors, or to confirm a lie;
          which yet he has done to witness the truth of divine revelation; see
          (Mark 16:20; Hebrews 2:3,4).
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Sixthly, The hatred and opposition of men, and the enmity of
          devils, to them, afford no inconsiderable argument in favor of the
          divinity of them; for were they of men, they would not have such a
          disgust at them, and disapprobation of them, and make such opposition
          to them: by this are to be known the Spirit of truth, and the spirit
          of error; what is of the world, and merely human, is approved by the
          men of the world; but what is of God is rejected, (1 John 4:5, 6) and
          if these writings were of Satan, and the work of forgery, imposture,
          and deceit, that wicked spirit would never have shown such despite
          unto them, nor have taken such pains to tempt men, and prevail upon
          them not to read them; and to persuade others to use their utmost
          efforts to corrupt or destroy them, and root them out of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Seventhly, The awful judgments of God on such who have despised
          them, and have endeavored to destroy them, are no mean evidence that
          they are of God; who hereby has shown his resentment of such conduct
          and behavior; which might be illustrated by the instances of Antiochus
          Epiphanes, king of Syria, who cut to pieces the copies of the book of
          the law wherever he found them, and burnt them, and put to death all
          with whom they were, &quot;59Now the five and twentieth day of the
          month they did sacrifice upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar
          of God. 60At which time according to the commandment they put to death
          certain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised.&quot;
          (1 Maccabees 1) this man died of a violent disorder in his affections,
          his body was covered with worms, his flesh flaked off, and was
          attended with an intolerable stench, &quot;But the Lord Almighty, the
          God of Israel, smote him with an incurable and invisible plague: or as
          soon as he had spoken these words, a pain of the affections that was
          remediless came upon him, and sore torments of the inner parts;&quot;
          (2 Maccabees 9:5) &quot;So that the worms rose up out of the body of
          this wicked man, and whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh
          fell away, and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to all his
          army.&quot; (2 Maccabees 9:9) and of Diocletian, the Roman emperor,
          who by an edict ordered all the sacred books to be burnt, that, if
          possible, he might root Christianity out of the world; and once
          imagined that he had done it; but when he found he had not
          accomplished his design, through madness and despair, in the height of
          his imperial glory, abdicated the empire, and retired to a private
          life, and at last poisoned himself: the one showed a despite to the
          books of the Old Testament, the other more especially to the books of
          the New Testament; and both were highly resented by the divine Being,
          who hereby showed himself the author of both. Many more instances
          might be produced, but these may suffice.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Eighthly, The antiquity and continuance of these writings may be
          improved into an argument in favor of them: Tertullian says,
          &quot;That which is most ancient is most true.&quot; Men from the
          beginning had knowledge of God, and of the way of salvation, and in
          what manner God was to be worshiped; which could not be without a
          revelation; though for some time it was not delivered in writing. The
          antediluvian patriarchs had it, and so the post-diluvian ones, to the
          times of Moses; whose writings are the first, and are more ancient
          than any profane writings, by many hundreds of years; the most early
          of that sort extant, are the poems of Homer and Hesiod, who flourished
          about the times of Isaiah; and the divine writings have been preserved
          notwithstanding the malice of men and devils, some of them some
          thousands of years, when other writings are lost and perished.
        </p>
        <p>
          To which may be added, that the Scriptures receive no small evidence
          of the authority of them, from the testimonies of many heathen writers
          agreeing with them, with respect to the chronology, geography, and
          history of them; as concerning the creation of the world, Noah&#x27;s
          flood, the tower of Babel, the confusion of languages, the peopling
          the earth by the sons of Noah, the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah; with
          many other things respecting the people of Israel, their origin, laws,
          &amp;c. I go on to consider, 2. The &quot;Perfection&quot; of the
          Scriptures. When we assert the perfection of them, we do not mean that
          they contain a perfect account of all that God has done from the
          beginning of time, in the dispensations of his providence in the
          world, and in the distributions of his grace to the sons of men;
          though they relate much of the state and condition of the church of
          God in all ages, and as it will be to the end of time. Nor that they
          contain all the discourses, exhortations, admonitions, cautions, and
          counsels of the prophets, delivered to the people of Israel, in each
          of the ages of time: nor all the sermons of the apostles, which they
          preached to the Jews, and among the Gentiles: nor are all that were
          said and done by our Lord Jesus Christ recorded in them; there were
          many signs done by him which are not written, which if they should be
          written, as the evangelist observes, &quot;even the world itself could
          not contain the books that should be written&quot;, (John 20:30,
          21:25). But then they relate all things necessary to salvation,
          everything that ought to be believed and done; and are a complete,
          perfect standard of faith and practice: which may be proved,
        </p>
        <p>
          2a. First, From the Author of them, who is God; they are the word of
          God, and are &quot;given by inspiration of God;&quot; as is asserted
          in them, and has been clearly shown. Now since God is the author of
          them, who is a perfect Being, in whom is &quot;no darkness at
          all&quot;; not of ignorance, error, and imperfection; they coming from
          him, must be free from everything of that kind; &quot;he is a
          rock&quot;, and &quot;his work is perfect&quot;; as his works of
          creation, providence, and redemption; so this work of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          2b. Secondly, From the name they go by, a &quot;Testament&quot;: we
          commonly divide the Scriptures into the Books of the Old Testament,
          and the Books of the New Testament; and that there was a First and a
          Second Testament, an Old and a New one, is plainly intimated, (Hebrews
          9:15). Now a man&#x27;s testament, or will, contains the whole of his
          will and pleasure, concerning the disposition of his estate to whoever
          he pleases, or it is not properly his will and testament; a man&#x27;s
          testament, &quot;if it be confirmed&quot;, as the apostle observes,
          &quot;no man disannuls or adds thereto&quot;, (Galatians 3:15). Such
          the Scriptures are; they contain the whole will of God, about the
          disposition of the blessings of grace, and of the heavenly
          inheritance, to those who are appointed by him heirs; and being
          ratified and confirmed by the blood of Christ, are so sure and firm as
          not to be disannulled, and so perfect that nothing can be added
          thereunto.
        </p>
        <p>
          2c. Thirdly, From the epithet of &quot;perfect&quot; being expressly
          given unto them; &quot;the law of the Lord is perfect&quot;, (Psalm
          19:7) which is to be understood, not of the Decalogue, or Ten
          Commands, but of the doctrine of the Lord, as the phrase signifies;
          even what was delivered in the sacred writings extant in the times of
          David; and if it was perfect then as to the substance of it, then much
          more must it appear so by the accession of the prophets, and the books
          of the New Testament since, in which there are plainer and clearer
          discoveries of the mind and will of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. Fourthly, From the essential parts of them, the Law and Gospel; to
          which two heads the substance of them may be reduced: the Law is a
          perfect rule of duty; it contains what is the &quot;good, acceptable,
          and perfect will of God&quot; (Romans 12:2). What he would have done,
          or not done; the whole duty of man, both towards God and man; all is
          comprehended in these two commands, &quot;You shall love the Lord your
          God with all your heart, etc. and you shall love your neighbor as
          yourself&quot; (Matthew 22:37- 40). The Gospel is the &quot;perfect
          law&quot;, or doctrine &quot;of liberty&quot;, the apostle James
          speaks of, (James 1:25) which proclaims the glorious liberty of the
          children of God by Christ; and it is perfect, it treats of perfect
          things; of perfect justification by Christ; of full pardon of sin
          through his blood, and complete salvation in him; and contains a
          perfect plan of truth; every truth, &quot;as it is in Jesus&quot;; all
          the treasures of wisdom and knowledge: it is the whole, or all the
          counsel of God, concerning the spiritual and eternal salvation of men
          (Acts 20:27).
        </p>
        <p>
          2e. Fifthly, From the integral parts of them; the Scriptures,
          containing all the books that were written by divine inspiration. The
          books of the Old Testament were complete and perfect in the times of
          Christ; not one was wanting, nor any mutilated and corrupted. The
          Jews, he says, &quot;have Moses and the prophets&quot;; and he
          himself, &quot;beginning at Moses and all the prophets, expounded in
          all the scriptures, the things concerning himself&quot; (Luke 16:31,
          24:27). So that they had not only the five books of Moses, but
          &quot;all&quot; the prophets, and &quot;all&quot; the scriptures of
          the Old Testament: nay, he affirms, that &quot;until Heaven and earth
          pass, one jot, or one tittle, shall in no wise pass from the law until
          all be fulfilled&quot;, (Matthew 5:18). The Jews had the oracles of
          God committed to their care, (Romans 3:2) and they have been faithful
          keepers of them, even some of them to superstition and scrupulous
          nicety, numbering not only the books and sections, but also the
          verses, and even the words and letters: and there never was nor now
          is, any reason to be given why they had corrupted, or would corrupt,
          any part of the Old Testament; on the coming of Christ it was not
          their interest to do it; and even before that it was translated into
          the Greek tongue, by which they would have been detected; and after
          the coming of Christ they could not do it if they would, copies of it
          being in the hands of Christians; who were able to correct what they
          should corrupt, had they done it: and whatever attempts may have been
          made by any under the Christian name, to corrupt some copies of either
          Testament, they may be, and have been detected; or whatever mistakes
          may be made, through the carelessness of transcribers of copies, they
          are to be corrected by other copies, which God, in his providence, has
          preserved; and, as it seems, for such purposes: so that we have a
          perfect canon, or rule of faith and practice. It is objected to the
          perfection of the books of the Old Testament, that the books of
          Nathan, Gad, and Iddo, the prophets mentioned therein, are lost; but
          then it should be proved that these were inspired writings, and,
          indeed, that they are lost; they may be the same, as some think, with
          the books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is also objected to those of the New Testament, that there was
          an epistle from Laodicea, (Colossians 4:16) and another to the
          Corinthians, distinct from those we have (1 Corinthians 5:9) neither
          of them now extant: as to the first, that is not an epistle
          &quot;to&quot; Laodicea, but &quot;from&quot; it; and may refer to one
          of the epistles, we have, written by the apostle Paul, when at that
          place: and as to that to the Corinthians, it does not appear to be
          another and distinct, but the same he was then writing: but admitting,
          for argument sake, though it is not to be granted, that some book, or
          part of the inspired writings is lost; let it be proved, if it can,
          that any essential article of faith is lost with it; or that there is
          any such article of faith wanting in the books we have: if this cannot
          be proved, then, notwithstanding the pretended defect, we have still a
          perfect rule of faith; which is what is contended for.
        </p>
        <p>
          2f. Sixthly, This may be further evinced from the charge that is
          given, &quot;not to add unto, nor diminish from, any part of the
          sacred writings, law or gospel&quot;: this is strictly enjoined the
          Israelites to observe, with respect to the law, and the commandments
          of it, given them by Moses (Deuteronomy 4:2, 12:32). And with respect
          to the Gospel, the apostle Paul says, &quot;Though we, or an angel
          from Heaven, preach any other gospel unto you, than that which we have
          preached unto you—and you have received, let him be accursed&quot;
          (Galatians 1:8, 9). And the wise man, or Agur, says of the Scriptures
          in his time, &quot;Every word of God is pure—add you not unto his
          words&quot;. And the apostle and evangelist John, closes the canon of
          the Scripture with these remarkable words, &quot;If any man shall add
          unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written
          in this book; and if any man shall take away from the words of the
          book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of
          life&quot;, etc. (Revelation 22:18, 19). Now if there is nothing
          superfluous in the Scriptures, to be taken from them; and nothing
          defective in them, which requires any addition to them; then they must
          be perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          2g. Seventhly, This may be argued from the sufficiency of them to
          answer the ends and purposes for which they are written; as, &quot;for
          doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in
          righteousness&quot;, (2 Timothy 3:16) they are sufficiently profitable
          and useful &quot;for doctrine&quot;; there is no spiritual truth, nor
          evangelical doctrine, but what they contain; they are called &quot;the
          Scriptures of truth&quot;; not only because they come from the God of
          truth, and whatever is in them is truth; but they contain &quot;all
          truth&quot;; which the Spirit of God, the dictator of them, guides
          into, and that by means of them; (see Daniel 10:21; John 16:13) every
          doctrine is to be confirmed and established by them: our Lord proved
          the things concerning himself, his person, office, sufferings, and
          death, by them, (Luke 24:25-27) the apostle Paul &quot;reasoned out of
          the Scriptures&quot;, in confirmation and defense of the doctrines he
          taught; &quot;opening and alleging&quot;, that is, from the
          Scriptures, &quot;that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again
          from the dead; and that this Jesus is Christ&quot;, whom he preached;
          and, indeed, he said &quot;none other things than what Moses and the
          prophets did say&quot; should be, and which he was able to prove from
          thence (Acts 17:2, 3, 26:22, 23).
        </p>
        <p>
          Every doctrine proposed by men, to the assent of others, is not
          immediately to be credited; but to be tried and proved, and judged of
          by the holy Scriptures, which are to be searched, as they were by the
          Bereans, to see whether those things be so or not; and being found
          agreeable to them, they are to be believed, and held fast; for
          &quot;to the law and to the testimony; if men speak not according to
          this word, it is because there is no light in them&quot; (Isaiah
          8:20). See 1 John 4:1; 1 Thessalonians 5:21; Acts 17:11 and these are
          serviceable &quot;for reproof&quot;, for the detection, confutation,
          and conviction of error: thus Christ confuted the error of the
          Sadducees by the Scriptures (Matthew 22:29, 30) and the apostles, with
          these, warred a good warfare; these were their spiritual weapons, the
          word of God is the sword of the Spirit, they used in fighting the good
          fight of faith, against false teachers; by sound doctrine, fetched
          from thence, they were able to convince and stop the mouths of
          gainsayers: there never was an error, or heresy, broached in the world
          yet, but what has been confuted by the Scriptures; and it is not
          possible that anyone can arise in opposition to &quot;the faith once
          delivered&quot;, but what may receive its refutation from them. They
          are also of use &quot;for correction&quot; of every sin, internal or
          external; of heart, lip, and life, secret or open; sins of omission or
          commission; all are forbidden, reproved, and condemned by the law of
          God; which says, &quot;You shall not covet&quot;, nor do this, and
          that, and the other iniquity (Romans 7:7, 13:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          And the Gospel agrees with the law herein; and what is contrary to the
          law, is to sound doctrine; the Gospel of the grace of God, teaches to
          &quot;deny ungodliness and worldly lusts&quot; (1 Timothy 1:9-11;
          Titus 2:11, 12). There is not a sin that can be named, but what the
          Scriptures inveigh against, forbid, and correct. And another end
          answered by them is, that they are &quot;for instruction in
          righteousness&quot;, in every moral duty of religion, and in every
          positive precept of God, according to the different dispensations;
          they instruct in everything of a moral or positive nature, and direct
          to observe all that is commanded of God and Christ; and now writings
          by which all such ends are answered, must needs be perfect and
          complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scriptures are sufficient to &quot;make a man of God perfect, and
          thoroughly furnish him unto all good works&quot; (2 Timothy 3:17). Not
          a private good man only, but one in a public character and office; a
          prophet, a preacher, and minister of the word; in which sense the
          phrase is used both in the Old and New Testament (1 Samuel 9:6, 7; 1
          Tim 6:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          An acquaintance with these fits him for the work of the ministry, and
          furnishes him with sound doctrine, to deliver out to the edification
          of others; by means of these he becomes &quot;a scribe well instructed
          in the kingdom of God; and to be able to bring out of his treasure
          things new and old&quot;: and if they are able to make such a man
          perfect, they must be perfect themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another use of the Scriptures, and an end to be, and which is,
          answered by them, is not only the learning and instruction of private
          men, as well as those of a public character; but to make them patient
          under afflictions, and comfort them in them, and give hope of
          deliverance out of them, as well as of eternal salvation hereafter;
          for the apostle says, &quot;Whatever things were written aforetime,
          were written for our learning; that we, through patience and comfort
          of the Scriptures, might have hope&quot; (Romans 15:4). Nor is there
          any afflictive circumstance a good man can come into, but there is a
          promise in the word of God suitable to him in it; and which may be a
          means of enlivening, cheering, and comforting him, (Psalm 119:49, 50)
          yes, the Scriptures are written to promote and increase the spiritual
          joy of God&#x27;s people, and that that joy might be full, and
          therefore must be full and perfect themselves (1 John 1:3, 4).
        </p>
        <p>
          2h. Eighthly, The Scriptures are able to make a man &quot;wise unto
          salvation&quot; (2 Timothy 3:15). One part of them being the gospel of
          salvation; which points out to men the way of salvation; gives an
          account of Christ, the author of it, and of the salvation itself
          wrought out by him; and describes the persons that have an interest in
          it, and shall enjoy it; and who, through the grace of God, are made
          wise enough to see their need of it, seek after it, and embrace it;
          for it is not barely by reading the word they become so wise; but
          through the Spirit of wisdom and revelation opening their eyes to see
          what is contained in it, and applying it to them; whereby the gospel
          becomes &quot;the power of God unto salvation&quot; to them. In short
          the Scriptures contain all things in them necessary to be believed,
          unto salvation; and, indeed, they are written for this end, that men
          &quot;might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that
          believing, they might have life through his name&quot; (John 20:31)
          and hereby, under a divine influence and blessing, they come to have
          the knowledge of God and Christ, and of God in Christ; which is the
          beginning, earnest, and pledge of eternal life (John 17:3).
        </p>
        <p>I proceed,</p>
        <p>
          3. To prove the &quot;perspicuity&quot; of the Scriptures; for since
          they are a rule of faith and practice, they should be clear and plain,
          as they are: not that they are all equally clear and plain; some parts
          of them, and some things in them, are dark and obscure; but then by
          comparing spiritual things with spiritual, or those more dark passages
          with those that are clearer, they may be plainly understood. Moreover,
          the light of the Scriptures has been a growing one; it was but dim
          under the dispensation of the law of Moses; it became more clear
          through the writings of the prophets; but most clear under the gospel
          dispensation; where, &quot;as in a glass, we behold, with open face,
          the glory of the Lord&quot;; and of divine things: though in the
          gospel dispensation, and in such clear writings and epistles as those
          of the apostle Paul, who used &quot;great plainness of speech&quot;,
          there are some things &quot;hard to be understood&quot;, see 2
          Corinthians 3:12-18; 2 Peter 3:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is so ordered on purpose to remove all contempt and loathing
          of the Scriptures, and to humble the arrogance and pride of men, to
          engage reverence of them, and to excite attention to them, and to put
          men on searching them with close study, application, and prayer. Nor
          is every doctrine of the Scriptures expressed in so many words; as the
          doctrine of the Trinity of persons in the Godhead; the eternal
          generation of the Son of God, his incarnation and satisfaction, etc.
          but then the things themselves signified by them are clear and plain;
          and there are terms and phrases answerable to them; or they are to be
          deduced from thence by just and necessary consequences. Nor are the
          Scriptures clear and plain to everyone that reads them; they are a
          sealed book, which neither learned nor unlearned men can understand
          and interpret without the Spirit of God, the dictator of them; the
          natural man, by the mere light of nature, and dint of reason, though
          he may understand the grammatical sense of words; yet he does not
          understand the meaning of them, at least in a spiritual way, with
          application to himself; and so far as he has any notion of them, he
          has a disgust and contempt of them, for the most part; yet they are so
          fully expressed and clearly revealed, that if the gospel is hid to
          any, it is to those that perish, who are left to the native darkness
          of their minds, and to be &quot;blinded by the God of this
          world&quot;, that the glorious light of the gospel might not shine
          into them, see Isaiah 29:11,12; 1 Corinthians 2:14; 2 Corinthians 4:3,
          4.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then the Scriptures are plain to them that have a spiritual
          understanding; who are spiritual men, and judge all things; &quot;to
          whom it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom&quot;. What are
          more clear and plain than the precepts of the law, commanding one
          thing to be done, and forbidding the doing of another? in what plain
          language are they expressed, &quot;You shall have no other gods before
          me, etc.&quot;, &quot;You shall not kill, etc.?&quot; And how clearly
          is asserted the great and fundamental doctrine of the gospel,
          &quot;That salvation is alone by Jesus Christ, through the free grace
          of God; and not of the works of men?&quot; and so everything necessary
          of belief unto salvation. In short, as Gregory says[2], they are like
          a full and deep river, in which the lamb may walk, and the elephant
          swim, in different places.
        </p>
        <p>The perspicuity of the Scriptures may be argued,</p>
        <p>
          3a. From the author of them, God, as has been proved, who is &quot;the
          Father of lights&quot;; and therefore what comes from him must be
          light and clear, in whom is &quot;no darkness at all&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          3b. From the several parts of them, and what they are compared unto.
          The law, or legal part of them, is represented by things which are
          light, and give it; &quot;The commandment is a lamp, and the law is
          light&quot; (Proverbs 6:23). The commandments of the law, as before
          observed, are clearly expressed; and are a plain direction to men what
          to do, or shun; the same David says of the word of the Lord in
          general, and more explicitly, &quot;Your word is a lamp unto my feet,
          and a light unto my path&quot; (Psalm 119:105). directing how to walk
          and act. The evangelical part of the Scriptures, or the gospel, is
          compared to a &quot;glass&quot;, in which may be clearly beheld,
          &quot;the glory of the Lord&quot;; of his person, offices, grace, and
          righteousness; and everyone of the glorious truths and doctrines of it
          (2 Corinthians 3:18). Hence the ministers of the word are called the
          light of the world; because by opening and explaining the Scriptures,
          they are instruments of enlightening men into the will of God, and the
          mysteries of his grace (Matthew 5:14).
        </p>
        <p>
          3c. From other testimonies of Scripture, particularly from Deuteronomy
          30:11-14. &quot;For this commandment, which I command you this day, is
          not hidden from you; neither is it far off—it is not in heaven—neither
          is it beyond the sea—but the word is very near unto you; in your
          mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it&quot;. And if it is not
          hidden, nor at a distance and inaccessible, then it must be open, and
          the knowledge of it to be come at; and this is to be understood, not
          only of the law of Moses, but more especially of the gospel, the word
          of faith, preached by the apostles, as the apostle Paul interprets it
          (Romans 10:6-8). And the whole of Scripture is the &quot;sure word of
          prophecy; whereunto men do well to take heed, as unto a light that
          shines in a dark place&quot;: and so the means of dispelling the
          darkness of ignorance, error, and unbelief; and of giving light all
          around, both with respect to doctrine and duty, see 2 Peter 1:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. From exhortations to all sorts of people to read them, and who are
          commended for so doing. Not only the kings of Israel were to read the
          law of the Lord, but all that people in general; and there was a
          certain time of the year for them to assemble together to hear it
          read, men, women, children, and strangers; but if it was not plain and
          clear, and easy to be understood, it would have been to no purpose for
          them to attend it (Deuteronomy 17:19; 31:11-13). Our Lord advises to
          &quot;search the Scriptures&quot;; which supposes them legible and
          intelligible, (John 5:39) and the Bereans are commended as more noble
          than those of Thessalonica; because they searched the Scriptures
          daily, and compared what they heard with them; that they might know
          whether they were right or not (Acts 17:11; see Revelation 1:3).
        </p>
        <p>
          3e. From all sorts of persons being capable of reading them, and
          hearing them read, so as to understand them. Thus in the times of
          Nehemiah and Ezra, persons of every gender and age, who were at years
          of maturity, and had the exercise of their rational faculties, had the
          law read unto them, (Nehemiah 8:3) Timothy, from a child, knew the
          holy Scriptures, (2 Timothy 3:15) believers, and regenerate persons of
          every rank and degree, have knowledge of them, whether fathers, young
          men, or little children, (1 John 2:12, 2:13, 14). Nor is the public
          preaching of the word, and the necessity of it, to be objected to all
          this; since that is, as for conversion, so for greater edification and
          comfort, and for establishment in the truth, even though it is known;
          and besides, serves to lead into a larger knowledge of it, and is the
          ordinary means of guiding into it, and of arriving to a more perfect
          acquaintance with it, (1 Corinthians 14:3; 2 Peter 1:12; Acts 8:30,
          31; Ephesians 4:11-13). So that it may be concluded, upon the whole,
          that the Scriptures are easily understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sure, certain, and infallible rule to go by, with respect to things
          both to be believed and done: a rule they are (Galatians 6:16). And
          since they are of divine authority, and are perfect and plain, they
          are a sure rule, and to be depended on; &quot;The testimony of the
          Lord is sure&quot;, (Psalm 19:7) and a &quot;more sure word of
          prophecy&quot; than all others whatever, (2 Peter 1:19) these are the
          witness of God, and therefore greater than man&#x27;s; and to be
          believed before any human testimony, (1 John 5:9) yes, must be
          reckoned infallible, since they are the Scriptures of truth, and not
          only contain what is truth, and nothing but truth in them: but have a
          true, even a divine testimony bore unto them, and come from the God of
          truth, who cannot lie (Daniel 10:21; Tit 1:2). They are the judge of
          all religious controversies, to which all are to be brought, and by
          them determined; according to these, spiritual men, who have their
          senses exercised, to discern between good and evil, try and judge all
          things. The Scripture is the best interpreter of Scripture, or the
          Spirit of God therein; nor are the church or its pastors, nor councils
          and popes, the infallible interpreters thereof; there is a private
          interpretation of Scripture, which every Christian may make, according
          to his ability and light; and there is a public one, by the preacher
          of the word but both are subject to, and to be determined by the
          Scripture itself, which is the only certain and infallible rule of
          faith and practice. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There seems to be a real &quot;necessity&quot; of such a rule in
          the present state of things; and, indeed, a divine revelation was
          necessary to Adam, in a state of innocence; how, otherwise, should he
          have known anything of the manner of his creation; of the state and
          condition in which he was created, after the image and in the likeness
          of God; the extent of his power and authority over the creation; by
          what means his animal life was to be supported; in what manner God was
          to be served and worshiped by him, especially the parts of positive
          and instituted worship, both as to matter, time, and place; and
          particularly the will of God, as to abstinence from eating of the
          fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil?
        </p>
        <p>
          And if our first parents stood in need of a divine revelation, as a
          rule and guide to them in their state of integrity; then much more we
          in our present state of ignorance and depravity. And after the fall,
          it was owing to divine revelation, that man had any knowledge of the
          way of his salvation, by the woman&#x27;s seed; and of the
          appointment, nature, import, use, and end of sacrifices; and though
          this revelation was for a time unwritten, and was handed down by
          tradition to the patriarchs before the flood, and for some time after,
          while the lives of men were of a long continuance, and it required but
          few hands to transmit it from one to another; but when men&#x27;s
          lives were shortened, and it was the pleasure of God to make further
          and clearer discoveries of his mind and will, and to frame new laws
          and rules of worship, in different dispensations; it seemed proper and
          necessary to commit them to writing, both that they might remain, and
          that they might be referred to in case of any doubt or difficulty
          about them; and particularly that the ends before mentioned might be
          answered by them, which it was intended should be; namely, the
          learning and instruction of men in matters of faith and practice,
          their peace, comfort, and edification, (Romans 15:4; 2 Timothy
          3:15-17) and the rather, since nothing else was, and nothing less than
          the Scriptures are, a sufficient rule and guide in matters of
          religion; even not the light of nature and reason, so much talked of,
          and so highly exalted; and since it has been set up as such against
          divine revelation, it may be proper to show the insufficiency of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the light of nature or reason, is not to be taken in an abstract
          sense, or considered only in theory, what it has been, may be, or
          should be, but not subsisting in men or books; as such it can be no
          rule or guide at all to have recourse unto; and besides, reason in
          such sense is not opposed to revelation; there is nothing in
          revelation contrary to reason, though there are things above it, and
          of which it is not a competent judge, and therefore can be no guide in
          such matters; but it must be considered as it is in fact, and as it
          exists, either in single individuals, or in whole bodies of men, and
          these unacquainted with, and unassisted by divine revelation; and then
          its sufficiency, or rather insufficiency, will soon appear. If it is
          considered as in individuals, it may easily be observed it is not
          alike in all, but differs, according to the circumstances of men,
          climate, constitution, education, etc. some have a greater share of it
          than others; and what is agreeable to the reason of one man, is not so
          to another; and therefore unless it was alike and equal in all, it can
          be no sure rule or guide to go by: let one of the most exalted genius,
          be chosen, one of the wisest and sagest philosophers of the Gentiles,
          that has studied nature most, and arrived to the highest degree of
          reason and good sense; for instance, let Socrates be the man, who is
          sometimes magnified as &quot;divine&quot;, and in whom the light of
          nature and reason may be thought to be sublimated and raised to its
          highest degree, in the Gentile world, without the help of revelation;
          and yet, as it was in him, it must be a very deficient rule of faith
          and practice; for though he asserted the unity of the divine Being,
          and is said to die a martyr for it; yet he was not clear of the
          heathenish notions of inferior deities, and of worship to be given
          them; for one of the last things spoken by him was, to desire his
          friends to fulfill a vow of his, to offer a rooster to Esculapius, the
          God of health; and he is most grievously slandered, if he was not
          guilty of the love of boys in an unnatural way; and besides, he
          himself bewails the weakness and darkness of human nature, and
          confessed the want of a guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the light of nature and reason be considered in large bodies of
          men, in whole nations, it will appear not to be the same in all. Some
          under the guidance of it have worshiped one sort of deities, and some
          others; have gone into different modes of worship, and devised
          different rites and ceremonies, and followed different customs and
          usages, and even differed in things of a moral nature; and as their
          forefathers, guided by this light, introduced and established the said
          things; they, with all their observations, reflections, and reasonings
          on them, or increase of light, supposing they had any, were never
          able, by the light of nature and reason in them, to prevail over, and
          demolish such idolatry, and such profane and wicked practices that
          obtained among them; and the insufficiency thereof, as a rule and
          guide in religion, will further appear by considering the following
          particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          4a. That there is a God may be known by the light of nature; but
          &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot; he is, men, destitute of a divine
          revelation, have been at a loss about. Multitudes have gone into
          polytheism, and have embraced for gods almost everything in and under
          the heavens; not only the sun, moon, and stars, and mortal men, they
          have deified; but various sorts of beasts, fishes, bird, creeping
          things, and even forms of such that never existed: and some that have
          received the notion of a supreme Being, yet have also acknowledged a
          numerous train of inferior deities, and have worshiped the creature
          besides the Creator; whose folly is represented in a true and full
          light by the apostle, (Romans 1:19-25) and though the unity of the
          divine Being, is the voice of reason as well as of revelation; yet by
          the former, without the latter, we could have had no certain notion,
          if any at all, of three divine persons subsisting in the unity of the
          divine essence; and especially of each of the parts they have taken in
          the economy of man&#x27;s salvation; for as for what Plato and others
          have been supposed to say concerning a Trinity, it is very lame and
          imperfect, and what was borrowed from eastern tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          4b. Though the light of nature may teach men that God, their Creator
          and Benefactor, is to be worshiped by them; and may direct them to
          some parts of worship, as to pray unto him for what they want, and
          praise him for what they have received; yet a perfect plan of worship,
          acceptable to God, could never have been formed according to that; and
          especially that part of it could not have been known which depends
          upon the arbitrary will of God, and consists of positive precepts and
          institutions; hence the Gentiles, left to that, and without a divine
          revelation, have introduced modes of worship the most absurd and
          ridiculous, as well as cruel and bloody, even human sacrifices, and
          the slaughter of their own children, as well as the most shocking
          scenes of debauchery and impurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          4c. By the light of nature men may know that they are not in the same
          condition and circumstances they originally were; for when they
          consider things, they cannot imagine that they were made by a holy
          Being subject to such irregular passions and unruly lusts which now
          prevail in them; but in what state they were made, and how they fell
          from that estate, and came into the present depraved one, they know
          not; and still less how to get out of it, and to be cured of their
          irregularities: but divine revelation informs us how man was made
          upright, and like unto God: and by what means he fell from his
          uprightness into the sinful state he is in; and how he may be
          recovered from it, and brought out of it by the regenerating and
          sanctifying grace of the Spirit of God, and not otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          4d. Though, as the apostle says, the Gentiles without the law,
          &quot;do by nature the things contained in the law; and are a law to
          themselves, which show the work of the law written on their hearts;
          their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts the
          meanwhile accusing, or else excusing one another&quot;, (Romans 2:14,
          15) and so have some notion of the difference between moral good and
          evil; yet this is not so clear and extensive, but that some of the
          greatest moralists among them gave into the most notorious vices, and
          allowed of them, and recommended them; Chrysippus allowed of incest;
          Plato commended community of wives; Socrates a plurality of wives, and
          which he enforced by his own example; Cicero pleaded for fornication;
          the Stoics, a grave set of moralists, for the use of obscene words,
          and recommended suicide as becoming a wise man, and as his duty to
          commit in some cases. So dim was this light of nature in things of a
          moral kind!
        </p>
        <p>
          4e. Though in many cases reason taught them that certain vices were
          disagreeable to God, and resented by him, and he was displeased with
          them, and would punish for them; and they were very desirous of
          appeasing him; but then how to reconcile him to them, and recommend
          themselves to his favor, they were quite ignorant; and therefore took
          the most shocking and detestable methods for it, as human sacrifices,
          and particularly burning their innocent infants. But revelation shows
          us the more excellent way.
        </p>
        <p>
          4f. Men may, by the light of nature, have some notion of sin as an
          offence to God, and of their need of forgiveness from him; and from a
          general notion of his mercy, and of some instances of kindness to
          them, may entertain some faint hope of the pardon of it; but then they
          cannot be certain of it from thence, or that even God will pardon sin
          at all, the sins of any man; and still less how this can be done
          consistent with his holiness and justice: but through divine
          revelation we come at a clear and certain knowledge of this doctrine,
          and of its consistence with the divine perfections.
        </p>
        <p>
          4g. The light of nature leaves men entirely without the knowledge of
          the way of salvation by the Son of God. And even without revelation,
          angels of themselves would not be able to know the way of saving
          sinful men, or how sinful men can be justified before God; wherefore,
          in order to know this; they &quot;desire to look into it&quot;, (1
          Peter 1:12). Some have thought that Socrates had some notion of it;
          who is made to say[9], &quot;It is necessary to wait until someone
          teaches how to behave towards God and men:&quot; but then this
          respects only a man&#x27;s outward conduct, and not his salvation: nor
          does the philosopher seem to have any clear notion of the instructor,
          and of the means he should use to instruct, and still less of the
          certainty of his coming; and besides, the relator of this, Plato,
          might receive this as a tradition in the East, where it is well known
          he traveled for knowledge. But the divine revelation gives an account
          of this glorious person, not merely as an instructor of men in the way
          of their duty, but as a Savior of them from their sins; and in what
          way he has wrought out salvation, by his sacrifice, blood, and
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          4h. The light of nature is far from giving any clear and certain
          account of the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the body,
          and a future state of happiness and misery: as for the immortality of
          the soul, the heathens rather wished it to be true than were fully
          satisfied of it; they that were for it made use of but mean arguments
          to prove it; and they themselves believed it only &quot;fide
          dimidiata&quot;, as Minutius Felix expresses it, with a divided faith;
          they did, as it were, but half believe it; and as for the resurrection
          of the body, that was denied, as Tertullian says, by every sect of the
          philosophers: and in what a low manner do they represent the happiness
          of the future state; by walking in pleasant fields, by sitting under
          fragrant arbors or bowers, and cooling shades, and by shelter from
          inclement weather; by viewing flowing fountains and purling and
          babbling streams; by carnal mirth, feasting, music, and dancing: and
          the misery of it, by being bound neck and heels together, or in
          chains, or fastened to rocks, and whipped by furies, with a scourge of
          serpents, or doomed to some laborious service. But not the least hint
          is given of the presence of God with the one, nor of his absence from
          the other; nor of any sensation of his love or wrath. Let us therefore
          bless God that we have a better rule and guide to go by; &quot;a more
          sure word of prophecy to take heed unto&quot;: let us have constant
          recourse unto it, as the standard of faith and practice; and try every
          doctrine and practice by it, and believe and act as that directs us,
          and fetch everything from it that may be for our good, and the glory
          of God.
