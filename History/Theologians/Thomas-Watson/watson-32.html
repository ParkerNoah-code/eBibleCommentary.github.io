<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Time's Shortness</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">A sermon preached July 2, 1676, at the funeral of Pastor 
    John Wells</p>
<p align="justify">"But this I say, brethren, <b>the time is short</b>." 1 
    Corinthians 7:29</p>
<p align="justify">The blessed Apostle in these words shows us what our 
    station in the world is, and what all our secular enjoyments are. They are 
    short and transient. "But this I say, brethren, the time is short." The text 
    consists of two parts:</p>
<p align="justify">1. A kind address—"Brethren." </p>
<p align="justify">2. A seasonable admonition—"The time is short."</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. A kind address—"Brethren."</p></b></font> The saints of 
    God are brethren. They are <i>cemented together with the blood of Christ</i>. 
    Then let there be no strife among them, seeing they are brethren (Genesis 
    13:8). Believers are regenerated by the same Spirit; they suck the same 
    breasts—the promises; and wear the same garment—Christ's righteousness. They 
    sit at the same board—the table of the Lord; and partake of the same 
    glory—the inheritance in light (Colossians 1:12). Should they not love one 
    another? There ought to be no contending among God's people—but as to who 
    would love most.
<p align="justify">Satan foments discord and warms himself at the fire of 
    men's passions. If he cannot divide the spiritual members from their Head, 
    he will endeavor to make them smite one against another. If he cannot keep 
    the saints from heaven, he will endeavor to make them fight with one another 
    along the way.</p>
<p align="justify">It was ill for Abraham's herdsmen and Lot's to fight with 
    one another, when the Canaanite was in the land (Genesis 13:7). It is an ill 
    time for mariners to be fighting, when the enemy is boring a hole in the 
    bottom of the ship. Take heed that the popish enemy does not enter at your 
    breaches.</p>
<p align="justify">Let Christians remember they are brethren. Unity among 
    brethren resembles the harmony among angels. Psalm 133:1-3: "Behold, how 
    good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. It is like 
    the precious ointment upon the head, as the dew of Hermon." It is compared 
    to <i>ointment </i>because it is sweet; and compared to the <i>dew </i>of 
    Hermon because it makes everything fruitful. The primitive Christians were 
    of one heart (Acts 4:32).</p>
<p align="justify">Let us pray that that golden motto may be written upon 
    the churches: "One heart and one way" (Jeremiah 32:39). What a blessed place 
    will heaven be, where our <i>light </i>shall be clear, our <i>love </i>shall 
    be perfect, and our <i>joy </i>shall be full.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A seasonable admonition—"The time is short." </p></b>
</font>This word "time" I shall take more strictly as the term and period of 
    man's life. The time is short. The diverse instances of <i>mortality</i>, 
    may serve as so many commentaries upon the text. The Greek word for "short" 
    alludes to mariners who roll up their sails and bring them into a narrow 
    compass when the ship draws near the harbor. Though the sails of man's life 
    were spread larger in the times of the patriarchs, now God is folding up 
    these sails in a narrower compass: "The time is short." The Scripture 
    frequently asserts the brevity and transitoriness of man's life. Psalm 
    89:47: "Remember how short my time is." Psalm 39:5: "Behold, You have made 
    my days as a hand-breadth," which is the least of the geometrical measures.
<p align="justify">Job used three elegant metaphors to set forth the 
    shortness of man's life. Job 9:25-26: "My life passes more swiftly than a <i>
    runner</i>. It disappears like a <i>swift boat</i>, like an <i>eagle </i>
    that swoops down on its prey." If we look to the land, man's life is like a 
    swift <i>runner</i>. If we look to the sea, it is like a swift <i>ship</i>. 
    If we look to the air, there it is like a flying <i>eagle</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Life is compared to a <i>cloud </i>(Job 7:9). A cloud is 
    a vapor drawn up by the sun into the middle region of the air. When this 
    cloud comes to its full proportion, it is soon dispersed and blown away with 
    the wind. Life gathers as a cloud, bigger and bigger—but all of a sudden it 
    is dissipated by death. Our life is but a breath, even less. Psalm 39:5: "My 
    life is no longer than the width of my hand. An entire lifetime is just a 
    moment to you; human existence is but a breath." There is but a span between 
    the cradle and the grave. Solomon said, "There is a time to be <i>born</i>—and 
    a time to <i>die</i>" (Ecclesiastes 3:2)—but mentions no time of <i>living</i>—as 
    if that were so short, it were not worth speaking of.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. <font color="#0000ff"><b>In what sense is the 
    time of life short?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is short in respect to the
    <font color="#b07050"><b>uncertainty</b></font>—it may instantly expire. Our 
    time is short, because of the uncertainty. Hezekiah, it is true, had a lease 
    of fifteen years sealed (Isaiah 38:5)—but we have no such lease sealed for 
    us—death may be within a day's march.</p>
<p align="justify">There are so many casualties, that it is a wonder if the 
    slender thread of our life is not cut off by an untimely death. Have you not 
    seen a virgin on the same day dressed in her bridal apparel—and her winding 
    sheet?</p>
<p align="justify">Time is short in respect to its <font color="#b07050"><b>
    improvement</b></font>. If we reckon that for <i>time which is well-spent</i>, 
    then time is brought into a narrow compass indeed. A great part of our time 
    lies <i>fallow</i>. Take from our life all the time of eating, drinking, 
    sleeping, besides idle impertinences—and then how short is our time! How 
    little is the time wherein we can truly say, "This time I have <i>lived</i>!" 
    Oh, how little is the time which is spent with God! Time misemployed is not 
    time lived—but time lost.</p>
<p align="justify">Time is short <font color="#b07050"><b>compared with 
    eternity</b></font>. There is no telescope which can see to the end of 
    eternity. Eternity is a day which has no sun setting. It is a <i>circle—</i>without 
    beginning or end. Eternity is a <i>sum</i> which can never be numbered, a 
    line which can never be measured. Reckon as many millions of years as there 
    have been minutes since the creation, and they stand as ciphers in eternity. 
    The most elevated strains of rhetoric cannot reach eternity. It is a sea 
    without bottom—or banks. Time may be compared to a spot of earth lying at 
    the mouth of the great ocean. Time is a spot on this side of eternity. What 
    a little spot of that, is man's life! Thus you see, in this sense, time is 
    short.</p>
<p align="justify">It will not be long before the silver cord is loosed and 
    the golden bow broken (Ecclesiastes 12:6). Time goes on apace. The poets 
    painted time with <i>wings, </i>because it flies so fast. In Joshua's days, 
    when the sun and moon stood still, time went on. In Hezekiah's reign, when 
    the sun went ten degrees backward, time went forward.<i> Our whole life is 
    nothing else but a passage to death</i>—where there is no staying by the way 
    or slacking our pace.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1.</p></b></font> See what a poor inconsiderable thing 
    life is. The time is short, and upon this <i>small wire of time </i>hangs 
    the <i>weight of eternity</i>. Life is but a short scene acted here. It is 
    but a vapor or puff of wind (James 4:14). Life is made up of a few flying 
    minutes. Oh, then, how imprudent are those, who will damn their souls to 
    save their lives! He would be unwise who, to preserve a short lease, would 
    lose his inheritance. How many there are who, to preserve this short life, 
    will take sinful courses, defraud and oppress and build up an estate—but 
    will pull down their souls! Many, to save their skins, will destroy their 
    souls.
<p align="justify">It is better to endure a blow on our body or estate—than 
    suffer our precious soul to be damaged. The soul is the man of the man. The 
    soul is the princely part, crowned with reason. It carries in it some faint 
    idea or resemblance of God. The soul is a rich diamond set in clay. What 
    folly it is to save the clay—and lose the diamond! Tiberius the emperor, for 
    a drink of water—lost his kingdom!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2. EXHORTATION.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">BRANCH 1.</p></b></font> Is time so uncertain and short?
    <font color="#008000"><b>Let us often contemplate the shortness of life. </b>
</font><i>Feathers </i>swim upon the water—but <i>gold </i>sinks into it. 
    Light, feathery people float in vanity—but serious Christians sink deep into 
    the thoughts of their death. Deuteronomy 32:29: "Oh, that they were 
    wise—that they would consider their latter end." Forgetfulness of the latter 
    end—makes <i>life </i>sinful—and <i>death </i>formidable. People naturally 
    shrink back from the thoughts of death. Amos 6:3: "They put far away from 
    them the evil day." When they are young, they hope they shall spin out life 
    to the blossoming of the almond tree. When old age comes, they hope to renew 
    their strength as the eagle, though their bodies are subject to corruption 
    and they feel the symptoms of mortality in them. <i>Deafness of hearing—</i>is 
    death creeping in at the <i>ear</i>. <i>Dimness of sight—</i>is death 
    creeping in at the <i>eye</i>. Yet they are so frantic as to persuade 
    themselves of long life. Bodily <i>diseases </i>are but <i>death's 
    harbingers </i>which go before to prepare a lodging for death. Why, then, do 
    men dream of an earthly eternity? Psalm 49:11: "Their inward thought is that 
    their houses shall continue forever." Where is the man who contemplates 
    time's shortness, or makes another's death a looking-glass in which he may 
    see his own dying face?
<p align="justify">Some may say this discourse of the shortness of time is 
    fit for such as are mortally ill, whom the physicians have given over. But 
    those who are in health, may live many years.</p>
<p align="justify">Though your blood is fresh in your veins, and your bones 
    are full of marrow—you know not how short your time may be. He was not sick 
    nor in fear of sickness who said, "Soul, take your ease—eat, drink, and 
    enjoy yourself." But that very night, death terminated his life (Luke 
    12:20). A strong constitution is no guarantee of a long life. People likely 
    enough to live, have been suddenly taken away by convulsions and strokes. 
    How soon may death sound its alarm! It is reported of Zelenchus that the 
    first he brought into his new house, was a tombstone. Oh, meditate on the <i>
    transitoriness</i> and <i>brittleness</i> of life! Think often of your 
    tombstone!</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. <font color="#b07050"><b>What advantage will 
    accrue to us, by often thinking of our short stay here?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. <b>Meditation on the <i>shortness of time </i>
    would cool the heat of our affections for the WORLD. </b>These visible 
    objects please the fancy—but they do not so much <i>delight </i>us—as <i>
    delude </i>us. They are suddenly gone from us. Worldly things are like a 
    fair picture drawn on the ice—which the sun quickly melts.</p>
<p align="justify">The time is short, so why should we overly love that 
    which we cannot keep over long? 1 Corinthians 7:31: "The <i>fashion </i>(or
    <i>pageant</i>) of the world passes away." Time passes away as a ship in 
    full sail. This, thought on seriously, would mortify covetousness. Paul 
    looked upon himself as ready to loosen anchor and be gone. His love to the 
    world had already died, Galatians 6:14: "The world is crucified to me—and I 
    unto the world." Who would covet that which has neither <i>contentment </i>
    nor <i>continuance</i>? </p>
<p align="justify">Peter had the same view in 2 Peter 1:14: "Knowing that 
    shortly I must put off this my tabernacle." Among the Grecians, the city of 
    Sparta had a king for a year and then he was to lay down his crown—which 
    made everyone strive not to be king. Why should we so toil about the world 
    as if we were to live here forever? What need is there for a long 
    provision—if it is for a short way? If we have enough to bear our charges to 
    heaven, that should suffice. Suppose a man's lease were ready to expire and 
    he should fall to building and planting; would not he be judged to be 
    foolish? When our time is so very short now, to follow the world 
    immoderately, as if we would fetch happiness out of the earth which God has 
    cursed—is a degree of madness. <i>We shall soon have no need of the 
    earth—but to be buried in it!</i></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. <b>Meditation on the shortness of time should 
    be a means to HUMBLE us. </b>Augustine calls humility the mother of the 
    graces. <i>Balm </i>sinks to the bottom of the water. A good Christian sinks 
    low in humility. And what can sooner pull down the flags and banners of 
    pride—than to consider we are shortly dropping into the dust! The priest was 
    to cast the feathers of the fowls by the place of the ashes (Leviticus 
    1:16). Just so, all your feathers of honor must shortly lie in the ashes. 
    Shall not he who is clothed with <i>mortality—</i>be clothed with<i> 
    humility?</i> The thoughts of the grave—should bury our pride.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 3. <b>Meditation on the shortness of time, would 
    hasten our REPENTANCE. </b>Repentance is as necessary, as heaven. As 
    moisture and natural heat preserve life—so repenting tears and a heart 
    burning with love preserve the soul. It is natural to delay repentance. We 
    say with Haggai 1:2, "The time is not yet come." But, the text says, the 
    time is short. Our life is a candle, which is soon blown out.</p>
<p align="justify">The thoughts of time's <i>uncertainty </i>and <i>
    swiftness, </i>would keep us from putting off our repentance. There is no 
    time for us to delay. It is observed of the birds of Norway, that they fly 
    faster than the birds of other countries. By the instinct of nature, knowing 
    the days in that climate to be very short, they therefore make more haste to 
    their nests. The consideration of short abode here, will make us avoid 
    delays and fly faster to heaven upon the wing of repentance.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 4. <b>Meditation on the shortness of time would 
    give us an antidote against the TEMPTATIONS of Satan. </b>Temptation is 
    Satan's eldest daughter, who woos for him. Satan does more mischief by his
    <i>wiles—</i>than his <i>darts</i>. He knows how to suit his temptation, as 
    the farmer knows what seed is proper for such a soil. Satan tempted Achan 
    with a wedge of gold; and David with beauty. It is hard to keep up the <i>
    banks of grace </i>against the <i>sea of temptation</i>. I know no better 
    remedy against Satan's immodest solicitations than this text: "the time is 
    short."</p>
<p align="justify">"What, Satan, do you tempt me to vanity—when I am going 
    to give up my accounts at the judgment? Shall I now be sinning—when tomorrow 
    I may be dying! How shall I look my judge in the face!" Christian, when 
    Satan sets sinful pleasure before you, show him a death's-head. This will 
    make temptations vanish.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 5. <b>The consideration of the shortness of our 
    stay in the world would be a help to TEMPERANCE. </b>It would make us sober 
    and moderate in the use of worldly comforts. By excess, we turn lawful 
    things into sinful things. The bee may suck a little honey from the <i>
    flower</i>—but put it into a <i>barrel </i>of honey—and it is drowned. We 
    may with Jonathan dip the end of the rod in honey—but not thrust it in too 
    far. The flesh, when pampered, rebels. The best preservative against 
    intemperance is this—the time is short!</p>
<p align="justify">The Egyptians at their great banquets, used to bring in 
    the image of a dead man, and say to their guests, "Look upon this—and 
    proceed in your banquet." An excellent antidote against excess. Joseph of 
    Arimathea erected a sepulcher in his garden—to spice his flowery delights 
    with the thoughts of death.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 6. <b>Meditation on the shortness of time would 
    much mitigate our grief for the loss of dear RELATIONS. </b>It is observable 
    that when the Apostle said, "The time is short," he immediately added. "Let 
    those who weep be as if they wept not."</p>
<p align="justify">No doubt the loss of relations is grievous to the fleshly 
    part. It is like pulling a limb from the body. When God strikes us in our 
    right eye—we weep. It is lawful to give vent to our grief. Joseph wept over 
    his dead father. But though true religion does not <i>banish </i>grief, it
    <i>bounds </i>it. We must weep—as if we wept not. Rachel's sin was that she 
    refused to be comforted (Matthew 2:18). If anything can stop the issue of 
    sorrow, at least assuage it, it is this, "The time is short." We shall 
    shortly have our losses made up and enjoy our godly relations again in 
    heaven!</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 7. <b>Meditation on the shortness of time would 
    make us highly value GRACE. </b><i>Time </i>is short—but <i>grace </i>is 
    forever. 1 John 2:27: "The anointing which you have received from Him <i>
    abides </i>in you." Grace is a blossom of eternity; it is an immortal seed 
    (1 John 3:9). Grace is not <i>blasted </i>by death—but <i>transplanted </i>
    into a better soil. Grace is not a lease which soon expires—but an 
    inheritance entailed forever. He who has true grace can no more lose it—than 
    the angels can, who are fixed in their heavenly orb. Grace shall outlast 
    time—and run parallel with eternity.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">BRANCH 2. If time is so short and winged, take heed of 
    MISSPENDING this short time. </p></b></font>To misspend time, is the worse 
    wastefulness.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Take heed of spending time UNPROFITABLY.</p></b></font> 
    Domitian wasted much of his time in <i>catching flies</i>. Many live merely 
    to cumber the ground. Judges 10:4: "Jair had thirty sons who rode around on 
    thirty donkeys" and they died. So it may be said, such a one was born in the 
    reign of such a king and he possessed such an estate—and he died. His <i>
    life </i>was scarcely worth a prayer—or his <i>death </i>worth a tear. An 
    idle person is a <i>cipher</i> in the world—and God writes down no ciphers 
    in the Book of Life. Many are like the wood of the vine—useless. Ezekiel 
    15:3: "Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?" 
<p align="justify">Too many resemble the lilies which do not toil, neither 
    do they spin. They spend their time as the emperor Caligula. He was at a 
    great expense to provide a navy, and when it was provided he sent his 
    mariners to sea to gather cockle-shells, and so they sailed home again. God 
    has furnished men with precious time wherein they may work out salvation—and 
    they employ it in foolish vanities. What <i>reward </i>can be expected—when 
    there is no <i>work </i>done? Who is crowned as a conqueror—who never 
    fights? Matthew 25:30: "Cast the <i>unprofitable </i>servant into utter 
    darkness!"</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Take heed of spending time VICIOUSLY.</p></b></font> Many 
    spend their short time in drinking, gaming, and whoring. Esau lost the 
    blessing, while he was hunting. Many lose heaven, while they hunt after 
    sinful pleasures. Sin is boiled to a great height in this age. Men count it 
    a shame, not to be vile. They are steeped and boiled in wickedness! They 
    live in the world to infect others—as the cockatrice with its breath poisons 
    the herbs. What a dreadful account will they have to give, who have nothing 
    to show God but their sins!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">BRANCH 3. If the time of life is so short, let us IMPROVE 
    it.</p></b></font> Ephesians 5:16: "Redeeming the time." If a man had but a 
    short time on a farm, he would make the best improvement of it and get as 
    good a crop as he could out of it before he left it. The thoughts of our 
    short stay here on earth, should make us improve this <i>little inch </i>of 
    time.'
<p align="justify">That we may do this better, remember we are accountable 
    to God for our time. God will say, "What have you done with your time?" If a 
    master entrusts his steward with money and goods—he expects that he should 
    give him an account of what he has done with them—and how he has employed 
    them. All of us are stewards, and God will call us to a reckoning and say, 
    "What have you done with the talent of time which I entrusted you with?"</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION: <font color="#b07050"><b><i>How </i>should we 
    improve this short time?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER: In general, mind salvation work (Philippians 
    2:12). He who lays up gold and silver is wise for his children—but he who 
    gets salvation is wise for himself.</p>
<p align="justify">Especially, improve this short time by a serious 
    examination. Examine how the case stands between God and your souls. 2 
    Corinthians 13:5: "Examine yourselves." Examine yourselves—as the goldsmith 
    does his gold. Time is short, and what if God should say this night, "Give 
    an account of your stewardship!"</p>
<p align="justify">Reckon with yourselves about your debts. Are your debts 
    paid—and your sins pardoned? Reckon with yourselves about making your will. 
    Time is short; you may die before night. Have you made your will? I mean, in 
    a spiritual sense, have you given up your will to God and, by solemn vow—set 
    seal to the will? They are most fit to resign their souls to God—who have 
    resigned their wills to Him.</p>
<p align="justify">Call yourselves to account about your evidences for 
    heaven. Are your evidences ready? Your desires are your evidences. Do you 
    desire Christ for Himself—as beauty is loved for itself? Can nothing quench 
    your thirst but Christ's blood? Is your desire quickened into endeavor? This 
    is a blessed sign.</p>
<p align="justify">For lack of this self-examination, many who are well 
    known to others—are unknown to themselves. They know not where they shall go 
    when they die—or to what coast they shall sail—to hell or to heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">Improve this short time, by laying hold of all the 
    seasons and opportunities for your souls. The mariner takes the fittest 
    season; he sets to sea while the wind blows. <i>Time </i>is short, and <i>
    opportunity </i>(which is the cream of time) is shorter. Let not the seasons 
    of mercy slip away unimproved.</p>
<p align="justify">While God's Spirit strives with you, nourish His sweet 
    whispers and motions. When the dove came flying to the windows of the ark, 
    Noah reached out his hand and pulled it into the ark. So when God's Spirit 
    (this blessed dove) comes to you, entertain and welcome Him into the ark of 
    your souls. If you repulse the Spirit, He may refuse to strive any more. 
    Gospel seasons, though they are sweet, are swift.</p>
<p align="justify">While God's ministers are with you, make use of them. 
    Zechariah 1:5: "The prophets, do they live forever?" Their time (by reason 
    of their labors) is scarcely so long as others. We read of lamps within the 
    pitchers in judges 7:16. Ministers are lamps—but these lamps are in earthen 
    pitchers, which soon break. Though ministers carry the word of life in their 
    mouths—yet they carry death in their faces! Improve their labors while you 
    have them. They thirst for your happiness and, as so many bells—would chime 
    in your souls to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Improve this short time by keeping up a close communion 
    with God. 1 John 1:3: "Our communion is with the Father." This sweet 
    communion with God is kept up by <i>holy meditation</i>. Genesis 24:63: 
    "Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening." <i>Meditation 
    cements divine truths into the mind. </i>It brings God and the soul 
    together. Meditation is the bellows of the affections. It gives a sight and 
    a taste of invisible glory. Psalm 104:34: "My meditation of Him shall be <i>
    sweet</i>."</p>
<p align="justify">Communion with God is kept up by <i>prayer</i>. Praying 
    days are ascension days. Caligula placed his effigies in the capitol, 
    whispering in Jupiter's ears. <i>Prayer whispers in God's ears. </i>It is a 
    secret parley and conversation with God. On this <i>mount </i>of prayer, the 
    soul has many sweet <i>transfigurations</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Improve this short time by doing all the service you can 
    for God. Wisdom may be learned from an enemy. Satan is more fierce because 
    he knows his time is short (Revelation 12:12). We would act more vigorously 
    for God seeing our time is short. Our lives should be as <i>jewels</i>—though 
    little in quantity yet great in value. Paul knew his stay in the world was 
    short, therefore, how zealous and active was he for God while he lived! 1 
    Corinthians 15:10: "I labored more abundantly than they all." Paul's 
    obedience did not move as slowly as the sun on the dial—but as swift as the 
    sun in the sky. Is time short? Let us be "God-exalters." Let us bring glory 
    to God in doing good to others. As aromatic trees sweat out their precious 
    oils, so should we lay out our strength for the good of others.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us do good to their souls and convince the ignorant, 
    strengthen the weak, and bring back the wandering. A good Christian is both 
    a diamond and a lodestone—a diamond sparkling in sanctity; and a lodestone 
    for his attractive virtue in drawing others to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us do good to their bodies. Many at this day say to 
    their sorrows, "You are our companions." Let our fingers drop with the myrrh 
    of liberality. Hebrews 13:16: "Don't forget to do good and to share what you 
    have with those in need, for such sacrifices are very pleasing to God." Let 
    us feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and be temporal saviors to others.</p>
<p align="justify">Could we thus improve our time—our lives, though short, 
    would be sweet. This would be the way to cast abroad a fragrant, redolent 
    smell in God's church, like the orange trees which perfume the air where 
    they grow.</p>
<p align="justify">Could we thus improve our time, we might have our 
    consciences drawing up a certificate for us, as in 2 Corinthians 1:12. Then 
    it does not matter if the world censures—as long as conscience acquits; it 
    does not matter how cross the wheels go—if the clock strikes rightly.</p>
<p align="justify">Could we thus improve our time, we might have an easy and 
    joyful passage out of the world. This was Hezekiah's comfort when he thought 
    he was lying on his deathbed. 2 Kings 20:3: "I beseech You, O Lord, remember 
    how I have done that which is good in Your sight." To improve time aright 
    answers God's cost, credits true religion, and saves the soul.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 3. Let this strike terror into every wicked person 
    who exhausts his strength in sin; his time is short—and then begins his 
    hell.</p></b></font> He spends his life in a frolic. He takes the timbrel and 
    harp and rejoices at the sound of the organ (Job 21:12). But the time is 
    shortly coming, when all his mirth shall cease. Revelation 18:22, "Never 
    again will the sound of music be heard there—no more harps, songs, flutes, 
    or trumpets." "All the fancy things you loved so much are gone. The luxuries 
    and splendor that you prized so much will never be yours again. They are 
    gone forever." Revelation 18:14. The grave buries all a sinner's joy.<i> 
    When a wicked man dies—the devil gets a windfall.
</i>
<p align="justify">Satan (in Samuel's shape) said to Saul, 1 Samuel 28:19, 
    "You shall be with me tomorrow." The sinner has his lusts today—and may be 
    with the devil tomorrow! Who would envy the wicked their honor or pleasure? 
    They must pay dearly for it! They have a short feast—but a long reckoning! 
    For a drop of mirth, they must drink a sea of wrath! And who knows the power 
    of that wrath? Bellarmine said that if a man had a sight of hell—it would be 
    enough to make a drunken person sober.</p>
<p align="justify">Hell is the epitome of torment. The sacrifice of jealousy 
    was to have no <i>oil </i>nor <i>frankincense </i>put to it (Numbers 5:15). 
    In hell, there is no <i>oil of mercy </i>put to the torments of the wicked 
    to assuage them; nor is there any <i>incense of prayer </i>to appease God's 
    wrath. Oh, that sinners would in time break off their iniquities! What has 
    become of their intellect—have they sinned away reason as well as 
    conscience? The time of life is short—but the torments of hell are 
    lengthened out! Revelation 14:11: "The smoke of their torment ascends up 
    forever and ever!"</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 4. Here is a light side of the text to the godly.</p></b></font> 
    They may be glad that their time here is short. They cannot really live—but 
    by dying. Behold, there is <i>honey </i>at the end of the <i>rod</i>.
<p align="justify">The time being short, their <font color="#b07050"><b>
    sinning </b></font>time cannot be long. Sin is a troublesome inmate. Romans 
    7:24 says that Paul, that bird of paradise, sighed and groaned under 
    corruption. A child of God mingles sin with his duties. He cannot write a 
    copy of holiness, without blotting. There's a part of a regenerate heart 
    that sides with Satan. But be of good comfort, the time is short. It is but 
    for a short while, Christians, that you shall be combating a proud, 
    unbelieving heart. The year of <i>release </i>is coming. Death does to the 
    godly as the angel did to Peter—it <i>smites </i>them, and makes their 
    chains of sin fall off!</p>
<p align="justify">The time being short, their <font color="#b07050"><b>
    working </b></font>time cannot be long. In this life, much work is cut out. 
    There is the work of the <i>hand</i>, as the artificer works in his trade 
    (Proverbs 10:4). There is the work of the <i>head</i>. <i>Notions </i>are 
    the children of the brain, and there is labor in bringing them forth. There 
    is the work of the <i>heart</i>, which is the hardest work—to search, 
    cleanse, and watch the heart. As a clock sometimes goes faster, sometimes 
    slower, so the heart sometimes goes faster in sin, sometimes slower in duty. 
    But here is the saint's comfort—their working time is short. Revelation 
    14:13: "They will rest from their labors." When their <i>bodies </i>return 
    to dust—their <i>souls </i>return to rest.</p>
<p align="justify">The time being short, their <font color="#b07050"><b>
    suffering </b></font>time cannot be long. Life is laden with trouble, "How 
    frail is humanity! How short is life, and how full of trouble!" Job 14:1. 
    You may as well separate weight from lead—as trouble from a man's life.<i> 
    We come into the world with a cry—and go out with a groan! </i>Everyone has 
    his <i>yoke</i>, and it is well if there is not a <i>nail </i>in it.<i> 
    Though the cross is heavy—we have but a little way to carry it. </i>Death 
    will give the godly a writ of ease. Job 3:17: "There (in the grave) the 
    wicked cease from troubling."</p>
<p align="justify">The time being short, their <font color="#b07050"><b>
    waiting </b></font>time cannot be long. The godly shall not be long out of 
    heaven. While the blessed angels see the orient beauties which shine in 
    God's face, believers live far from court, being imprisoned in the body. 
    Here they rather <i>desire </i>God—than <i>enjoy </i>Him. But the time is 
    short, perhaps a few days or hours—and the saints shall be solacing 
    themselves in the light of God's countenance. They shall leave their pillow 
    of <i>thorns—</i>and lay their head on Christ's bosom! Faith gives a <i>
    propriety </i>in God; death gives a <i>possession</i>. The wagons and 
    chariots came rattling to old Jacob—but they were to carry him to his son, 
    Joseph. Death's chariot wheels may come rattling to a believer—but it is to 
    carry him home to his Father's house!</p>
<p align="justify">In that paradise of God, a Christian shall have more than 
    he can ever imagine (Ephesians 3:20). He can imagine, "What if every 
    mountain were a pearl, every flower a ruby, every sand in the sea a diamond, 
    the whole globe a shining gem?" But all his thoughts are too low and 
    dwarf-like to reach the glory of the celestial pyramids. The heavenly reward 
    (as Augustine said) <i>exceeds faith—</i>and, as the time is short, a 
    Christian shall be in heaven before he is aware. Then he shall bathe his 
    soul in those perfumed pleasures of paradise, which run at God's right hand 
    forevermore!</p>
<p align="justify">I am done with the text. Let me speak to the occasion. We 
    are meeting here to commemorate the death of an eminent minister in this 
    city, Mr. John Wells. I am sorry I am the actor in this mournful scene. But 
    being requested by him in his life (in case I survived), I was willing to do 
    this last office of love.</p>
<p align="justify">There has been a great mortality of ministers lately. The 
    men of the world need not be so fierce against God's ministers; they will 
    not trouble them long. God's taking away His ministers so fast (two in a 
    day) bodes much evil. It presages the fall of a house—when the pillars are 
    removed.</p>
<p align="justify">Concerning this reverend brother deceased, it is not my 
    purpose to use any exaggerated eulogies; only give me permission to strew a 
    few <i>flowers </i>upon his casket.</p>
<p align="justify">Our worthy friend was endued with learning and 
    volubleness of speech. He could rightly divide the Word as a workman who 
    needed not to be ashamed. He had seals to his ministry. Some of his hearers 
    might call him their spiritual father.</p>
<p align="justify">Regarding his piety, he was not only a <i>follower </i>of 
    that which was good—but a <i>leader</i>. He said not long before his death, 
    that he was sure that he loved God. He was fixed to his principles. Though 
    he is by death a <i>fallen </i>star, he was not a <i>wandering </i>star.</p>
<p align="justify">His disposition was not morose—but affable. He was a man 
    of candor and courtesy. He obliged and won the affections of many to him. 
    When <i>grace </i>and <i>sweetness of nature </i>meet—it is like a diamond 
    in a gold ring.</p>
<p align="justify">Regarding his preaching, he preached intelligibly to the 
    capacity of his assembly of hearers, because he was sure that a minister 
    would never touch the hearts of his hearers if he shot over their heads. 
    Ministers should be <i>stars </i>to give light, not <i>clouds </i>to darken 
    the truth. Clearness is the grace of speech. Gregory Nazianzen preached 
    plainly to the ignorant—yet was admired by the learned.</p>
<p align="justify">He was conscientious and painstaking in his work. Sloth 
    in a minister, is as bad as sleep in a sentinel. He would not offer that to 
    God, that which cost him nothing. Christ <i>bled </i>for souls; well may we
    <i>sweat</i>. This good man, like a candle, consumed himself while he gave 
    light to others.</p>
<p align="justify">He was a man of a forgiving spirit. He was not troubled 
    with the overflowing of gall. <i>Kindnesses </i>he wrote in marble; <i>
    injuries </i>he forgot. He was very <i>charitable</i>. The backs and bellies 
    of the poor, were the <i>furrows </i>where he sowed the seeds of his 
    liberality. But though his charity <i>shone</i>, he did not care that it 
    might <i>blaze</i>. He is now taken from the evil to come.</p>
<p align="justify">For you who sat under his ministry, let me tell you that 
    you have lost a friend and a guide. You have cause to be dear mourners. Let 
    me request only this of you, that you would remember the many good 
    instructions given you. Though he is dead, let not his sermons die, too—but 
    labor to copy them in your lives.</p>
