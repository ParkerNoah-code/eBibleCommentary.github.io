    One Thing Necessary</b></font></font></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson </p>
<p align="center">"Work out your own salvation with fear <br/>
    and trembling." Philippians 2:12 <br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">If there is anything <i>excellent</i>—it is salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">If there is anything <i>necessary</i>—it is working out 
    salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">If there is any <i>tool </i>to work with—it is holy fear. 
    "Work out your salvation with fear."</p>
<p align="justify">The words are a grave and serious exhortation, needful, 
    not only for those Christians who lived in the apostle's time, but may fitly 
    be calculated for the meridian of this age wherein we live. </p>
<p align="justify">I proceed now to the EXHORTATION, "Work out your own 
    salvation with fear and trembling," which words do branch themselves into 
    these three particulars: </p>
<p align="justify">First, the <b>act</b>—work out; </p>
<p align="justify">secondly, the <b>object</b>—your own salvation; </p>
<p align="justify">thirdly, the <b>manner</b> in which we should work it 
    out—with fear and trembling. </p>
<p align="justify">I shall speak principally of the first two, and draw in 
    the other briefly in the application. <br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">I. The ACT—work out.</p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">The proposition is this—It should be a Christian's great 
    work to be working out his salvation. The great God has put us into the 
    world as into a vineyard, and here is the work He has set us about—the 
    working out of salvation. There is a parallel Scripture to this: "Give 
    diligence to make your calling and election sure" (2 Pet. 1:10). When 
    estate, friends, life cannot be made sure—let this be made sure. The 
    original Greek signifies to study, or beat the brains about a thing. These 
    words in the text, "work out," imply two things. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">First, a shaking off spiritual sloth. </p></b>Sloth is a 
    pillow on which many have slept the sleep of death. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Secondly, it implies a uniting and rallying together all 
    the powers of our souls that we may attend the business of salvation.</p></b> 
    God has enacted a law in Paradise—that no man should eat of the tree of 
    life, but only in the sweat of his brows. 
<p align="justify">I proceed now to </p></font>
<font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>the REASONS enforcing this holy 
    sweat and industry about salvation</b></font><font face="Verdana">, and they 
    are three. We must work out our salvation because of—
<p align="justify">1. The difficulty of this work. </p>
<p align="justify">2. The rareness of it. </p>
<p align="justify">3. The possibility of it.</p>
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The DIFFICULTY of this work.</p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">It is a work that may make us labor to the going down of 
    the sun of our life (Dan. 6:14) Now this difficulty about the work of 
    salvation will appear four manner of ways. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">First, from the nature of the work.</p></b> <i>The heart is 
    to be changed.</i> The heart is the very nursery of sin. It is the treasure 
    where all the weapons of unrighteousness lie. It is a lesser hell. The heart 
    is full of antipathy against God; it is angry with converting grace. That 
    the bias of the heart should be changed—what a work is this! How should we 
    beg of Christ, that He who turned the water into wine would turn the water, 
    or rather <i>poison </i>of nature—into the wine of grace? 
<p align="justify"><i>The heart will be ready to deceive us in this work of 
    salvation, and make us take a show of grace, for grace. </i>Many think they 
    repent when it is not the offence of sin—but the penalty of sin, which 
    troubles them; not the treason, but the bloody axe. They think they repent 
    when they shed a few tears; but though this ice begins to melt a little, it 
    freezes again; they go on still in sin. Many weep for their unkind dealings 
    with God, as Saul did for his unkindness to David. "He said to David, You 
    are more righteous than I; for you have rewarded me good, whereas I have 
    rewarded you evil" (1 Sam. 24:17). "And Saul lifted up his voice and wept" 
    (I Sam. 24:16). But for all this he follows David again, and pursues after 
    him (1 Sam. 26). </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Secondly, men can lift up their voices and weep for sin, 
    yet follow their sins again.</p></b> 
<b>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, others forsake sin, but still they retain the 
    love of it in their hearts.</p></b><i> </i>Like the snake which casts off its 
    skin, but keeps the sting, there is as much difference between false and 
    true tears as between salt water and spring water. That which makes 
    salvation-work hard, is, that it is<i> a <b>slippery </b>work.</i> "Look to 
    yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought" (2 John 8). 
    This work falls down almost as fast as we build. An ordinary builder, when 
    he has been at work, finds his work the next morning just as he left it; but 
    it is not so with us. When we have been working out salvation by prayer, 
    fasting, meditation, and leave this work a while—we shall not find our work 
    as we left it; a great deal of our work has fallen down again. We had need 
    be often called upon to "Strengthen the things which remain, which are ready 
    to die" (Rev 3:2). No sooner is a Christian taken off from the fire of the 
    sanctuary, but he is ready to cool and freeze again in security. He is like 
    a <b>watch</b>, when he has been wound up towards heaven, he does quickly 
    unwind to earth and sin again. When the gold has been purified in the 
    furnace, it remains pure; but it is not so with the heart. Let it be heated 
    in an ordinance, let it be purged in the furnace of affliction—it does not 
    remain pure, but quickly gathers soil and corruption! We are seldom long in 
    a holy frame. All this shows how difficult the work of salvation is—we must 
    not only work, but set a watch too. 
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But why has God made the way to heaven so hard? 
    Why must there be this working? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. To make us set a high estimate upon heavenly 
    things. If salvation were easily come by, we would not have valued it to its 
    worth. If diamonds were ordinary, they would be slighted; but because they 
    are hard to come by, they are in great esteem. <br/>
 </p>
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><b>2. The RARENESS of this work.</b></p>
</font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">The second reason we must put forth so much holy sweat 
    and industry about salvation is because of the rareness of this work. 
    "Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said 
    to them, "Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, 
    I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to." Luke 13:23-24 </p>
<p align="justify">There are but <b>few </b>who shall be saved; therefore we 
    had need work the harder that we may be in the number of these few! The way 
    to hell is a broad way. Hell's highway is paved with riches and pleasure; it 
    has a golden highway; therefore there are daily so many travelers in it. But 
    the way to heaven lies outside of the road; it is an unbeaten path, and few 
    can find it. </p>
<p align="justify">Those who advocate <i>universal grace </i>say that Christ 
    died intentionally for all; but then why are not all saved? Can Christ be 
    frustrated of His intention? Some are so gross to aver that all shall 
    actually be saved; but has not our Lord Christ told us, "Enter through the 
    narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to 
    destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the 
    road that leads to life, and only a few find it." Matthew 7:13-14. How all 
    can go in at this gate, and yet but few find it, seems to me a 
    contradiction. </p>
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The POSSIBILITY of this work</p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">The third reason why we should put forth so much vigor 
    about the work of salvation is because of the possibility of the work. 
    Impossibility kills all endeavor. Who will take pains for that which he 
    thinks there is no hope of ever obtaining? But "there is hope in Israel 
    concerning this." Salvation is a thing feasible; it may be had. Oh sirs, 
    though the gate of paradise be strait, yet the gate is open! It is shut 
    against the devils, but it is yet open to you! Who would not crowd hard to 
    get in? It is but paring off your sins; it is but unloading some of your 
    thick clay; it is but assuaging your swelling pride—and you may get in at 
    the strait gate. This <i>possibility</i>, no <i>probability</i>, of 
    salvation may put life into your endeavor. If there is food to be had, why 
    should you sit starving in your sins any longer? <br/>
 </p>
</font><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">II. THE OBJECT—your own salvation</p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">And so I proceed to the use of exhortation, to persuade 
    you all in the love of Christ, to set about this great work, "the working 
    out your salvation." Beloved, here is a plot for heaven, and I would have 
    you all in this plot; rally together all the powers of your souls; give 
    neither God nor yourselves rest until you have "made your election sure." 
    Christians, fall to work; do it early, earnestly, incessantly. Pursue 
    salvation as in a holy chase; other things are but matters of convenience; 
    salvation is a matter of necessity. You must either do the work that 
    Christians are doing, or you must do the work that devils are doing. Oh, you 
    who never yet made one stitch in this work of salvation, begin now. Piety is 
    a good trade, if it is well-followed. Be assured there is no salvation 
    without working. But here I must lay down a <i>CAUTION</i> to prevent 
    mistakes.</p>
<p align="justify">Though we shall not be saved without working—yet we are 
    not saved<i> for our working. </i>We do not work out salvation by way of <i>
    merit</i>. Bellarmine says, "We merit heaven out of worthiness." No, though 
    we are saved in the use of means, yet by grace too (Eph. 2:5). There must be 
    ploughing and sowing the ground, but yet no crop can be expected without the 
    influence of the sun. Just so, there must be working, but no crop of 
    salvation can be hoped for without the sunshine of free grace! "It is your 
    Father's good pleasure to <i>give </i>you the Kingdom!" (Luke 12:32). Give? 
    Why, might some say, we have wrought hard for it? Ay, but heaven is a gift 
    of God; though you work for it, yet it is the good pleasure of God to bestow 
    it. Still look up to Christ's merit; it is not your sweat—but His blood that 
    saves. That your working cannot merit salvation is clear, "It is God who 
    works in you to will and to do" (ver. 13). It is not your working, but God's 
    co-working. For as the scrivener guides the child's hand, or he cannot 
    write; so the Spirit of God must afford His auxiliary concurrence, or our 
    work stands still. How then can any man merit by working, when it is God who 
    helps him to work? </p>
<p align="justify">I shall now, having laid down this caution, resume the 
    exhortation, and persuade you to the working out salvation. But I must first 
    remove two objections which lie in the way. </p>
<p align="justify"></p></font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>Objection 
    1.</b> </font><font face="Verdana">You bid us work out salvation—but we have 
    no power to work. 
<p align="justify"><b>Answer</b>. It is true, we have not power; I deny that 
    we have the liberty to work. Man before conversion is purely passive; 
    therefore the Scripture calls it a <i>heart of stone </i>(Ezek. 36:26). A 
    man by nature can no more prepare himself to his own converting than the 
    stone can prepare itself to its own softening. But yet when God begins to 
    draw—we may follow. Those dry bones in Ezekiel could not of themselves live, 
    but when breath came into them, then "they lived, and stood up upon their 
    feet" (Ezek. 37: 10).</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Question</b>. But suppose God has not dropped in a 
    principle of grace? Suppose He has not caused breath to enter? </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Answer</b>. Yet you must use the means. Though you 
    cannot work spiritually, yet work physically; do what you are able, and that 
    for two reasons: </p>
<p align="justify">1. Because a man by neglecting the means—does destroy 
    himself. It is like a man by not going to the physician, may be said to be 
    the cause of his own death. </p>
<p align="justify">2. God is not lacking to us, when we do what we are able. 
    Urge the promise, "Seek and you shall find" (Matt. 7:7). Put this bond in 
    suit by prayer. You say you have no power, but have you not a promise? Act 
    so far as you can. Though I dare not say as the Arminian, when we do exert 
    and put forth nature, God is bound to give grace; yet this I say, God is not 
    lacking to those who seek his grace. No, I will say more—He denies His grace 
    to none but those who willfully refuse it (John 5:40). </p>
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">Objection 2.</p></b></font><font face="Verdana"> The second 
    objection is this; But to what purpose should I work? There is a past 
    decree; if God has decreed I shall be saved, I shall be saved. 
<p align="justify"><b>Answer</b>. God decrees salvation in a way of working 
    (2 Thes. 2:13). Origen, in his book against Celsus, observes a subtle 
    argument of some who disputed about Fate and Destiny. One gave counsel to 
    his sick friend not to send for the physician, because, says he, it is 
    appointed by <i>destiny </i>whether you shall recover or not. If it is your 
    destiny to recover—then you need not the physician; if it is not your 
    destiny to recover—then the physician will do you no good. The like fallacy 
    does the devil use to men; he bids them not work; if God has decreed they 
    shall be saved—they shall be saved, and there is no need of working; if He 
    has not decreed their salvation—then their working will do them no good. 
    This is an argument fetched out of the devil's school. </p>
<p align="justify">But we say—God decrees the end in the use of means. God 
    decreed that Israel should enter into Canaan, but first they must fight with 
    the sons of Anak. God decreed that Hezekiah should recover from his 
    sickness, but he must "prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, 
    and he will recover." (Isa. 38:21). We do not argue thus in other things. A 
    man does not say, "If God has decreed I shall have a crop this year, I shall 
    have a crop; what need I plough, or sow, or fertilize the land?" No! he will 
    use the means—and expect a crop. Though "the blessing of the Lord, it makes 
    rich" (Prov. 10:22), yet it is as true, "the hand of the diligent makes 
    rich" (Prov. 10:4). <i>God's decreeing is carried on by our working! </i></p>

<p align="justify">And thus having removed these objections, let me now 
    persuade you to set about this blessed work—the working out your salvation. 
    And that my words may the better prevail, I shall propound several arguments 
    by way of motive to excite you to this work. </p>
</font><b><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">Argument 1.</p></font><font face="Verdana"> </font></b>
<font face="Verdana">The first argument or motive for working, is taken from
    <i>the preciousness of the soul</i>; well may we take pains that we may 
    secure this from danger. The soul is a divine spark kindled by the breath of 
    God. It is of more value than the world (Matt. 16:26). If the world be the
    <i>book </i>of God, as Origen calls it, the soul is the <i>image </i>of God. 
    The soul is a bright mirror in which some refracted beams of God's wisdom 
    and holiness shine forth; the soul is a blossom of eternity. God has made 
    the soul capable of communion with Himself. It would bankrupt the world, to 
    give half the price of a soul. How highly did Christ value the soul when He 
    sold Himself to buy it? Oh then, what pity is it that this excellent soul 
    (this soul for which God called a council in heaven when he made it) should 
    miscarry and be undone to all eternity! Who would not rather work night and 
    day than lose such a soul? This jewel is invaluable. The loss of the soul is 
    irreparable. 
</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">Argument 2.</p></b> </font><font face="Verdana">Holy activity 
    and industry ennobles a Christian. The more excellent anything is—the more 
    active it is. The <i>sun </i>is a glorious creature, it never stands still, 
    but is going it's circuit round the world. <i>Fire </i>is the purest 
    element, and the most active; it is ever sparkling and flaming. The <i>
    angels </i>are the most noble creatures and the most nimble; therefore they 
    are represented by the cherubim, with their wings displayed. <i>God </i>
    Himself is (as the school men speak) a most pure act. By holy activity we 
    resemble God, who is a most pure act. The phoenix flies with a coronet on 
    its head; the industrious Christian needs not a coronet; his sweat ennobles 
    him; his labor is his ensign of honor. Solomon tells us that "drowsiness 
    shall clothe a man with rags" (Prov. 23:21). Infamy is one of the rags that 
    hang upon him; God hates a dull temper. We read in the law, that the donkey, 
    being a sluggish creature, must not be offered up in sacrifice. Spiritual 
    activity is a badge of honor. 
</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">Argument 3.</p></b></font><font face="Verdana"> Working out 
    salvation is that which <i>will make death and heaven sweet to us. </i>It 
    will sweeten death. He who has been hard at work all day—how soundly does he 
    sleep at night! You who have been working out salvation all your lives, how 
    comfortably may you lay down your head at night in the grave, upon a pillow 
    of dust, in hopes of a glorious resurrection? This will be a deathbed 
    cordial. It will sweeten heaven. <i>The more pains we have taken for 
    heaven—the sweeter will it be when we come there </i>It is delightful for a 
    man to look over his work and see the fruit appear. When he has been 
    planting trees in his orchard, or setting flowers, it is pleasant to behold 
    and review his labors. Thus in heaven, when we shall see the fruit of our 
    labors, "the end of your faith, even the salvation" (1 Pet. 1:9), this will 
    make heaven the sweeter. The more pains we have taken for heaven—the more 
    welcome it will be; the more <i>sweat</i>—the more <i>sweet!</i> When a man 
    has been sinning—the pleasure is gone, and the sting remains. But when he 
    has been repenting—the labor is gone, and the joy remains. 
</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">Argument 4.</p></b> </font><font face="Verdana"><i>Yet you 
    have time to work out your salvation.</i> This text and sermon would be out 
    of season to preach to the damned in hell. If I should bid them work, it is 
    too late; their time is past. It is <i>night </i>with the devils; it is yet
    <i>day </i>with you. Work while it is day (John 9:4). If you lose your day, 
    you lose your souls! This is the season for your souls. Now <i>God </i>
    commands, now the <i>Spirit </i>breathes, now <i>ministers </i>beseech, and 
    as so many bells of Aaron, would chime in your souls to Christ. Oh, improve 
    your season! This is your seed-time, now sow the seeds of faith and 
    repentance. If when you have seasons, you lack hearts, the time may come 
    when you have hearts and you shall lack seasons. Take time while you may; 
    the mariner hoists up his sails while the wind blows. Never had a people a 
    fairer gale for heaven than you of this city, and will you not set forward 
    in your voyage? Oh my brethren, now is the time for your souls, now plead 
    with God for mercy, or at least get Christ to plead for you. Think seriously 
    of these things. 
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">Reasons to think seriously of these things</p></b></font><font face="Verdana">:
<b>
<p align="justify">First, our life does unravel apace.</p></b> Gregory compares 
    our life to the mariner in a ship going full sail; we are every day sailing 
    apace to eternity! 
<b>
<p align="justify">Secondly, the seasons of grace though they are precious, 
    are not permanent. </p></b>Abused mercies will like Noah's dove, take their 
    wings and fly from us. England's golden hour will soon run out; gospel 
    blessings are very <i>sweet</i>, but very <i>swift</i>. "Now they are hidden 
    from your eyes" (Luke 19:42). We know not how soon the golden candlestick 
    may be removed. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, there is a time when the Spirit has done 
    striving. </p></b>There are certain tides of the Spirit, and these being 
    neglected, possibly we may never see another tide come in. When conscience 
    has done speaking, usually the Spirit has done striving. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Fourthly, the loss of gospel opportunities will be the 
    hell of hell.</p></b> When a sinner shall at the last day think with himself, 
    "Oh, what might I have been! I might have been as rich as the angels, as 
    rich as heaven could make me! I had a season to work in—but I lost it!" 
    This, this will be as a vulture gnawing upon him; this will enhance and 
    accent his misery. And let this persuade you speedily to work out your 
    salvation. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Fifthly, you may do this work and not hinder your other 
    work;</p></b> working out salvation and working in a vocation, are not 
    inconsistent. And this I insert to prevent an objection. Some may say, "but 
    if I work so hard for heaven, I shall have no time for my trade." No, 
    surely, the wise God would never make any of His commands to interfere with 
    each other; as He would have you "seek <i>first </i>the kingdom" (Matt. 
    6:33), so he would have you provide for your family (1 Tim. 5: 8); you may 
    drive two trades together. I do not like those who make the church exclude 
    the shop, who swallow up all their time in hearing the word—but neglect 
    their work at home (2 Thes. 3:11). They are like the lilies of the field 
    which toil not, neither do they spin. God never sealed a warrant to 
    idleness. He both commands and commends diligence in a calling, which may 
    the rather encourage us to look after salvation, because this work will not 
    take us off our other work. A man may with Caleb, follow God fully, (Num. 
    14:24) and yet with David be "tending the sheep" (Ps. 78:71). <i>Piety </i>
    and <i>industry </i>may dwell together. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Sixthly, the inexcusableness of those who neglect working 
    out their salvation.</p></b> Methinks I hear God expostulating the case with men 
    at the last day, after this manner, "Why did you not work? I gave you time 
    to work, I gave you light to work by, I gave you My gospel, My ministers. I 
    bestowed talents upon you to trade; I set the recompense of reward before 
    you. Why did you not work out your salvation?" Either it must be <i>sloth
    </i>or <i>stubbornness</i>. Was their any work you did, which was of greater 
    concern? You could work in <i>brick</i>, but not in <i>gold</i>. What can 
    you say for yourselves why the sentence should not pass? Oh, how will the 
    sinner be left speechless at such a time, and how will this cut him to the 
    heart to think with himself he neglected salvation, and could give no reason 
    for it? 
<b>
<p align="justify">Seventhly, the inexpressible misery of such as do not 
    work out salvation.</p></b> Those who sleep in spring—shall beg in harvest. 
    After death, when they look to receive a full crop of glory—they will be put 
    to beg, as Dives, for one drop of water! Vagrant people who will not work 
    are sent to the jail. Such as will not work out salvation, let them know, 
    hell is God's jail, which they must be sent to. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Eighthly, if all this does not prevail, consider what it 
    is we are working for. </p></b>None will take pains for a trifle. But we are 
    working for a crown, for a throne, for a paradise—and all this is comprised 
    in that one word, "salvation." Here is a great incentive to holy industry. 
    All men desire salvation. It is the crown of our hopes; we should not think 
    any labor too much for this. What pains will men take for earthly crowns and 
    scepters! And suppose all the kingdoms of the world were more illustrious 
    than they are — their foundations of gold, their walls of pearl, their 
    windows of sapphire — what is all this, compared to that kingdom we are 
    laboring for? We may as well measure the skies, as set forth this in all its 
    splendor and magnificence. Salvation is a beautiful thing, it is as far 
    above our thoughts as it is beyond our deserts. Oh, how should this add 
    wings to our endeavors! The <i>merchant </i>will run through the intemperate 
    zones of heat and cold for a little prize. The <i>soldier</i>, for a rich 
    booty, will endure the bullet and sword—he will gladly undergo a <i>bloody 
    spring</i> for a <i>golden harvest. </i>Oh then, how much more should we 
    spend our holy sweat for this blessed prize of salvation!

    III. THE MANNER—with fear and trembling</p>
</font></b><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">And so, having laid down some arguments by way of motive, 
    to persuade to this work, I shall now propound some means by way of 
    direction to help us in this work; and here I shall show you what are those
    <b>obstacles </b>to be removed which will hinder our working; and what are 
    those <b>helps</b> to be prosecuted which will further it. </p>
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">1. We must remove those things which will hinder our 
    working out salvation. There are six OBSTACLES in the way to salvation which 
    must be removed. </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">(i) First, the entanglements of the world.</p></b> While the 
    foot is in a snare, a man cannot run. The world is a snare; while our feet 
    are in it, we cannot run the race set before us (Heb. 12:1). If a man were 
    to climb up a steep rock, and had weights tied to his legs, they would 
    hinder his ascent; too many <i>golden weights </i>will hinder us from 
    climbing up this steep rock that leads to salvation. While the <i>mill of a 
    trade </i>is going, it makes such a noise that we can hardly hear the 
    minister "lifting up his voice like a trumpet." The world chokes our zeal 
    and appetite after heavenly things; the earth puts out the fire; the music 
    of the world charms us asleep, and then we cannot work. In mines of gold 
    there are killing damps. Oh, how many souls have been destroyed with a damp 
    arising from the earth! 
<b>
<p align="justify">(ii) The second bar in the way to salvation is sadness 
    and uncheerfulness.</p></b> When a man's heart is sad, he is unfit to go about 
    his work; he is like an untuned instrument. Under fears and discouragements 
    we act but faintly in religion. David labors to chide himself out of this 
    spiritual melancholy, "why are you cast down O my soul?" (Ps. 42:5). 
    Cheerfulness quickens; the Lacedemonians used music in their battles to 
    excite their spirits and make them fight more valiantly. Cheerfulness is 
    like music to the soul, it excites to duty, it oils the wheels of the 
    affections. Cheerfulness makes service come off with delight, and we are 
    never carried so swift in religion as upon the wings of delight. Melancholy 
    takes off our chariot wheels, and then we drive on heavily. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(iii) The third bar in the way to salvation is spiritual 
    sloth. </p></b>This is a great impediment to our working. It was said of Israel, 
    "they despised the pleasant land." (Psalm 106:24) What should be the reason? 
    Canaan was a paradise of delight, a type of heaven; but they thought it 
    would cost them a great deal of trouble and hazard in the getting, and they 
    would rather go without it; they <i>despised </i>the pleasant land. Are 
    there not millions among us who had rather go sleeping to hell, than 
    sweating to heaven? I have read of certain Spaniards who live near where 
    there is great store of fish, yet are so lazy that they will not be at the 
    pains to catch them, but buy of their neighbors. There is such a sinful 
    stupidity and sloth upon the most, that though Christ is near them, though 
    salvation is offered in the gospel, yet they will not work out salvation. 
    "Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep" (Prov. 19:15). Adam lost his rib when 
    he was asleep; many a man loses his soul in this deep sleep! 
<b>
<p align="justify">(iv) The fourth bar in the way to salvation is an opinion 
    of the <i>easiness </i>of salvation. </p></b>"God is merciful, and the worst 
    come to the worst—all I have to do is but repent."
<p align="justify">God is merciful, it is true, but He is also just; He must 
    not wrong His justice by showing mercy; therefore observe that clause in the 
    proclamation, He "will by no means clear the guilty" (Ex. 34:7). If a king 
    did proclaim that only those should be pardoned who came in and submitted to 
    his scepter; could any, still persisting in rebellion, claim the benefit of 
    that pardon? Oh sinner, would you have mercy, and will not disband the 
    weapon of unrighteousness? </p>
<p align="justify">"It is but repent." But repentance is such a mark that we 
    cannot hit, unless God directs our arrow. Tell me, Oh sinner, is it easy for 
    a dead man to live and walk? You are spiritually dead, and wrapped up in 
    your winding sheet (Eph. 2:2). Is regeneration easy? Are there no pangs in 
    the new birth? Is self-denial easy; do you know what religion must cost, and 
    what it may cost? It must cost you the parting with your lusts, it may cost 
    you the parting with your life! Take heed of this obstruction! Salvation is 
    not accomplished lightly; thousands have gone to hell upon this mistake. The 
    broad spectacles of <i>presumption </i>have made the strait gate seem wider 
    than it is! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(v) The fifth bar in the way to salvation is carnal 
    friends. </p></b>It is dangerous listening to their voice. The serpent did speak 
    in Eve. Job's wife would have caged him off from serving God, "Do you still 
    retain your integrity?" (Job 2:9) "What, still pray and weep?" Here the 
    devil did hand over a temptation to Job by his wife. Carnal friends will be 
    calling us off from our work. "What needs all this ado? Less pains will 
    serve." We read that some of Christ's kindred, when they saw Christ so 
    earnest in preaching, would try to stop Him: "they went to lay hold on Him" 
    (Mark 3:2 1). Our friends and kindred would sometimes stand in our way to 
    heaven, and judging our zeal to be madness, would lay hold of us and hinder 
    us from working out our salvation.
<b>
<p align="justify">(vi) The sixth bar in the way to salvation is evil 
    company. </p></b>They will take us off our work. The sweet waters lose their 
    freshness, when they run into the salt water; Christians lose their 
    freshness and savouriness, among the wicked. Christ's doves will be sullied 
    by lying among these filthy pots. Sinful company is like the water in a 
    smith's forge which quenches the iron, be it ever so hot; such evil company 
    cools good affections. The wicked have the plague of the heart (1 Kings 
    8:38), and their breath is infectious. They will discourage us from working 
    out our salvation. Just as he who is a suitor to a woman; and is very 
    earnest in his suit, there comes one and tells him he knows something about 
    the woman of ill report, some impediment; the man hearing this, is presently 
    taken off, and the suit ceases. So it is with many a man who begins to be a 
    suitor to religion. Sincerely he would have the match made up, and he grows 
    very hot and violent in the suit, and begins to work out his salvation, but 
    then there come some of his confederates, and they tell him they know 
    something about religion that is of ill report. "This sect is everywhere 
    spoken against." There must be so much strictness and mortification that he 
    must never look to see good days anymore; hereupon he is discouraged, and so 
    the match is broken off. Take heed of such people; they are devils covered 
    with flesh; they are, as one says, like Herod, who would have killed Christ 
    as soon as He was born. Thus, when Christ is, as it were, beginning to be 
    formed in the heart, they would in a spiritual sense kill Him. 
<p align="justify">And thus I have shown you the <b>bars </b>which lie in 
    the way to salvation, which are to be removed. </p>
<p align="justify"></p></font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>2. I 
    proceed now in the second place to lay down some HELPS conducive to 
    salvation. 
</b></font><font face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">(i) The first is in the text, FEAR and trembling. </p></b>
    This is not a fear of doubting, but a fear of diligence. This fear is 
    requisite in the working out of salvation. Let us fear lest we come short 
    (Heb. 4:1). Fear is a remedy against presumption. Hope is like the cork to 
    the net, it keeps the soul from sinking in despair; and fear is like the 
    lead to the net, it keeps the soul from floating in presumption. Fear is 
    that flaming sword that turns every way to keep sin from entering. Fear 
    quickens; it is an antidote against sloth. "Noah being moved with fear, 
    prepared an ark" (Heb. 11:8). The traveler, lest night should overtake him 
    before he gets to his journey's end, spurs on the faster. Fear causes 
    circumspection; he who walks in fear, treads warily. Fear is a preservative 
    against apostasy, "I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not 
    depart from Me" (Jer. 32:40). The fear of falling, keeps us from falling. 
    Fear is the badge and livery of a Christian. The saints of old, were 
    God-fearing men (Mal. 3:16). It is reported of holy Anselm, that he spent 
    most of his thoughts about the day of judgment. "Happy is the man who fears 
    always" (Prov. 28:14). Fear is a Christian's garrison, the way to be secure 
    is always to fear. This is one of the best tools for a Christian to work 
    with. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(ii) Secondly, another great help in working out 
    salvation is LOVE.</p></b> Love makes the work proceed with delight; seven years 
    labor seemed nothing to Jacob because of the love he bore to Rachel. Love 
    facilitates everything. It is like wings to the bird, like wheels to the 
    chariot, like sails to the ship; it carries the soul on swiftly and 
    cheerfully in duty. Love is never weary. It is an excellent saying of 
    Gregory, "Let but a man get the love of the world into his heart, and he 
    will quickly be rich." So do but get the love of religion into your heart, 
    and you will quickly be rich in grace. Love is a vigorous, active grace. It 
    despises dangers; it tramples upon difficulties; like a mighty torrent it 
    carries all before it. This is the grace which "takes heaven by violence." 
    Get but your hearts well heated with this grace, and you will be fitted for 
    this work. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(iii) A third thing conducive to salvation, is to work in 
    the strength of Christ.</p></b> "I can do all things through Christ who 
    strengthens me" (Phil. 4:13). Never go to work alone. Samson's strength lay 
    in his hair. And a Christian's strength lies in Christ. When you are to do 
    any duty, to resist any temptation, to subdue any lust, set upon it in the 
    strength of Christ. Some go out against sin, in the strength of resolutions 
    and vows—and they are soon foiled. Do as Samson; he first cried to heaven 
    for help and then having taken hold of the pillars, he pulled down the house 
    upon the Philistines! Likewise, only when we engage Christ in the work, can 
    we bring down the house upon the head of our lusts!
<b>
<p align="justify">(iv) Fourthly, work humbly, be HUMBLE, do not think to 
    merit by your working.</p></b> Satan would either <i>keep </i>us from working, 
    or else he would make us <i>proud </i>of our working. God must pardon our 
    works before He crowns them. If we could pray as angels, shed rivers of 
    tears, build churches, erect hospitals—and thought that there was any <i>
    merit </i>in all this—it would be as a dead fly in the box of perfume; it 
    would stain and eclipse the glory of the work. Our duties, like good wine, 
    savor of a bad cask. <b>Our best duties are but glittering sins! </b>Let not 
    pride poison our holy things; when we have been working for heaven, we 
    should say as good Nehemiah, "Remember me, O my God, concerning also, and 
    spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy" (Neh. 13:22). 
<b>
<p align="justify">(v) Fifthly, work upon your knees; be much in PRAYER. </p></b>
    Beg the Spirit of God to help you in the work; make that prayer, "Awake O 
    north wind; and come, O south wind—and blow upon my garden" (Song 4:16). We 
    have need that this Spirit blow upon us, there being so many contrary winds 
    blowing against us, and considering how soon holy affections are apt to 
    wither. The garden has not more need of wind to make its fruit flow out, 
    than we of the Spirit to make our graces flourish. Philip joined himself to 
    the Eunuch's chariot (Acts 8:29). God's Spirit must join itself to our 
    chariot; as the mariner has his hand to the helm, so he has his eye to the 
    star. While we are working, we must look up to the Spirit. What is our 
    preparation without the Spirit's operation? What is all our rowing without a 
    gale from heaven? "The Spirit lifted me up" (Ezek. 3:14). God's Spirit must 
    both <i>infuse </i>grace and <i>excite </i>it. We read of a "wheel in the 
    middle of a wheel" (Ezek. 1: 16). The Spirit of God is that inner wheel that 
    must move the wheel of our endeavors. To conclude all, pray to God to bless 
    you in your work. "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the 
    strong." (Eccl. 9: 11) Nothing prospers without God's blessing; and what way 
    to obtain it but by prayer? It is a saying of one of the ancients, "The 
    saints carry the keys of heaven at their belt."<b> Prayer beats the weapon 
    out of the enemy's hand—and gets the blessing out of God's hand! 
<p align="justify">(vi) Lastly, work in HOPE.</p></b> The apostle says, "he who 
    plows should plow in hope" (1 Cor. 9:10). Hope is the soul's anchor (Heb. 
    6:19). Cast this anchor upon the promise and you shall never sink. Nothing 
    more hinders us in our working than unbelief. "Surely," says a Christian, "I 
    may toil all day for salvation and catch nothing." What! Is there 'no balm 
    in Gilead?' Is there no mercy seat? Oh, sprinkle faith in every duty! Look 
    up to free grace; fix your eye upon the blood of Christ. Would you be saved? 
    To your working, join believing.
