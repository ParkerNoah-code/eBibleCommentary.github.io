<p align="justify">While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and 
    broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is My 
    body." Then He took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, 
    "Drink from it, all of you. This is My blood of the covenant, which is 
    poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." </p></i>Matthew 26:26-28
<p align="justify">"<i>Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it</i>." This 
    shadowed out Christ's death and passion with all the torments of His body 
    and soul. "It pleased the Lord to bruise Him," Isaiah 53:10. When <i>spices
    </i>are bruised—then they send forth a sweet savor. So, when <i>Christ </i>
    was bruised on the cross—He sent out a sweet fragrance. Christ's body 
    crucifying—was the breaking open of a box of precious ointment which filled 
    heaven and earth with its perfume.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What was the cause of Christ's suffering? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Surely not for any desert of His own. "The 
    Messiah shall be cut off—but <i>not for Himself</i>," Daniel 9:26. In the 
    original it is, "He shall be cut off, and there is nothing in Him." That 
    is—there is no cause <i>in Him, </i>why He should suffer. Why, then, was His 
    blessed body broken? It was for our sins. "He was wounded <i>for our 
    transgressions</i>," Isaiah 53:5. The Hebrew word for "wounded" has a double 
    emphasis. Either it may signify that He was <i>pierced </i>through as with a 
    dart, or that He was <i>profaned</i>. He was used as some common vile 
    thing—and Christ can thank <i>us </i>for it. "He was wounded for <i>our </i>
    transgressions." So that, if the question were put to us, as once was put to 
    Christ, "Prophesy to us—who smote You?" Luke 22:64, we might soon answer 
    that <i>it was our sins which smote Him! </i>Our pride made Christ wear a 
    crown of thorns. As Zipporah said to Moses, "A bloody husband are you to 
    me," Exodus 4:25, so may Christ say to His church, "A bloody spouse you have 
    been to Me—you have cost Me My heart's blood!" </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Concerning Christ's suffering upon the cross, observe 
    these things:</p>
</i><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It was a BITTER death. </p></b></font>"He was broken." The 
    very thoughts of His suffering, put Him into an agony. "Being in agony, He 
    prayed more earnestly, and He sweat, as it were, great drops of blood 
    falling down to the ground!" Luke 22:44. He was full of sorrow. "My soul is 
    exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death!" Matthew 26:38. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It was a LINGERING death.</p></b></font> It was more for 
    Christ to suffer one hour—than for us to have suffered forever. But His 
    death was lengthened out. He hung three hours on the cross. He died many 
    deaths before He could die one.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. It was a PAINFUL death.</p></b></font> His hands and feet 
    were nailed, which parts, being full of sinews, and therefore very 
    tender—His pain must be most acute and sharp. And to have the envenomed 
    arrow of God's wrath shot to His heart—this was the direful catastrophe, and 
    caused that outcry upon the cross, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken 
    Me!" The justice of God was now inflamed and heightened to its full. "God 
    spared not His Son," Romans 8:38. Nothing must be abated of the debt. Christ 
    felt the pains of hell, though not locally, yet equivalently. In the Lord's 
    Supper, we see this <i>tragedy </i>acted before us.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. It was a SHAMEFUL death.</p></b></font> Christ was hung 
    between two thieves, Matthew 27:38. It was as if He had been the principal 
    malefactor. Well might the <i>lamp of heaven </i>withdraw its light and mask 
    itself with darkness, as blushing to behold the Sun of righteousness in an 
    eclipse. It is hard to say which was greater, the <i>blood </i>of the 
    cross—or the <i>shame </i>of the cross, Hebrews 12:2. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. It was a CURSED death.</p></b></font> Deuteronomy 21:23. 
    This kind of death was deemed exceedingly execrable, yet the Lord Jesus 
    underwent this, "Being made a <i>curse </i>for us," Galatians 3:13. He who 
    was God blessed forever, Romans 9:5—was under a curse!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Also, consider the SWEETNESS of it to us.</p></b></font> 
    Christ's bruising—is our healing. "By His stripes, we are healed," Isaiah 
    53:5. Calvin calls the crucifixion of Christ, the hinge on which our 
    salvation turns. Luther calls it a <i>gospel spring </i>opened to refresh 
    sinners. Indeed, the suffering of Christ is a deathbed cordial. It is an 
    antidote to expel all our fear. Does sin trouble? Christ has overcome it for 
    us! Besides the two thieves crucified with Christ, there were two other 
    invisible <i>thieves </i>crucified with Him—<i>sin </i>and the <i>devil</i>.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What is meant by <i>Christ's taking the cup?</i></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER. The <i>cup </i>is figurative of the <i>wine </i>
    in it. By this, Christ signified the shedding of His <i>blood </i>upon the 
    cross. When His blood was poured out—now the vine was cut and bled. Now was 
    the <i>lily of the valleys</i> dyed a <i>purple </i>color. This was, to 
    Christ, a cup of <i>astonishment</i>, Ezekiel 23:33. But to us, it is a cup 
    of <i>salvation</i>. When Christ drank this cup of blood, we may truly say 
    that He drank a toast to the world. </p>
<p align="justify">It was <i>precious </i>blood, 1 Peter 1:19. In this 
    blood, we see sin fully punished and fully pardoned. Well may the spouse 
    give Christ of her spiced wine and the juice of her pomegranate, Song of 
    Solomon 8:2, when Christ has given her a draft of His warm blood, spiced 
    with His love and perfumed with the Divine nature!</p>
<p align="justify">"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out 
    for many <b>for the forgiveness of sins</b>." This is a mercy of the first 
    magnitude, the crowning blessing. "Who forgives your iniquities, who crowns 
    you with loving-kindness," Psalm 103:3-4. Whoever has this charter granted, 
    is enrolled in the book of life. "Blessed is he whose transgression is 
    forgiven," Psalm 32:1. Under this word, "forgiveness of sin"—are 
    comprehended all heavenly blessings: justification, adoption, and glory—in 
    respect of which benefits we may, with Chrysostom, call the Lord's Supper, 
    "the <i>feast </i>of the cross!"</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">See in this text, as in a looking-glass, God's infinite 
    love displayed.</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">(1) Behold the love of God the Father in giving Christ to 
    be broken for us! </p></b>That God should put such a <i>jewel </i>in pledge—is 
    the astonishment of angels. "God so loved the world that He gave His only 
    begotten Son," John 3:16. It is a example of love, without a parallel. It 
    was a far greater expression of love in God to give His Son to die for 
    us—than if He had voluntarily acquitted us of the debt without any atoning 
    sacrifice at all. If a subject is disloyal to his sovereign, it argues more 
    love in the king to give his own son to die for that subject—than to freely 
    forgive him the wrong.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2) That Christ should suffer death.</p></b> "Lord," said 
    Bernard, "You have loved me more than Yourself; for You laid down Your life 
    for me." The emperor Trajan tore off a piece of his own <i>robe </i>to bind 
    up one of his soldier's wounds. But Christ tore off His own <i>flesh </i>for 
    us! Nay, that Christ should die as the <i>greatest </i>sinner—having the 
    weight of all men's sins laid upon Him—here was most transporting love! It 
    astonishes all the angels in heaven! 
<b>
<p align="justify">(3) That Christ should die freely.</p></b> "I lay down My 
    life," John 10:17. There was no law to coerce Him, no force to compel Him. 
    It is called the <i>offering </i>of the body of Jesus, Hebrews 10:10. <i>
    Nothing could fasten Jesus to the cross—but the golden link of love! 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">(4) That Christ should die for such as <i>we </i>are. </p></b>
    What are we? Not only <i>vanity</i>—but <i>enmity</i>! When we were <i>
    rebelling</i>—He was <i>dying!</i> When we had <i>weapons </i>in our 
    hands—then He had the <i>spear </i>in His side! "But God demonstrates His 
    own love for us in this: While we were still <i>sinners</i>, Christ died for 
    us." Romans 5:8.
<b>
<p align="justify">(5) That Christ died for us when He could not expect to 
    be at all bettered by us. </p></b>We were reduced to poverty. We were in such a 
    condition that we could neither <i>merit </i>Christ's love—nor <i>requite
    </i>it. For Christ to die for us when we were at such a low ebb, was the 
    very quintessence of love. One man will extend kindness to another as long 
    as he is able to requite him. But if he is fallen to decay, then love begins 
    to slacken and cool. But when we were engulfed in <i>misery </i>and fallen 
    to <i>decay</i>, when we had lost our beauty, stained our blood, and spent 
    our portion—then Christ died for us. O amazing love, which may swallow up 
    all our thoughts!
<b>
<p align="justify">(6) That Christ should not repent of His sufferings. </p></b>
    "He shall see the <i>travail </i>of His soul, and shall be satisfied," 
    Isaiah 53:11. It is a metaphor which alludes to a mother who, though she has 
    suffered greatly, does not repent of it when she sees a child brought forth. 
    So, though Christ had hard travail upon the cross, yet He does not repent of 
    it—but thinks all His sufferings well-bestowed.<i> "He shall be satisfied."
    </i>The Hebrew word signifies such a satiating, as a man has at some sweet 
    banquet.
<b>
<p align="justify">(7) That Christ should die for us—rather than for the 
    fallen angels</p></b>. They were creatures of a more noble extraction and, in 
    all probability, might have brought greater revenues of glory to God, Yet, 
    that Christ should pass by those <i>golden </i>vessels and make us 'clods of 
    earth' into 'stars of glory'—O the hyperbole of Christ's love!
<b>
<p align="justify">(8) </p></b>Yet another step of Christ's love, for like the 
    waters of the sanctuary—it rises higher: that <b>Christ's love should not 
    cease at the hour of death! </b>We write in our letters, "your friend <i>
    until </i>death." But Christ wrote in another style, "your Friend <i>after
    </i>death!" Christ died once—but loves forever. He never withdraws His 
    affection to us. He is making the mansions ready for us, John 14:2. He is 
    interceding for us, Hebrews 7:25. He has finished dying—yet He has not 
    finished loving. What a stupendous love is this! Who can meditate upon His 
    love—and not be in ecstasy? "May you experience the love of Christ, though 
    it is so great you will never fully understand it!" Ephesians 3:19. When you 
    see Christ broken in the Lord's Supper, think of this love. 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">See, then, what entire affection we should bear to 
    Christ, who gives us His body and blood in the Supper.</p></b></font> If He had 
    anything to part with of more worth, He would have bestowed it upon us. "He 
    gave Himself for us to redeem us." Titus 2:14. O let Christ lie nearest our 
    hearts! Let Him be our <i>Tree of Life</i>—and let us desire no other fruit. 
    Let Him be our <i>morning Star</i>—and let us rejoice in no other light.
<p align="justify">As Christ's <b>beauty</b>—so His <b>bounty </b>should 
    make Him loved by us. He has given us His blood as the <i>price</i>—and His 
    Spirit as the <i>witness </i>of our pardon. In the Lord's Supper, Christ 
    bestows all good things. He both imputes His righteousness, and imparts His 
    loving-kindness. He gives a foretaste of that supper which shall be 
    celebrated in the paradise of God. To sum up all, in the blessed supper, 
    Christ gives <i>Himself </i>to believers—and what more could He give? "Dear 
    Savior, how should Your name be as ointment poured forth!" The Persians 
    worship the sun for their god. Let us worship the Sun of righteousness. 
    Though Judas sold Christ for 30 pieces of silver—let us rather part with 
    all, than this <i>pearl of great price</i>. <i>Christ is that golden pipe, 
    through which the golden oil of salvation is transmitted to us.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Was Christ's body broken? Then we may behold <b>sin </b>
    odious in the red looking-glass of Christ's sufferings. It is true, sin is 
    to be abominated since it turned Adam out of paradise and threw the angels 
    down to hell. Sin is the peace-breaker. It is like an incendiary in the 
    family that sets husband and wife at variance. It makes God fall out with 
    us. <i>Sin is the birthplace of our sorrows—and the grave of our comforts.
    </i>But that which may most of all disfigure the <i>face of sin </i>and make 
    it appear abominable is this—<i>It crucified our Lord Jesus!</i> It made 
    Christ veil His glory and lose His blood.</p>
<p align="justify">If a woman saw the sword which killed her dear 
    husband—how hateful would the sight of it be to her! Do we count that sin 
    light—which made Christ's soul heavy unto death? Mark 14:34. Can that be our 
    joy—which made the Lord Jesus a man of sorrows? Isaiah 53:3. Did He cry out, 
    "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" And shall not those sins be 
    forsaken by us—which made Christ Himself forsaken? O let us look upon sin 
    with indignation! When a temptation to sin comes, let us say, "Is not this 
    the sin which poured out Christ's blood!" Let our hearts be enraged against 
    sin. </p>
<p align="justify">When the senators of Rome showed the people Caesar's 
    bloody robe, they were incensed against those who slew him. Sin has rent the 
    white robe of Christ's flesh, and died it a crimson color. Let us, then, 
    seek to be avenged of our sins. Under the Law, if an ox gored a man so that 
    he died, the ox was to be killed, Exodus 21:28. <i>Sin has gored and pierced 
    our Savior! </i>Let it die! What a pity is it for sin to live—which would 
    not allow Christ to live!</p>
<p align="justify">Was Christ's body broken? Let us, then, from His 
    suffering on the cross, learn this lesson—do not wonder <i>if we meet with 
    troubles </i>in the world. Did Christ suffer—who "knew no sin," and do we 
    think it strange to suffer—who know nothing but sin? Did Christ feel the 
    anger of <i>God</i>? And is it much for us to feel the anger of <i>men? </i>
    Was the <i>Head </i>crowned with thorns? Must we have our <i>bracelets </i>
    and <i>diamonds</i>—when Christ had the nails and<i> spear</i> going to His 
    heart! Truly, such as are <i>guilty </i>may well expect the <i>lash</i>—when 
    He, who was innocent, could not go free.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center"><br/>
    EXHORTATIONS</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 1.</p></b></font> Was Christ's body broken for us? Let 
    us be deeply affected with the great love of Christ. Who can tread upon 
    these hot coals, and his heart not burn? Cry out with Ignatius, <i>"Christ, 
    my love, is crucified!" </i>If a <i>friend </i>should die for us—would not 
    our hearts be much affected with his kindness? That the God of heaven should 
    die for us—how should this stupendous mercy have a melting influence upon 
    us! The body of Christ broken—is enough to break the most flinty heart. At 
    our Savior's passion, the very rocks cleaved asunder. "The rocks split 
    apart," Matthew 27:51. He who is not affected with Christ's love—has a heart 
    harder than the rocks! If Saul was so affected with David's mercy in sparing 
    his life, 1 Samuel 24:16, how may we be affected with Christ's kindness who, 
    to spare our life—lost His own! Let us pray that, as Christ was fastened to 
    the cross—so may He be fastened to our hearts.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 2.</p></b></font> Is Jesus Christ spiritually 
    exhibited to us in the Lord's Supper? Let us then set a high value and 
    estimate upon Him.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Let us prize Christ's BODY.</p></b></font> Every crumb of 
    this <i>Bread of life </i>is precious. "My flesh is food indeed," John 6:55. 
    The <b>manna </b>was a lively type and emblem of Christ's body, for manna 
    was sweet. "The people of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like 
    coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with <i>honey</i>." Exodus 16:31. 
    It was a delicious food. Therefore it was called <i>angel's food </i>for its 
    excellency. So Christ, the <i>sacramental manna</i>, is sweet to a 
    believer's soul. "His fruit was sweet to my taste," Song of Solomon 2:3. 
    Everything of Christ is sweet. His name is sweet. His virtue is sweet. This
    <i>manna </i>sweetens the <i>bitter waters of Marah</i>.
<p align="justify">Nay, Christ's flesh excels manna. Manna was <i>food</i>—but 
    not <i>medicine</i>. If an Israelite had been sick, manna could not have 
    cured him. But this blessed manna of Christ's body, is not only for food—but 
    for medicine! Christ has healing under His wings, Malachi 4:2. He heals the
    <i>blind </i>eye, the <i>hard </i>heart. Keep this medicine next to your 
    heart—and it will heal you of all your spiritual distempers. </p>
<p align="justify">Also, manna was corruptible. It ceased when Israel came 
    to Canaan. But this blessed manna of Christ's body will never cease. The 
    saints will feed with infinite delight and soul satisfaction upon Christ to 
    all eternity! The joys of heaven would cease—if this manna would cease. The 
    manna was put in a golden pot in the ark to be preserved there. So the 
    blessed manna of Christ's body, being put in the golden pot of the Divine 
    nature, is laid up in the ark of heaven for the support of saints forever. 
    Well, then, may we say of Christ's blessed body—it is food indeed. In the 
    field of Christ's body, being dug upon the cross—we find the pearl of 
    salvation!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Let us prize Christ's BLOOD in the Lord's Supper.</p></b></font> 
    It is drink indeed, John 6:55. Here is the nectar and ambrosia, which God 
    Himself delights to taste of! This is both a balsam and a perfume. That we 
    may set the higher value upon the blood of Christ—I shall show you<b> seven 
    rare supernatural virtues </b>in it: 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It is a RECONCILING blood. </p></b></font>"And you were 
    once alienated and hostile in mind because of your evil actions. But now He 
    has <i>reconciled </i>you by His physical body through His death, to present 
    you holy, faultless, and blameless before Him." Colossians 1:21-22. Christ's 
    blood is the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Nay, it is not only a sacrifice 
    but a <i>propitiation</i>, 1 John 2:2, which denotes a bringing us into 
    favor with God. It is one thing for a traitor to be <i>pardoned</i>—and 
    another thing to be <i>brought into favor</i>. Sin <i>rent </i>us off from 
    God—Christ's blood <i>cements </i>us to God! If we had had as much grace as 
    the angels—it could not have wrought our reconciliation. If we had offered 
    up millions of sacrifices, if we had wept rivers of tears—this could never 
    have appeased an angry Deity. Only Christ's blood ingratiates us into God's 
    favor—and makes Him look upon us with a smiling aspect. When Christ died, 
    the veil of the temple was rent. This was not without a mystery, to show 
    that through Christ's blood—the <i>veil of our sins is rent </i>which 
    interposed between God and us.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Christ's blood is a QUICKENING blood.</p></b></font> 
    "Whoever drinks My blood, has eternal life," John 6:54. It both begets <i>
    life</i>—and prevents <i>death!</i> "The life of any creature is in its 
    blood," Leviticus 17:11. Sure enough, the life of our soul—is in the blood 
    of Christ. When we contract deadness of heart, and are like wine which has 
    lost its spirits—Christ's blood has an elevating power; it puts vivacity 
    into us, making us quick and lively in our motion. "They shall mount up with 
    wings as eagles," Isaiah 40:31.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Christ's blood is a CLEANSING blood.</p></b></font> "The 
    blood of Jesus cleanses us from all our sin," 1 John 1:7. As the merit of 
    Christ's blood <i>pacifies God</i>—so the virtue of it <i>purifies us. </i>
    Christ's blood is <i>heaven's bath</i>. It is a <i>laver </i>to wash in. It 
    washes a crimson sinner—milk-white! <i>The Word of God is a looking-glass to 
    show us our spots—and the blood of Christ is a fountain to wash them away!
    </i>"On that day a fountain will be opened—to cleanse them from all their 
    sins and defilement!" Zechariah 13:1.
<p align="justify">But this blood will not wash—if it is <i>mingled </i>with 
    anything. If we mingle our good works with Christ's blood—it will not wash! 
    Let Christ's blood be pure and unmixed--and there is no spot which it cannot 
    wash away! It purged out Noah's drunkenness, and Lot's incest! Indeed, there 
    is one spot so black that Christ's blood does not wash away—and that is the 
    sin against the Holy Spirit. Not but that there is virtue enough in Christ's 
    blood to wash it away—but he who has sinned that sin—will <i>not </i>be 
    washed. He despises Christ's blood and tramples it under foot! Hebrews 
    10:29.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Christ's blood is a SOFTENING blood. </p></b></font>There 
    is nothing so hard, that it cannot be softened by this blood. It will soften 
    a stone! Water will soften the earth—but it will not soften a stone; but 
    Christ's blood mollifies a stone. It softens a heart of stone. It turns a 
    flint—into a spring. The heart, which before was like an adamantine rock, 
    being steeped in Christ's blood, becomes soft—and the waters of repentance 
    flow from it! How was the jailer's heart dissolved and made tender when the 
    blood of sprinkling was upon it! "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" Acts 
    16:30. His heart was now like melting wax. God might now set whatever seal 
    and impression He desired upon it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Christ's blood COOLS the heart.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">First, it cools the heat of <b>sin</b>. The heart 
    naturally is full of distempered heat. It must be hot—being set on fire by 
    hell. It burns in lust and passion. Christ's blood allays this heat—and 
    quenches the inflammation of sin.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, it cools the heat of <b>conscience</b>. In times 
    of spiritual desertion, conscience burns with the heat of God's displeasure. 
    Now, Christ's blood, being sprinkled upon the conscience—cools and pacifies 
    it. And, in this sense, Christ is compared to a river of water, Isaiah 32:2. 
    When the conscience burns and is in agony—Christ's blood is like water to 
    the fire. It has a cooling, refreshing virtue in it.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Christ's blood COMFORTS the soul.</p></b></font> It is a 
    good remedy for <i>fainting fits</i>. Christ's blood is better than wine. 
    Though wine cheers the heart of a man who is well, yet it will not cheer his 
    heart when he is greatly afflicted—or when the pangs of death are upon him. 
    But Christ's blood will cheer the heart at such a time. It is best in <i>
    affliction</i>. It cures the <i>trembling </i>of the heart!
<p align="justify">A conscience sprinkled with Christ's blood can, like the 
    nightingale, sing with a <i>thorn </i>in its breast. The blood of Christ can 
    make a prison—become a palace. It turned the martyr's flames—into beds of 
    roses. Christ's blood gives comfort at the hour of death. As a holy man once 
    said on his deathbed when they brought him a cordial, <i>"No cordial like 
    the blood of Christ!"</i></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Christ's blood PROCURES HEAVEN. </p></b></font>Israel 
    passed through the <i>Red Sea</i> to Canaan. So, through the <i>red sea of 
    Christ's blood</i>—we enter into the heavenly Canaan. "Having boldness 
    therefore to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus," Hebrews 10:19. 
    Our sins shut heaven—Christ's blood is <i>the key </i>which opens the gate 
    of paradise for us! Hence it is, that one calls the cross <i>"the tree of 
    salvation" </i>because that blood which trickled down the cross, distills 
    salvation. Well, then, may we prize the blood of Christ and, with Paul, 
    determine to know nothing but Christ crucified, 1 Corinthians 2:2. King's 
    crowns are only crosses—but the cross of Christ is the only crown!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 3.</p></b></font> Does Christ offer His body and blood 
    to us in the Supper? Then with what solemn <b>preparation </b>should we come 
    to so sacred an ordinance! It is not enough to do <i>what </i>God has 
    appointed—but <i>as </i>He has appointed. "Prepare your hearts unto the 
    Lord," 1 Samuel 7:3. The musician first puts his instrument in tune—before 
    he plays. The heart must be prepared and put in tune—before it goes to meet 
    with God in this solemn ordinance of the Lord's Supper. Take heed of 
    rashness and irreverence. If we do not come prepared, we do not <i>drink</i>—but
    <i>spill </i>Christ's blood! "Whoever shall eat this bread and drink this 
    cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the 
    Lord," 1 Corinthians 11:27. "That is," said one, "he shall be judged a <i>
    shedder </i>of Christ's blood." 
<p align="justify">We read of a <i>wine cup of fury in God's hand</i>, 
    Jeremiah 25:15. He who comes unprepared to the Lord's Supper turns the cup 
    of the Lord's Supper—into a cup of fury. Oh, with what reverence and 
    devotion should we address ourselves to these holy mysteries! The saints are 
    called "prepared vessels," Romans 9:23. If ever these vessels should be 
    prepared—it is when they are to hold the precious body and blood of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">The sinner who is damned—is first prepared. Men do not go 
    to hell without some kind of preparation. "Vessels <i>prepared </i>for 
    destruction," Romans 9:22. If those vessels are prepared which are filled 
    with wrath—much more are those to be prepared who are to receive Christ in 
    the Lord's Supper. Let us dress ourselves before a Scripture looking-glass, 
    before we come to the Lord's Supper; and, with the Lamb's wife, make 
    ourselves <i>ready</i>.<i> </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">How should we PREPARE for the Lord's Supper?</p>
</b><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. We must come with SELF-EXAMINING hearts. </p></b></font>
    "But let a man <i>examine himself</i>, and so let him eat of that bread," 1 
    Corinthians 11:28. It is not enough that <i>others </i>think that we are fit 
    to come—but we must examine <i>ourselves</i>. The Greek word "to examine" is 
    a metaphor taken from the <i>goldsmith </i>who carefully <i>tries </i>his 
    precious metals. So before we come to the Lord's Supper, we are to make a 
    careful and discerning trial of ourselves by the Word. Self-examination is 
    difficult. It is hard for a man to look <i>inward—</i>and see the <i>face of 
    his own soul. </i>The <i>eye </i>can see everything, but itself.
<p align="justify">But this work is necessary because, if we do not examine 
    ourselves, we are at a loss about our spiritual estate. We know not whether 
    we are savingly interested in the covenant—or whether we have a right to the 
    Supper. Also, because <i>God </i>will examine us. It was a sad question the 
    master of the feast asked, "How is it that you are here—without a wedding 
    garment?" Matthew 22:12. So it will be terrible when God shall say to a man, 
    "How did you come in here to My table—with a proud, vain, unbelieving heart? 
    What have you to do here—in your sins. You pollute My holy things!"</p>
<p align="justify">What need, therefore, is there to make a heart search 
    before we come to the Lord's Supper! We should examine our <i>sins </i>that 
    they may be mortified, our <i>spiritual needs </i>that they may be supplied, 
    our <i>graces </i>that they may be strengthened.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. We must come with SERIOUS hearts.</p></b></font> Our 
    spirits are feathery and light—like a boat without ballast, which <i>floats
    </i>in the water but does not <i>sail</i>. We float in holy duties and are 
    full of vain excursions, even when we are to deal with God and are engaged 
    in matters of life and death. That which may fill our hearts with 
    seriousness, is to consider that <i>God's eye </i>is now especially upon 
    us—when we approach His table. "When the King came in to <i>view </i>the 
    guests, He <i>saw </i>a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes," 
    Matthew 22:11. God knows every communicant, and if He sees any levity and 
    indecency of spirit in us, unworthy of His presence—He will be highly 
    incensed and send us away with the <i>guilt </i>of Christ's blood—instead of 
    the <i>comfort </i>of it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. We must come with INTELLIGENT hearts.</p></b></font> There 
    ought to be a competent measure of knowledge, that we may discern the Lord's 
    body. As we are to <i>pray </i>with understanding, 1 Corinthians 14:15, so 
    ought we to <i>communicate </i>at the Lord's Supper with understanding. If 
    knowledge is lacking, it cannot be a <i>reasonable </i>service, Romans 12:1. 
    Those who do not know the <i>meaning </i>of the Supper—do not feel the <i>
    comfort</i> of it. We must know—God the <i>Father </i>in His attributes, God 
    the <i>Son </i>in His offices, God the <i>Holy Spirit </i>in His graces. 
    Some say they have good hearts—yet lack knowledge. We may as well call that 
    a good eye—which lacks sight.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. We must come to the Lord's Supper with LONGING hearts.</p></b></font> 
    Say as Christ, "I have <i>eagerly desired </i>to eat this Passover," Luke 
    22:15. If God prepares a <i>feast</i>—we must get an <i>appetite</i>. As 
    David longed for the water of the well of Bethlehem, 2 Samuel 23:15, so 
    should we long for Christ in the Lord's Supper. <i>Holy desires </i>are <i>
    the sails of the soul </i>which are spread to receive the gale of a heavenly 
    blessing. For the exciting of holy desires and longings, consider:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) The MAGNIFICENCE and ROYALTY of this supper.</p></b></font> 
    It is a <i>heavenly </i>banquet. "The Lord Almighty will prepare a feast of 
    rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine—the best of meats and the 
    finest of wines," Isaiah 25:6. Here in this Supper, is the juice of that 
    grape which comes from the true Vine. Under these elements of bread and 
    wine, Christ and all His benefits are exhibited to us. The Lord's Supper is 
    a repository and storehouse of celestial blessings. Behold here, <i>life </i>
    and <i>peace </i>and <i>salvation </i>set before us! All the <i>sweet 
    delicacies of heaven </i>are served in this feast!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) To provoke appetite, consider what NEED we have of 
    this spiritual feast. </p></b></font>The angel persuaded Elijah to take a little 
    of the cake and jar of water that he might not faint in his journey. "Arise 
    and eat, because the journey is too great for you," 1 Kings 19:7. So truly 
    we have a great journey—from earth to heaven. Therefore, we need to refresh 
    ourselves along the way. How many <i>sins </i>have we to subdue! How many <i>
    duties </i>to perform! How many <i>needs </i>to supply! How many <i>graces
    </i>to strengthen! How many <i>adversaries </i>to conflict with! So that we 
    need refreshment along the way. By feeding upon the body and blood of the 
    Lord in the Supper—we renew our strength as the eagle.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3) Consider CHRIST'S READINESS to dispense divine 
    blessings in this ordinance. </p></b></font>Jesus Christ is not a <i>sealed </i>
    fountain—but a <i>flowing </i>fountain. It is but our <i>crying</i>—and He 
    gives us food. It is but <i>thirsting</i>—and He opens the conduit. "Let the 
    thirsty ones come—anyone who wants to. Let them come and drink the water of 
    life without charge!" Revelation 22:17. As the clouds have natural proneness 
    to drop down their moisture upon the earth—so does Christ delight to give 
    forth of His gracious virtues and influences, to the hungry soul.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4) There is no danger of EXCESS at this supper.</p></b></font> 
    Other feasts often cause gluttony; it is not so here. The more we take of 
    the Bread of life—the more healthful we are, and the more we come to our 
    spiritual maturity. <i>Fullness </i>here, increases our comforts. In 
    spiritual things there is no extreme. Though a drop of Christ's blood is 
    sweet, yet the more, the better; the more, the sweeter. "Drink <i>abundantly</i>, 
    O beloved!" Song of Solomon 5:1.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5) We do not know how long this feast may last.</p></b></font> 
    While the manna is to be had—let us bring our baskets! God will not always 
    be spreading the Supper-table. If people lose their appetite, He will take 
    the Supper away.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6) Feeding upon Christ sacramentally, will be a good 
    preparation to sufferings.</p></b></font> The Bread of <i>life—</i>will help us 
    to feed upon the bread of <i>affliction</i>. The cup of <i>blessing—</i>will 
    enable us to drink of the cup of <i>persecution</i>. Christ's blood is a 
    choice wine which <i>strengthens</i>. Therefore, Cyprian tells us, when the 
    primitive Christians were to appear before the cruel tyrants, they were 
    accustomed to receive the Lord's Supper, and then they arose up from the 
    Lord's Supper as lions breathing forth the fire of heavenly courage. Let 
    these considerations be as sauce to sharpen our appetites to the Lord's 
    Supper. God loves to see us feed hungrily upon the Bread of life.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. If we would come prepared to this ordinance, we must 
    come with PENITENT hearts.</p></b></font> The Passover was to be eaten with <i>
    bitter herbs</i>. We must bring our <i>myrrh of repentance </i>which, though 
    it is bitter to us—is sweet to Christ. "They shall look upon Me whom they 
    have pierced—and <i>mourn </i>for Him," Zechariah 12:10. A broken Christ is 
    to be received with a broken heart. We who have sinned with Peter—should 
    weep with Peter. Our eyes should be filled with tears—and our hearts steeped 
    in the brinish waters of repentance. Say, "Lord Jesus, though I cannot bring 
    sweet spices, and perfume Your body as Mary did—yet I will wash Your feet 
    with my tears." <i>The more bitterness we taste in sin—the more sweetness we 
    shall taste in Christ!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. We must come with SINCERE hearts. </p></b></font>The 
    tribes of Israel, being straitened in time, lacked some legal purifications. 
    Yet because their hearts were sincere and they came with desire to meet with 
    God in the Passover, therefore the Lord healed the people, 2 Chronicles 
    30:19-20. Bad <i>aims </i>will spoil good <i>actions</i>. An archer may miss 
    the mark as well by <i>squinting—</i>as by shooting short. What is our 
    design in coming to the Lord's Supper? Is it that we may have more victory 
    over our corruptions and be more confirmed in holiness? Then God will be 
    good to us and heal us. <i>Sincerity</i>, like true gold, shall allow for 
    some grains of impurity.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. We must come with hearts fired with LOVE to Christ.</p></b></font> 
    The spouse said, "I am sick with love," Song of Solomon 2:5. Let us give 
    Christ the <i>wine of our love </i>to drink—and weep that we can love Him no 
    more. Would we have Christ's exhilarating presence in the supper? Let us 
    meet Him with strong endearments of affection. Basil compares love to a 
    fragrant ointment. Christ delights to smell this perfume! The disciple who 
    loved most—Christ put in His bosom.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. We must come with HUMBLE hearts. </p></b></font>We see 
    Christ humbling Himself unto death. Will a humble Christ ever be received 
    into a proud heart? A sight of God's glory, and a sight of sin—will humble 
    us. Was Christ humble—who was all purity? And are we proud—who are all 
    leprosy? O let us come with a sense of our own vileness. How humble should 
    he be, who is to receive <i>alms of free grace! </i>Jesus Christ is a lily 
    of the <i>valley</i>, Song of Solomon 2:1, not of the <i>mountains</i>. 
    Humility was never a loser. The <i>emptier </i>the vessel is, and the <i>
    lower </i>it is let down into the well—the more water it draws up. So the 
    more the soul is emptied of itself, and the lower it is let down by 
    humility—the more it fetches out of the well of salvation. God will come 
    into a humble heart to revive it, Isaiah 57:15.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. We must come with HEAVENLY hearts.</p></b></font> The 
    mystery of the Lord's Supper is heavenly. What would an <i>earthworm </i>do 
    here? He is not likely to feed on Christ's body and blood who, with the 
    serpent, eats dust. The Lord's Supper is called "communion," 1 Corinthians 
    10:16. What communion can an earthly man have with a heavenly Christ? First, 
    there must be <i>conformity </i>before communion. He who is earthly is no 
    more conformed in likeness to Christ—than a clod of dust is like a star. An 
    earthly man makes the world his god. Then let him not think to receive 
    another God in the Lord's Supper. O let us be in the heavenly altitudes and, 
    by the wing of grace, ascend!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">10. We must come with BELIEVING hearts. </p></b></font>Christ 
    gave the Lord's Supper to the apostles, principally as they were <i>
    believers</i>. Such as come <i>faithless</i>—go away <i>fruitless</i>. Nor 
    it is enough to have the <i>principle </i>of faith. We must exert and put 
    forth the <i>vigorous actings </i>of faith in this ordinance.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) Let us exercise the EYE of faith.</p></b></font> Faith 
    has an eagle's eye. It pierces into things far remote from sense. Faith 
    takes a prospect of heaven. It discerns Him who is invisible, Hebrews 11:27. 
    It beholds a beauty and fullness in Christ. It sees His beauty shining 
    through the lattice of the ordinance. Faith views Christ's <i>love</i>, 
    streaming in His <i>blood</i>. Look upon Christ with <i>believing </i>eyes 
    and you shall, one day, see Him with <i>glorified </i>eyes!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) Let us exercise the MOUTH of faith.</p></b></font> Here 
    is the bread broken. What use is there of bread—but to <i>feed </i>on? Feed 
    upon the Bread of God. Adam <i>died </i>by eating; we <i>live </i>by eating. 
    In the Lord's Supper, the whole Christ is presented to us—the Divine and the 
    human nature. All kind of virtue comes from Him—mortifying, mollifying, and 
    comforting virtues. Oh, then, feed on Him! This grace of faith is the great 
    grace to be set to work, at the Lord's Supper. 
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But does the virtue lie simply in faith?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Not in faith considered purely as a grace—but as 
    it has respect to the object—Christ. The virtue is not in <i>faith</i>—but 
    in <i>Christ</i>. Faith is the ring, Christ is the precious stone. All that 
    faith does, is to bring home Christ's merits to the soul—and so it 
    justifies. The virtue is not in faith—but in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But why should faith carry away more from 
    Christ in the Lord's Supper, than any other grace?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. Because faith is the most <i>receptive </i>
    grace. It is the <i>receiving </i>of gold, which enriches. So faith, 
    receiving Christ's merits and filling the soul with all the fullness of 
    God—must be an enriching grace. In the body, there are veins that suck the 
    nourishment which comes into the stomach and turns it into blood and 
    spirits. Faith is such a sucking vein—which draws virtue from Christ. 
    Therefore it is called a <i>precious </i>faith, 2 Peter 1:1. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. Faith has more of Christ's benefits annexed to 
    it, because it is the most <i>humble </i>grace. If <i>repentance </i>would 
    fetch justification from Christ, a man would be ready to say, "This was for 
    my tears." But faith is humble; it is an <i>empty hand</i>—and what merit 
    can there be in that? Does a poor man, reaching out his hand, <i>merit </i>
    an alms? So because faith is humble, and gives all the glory to Christ and 
    free grace, hence it is that God has put so much honor on it. Faith is the 
    grace to which Christ and all His merits belong. Therefore, above all 
    graces, set faith to work in the Lord's Supper. Faith fetches in all 
    provisions. This is the <i>golden bucket</i>, which draws water out of the 
    well of life.</p>
<p align="justify">But there is a <i>spurious faith </i>in the world. Pliny 
    tells of a <i>Cyprian stone </i>which is, in color and splendor, like the <i>
    diamond</i>—but it is not of the right kind. It will break with the hammer. 
    So, there is a false faith which sparkles and makes a show in the eye of the 
    world—but it is not genuine; it will break with the hammer of persecution.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">11. We must come to the Lord's Supper with LOVING hearts.</p></b></font> 
    "Purge out the old leaven," 1 Corinthians 5:7. The leaven of <i>malice </i>
    will sour the ordinance to us. We must come with bitter <i>tears</i>—yet not 
    with bitter <i>spirits</i>. The Lord's Supper is a <i>love-feast</i>. 
    Christ's blood was shed not only to reconcile us to God—but to one another. 
    Christ's body was broken to make up the breaches among Christians. How sad 
    is it that those who profess they are going to eat Christ's flesh in the 
    Lord's Supper—should tear the flesh of one another! "Whoever hates his 
    brother is a murderer!" 1 John 3:15. He who comes to the Lord's Supper in 
    hatred—is a <i>Judas </i>to Christ—and a <i>Cain </i>to his brother! What 
    benefit can he receive at the Lord's Supper, whose heart is poisoned with 
    malice?
<p align="justify">If one drinks poison—surely food will do him no good. 
    Such as are poisoned with bitterness and malice, are not the better for the 
    sacramental food. He who does not come in love, to the Lord's Supper, has 
    nothing of God in him, for "God is love," 1 John 4:16. He knows nothing of 
    the gospel savingly—for it is a gospel of <i>peace</i>, Ephesians 6:15. He 
    has none of the wisdom which comes from heaven, for that is gentle and easy 
    to be entreated, James 3:17. Oh, that Christians were rooted and cemented 
    together in love!</p>
<p align="justify">Shall <i>devils </i>unite—and <i>saints </i>divide! Did 
    we <i>thus </i>learn Christ? Has not the Lord Jesus loved us to the death? 
    What greater reproach can be cast upon such a loving <i>Head</i>—than for 
    the <i>members </i>to smite one another? May the good Lord put out the <i>
    fire of contention </i>and kindle the <i>fire of love </i>and amity in all 
    our hearts.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">12. We must come with PRAYING hearts.</p></b></font> Every <i>
    ordinance</i>, as well as every <i>creature</i>—is sanctified by prayer, 1 
    Timothy 4:5. Prayer turns the Lord's Supper, into spiritual nourishment. 
    When we send the <i>dove of prayer </i>to heaven, it brings an <i>olive leaf
    </i>in its mouth. We should pray that God would enrich His ordinance with 
    His presence; that He would make the Lord's Supper effectual to all those 
    holy ends and purposes for which He has appointed it; that it may be the <i>
    feast of our graces—</i>and the <i>funeral of our corruptions</i>; that it 
    may be not only a sign to <i>represent </i>Christ—but an instrument to <i>
    convey </i>Christ to us, and a seal to assure us of our heavenly union. If 
    we would have the <i>fat </i>and <i>sweet </i>of this ordinance—we must send 
    prayer before, as a harbinger, to bespeak a blessing.
<p align="justify">Some are so distracted with worldly cares, that they can 
    scarcely spare any time for prayer before they come to the Lord's Supper. Do 
    they think the <i>tree of blessing </i>will drop its <i>fruit </i>into their 
    mouth—when they never shook it by prayer! God does not set His mercies at so 
    low a rate—as to cast them away upon those who do not seek them! Ezekiel 
    36:37. Nor is it enough to pray—but it must be with fervency and intensity 
    of soul. Jacob <i>wrestled </i>in prayer, Genesis 32:24. Cold prayers, like 
    cold suitors, never succeed. Prayer must be with <i>sighs </i>and <i>groans</i>, 
    Romans 8:26. It must be in the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, Jude 20. "He who will 
    speak to God," said Ambrose, "must speak to Him in His own language which He 
    understands, that is, in the language of His Spirit."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">13. We must come to the Lord's Supper with SELF-DENYING 
    hearts.</p></b></font> When we have prepared ourselves in the best manner we 
    can—let us take heed of trusting our preparations. "When you have done 
    everything you were told to do, you should say—<i>We are unworthy servants; 
    we have only done our duty</i>." Luke 17:15. Use duty—but do not idolize it. 
    We ought to use duties to fit us for Christ—but we must not make a Christ of 
    our duties. Duty is the golden path to walk in—but not a silver crutch to 
    lean on. Alas! What are all our preparations? God can spy a hole in our best 
    garments. "All our righteousness is as filthy rags," Isaiah 64:6. When we 
    have prepared ourselves as hoping in God's mercy, we must deny ourselves as 
    deserving His justice. <i>If our holiest services are not sprinkled with 
    Christ's blood—they are no better than shining sins </i>and, like Uriah's 
    letter, they carry in them the matter of our death! Use duty—but trust 
    Christ and free grace for acceptance with God. Be like Noah's dove. She made 
    use of her wings to fly—but trusted in the ark for safety.
<p align="justify">We see how we are to be qualified in our coming to the 
    Lord's Supper. Thus coming—we shall meet with <i>embraces of mercy</i>. We 
    shall have not only a <i>representation</i>, but a <i>participation </i>of 
    Christ in the Lord's Supper. We shall be filled with all the fullness of 
    God.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 4. </p></b></font>Has Christ really and truly died for 
    us? Then when we are at this gospel ordinance, let us remember the Lord 
    Jesus there. The Lord's Supper is <i>a Christ-remembering ordinance</i>. 
    "This do in <i>remembrance </i>of Me," 1 Corinthians 11:25. God has 
    appointed this spiritual festival, <i>to preserve the living memory of our 
    dying Savior</i>. A Sacrament-day is a <i>commemoration </i>day. Remember 
    Christ's passion. "Remembering the wormwood and the gall," Lamentations 
    3:19. If the manna was to be kept in the ark, so that the memory of it 
    should be preserved—how should the death and suffering of Christ be kept in 
    our minds as a memorial, when we are at the table of the Lord?
<p align="justify">Remember the glorious <b>benefits </b>we receive from the 
    broken body of Christ. We usually remember those things which are <i>
    advantageous </i>to us. Christ's broken body is a <i>screen to keep off the 
    fire of God's wrath from us! </i>Christ's body being broken—the serpent's 
    head is broken! Christ being broken upon the cross—a box of precious jewels 
    is broken open! Now we have access to God with boldness. The <i>blood of the 
    cross </i>has made way to the <i>throne of grace</i>. Now we are made sons 
    and heirs—and to be heir to the promise, is better than to be heir to the 
    crown! Christ having died, we are made near akin to the blessed Trinity. We 
    are expectants of glory. The <i>bloody </i>way of the cross—is our <i>milky
    </i>way to heaven. Jesus Christ drank<i> gall</i>—that we might drink the <i>
    honey </i>streams of Canaan. His cross was stuck full of <i>nails</i>—that 
    our crown might be hung full of <i>jewels! </i>Well may we remember Christ 
    in the blessed Lord's Supper!</p>
<p align="justify">But the bare remembrance of Christ's death is not enough. 
    Some who have a natural tenderness of spirit may be affected with the 
    history of Christ's passion—but this remembrance of Christ has little 
    comfort in it. Let us remember Christ in the Lord's Supper rightly.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us remember Christ's death with JOY<b>.<font color="#008000">
</font></b>"God forbid that I should <i>glory</i>—except in the cross of our 
    Lord Jesus Christ," Galatians 6:14. When we see Christ in the Lord's Supper 
    crucified before our eyes—we may behold Him in that posture as He was in 
    upon the cross, <i>stretching out His blessed arms to receive us. </i>O what 
    matter of triumph and acclamation is this! Though we remember <i>our sins
    </i>with grief—yet we should remember <i>Christ's sufferings </i>with joy! 
    Let us weep for those sins which shed His blood—yet rejoice in that blood 
    which washes away our sins!</p>
<p align="justify">Let us so remember Christ's death—as to be <b>conformed
    </b>to His death. "That I may be conformed to His death," Philippians 3:10. 
    Then we remember Christ's death rightly—when we are dead with Him. Our pride 
    and passion are dead. Christ's dying for us—makes sin die in us. Then we 
    rightly remember Christ's crucifixion—when we are crucified with Him. We are 
    dead to the pleasures and preferment's of the world. "The world is crucified 
    unto me—and I to the world," Galatians 6:14.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 5. </p></b></font>If Christ has given us this <i>soul 
    festival </i>for the strengthening of grace, let us labor to feel some <i>
    virtue </i>flowing out of this ordinance to us. It would be strange if a man 
    should receive no nourishment from his food. It is a discredit to this 
    ordinance—if we get no increase of <i>grace</i>. Shall leanness enter into 
    our souls—at a feast of fat things? Christ gives us His body and blood for 
    the augmenting of faith. He expects that we should reap some profit and 
    income, and that our weak, feeble faith—should flourish into a great faith. 
    "O woman, great is your faith," Matthew 15:28. It would be good to examine 
    whether, after our frequent celebration of this holy supper, whether we have 
    arrived at a great faith. 
<p align="justify">But I would not discourage <i><b>infant </b></i>
    believers. If your grace is not risen to the bigness and proportion of a 
    great faith—but is of the proper kind—it shall find acceptance with God. 
    God, who bids <i>us </i>to receive him who is weak in faith, Romans 14:1, 
    will not Himself refuse him. If your faith is not grown to a <i>cedar</i>, 
    yet is a <i>bruised reed</i>—it is too good to be broken, Matthew 12:20. <i>
    A weak faith can lay hold on a strong Christ! </i>A <i>palsied </i>hand may 
    tie the knot in marriage.</p>
<p align="justify">Only do not let Christians rest in lower measures of 
    grace—but aspire after higher degrees. The stronger our faith—the more sweet 
    influence we draw from Christ. This is that which honors the blessed Lord's 
    Supper—when we can show the increase of grace and, being strong in faith, 
    bring glory to God, Romans 4:20.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 6.</p></b></font> Has Christ provided such a blessed 
    banquet for us? He does not nurse us abroad—but feeds us with His own <i>
    breast</i>—nay, with His own <i>blood! </i>Let us, then, study to respond to 
    this great love of Christ. It is true, we can never parallel His love. Yet 
    let us show ourselves <i>thankful</i>. We can do nothing satisfactory—but we 
    may do something out of gratitude. Christ gave Himself as a <i>sin-offering
    </i>for us. Let us give ourselves as a <i>thank-offering </i>for Him. If a 
    man redeems another out of <i>debt</i>—will he not be grateful? How deeply 
    do we stand obliged to Christ—who has redeemed us from <i>hell!</i> Let us 
    show thankfulness four ways:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Let us show our thankfulness to Christ, by COURAGE.</p></b></font> 
    Christ has set us a copy. He did not fear men—but endured the cross and 
    despised the shame. Let us be steeled with courage, being made ready to 
    suffer for Christ, which is, as Chrysostom said, to be baptized with a 
    baptism of blood. Did Christ bear the wrath of <i>God </i>for us—and shall 
    we not bear the wrath of <i>men </i>for Him! It is our glory to suffer in 
    Christ's quarrel. "The Spirit of God and of glory rests upon you," 1 Peter 
    4:14. Let us pray for <i>furnace </i>grace. Be like those three Hebrew 
    children. "Be it known to you, O king, that we <i>will not </i>serve your 
    gods!" Daniel 3:18. They would rather <i>burn</i>—than <i>bow!
</i>
<p align="justify">We do not know how soon an hour of trial may come. Oh, 
    remember, Christ's body was broken! His blood was poured out. We have no 
    such blood to shed for Him—as He shed for us!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Let us show our thankfulness to Christ, by 
    FRUITFULNESS.</p></b></font> Let us bring forth the sweet fruits of patience, 
    heavenly-mindedness, and good works. This is to <b>live </b>unto Him—who <b>
    died </b>for us, 2 Corinthians 5:15. If we would rejoice the heart of 
    Christ, and make Him not to repent of His sufferings—let us be fruitful in 
    obedience. The wise men not only worshiped Christ—but presented unto Him 
    gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Matthew 2:11. Let us present Christ 
    with the best fruits of our garden: Let us give Him our love—that flower of 
    delight. The saints are not only compared to stars for their knowledge—but
    <i>spice trees </i>for their fruitfulness. The breasts of the spouse were 
    like <i>clusters of grapes</i>; Song of Solomon 7:7. 
<p align="justify">Christ's blood both kills sin—and makes the heart 
    fruitful in grace.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Let us show our thankfulness to Christ, by our ZEAL.
    </p></b></font>How zealous was Christ for our redemption! Zeal turns a <i>saint
    </i>into <i>a seraphim!</i> A true Christian has a double baptism—one of 
    water, the other of fire. He is baptized with the fire of zeal. Be zealous 
    for Christ's name and truth. Zeal is increased by opposition. It cuts its 
    way through the rocks. Zeal loves truth most, when it is disgraced and 
    hated. "They have made void Your law; <i>therefore </i>I love Your 
    commandments above gold!" Psalm 119:126-127.
<p align="justify">How little thankfulness do they show to Christ—who have 
    no zeal for His honor and interests! They are like Ephraim. "Ephraim is a 
    cake not turned," Hosea 7:8, baked on one side—and dough on the other. 
    Christ most abominates a lukewarm temper, Revelation 3:15. He is nauseated 
    with such professors. The location of <i>England </i>is seated between the
    <i>torrid </i>and <i>frigid </i>zones. The climate is neither very hot nor 
    cold. I wish this were not the temper of Christians, and that our hearts 
    were not too like the climate we live in. May the Lord cause the fire of 
    holy zeal, to always be burning upon the altar of our hearts.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Let us show our thankfulness, by universal SUBJECTION 
    to Christ.</p></b></font> This is to make the Lord's Supper, in a spiritual 
    sense—a feast of <i>dedication</i>, when we renew our vows and give 
    ourselves up to God's service. "Truly I am Your servant," Psalm 116:16. 
    "Lord, <i>all </i>I have is Yours. My <i>head </i>shall be Yours to study 
    for You; my <i>hands </i>shall be Yours to work for You; my <i>heart </i>
    shall be Yours to adore You; my <i>tongue </i>shall be Yours to praise You!"
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 7. </p></b></font>If Jesus Christ has provided so holy 
    an ordinance as the Lord's Supper, let us <i>live </i>suitably to it. Have 
    we received Christ into our hearts? Let us show Him forth—by our 
    heavenliness. Let us show forth Christ by our heavenly <i>words</i>. Let us 
    speak the <i>language of Canaan</i>. When the Holy Spirit came upon the 
    apostles, they spoke with other tongues, Acts 2:4. While we speak the words 
    of grace and soberness—our lips are fragrant with perfume, and drip with 
    honey.
<p align="justify">Let us show forth Christ by our heavenly <i>affections</i>. 
    Let our sighs and breathings after God, go up as a cloud of incense. "Set 
    your affections on things above," Colossians 3:2. We should do by our 
    affections, as the farmers do by their corn. If the corn lies low in a damp 
    room, it is in danger of corruption. Therefore, they carry it up into their 
    highest room that it may keep the better. So our affections, if set on <i>
    earth</i>, are apt to corrupt and be unsavory. Therefore, we should carry 
    them up on high above the world that they may be preserved pure. Breathe 
    after fuller revelations of God. The <i>higher </i>the lark flies—the <i>
    sweeter </i>it sings. The higher our affections are raised towards 
    heaven—the sweeter joys we feel.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us show forth Christ by our heavenly <i>lives</i>, 
    Philippians 3:20. Hypocrites may, in a pang of conscience, have some good 
    affections stirred—but they are as a flushed face, which comes and goes. But 
    the <i>constant tenor </i>of our life must be holy. We must shine forth in a 
    kind of angelic sanctity. It is not enough to have the image of Christ in 
    the <i>heart</i>—but there must be something of Christ manifest in the <i>
    life</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The scandalous lives of many communicants are a reproach 
    to the Lord's Supper, and tempt others to infidelity. How odious it is, that 
    those <i>hands </i>which have received the sacramental elements—should be 
    unjust! That those <i>eyes </i>which have been filled with tears at the 
    Lord's Supper should, afterwards, be filled with envy! That those <i>teeth</i>, 
    which have eaten holy bread, should grind the faces of the poor! That those
    <i>lips</i>, which have touched the sacramental cup, should greet a harlot! 
    That the <i>mouth </i>which has drunk consecrated wine, should be full of 
    coarse jesting! That they who seem to <i>deify </i>Christ in the Supper, 
    should <i>vilify </i>Him in His members! In a word, that such as pretend to 
    eat Christ's body and drink His blood at church, should eat the bread of 
    wickedness, and drink the wine of bitterness in their own houses! Proverbs 
    4:17. </p>
<p align="justify">These are like those Italians I have read of, who, at the 
    Lord's Supper, are so devout, as if they believed God to be in the <i>bread</i>—but 
    in their lives are so profane, as if they did not believe God to be in <i>
    heaven!</i> Such as these are apt to make the world think that the gospel is 
    but a <i>religious cheat</i>. What shall I say of them? With <i>Judas</i>, 
    they receive the devil in the sop, and are no better than crucifiers of the 
    Lord of glory. As their sin is heinous, so their punishment will be 
    proportional. "They eat and drink <i>damnation </i>to themselves," 1 
    Corinthians 11:29. </p>
<p align="justify">Oh, that such a luster and majesty of holiness sparkled 
    forth in the lives of communicants, so that others would say,<i> "These 
    people have been with Jesus!"</i> And their consciences may lie under the 
    power of this conviction, that the Lord's Supper has a holy and transforming 
    virtue in it!<br/>
<font color="#ff0000"><b><br/>
    COMFORT to God's people.</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. From Christ's broken body and His blood poured out, we 
    may gather this comfort—that it was a <i>glorious </i>sacrifice</p></b>.
</font>
<p align="justify">It was a sacrifice of infinite merit. Had it been only an
    <i>angel </i>that suffered, or had Christ been only a mere man, as some 
    blasphemously dream—then we might have despaired of salvation. But He 
    suffered for us—who was <i>God </i>as well as man. Therefore, the apostle 
    expressly calls it <i>"the blood of God,"</i> Acts 20:28. It is man who 
    sins. It is God in our nature who dies! </p>
<p align="justify">This is <i>sovereign medicine </i>to believers. Christ 
    having poured out His blood—now God's justice is completely satisfied. God 
    was infinitely more content with Christ's sufferings upon mount Calvary—than 
    if <i>we </i>had lain in hell and undergone His wrath forever! <i>The blood 
    of Christ has quenched the flame of Divine fury! </i>And, now, what should 
    we fear? All are enemies are either <i>reconciled </i>or <i>subdued</i>. God 
    is a reconciled enemy--and sin is a subdued enemy. "Who shall lay anything 
    to the charge of God's elect? It is Christ who died!" Romans 8:34. When the 
    devil accuses us—let us show him the cross of Christ! <i>When he brings his 
    pencil and goes to paint our sins in their heinous colors—let us bring the 
    sponge of Christ's blood, and that will wipe them out again! </i>All bonds 
    are cancelled. Whatever the law has charged upon us, is discharged. The 
    debt-book is crossed out—with the blood of the Lamb!</p>
<p align="justify">It was a sacrifice of <i>eternal </i>extent. The benefit 
    of it is perpetuated. "He entered in once into the holy place, having 
    obtained <i>eternal redemption </i>for us," Hebrews 9:12. Therefore, Christ 
    is said to be a Priest <i>forever</i>, Hebrews 5:6, because the virtue and 
    comfort of His sacrifice abides forever.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Christ's blood being shed, believers may lay claim to 
    all heavenly privileges.</p></b></font> Wills are ratified by the <i>death </i>
    of the testator. "A testament is of force after men are dead," Hebrews 9:17. 
    It is observable in the text that Christ calls His blood "the blood of the
    <i>new testament</i>." Christ made a will or testament, and gave rich 
    legacies to the saints: pardon of sin, grace, and glory! The Scriptures are 
    the scrolls wherein these legacies are registered. Christ's blood is the 
    sealing of the will. This blood being shed, Christians may put in for a 
    title to all these legacies. "Lord, pardon my sin. Christ has died for my 
    pardon. Give me grace; Christ has purchased it by His blood."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Is Christ's blood shed? Here is comfort against death.</p></b></font> 
    A dying Savior, sweetens the pangs of death. Is your Lord crucified? Be of 
    good comfort! Christ, by dying, has overcome death. He has cut the <i>lock 
    of sin </i>where the strength of death lay! Christ has knocked out the teeth 
    of this <i>lion!</i> He has pulled the <i>thorn </i>out of death—so that it 
    cannot prick a believer's conscience. "O death, I will be your plague," 
    Hosea 13:14. Christ has disarmed death and taken away all its deadly 
    weapons, so that, though it may <i>strike</i>, it cannot <i>sting </i>a 
    believer. Christ has drawn the <i>poison </i>out of death. Nay, He has made 
    death <i>friendly</i>. This <i>pale horse </i>carries a child of God home to 
    his Father's house! Faith gives a <i>right </i>to heaven; death gives us <i>
    possession </i>of heaven! What sweet comfort may we draw from the 
    crucifixion of our Lord! His precious blood paints the <i>pale face of 
    death, </i>into a glorious and beautiful complexion. 
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">Here is a DARK side of the cloud, to all profane people 
    who live and die in sin.</p></b></font> They have no part in Christ's blood. 
    Their condition will be worse, than if Christ had not died. Christ, who is a
    <i>loadstone </i>to draw the elect to heaven—will be a <i>millstone </i>to 
    sink the wicked deeper in hell! They must feel the same wrath which Christ 
    felt upon the cross! And, because they cannot bear it all at once, they must 
    be undergoing it to eternity! 2 Thessalonians 1:9. So inconceivably 
    torturing will this be—that the damned do not know how to <i>endure </i>
    it—nor how to <i>avoid </i>it!
<p align="justify">Sinners will not believe this until it is too late. 
    Wicked men, while they live, are blinded by the god of this world. But, when 
    they are dying, the eye of their consciences will begin to be opened, and 
    they shall see the wrath of God flaming before their eyes—which sight will 
    be but a sad prologue to an eternal tragedy!</p>
