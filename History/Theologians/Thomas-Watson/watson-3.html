            Abraham is called "the friend of God," James 2:23. The Lord spoke
            with him familiarly, Genesis 17:22; he was made of God's privy
            council, Genesis 18:17. And in the text, "the Word of the Lord came
            unto him in a vision." And what was the word that came to this holy
            patriarch in a vision? "I am your shield, and your exceeding great
            reward"—words too great for any man or angel fully to expound. In
            the Hebrew it is, "I am your
            <i> superabundant, very exceeding much </i>reward." In the text is a
            climax; it rises like the waters of the sanctuary, higher and
            higher—"I am your reward; your great reward; and your exceeding
            great reward." There are four things here to be spoken of:

          <p>
            Nothing on earth can be their reward. The glittering of the
            <b>world </b>dazzles men's eyes; but, like the apples of Sodom, it
            does not so much delight as delude. The world is gilded emptiness.
            The world is made circular; but the heart is a triangle. A circle
            cannot fill a triangle. The world is enough to <i>busy </i>us, not
            to <i>fill </i>us. Job 20:22, "In the fullness of his sufficiency he
            shall be in straits." It seems a riddle to have sufficiency—yet not
            have enough. The meaning is, when he enjoys most of the creature—yet
            there is something lacking. When King Solomon had put all the
            creatures into a cup, and went to extract and distill out the
            spirits, they turned to froth. "Meaningless! Meaningless! Utterly
            meaningless! Everything is meaningless." Ecclesiastes 1:2. God never
            intended that we should dig happiness, out of the earth which He has
            cursed.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <b>Heaven itself </b>is not a saint's reward. Psalm 73:25, "Whom have
          I in heaven but <i>You</i>?" There are angels and archangels—yes, but
          though these are for a saint's <i>comfort</i>—yet not properly for his

          <i>reward</i>. Communion with seraphim is excellent—yet can no more
          make a saint's reward than the light of the stars can make day.

            In bestowing Himself upon them. The great blessing of the covenant
            is, "I am your God." The Lord told Abraham that kings should come
            out of his loins, and He would give the land of Canaan to him and
            his seed, Genesis 17:6. But all this did not amount to blessedness.
            That which made up the portion was, "I will be their God," verse 8.
            God will not only see that the saints shall be rewarded—but He
            Himself will be their reward. A king may reward his subjects with
            gratuities—but he bestows himself upon his queen. God said to every
            believer, as He did to Aaron, "I am your part and your inheritance,"
            Numbers 18:20, and as the king of Israel said to Benhadad, "I am
            yours, and all that I have," 1 Kings 20:4.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Abraham sent away the sons of the concubines with a few gifts—but he
            settled the inheritance upon Isaac, Genesis 25:5-6. God sends away
            the wicked with riches and honor—but made Himself over to His
            people. They have not only the gift but the Giver. And what more can
            be said? As Micah said, "What have I more?" Judges 18:24. Just so,
            what has God more to give than Himself? What greater dowry is there
            than the Deity? God is not only the saints' rewarder—but He is their
            reward. Job 22:25, "The Almighty shall be your gold," for so does
            the Hebrew word import. The sum of all is this, The saints' portion
            lies in God. Psalm 16:5, "The Lord is the portion of my inheritance
            and of my cup."
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Question. But how does God give Himself to His people? Is not His
            essence incommunicable?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Answer. True, the saints cannot partake of God's very essence; the
            riches of the Deity are too great to be received in essence. But the
            saints shall have all in God, which may be for their comfort. They
            shall partake so much of God's likeness, His love, His influence,
            and the irradiations of His glory (1 John 3:2; John 17:26) as
            astonishes and fills the vessels of mercy, that they run over with
            joy.

            Through Jesus Christ—His blood, being the blood of God, has merited
            this glorious reward for them, Acts 20:28. Though in respect of free
            grace, this reward is a <i>donation</i>—yet in respect of Christ's
            blood it is a <i>purchase</i>, Ephesians 1:14. How precious should
            Christ be to us! Had not He died, the exceeding great portion would
            never have come into our hands!

            God is a <font color="#008000"><b>satisfying </b></font>

            reward. Genesis 17:1, "I am God Almighty." The word for
            <i>Almighty </i>

            signifies "Him who has sufficiency." God is a whole ocean of
            blessedness, so that the soul, while it is bathing in it, cries out
            in a divine ecstasy, "I have enough!" Here is fullness—but no
            excess. Psalm 17:15, "I shall be satisfied when I awake with Your
            likeness." When I awake out of the sleep of death, having my soul
            embellished with the illustrious beams of Your glory, I shall be
            satisfied. In God there is not only <i>sufficiency </i>but
            <i> redundancy</i>; not only the fullness of the <i>vessel</i>—but
            the fullness of the <i>fountain!</i> When the whole world was
            defaced, Noah had the copy and emblem of it in the ark. In God, this
            Ark of blessedness, are all good things virtually to be found.
            Therefore Jacob, having God for his reward, could say, "I have
            enough!" or, as it is in the original, "I have all!" Genesis 33:11.
            God is all marrow and fatness. He is such an exuberant reward as
            exceeds our very faith. If the Queen of Sheba's heart fainted within
            her to see all King Solomon's glory—what would it have done to have
            beheld the astonishing and magnificent reward which God bestows upon
            His favorites!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            God is a <font color="#008000"><b>suitable </b></font>

            reward. The soul, being spiritual, must have something comparable
            and suitable to make it happy—and that is God. Light is no more
            suitable to the

            <i>eye</i>, nor melody to the <i>ear</i>—than God is to the
            <i>soul</i>. He pours spiritual blessings into the soul, Ephesians
            1:3. He enriches it with grace, feasts it with His love, and crowns
            it with heavenly dignity!

          <p>
            God is a <font color="#008000"><b>pleasant </b></font>

            reward. He is the quintessence of delight! He is all beauty and
            love! To be feeding upon the <i>thoughts of God </i>is delicious.
            Psalm 104:34, "My meditation of Him shall be sweet." It is
            delightful to the bee to suck the flower; so, by holy musing, to
            suck out some of the sweetness in God, carries a secret delight in
            it. To have a <i>prospect </i>of God only by faith is pleasant. 1
            Peter 1:8, "In whom believing you rejoice." Then what will the joy
            of <i>vision </i>be—when we shall have a clear, personal sight of
            Him—and be laid in the bosom of divine love! Is God so sweet a
            reward in

            <i>affliction?</i> 2 Corinthians 7:4, "I am exceedingly joyful in
            all our trouble." Philip, Count of Hesse, said that in his
            confinement, he had the divine consolation of the martyrs. Then what
            a delicious reward will God be in heaven! This may be better
            <i>felt—</i>than<i> expressed</i>. The godly, entering upon their
            celestial reward, are said to enter into the joy of their Lord,
            Matthew 25:21. Oh, amazing! The saints enter into God's own joy.
            They have not only the joy which God<i> bestows</i>—but the joy
            which God <i> enjoys!</i>
          </p>

          <p></p>
          <p>
            God is a <font color="#008000"><b>transcendent </b> </font>reward.
            The painter, going to paint the picture of Helena, not being able to
            draw her beauty as in life, drew her face covered with a veil. So,
            when we speak of God's excellencies—we must draw a veil. He is so
            super-eminent a reward that we cannot set Him forth in all His
            luster and magnificence. Put the whole world in scale with Him—and
            it is as if you should weigh a feather with a mountain of gold. God
            is far better than all other things put together! He is better than
            the world, and better than heaven! He is the original cause of all
            good things. Nothing is sweet without Him. He perfumes and
            sanctifies our comforts! He turns the venison into a blessing.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            God is an <font color="#008000"><b>infinite </b></font>

            reward. And, being infinite, these two things follow:
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            This reward cannot come to us by way of merit. Can we merit God? Can
            finite creatures merit an infinite reward?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            God being an infinite reward, there can be no <i>defect </i>or
            <i>scantiness </i>in it. There is no <i>lack </i>in that which is
            infinite. Some may ask, "Is God sufficient for every individual
            saint?" Yes! If the sun, which is but a finite creature, disperses
            its light to the universe, then much more God, who is infinite,
            distributes glory to the whole number of the elect. Every individual
            Christian has a membership in God. As every person enjoys the whole
            sun to himself, so every believer possesses the whole God to
            himself. The Lord has land enough to give all His heirs. Throw a
            thousand buckets into the sea and there is water enough in the sea
            to fill them. Though there are millions of saints and angels, there
            is enough in God to fill them. God is an infinite reward, and though
            He is continually giving out of His fullness to others—yet He has
            not the less. His glory is <i>imparted</i>, not <i>impaired</i>. It
            is a <i>distribution </i>without a diminution.
          </p>
          <p>
            God is an <font color="#008000"><b>honorable </b></font>

            reward. Honor is the height of men's ambition. Aristotle calls it
            the greatest of blessings. Alas! Worldly honor is but a pleasing
            fancy—it often has a speedy burial. But to enjoy God is the head of
            honor. What greater dignity than to be taken up into communion with
            the God of glory, and to possess a kingdom with Him, bespangled with
            light, and seated above all the visible orbs!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            A great heir, while in a foreign land, may be despised; but in his
            own country he is held in veneration. Here on earth, the people of
            God are as <i>princes in a disguise</i>, 1 John 3:1. But they shall
            have honor enough in heaven when they shall be clothed with white
            robes and sit with Christ upon His throne, Revelation 3:21.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            God is an <font color="#008000"><b>everlasting </b> </font>reward.
            Mortality is the flaw of all earthly things. They are in their
            fruition surfeiting, and in their duration dying. They are like that
            metal which glass is made of, which, when it shines brightest, is
            nearest melting. But God is an eternal reward. Eternity cannot be
            measured by years nor ages. Eternity makes glory weighty. Psalm
            48:14, "This God is our God forever and ever!" Oh, you saints of
            God, your praying and repenting are but for a while—but your reward
            is forever! As long as God is God, He will be rewarding you! Hosea
            2:19, "I will betroth you unto me forever." God marries Himself to
            His people, and this admits of no divorce. God's love for His elect
            is as unchangeable as His love for Christ. Psalm 73:26, "My portion
            forever." This portion cannot be spent—because it is infinite; nor
            can it be lost—because it is eternal.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            We read of a <i>river </i>of pleasures at God's right hand, Psalm
            36:8.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>But, you may ask, may not this river be dried up?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            No! For there is a <i>fountain </i>at the bottom. Psalm 36:9, "With
            You is the fountain of life."
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Question. But if this reward is so exceedingly great, will it not
            overwhelm us?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Answer. In the eternal world, our faculties shall be extended, and
            through the Mediator, Christ—we shall be made capable of receiving
            this reward. Put a plate of steel behind a glass and you may see
            your face in it. So, Christ's human nature being put as steel to the
            divine, God's glory will be seen and enjoyed by us. As there is no
            seeing the sun in the circle but in the beams, so, whatever of God
            is made visible to us will be through the golden beams of the Sun of
            Righteousness.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Question. Where does the <b>certainty </b>of this reward appear?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Answer. God, who is the oracle of truth, has asserted it. God's oath
            is laid as pledge, Psalm 58:11. Nay, God has not only pawned His
            truth, the most orient pearl of His crown—but He has given the
            anticipation and first fruits of this reward to His saints in joy
            and consolation, Galatians 5:22, which assures them of a harvest
            afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>Question. But <b>when </b>shall we be possessed of this reward?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Answer. The time is not long. Revelation 22:12, "Behold, I come
            <i>quickly—</i>and My reward is with Me." <i>Sense </i>and
            <i>reason </i>think it a long interval—but <i>faith </i>looks at the
            rewards as near. Through a telescope, an object which is at some
            distance seems near to the eye. So, when faith looks through the
            telescope of a promise, the reward seems near. As faith
            substantiates, so it anticipates things not seen; it makes them
            present, Ephesians 2:6.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Question. But <b>why </b>is this reward at all deferred?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Answer 1. God does not see fit that we should yet receive it. Our
            work is not done. A day laborer does not receive his pay until his
            work is done. Even Christ's reward was deferred until He had
            completed His mediatorial work and said upon the cross, "It is
            finished."
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Answer 2. God defers the reward that we may live by <i> faith</i>.
            We are taken with the <i>reward</i>—but God is more taken with our
            <i>faith</i>. No grace honors God like faith, Romans 4:20. God has
            given Himself to us by promise. Faith trusts God's bond, and
            patience waits for the payment.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Answer 3. God adjourns the reward a while to <i>sweeten </i>it and
            make it more welcome to us when it comes. After all our labors,
            watchings, and conflicts—how comfortable will the reward be! Nay,
            the longer the reward is deferred—the greater it is appreciated. The
            longest labors, have the largest returns.

          <p>
            If still it is asked, "When shall the time of this reward be?" I
            say, the righteous shall receive part of their reward at death. No
            sooner is the soul out of the body—than it is present with the Lord,
            2 Corinthians 5:8. And the full coronation is at the resurrection
            when the soul and body shall be united and perfected in glory.
            Christians, do not faint in your voyage, though it may be
            troublesome. You are within a few steps of heaven! Your salvation is
            now nearer, than when you first believed, Romans 13:11.

          <p>
            BRANCH 1. Hence it is evident that it is lawful to look to the
            future reward. God is our reward; is it not lawful to look to Him?
            Moses had an eye to the recompense of reward, Hebrews 11:26. What
            was this reward, but God Himself! Verse 27, "As seeing Him who is
            invisible." Looking to the reward, quickens us in piety. It is like
            the rod of myrtle in the traveler's hand which, it is said, revives
            his spirits and makes him walk without being weary. Who that is
            subject to fainting fits, will not carry the <i>remedy </i>with him?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            BRANCH 2. If God is such an exceedingly great reward, then it is not
            in vain, to engage in His service. It was a slanderous speech, "It
            is vain to serve God!" Malachi 3:14. The infinite Jehovah gives a
            reward that is as far beyond our thoughts—as it is above our
            deserts. How apt are people, through ignorance or mistake, to
            misjudge the ways of God! They think it will not be worth the cost
            to be pious. They speak evil of true religion before they have tried
            it; as if one should condemn a food before he has tasted it. Beside
            the gratuities which God gives in this life—provision, protection,
            and peace—there is a glorious reward shortly coming, Psalm 19:11.
            God Himself is the saints' dowry! God has a true monopoly—He has
            those riches which are nowhere else to be had—the riches of
            salvation. He is such a gold-mine as no angel can find the
            bottom—the unsearchable riches of Christ! Ephesians 3:8. Is it vain,
            then, to serve God? A Christian's <i>work </i>is soon over—but not
            his <i>reward</i>. He has such a harvest coming, as cannot be fully
            taken in. It will always be reaping time in heaven. How great is
            that reward—which <i>thoughts </i>

            cannot measure, nor <i>time </i>finish!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            BRANCH 3. See the detestable folly of such as refuse God. Psalm
            81:11, "Israel would have none of Me." Is it usual to refuse
            rewards? If a man should have a vast sum of money offered to him and
            he should refuse it, his sanity would be called into question. God
            offers an incomprehensible reward to men—yet they refuse! They are
            like a
            <b>magnet </b>which refuses gold and diamond—and draws rusty iron to
            it instead! Man, by his fall, lost his <i>headpiece</i>; he does not
            see where his best interest lies. He flies

            <i>from </i>God as if he were afraid of salvation; and what does he
            refuse God for? The fleeting and unsatisfying pleasures of the
            world! We may write upon them "temporary." And to lose God for these
            perishables is an example of folly worse than that of Lysimachus,
            who, for a draft of water, lost his kingdom. We read in Scripture of
            two cups. Psalm 16:5, "The Lord is the portion of my cup." Those who
            refuse this cup shall have another cup to drink of—Psalm 11:6, "Upon
            the wicked He shall rain snares, fire, and brimstone—this shall be
            the portion of their cup."
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            BRANCH 4. If God is such an immense reward, then see how little
            cause the saints have to fear <i>death</i>. Are men afraid to
            receive

            <i>rewards? </i>There is no way to really <i>live, </i>but by
            <i>dying</i>. Christians would be clothed with glory—but are loath
            to be unclothed. They pray, "may Your kingdom come," and when God is
            leading them to this kingdom, they are afraid to go. What makes us
            desirous of staying here on earth? There is more in the world to
            <i>wean </i>us—than to <i>entice </i>us. Is it not a
            <i>valley of tears? </i>And do we weep to leave it? Are we not in a
            <i> wilderness </i>among fiery serpents? And are we loath to leave
            their company? Is there a better friend we can go to—than God! Are
            there any sweeter smiles or softer embraces—than His! Surely, those
            who know that when they die they go to receive their reward, should
            neither be fond of life—nor fearful of death! The pangs of death to
            believers are but the pangs of travail by which they are born into
            glory.

          Sensualists question this reward, because they do not <i>see </i>it.
          They may as well question the verity of their souls because, being
          spirits, they cannot be seen. Where should our faith rest but upon a
          divine testimony? We believe there are such places such as Africa and
          China (though we have never seen them) because travelers who have been
          there affirm it. And shall we not believe the eternal recompenses,
          when God <i>Himself </i>affirms them? The whole earth hangs upon the
          Word of God's <i>power</i>, and shall not our faith hang upon the Word
          of His <i>truth</i>? Let us not be skeptics, in matters of such
          importance.
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The disbelief of this grand truth is the cause of the flagitiousness
            of the age. Immorality begins at infidelity, Hebrews 3:12. To
            mistrust a future reward is to question the Bible and to destroy a
            main article of our Creed, "Life everlasting." Such atheists as look
            upon God's promise but as a forged deed, put God to swear against
            them, that they shall never enter into His rest, verse 18.

            Question.
            <font color="#008000"
              ><b>How shall we know that God is our reward? </b></font
            >There are four ways:
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            1. If God has given us the pledge of this reward. This pledge is His
            Spirit. Ephesians 1:13-14, "You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
            promise, who is the pledge of our inheritance." Where God gives His
            Spirit for a <i>pledge</i>—there He gives Himself for a
            <i>portion</i>. Christ gave the <i>purse </i>to Judas, not His
            <i>Spirit</i>.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>How shall we know we have God's Spirit?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The Spirit carries influence along with Himself. He consecrates the
            <i>heart</i>—making it a holy of holies. He sanctifies the

            <i>mind</i>—causing it to mint holy thoughts. He sanctifies the
            <i>will</i>, strongly biasing it to godliness. As musk, lying among
            linen, perfumes it—so the Spirit of God in the soul perfumes it with
            holiness.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            But are not the unregenerate said to partake of the Holy Spirit?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            They may have the <i>common </i>gifts of the Spirit—but not the
            <i>special </i>grace. They may have the <i>enlightening </i>of the
            Spirit—but not the <i>anointing</i> of the Spirit. They may have the
            Spirit

            <i>move </i>in them—but not <i>live </i>in them. But to partake of
            the Holy Spirit aright, is when the Spirit leaves lively impressions
            upon the heart. He softens, purifies, and transforms it—writing a
            law of grace there! Hebrews 8:10. By this pledge, we have a title to
            the reward.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. If God is our reward, He has given us a <i>hand </i>to lay hold
            on Him. This hand is <i>faith</i>. Mark 9:24, "Lord, I believe." A
            weak faith justifies. As a weak hand can tie the knot in marriage;
            just so—a

            <i>weak faith </i>can lay hold on a <i>strong Christ! </i>The nature
            of faith is <i>assent </i>joined with <i>affiance</i>, Acts 8:37 and
            16:31. Faith makes God ours! Other graces make us
            <i>like </i>Christ—faith makes us

            <i>one </i>with Him. And this faith is known by its <i>virtue</i>.
            Precious faith has virtue in it; it quickens and ennobles; it puts
            worth into our services, Romans 16:26.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            3. We may know God is our reward by our choosing Him. True religion
            is not a matter of <i>chance—</i>but of <i>choice</i>, Psalm 119:30.
            Have we weighed things in the balance, and, upon mature
            deliberation, made this choice—"We will have God upon any terms"?
            Have we sat down and reckoned the cost? What true religion
            <i>must </i>cost us—parting with our lusts; and what it
            <i>may </i>cost us—parting with our lives? Have we resolved, through
            the assistance of grace, to own Christ when the world is against us.
            And to sail with Him not only in a pleasure-boat, but in a
            battle-ship? This choosing God speaks Him to be ours. Hypocrites
            profess God out of worldly design, not pious choice.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            4. God is known to be our reward, by the <i>delight </i>

            we take in Him, Psalm 37:4-8. How men please themselves with rich
            portions! What delight a bride takes in her jewels! Do we
            <i>delight </i>in God as our eternal portion? Indeed, He is a whole
            paradise of delight! All excellencies meet in God! Is ours a
            <i>genuine </i>delight? Do we not only delight in God's
            <i>blessings—</i>but in God <i>Himself? </i>Is it a <i>superior </i>

            delight? Do we delight in God <i>above </i>other things? David had
            His crown-revenues to delight in—but his delight in God took place
            over all other delights. Psalm 43:4, "God, my
            <i>exceeding </i>glory," or, as it is in the original, "the
            <i>cream </i>of my joy." Can we delight in God when other delights
            are gone? "Even though the fig trees have no blossoms, and there are
            no grapes on the vine; even though the olive crop fails, and the
            fields lie empty and barren; even though the flocks die in the
            fields, and the cattle barns are empty,
            <i>yet I will rejoice in the Lord! </i>I will be joyful in the God
            of my salvation!" Habakkuk 3:17-18
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            When the <i>flowers </i>in a man's garden die—yet he can delight in
            his <i>land </i>and <i>money</i>. Thus a gracious soul, when the

            <i>creature </i>fades, can rejoice in the
            <i>pearl of great price. </i>

            Paulinus, when they told him the Goths had sacked his city and
            plundered him of all, lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Lord,
            You know where I have laid up my treasure." By this
            <i>delighting </i>in God, we may undoubtedly know He is our reward.

            glory—until your hearts are deeply affected! "What, Lord! Is there
            such an incomprehensible reward to be bestowed upon <i>me!</i> Shall
            these eyes of

            <i>mine </i>be blessed with transforming thoughts of You? Oh, the
            astonishing love of God to sinners!" Stand at this fire of
            meditation until your hearts begin to be warm. How would the
            reflection on this immense reward, conquer temptation and
            <i>behead those unruly lusts </i>which have formerly conspired
            against us! "What! Is there a reward so sure, so sweet, so rich! And
            shall I forfeit this by sin? Shall I, to please my <i>appetite</i>,
            lose my crown? Oh, all you pleasures of sin, begone! Let me no more

          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            There is no stronger antidote to expel sin than the

          <i>eternal portion </i>is large! If God is yours—this may rock your
          hearts quiet. God lets the wicked have their pay beforehand. Luke
          6:24, "You have already received your comfort." A wicked man will make
          his acquittance and write, "Received in full payment." But the saints'
          reward is in reversion—the robe and the ring are <i>yet to come! </i>

          May not this tune their hearts into contentment? Christian! What if
          God denies you a trifle which you may desire? If He says, "Son, all
          that I have is yours!" Luke 15:31. Is not this sufficient? Why do you
          complain of the <i> world's emptiness—</i>when you have
          <i>God's fullness! </i>Is not God reward enough? Has a son any cause
          to complain that his father denies him a flower in the garden—when he
          makes him heir to his wealthy estate?
          <p></p>

            The philosopher comforted himself with this—that though he had no
            music or vine trees—yet he had the <i>household gods </i>with him.
            So, Christian, though you do not have much of the world—yet you have
            God—and He is an inexhaustible treasure! It was strange, after God
            had told Abraham, "I am your exceeding great reward," that Abraham
            should yet say, "Lord God, what will You give me seeing I go
            childless?" Genesis 15:2. Shall Abraham ask, "Lord, what will You
            give me?" when He had given <i>Himself! </i>Was Abraham troubled at
            the lack of a <i>child</i>—when he had a <i>God! </i>Was not God
            "better than ten sons"? Who should be content—if not he who has God
            for his portion and heaven for his eternal haven!

            Let this exceedingly great reward stir up in us a spirit of
            <i>activity </i>for God. Our <i>head </i>should study for Him; our
            <i> hands </i>should work for Him; our <i>feet </i>should run in the
            way of His commandments. Alas! How little—is all that we can do! Our
            <i>work </i>bears no proportion with our <i>reward</i>. The thoughts
            of this reward should make us rise off the <i>bed of sloth </i>and
            live for God with all our might. It should add wings to our prayers,
            and weight to our alms. A slothful person stands in the world for a
            <i>cipher</i>, and God writes down

            <i>no ciphers </i>in the book of life! Let us abound in the work of
            the Lord, 1 Corinthians 15:58. As aromatic trees sweat out their
            precious oils—so should we sweat out our strength and spirits for
            Christ.

            Paul, knowing what a splendid reward was ahead, brought all the more
            glory he could to God. 1 Corinthians 15:10, "I labored more
            abundantly than they all." He outworked all the other apostles. Did
            Plato and Demosthenes undergo such herculean labors and studies, who
            had but the dim candlelight of nature to see by? And shall not
            Christians much more put forth all their vigor of spirit for
            God—when they are sure to be crowned, nay—God Himself will be their
            crown!

          God loves a <i>gladsome </i>

            Answer. Let God take away whatever He will from you—He will at last
            give you that which is far better. Be not too much troubled, at the
            diminution of these earthly things—for all the eternal blessings of

          not the bride desire her wedding day? Revelation 22:17. If we
          seriously considered our condition here on earth—that we are compassed
          with a body of sin; that we cannot pray without wandering; that we
          cannot believe without doubting—would not this make us desire to
          depart, to be gone to heaven? Let us think how happy those saints
          above are, who are solacing themselves in God. While <i>we </i>live

          Psalm 118:28, "You are my God—and I will <i>praise </i>You!"
          Themistocles thought he was well requited by the Grecians for his
          valor—when they took such notice of him in the Olympics, saying, "This
          is Themistocles." God counts it requital enough for all His love—when
          we are grateful and present Him with our <i> thank offering! </i>And
          well may we stand upon Mount Gerizim, blessing and praising, if we
          consider the greatness of this reward. That we should be made heirs of
          God; and that this surpassing reward is not a <i>debt </i>but a
          <i>legacy</i>; and that, when most others are passed by, the lot of
          free grace should fall upon <i>us!</i>—let this make us ascribe praise
          to the Lord. It is called "the <i>garment </i>of praise" in Isaiah
          61:3. The saints never look so lovely as in this garment. Praise is
          the work of heaven; such as shall have angels' <i>reward, </i>should
          do angels' <i>work</i>. The word "praise" comes from a Hebrew word
          that signifies <i>to shoot up. </i>The godly should shoot up their
          praises toward heaven! Shall you live forever with God and partake of
          His fullness in glory? Break forth into doxologies and triumphs! Long
          for that time when you shall join in concert with the angels, those
          choristers of heaven, in sounding forth hallelujahs to the King of
          glory! Such as are <i>monuments of mercy </i>should be
          <i>patterns of praise! </i

          They have lost their livings and promotions for conscience's sake—but

          Bernard said, "I cannot be poor—so long as God is rich; for His riches
          are mine!" Whatever we lose for God, we shall find again in Him. In
          Mark 10:28 the disciples said, "We have left all and have followed
          You." Alas! What had they left? A few sorry boats and nets! What were
          these, compared to their reward? They parted with fleeting goods—for
          the unchangeable God! All losses are made up in Him! We may be losers
          <i>for </i>God—but we shall never be losers <i>by </i>Him.

          The saints' reward will abundantly compensate for all their
          sufferings. Agrippa was laid in chains for Caius. When Caius came
          later to the empire, he released Agrippa out of prison and gave him a
          <i>chain of gold </i>bigger than his iron chain. Just so, God will
          infinitely remunerate those who suffer for Him. For their "waters of
          Marah" they shall have the <i>wine of Paradise! </i>The saints'
          <i>sufferings </i>are but for a short time—but their <i>reward </i>

          is forever! They are but a short while in the<i> winepress</i>—but
          forever in the<i> banqueting house! </i>The Hebrew word for "glory"
          signifies a <i> weight</i>. The <i>weight of glory</i>—should make
          affliction light. The enjoying of God eternally will cause Christians
          to forget all their sorrows. One beam of the Sun of Righteousness will
          dry up all their tears! After trouble—eternal peace! After
          labor—eternal rest. Then God will be all in all to His people—light to
          their <i>eye</i>, manna to their <i>taste</i>, music to their
          <i>ear</i>, and joy to their <i>heart!</i> Oh, then, let the saints be
          comforted in the midst of their trials! Romans 8:18, "I reckon that
          the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with
          the glory which shall be revealed in us!"

            Here is dread to frighten them. They shall have a reward—but one

            Zophar notably sets forth a wicked man's reward in <b>Job 20</b>.
            Verse 7, "He shall perish forever, thrown away like his own dung."
            That is, he shall leave a stinking savor behind. Verse 16, "He will
            spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit
            them up. He will suck the poison of serpents." That is, the sin
            which was sweet as honey in his mouth—shall be as bitter as the
            poison of serpents. Verse 26, "Terrors will come over him; total
            darkness is reserved for his treasures. A fire unfanned [by human
            hands] will consume him." That is, the fire of hell shall torture
            his soul. He shall be ever consuming, never consumed. Verse 29,
            "This is the portion of a wicked man!" How dreadful is this! For
            every <i> golden sand of mercy </i>which runs out to a sinner, God
            puts a <i>drop of wrath </i>into His vial! "But because of your

            <i>storing up wrath </i>against yourself for the day of God's wrath,
            when his righteous judgment will be revealed." Romans 2:5.
