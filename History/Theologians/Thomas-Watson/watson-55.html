<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">True Religion—our 
    Business</font></b></p>
<p align="center">By Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">"Don't you know that I must be about My Father's 
    business?" Luke 2:49</p>
<p align="justify">These are the words of our Lord Jesus, whose lips dropped 
    as a honeycomb. The <i>occasion </i>was this, Christ, having the Spirit of
    <i>wisdom </i>and <i>sanctity </i>poured out upon Him without measure, being 
    but 12 years old, went to the temple and fell to disputing with the 
    religious teachers, verse 46. Where should learning blossom, but upon that 
    tree which bore several sorts of fruit? Who could better interpret 
    secrets—than He who lay in His Father's bosom, Colossians 2:9? According to 
    Luke 2:47, "All who heard Him were <i>astonished </i>at His understanding." 
    Well might they admire—that He who had never been at the university should 
    be able to silence the great religious teachers. John 7:15, "How did this 
    man get such learning without having studied?"</p>
<p align="justify">While they were wondering, his mother, who now was come 
    to seek Him, propounded this question, "Son, why have You thus dealt with 
    us?" Luke 2:48. That is, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your 
    father and I have been anxiously searching for you." In the words of the 
    text, Christ made a rational and pious reply, "Didn't you know I had to be 
    about My Father's business?" In the Greek it is "in the things of My 
    Father." It is as if Christ had said, "I must be doing the work which My 
    Father in heaven has set Me about; for this I received My mission and 
    unction, that I might do the will of Him who sent Me." What am I in the 
    world for but to promote His glory, propagate His truth, and be as a magnet 
    to draw souls to heaven? "Didn't you know I had to be about My Father's 
    business?"</p>
<p align="justify">From this example of our blessed Savior in making His 
    Father's work His business, we learn this great truth:</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. It is the duty of every Christian to make true 
    religion his business.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">True religion is not an occasional thing, only secondary 
    in importance, or the thing "by the by," proper only for spare hours; but it 
    must be the grand business of our lives. Paul made it so. His great care was 
    to know Christ and be found in Christ, Philippians 3:9-10. How abundantly 
    did he lay himself out for God! "I labored more abundantly than they all," 1 
    Corinthians 15:10. Paul moved heavenward, not slowly as the dial on the 
    sun—but as the sun in its hemisphere, with a winged swiftness. He made true 
    religion his business.</p>
<p align="justify">For the illustrating and unfolding of this, there are 
    three questions to be resolved:</p>
<p align="justify">1. What is meant by true religion?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Why must we make true religion our business?</p>
<p align="justify">3. What is it to make true religion our business?</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 1. What is meant by true religion?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Answer. The Latin word for religion, signifies a <i>
    knitting together</i>. Sin has loosened us from God—but when true religion 
    comes into the heart it fastens the heart to God again, as the members are 
    knit to the head by several nerves and ligaments. True religion is the 
    spiritual sinew and ligament, which knits us to God. The Greek word for 
    religion signifies a <i>right worshiping</i>. This is true religion, when we 
    not only worship the true God—but in that <i>manner </i>which He has 
    prescribed—by a right <i>rule</i>, from a right <i>principle</i>, and to a 
    right <i>end.</i></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 2. Why must we make true religion our business?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Answer. Because true religion is a matter of the highest 
    nature. While we are serving God, we are doing angels' work. The business of 
    true religion, infinitely out-balances all other things besides. Pleasure, 
    profit, and honor (the trinity which the world adores) are all of an 
    inferior alloy—and must give way to true religion. The fear of God is said 
    to be the whole duty of man, Ecclesiastes 12:13; or, as it is in the Hebrew, 
    the whole of man. Other things may delight; true religion satiates. Other 
    things may make us wise to admiration; true religion makes us wise to 
    salvation, 2 Timothy 3:15.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 3. What is it to make true religion our 
    business?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Answer. It consists principally in these seven things:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. We make true religion our business—when we wholly 
    devote ourselves to true religion. </p></b></font>Psalm 119:38, "Establish Your 
    Word unto Your servant, who is devoted to Your fear." We must be as the 
    scholar who devotes himself to his studies, and makes learning his whole 
    business. A godly man may sometimes run himself, through rashness and 
    thoughtlessness, upon that which is evil. There is no man so bad but he may 
    do some good actions; and there is no man so good but he may do some bad 
    actions. But the course and tenor of a godly man's life is pious. When he <i>
    deviates </i>to sin—yet he <i>devotes </i>himself to God. It is with 
    Christians as it is with a company of mariners at sea. They are bound for 
    some coast, and may meet with such a crosswind as may turn them back and 
    drive them in a quite contrary way. But as soon as the storm is over and the 
    sea calm, they recover themselves again and get into the right way where 
    they sailed before. Just so, it is with a Christian. Heaven is the haven he 
    is bound for; the Scripture is the compass he sails by; yet, by a contrary 
    wind of temptation blowing, he may be driven back into a sinful action. But 
    he recovers himself again by repentance and sails on constantly to the 
    heavenly port. This is to make true religion our business—when, 
    notwithstanding some excursions through human frailty, we are devoted to 
    God's fear and dedicate our entire existence to God.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. We make true religion our business—when we devote much 
    attention to the business of true religion chiefly.</p></b></font> It gains the 
    preeminence. "Seek <i>first </i>the kingdom of God," Matthew 6:33; first in 
    time, before all things, and first in affection, above all things. We must 
    give true religion the precedence, making all other things either 
    subservient or subordinate to it. We are to provide for our families—but 
    chiefly for our souls. This is to make true religion our business. It is 
    unworthy to make true religion come behind in the rear. It must lead the 
    van, and all other things must stoop and bow to it. He never had true 
    religion in his heart who said to any worldly thing, "In the throne, you 
    shall be greater."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. We make true religion our business—when our thoughts 
    are most busied about true religion. </p></b></font>While others are thinking 
    what they shall do to get a living, our thoughts are what we shall do to be 
    saved. David mused upon God, "While I was musing, the fire burned," Psalm 
    39:3. Thoughts are as passengers in the soul. When we travel every day to 
    the city of God and are contemplating glory and eternity, this is to make 
    true religion our business. Theophylact calls holy contemplation "the gate 
    and portal by which we enter into heaven." A Christian, by divine 
    soliloquies and meditations, is in heaven before his time. He is taken up 
    into paradise; his thoughts are all packed up and gone.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. We make true religion our business—when our main end 
    and scope is to serve God. </p></b></font>He is said to make the world his 
    business—whose great design is to get the world. Paul's ultimate end was 
    that Christ might be magnified, and the church edified. Our <i>aims </i>must 
    be good, as well as our <i>actions</i>. Many make use of religion for 
    sinister ends, like the eagle; while she flies aloft, her eye is upon her 
    prey. Hypocrites serve God on account of other advantages. They love the 
    temple for the gold; they court the gospel not for its beauty—but for its 
    jewels. These do not make true religion their business—but a political trick 
    and artifice to get money. But then we make true religion our business—when 
    the glory of God is mainly in our eye, and the very purpose and intent of 
    our life is to live to Him who has died for us. God is the center, and all 
    the lines of our actions must be drawn to this center.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. We make true religion our business—when we trade with 
    God every day. </p></b></font>"Our conversation is in heaven," Philippians 3:20. 
    The Greek word for "conversation" signifies commerce and traffic. Our 
    merchandise is in heaven. A man may live in one place and drive his trade in 
    another. Though a saint lives in the world—yet he trades above the moon. He 
    is a merchant for the pearl of price. This is to make true religion our 
    business. When we keep a holy fellowship with God, there is a trade driven 
    between us and heaven. "Our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son 
    Jesus Christ," 1 John 1:3. <i>God comes down to us upon the wing of His 
    Spirit—and we go up to Him upon the wing of prayer!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. We make true religion our business—when we redeem TIME 
    from secular things—for the service of God.</p></b></font> A godly man is the 
    greatest miser. He hoards up all the time he can for God. Psalm 119:62, "At 
    midnight I will rise to give thanks to You." Those are the best hours, which 
    are spent with God. David, having tasted how sweet the Lord was, would 
    borrow some time from his sleep that he might take a turn in heaven. It well 
    befits Christians, to take time from worldly occasions, vain amusements, 
    idle visits—that they may be the more intent upon the matters of true 
    religion.
<p align="justify">I have read of a holy man who, being tempted by his 
    former evil companions to sin, made this answer, "I am so busy in reading <i>
    a little book with three pages, </i>that I have no leisure so much as to 
    mind my other business." And being asked afterward whether he had read over 
    the book, he replied, "This book with three pages is of three colors—red, 
    white, and black—which contain such deep mysteries that I have resolved with 
    myself to read therein all the days of my life. In the first leaf, which is
    <font color="#ff0000"><b>red</b></font>, I meditate on the precious blood of 
    Christ which was shed for my sins. In the <u>white</u> leaf, I meditate on 
    the pure and delicious joys of heaven. In the <b>black </b>leaf, I 
    contemplate the hideous and dreadful torments of hell, prepared for the 
    wicked to all eternity."</p>
<p align="justify">This is to make true religion our business—when we are so 
    taken up with it, that we have scarcely any leisure for other things. </p>
<p align="justify">Christian, you have a <i>God </i>to serve, and a <i>soul
    </i>to save; and if you have anything of true religion in you, you will take 
    heed of the thieves of time, and will reserve all opportunities for the best 
    things. How far are they from Christianity, who jostle out holy duties! 
    Instead of borrowing time from the world for prayer—they steal time from 
    prayer that they might follow the world!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. We make true religion our business—when we serve God 
    with all our might.</p></b></font> Our strength and spirits are drawn forth 
    about true religion. We seek, sweat, strive, and bestir ourselves as in a 
    matter of life and death. We put forth not only <i>diligence</i>, but a holy
    <i>violence</i>. 2 Samuel 6:14, "David danced before the Lord with all his 
    might." This is to make true religion our business—when we shake off sloth 
    and put on zeal as a garment. We must not only pray—but pray fervently. We 
    must not only repent—but be "zealous and repent," Revelation 3:19. We must 
    not only love—but be "sick with love," Song of Solomon 2:5.
<p align="justify">This is to be a Christian with purpose, when we put forth 
    all our vigor and fervor in true religion, and take the kingdom of God, as 
    it were, by storm. It is not a faint desire, which will bring us to heaven. 
    There must not only be <i>wishing</i>, but <i>working</i>; and we must so 
    work as to be damned if we come short.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 1. Of Information.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 1.</p></b></font> Hence learn that there are but few 
    godly Christians. Oh, how few make true religion their business! Is he an 
    craftsman—who never worked in the trade? Is he a Christian—who never wrought 
    in the trade of godliness? How few make true religion their business!
<p align="justify">Some make religion a <i>complement</i>—but not their <i>
    business</i>. They court religion by a profession, and, if need be, religion 
    shall have their letters of commendation—but they do not make true religion 
    their business. Many of Christ's disciples who said, "Lord, evermore give us 
    this bread," John 6:34—yet soon after basely deserted Christ and would 
    follow Him no more. John 6:66, "From that time, many of His disciples went 
    back and walked no more with Him."</p>
<p align="justify">Others make the world their main business. "They mind 
    earthly things," Philippians 3:19. As the earth puts out the fire—so the 
    love of earthly things puts out the fire of heavenly affections. It was a 
    judgment upon Korah and Dathan, "The <i>earth </i>swallowed them up." 
    Numbers 16:32 Thus it is with many; the world swallows up their time, 
    thoughts, and discourse. They are swallowed alive in the earth! There is a 
    lawful use of these things—but the sin is in the excess. The bee may suck a 
    little honey from the flower; but put it in a barrel of honey—and it is 
    drowned. How many engulf themselves in the creature and drive such a trade 
    in the shop that they quite break in their trading for heaven! The farm and 
    oxen have kept millions from Christ. These do not make true religion their 
    business—but make the world their business. What will all the world be at 
    death--but a dream! Habakkuk 2:13, "They work so hard, but all in vain!"</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 2.</p></b></font> Hence see how hard it is to be 
    saved. It is not as easy as some think. True religion must be our business. 
    It is not enough to have a smack of religion, a touch of religion—but we 
    must make it our business. How many <i>precepts </i>have we to obey, how 
    many <i>temptations </i>to resist, how many <i>graces </i>to treasure up! 
    True religion is the work of our whole lives, and all is little enough! 
    Lord, then how hard is it to be saved! "Where will the sinner appear?" What 
    will become of the gallants of our time—who make sin their business, whose 
    whole employment is to indulge and pamper the flesh, lovers of pleasure more 
    than lovers of God? "All their care is," said Jerome, "to crisp their hair, 
    to sparkle their diamonds; instead of steeping their souls in brinish tears, 
    they bathe themselves in perfumed waters and ride to hell upon the back of 
    pleasure!"
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Of Trial.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Let us deal impartially with our own souls, and put 
    ourselves upon a strict trial before the Lord whether we make true religion 
    our business or not. And, for our better progress herein, I shall lay down
    <b>ten signs and characters of a man who makes his true religion his 
    business</b>; and by these, as by a gospel touchstone, we may try ourselves.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Character 1. He who makes true religion his business—does 
    not place his piety only in externals.</p></b></font> Romans 2:28, "He is not a 
    Jew, who is one outwardly." True religion does not stand only in forms and 
    shadows; this is to give God <i>leaves </i>instead of <i>fruit</i>. It is 
    often seen that the <i>pomp of worship </i>destroys the <i>purity of worship</i>—as 
    the paint of the glass hinders the light. And it is no untruth to say, that 
    religious formality will as well damn—as profane wickedness. A superstitious 
    religionist will as well be in hell—as a drunken sot. A Christian's main 
    work lies with his heart. He who makes true religion his business gives God 
    the heart; he worships Him in spirit and truth. In distilling, the spirits 
    are strongest. The godly Christian distills out the spirits for God. Aaron 
    must offer the <i>fat </i>upon the altar, Leviticus 3:3, 16, "He shall offer 
    an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the fat that covers the inwards. All 
    the fat is the Lord's." If Aaron had offered the skin instead of the fat, it 
    would not have been accepted. External devotion alone is offering the skin, 
    and they who give God only the <i>skin of religion, </i>shall carry away 
    only the <i>shell of comfort</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Character 2. He who makes true religion his 
    business—avoids everything that may be an obstacle or a hindrance to him in 
    his work. </p></b></font>A wicked man does not care whether he makes progress in 
    true religion. He stands in the way of temptation, and, as if sin did not 
    come fast enough—he draws it as with a cart rope, Isaiah 5:18. But he who 
    makes true religion his business, flies from temptation; and while he is 
    running the heavenly race he "lays aside every weight of sin which does so 
    easily beset him," Hebrews 12:1. A man may as well miss heaven by <i>
    loitering </i>in the way—as by <i>losing </i>the way. "The king's business 
    required haste," 1 Samuel 21:8, so the business of true religion requires 
    haste. Therefore, the godly Christian is careful that he is not taken off 
    the work, and so found tardy in it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Character 3. He who makes true religion his business has 
    a care to preserve conscience inviolable</p></b></font>, and would rather offend 
    all the world—than offend his conscience. 2 Timothy 1:3, "I thank God, whom 
    I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience." Much of true religion 
    lies in conscience. Faith is a precious jewel—but conscience is the cabinet 
    where this jewel must be kept. 1 Timothy 3:9, "Holding the mystery of the 
    faith in a pure conscience." 1 Timothy 1:5, "Charity out of a pure heart, 
    and of a good conscience." So sacred a thing is conscience, that without 
    this all true religion drops in pieces. He who makes true religion his 
    business labors to get conscience regulated by Scripture as the watch is set 
    by the dial, and, having done this, he keeps his conscience as would protect 
    his eye—so that no dust of sin falls into it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Character 4. He who makes true religion his business sees 
    to it that piety has an influence upon all his civil actions.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">True religion has an influence upon his <b>eating </b>and
    <b>drinking</b>. He holds the golden bridle of temperance; he eats 
    sparingly. As Chrysostom said, "The godly man feeds not to please the 
    sensual appetite—but that he may, by the strength he receives from the 
    creature, be the more fit for the cheerful discharge of spiritual services." 
    He does not make his food fuel for lust—but help to duty. Epicures dig their 
    own grave with their teeth; they feed without fear, Jude 12; they are 
    lawless gluttons. Sinners do not fear lest their table should be a snare. 
    While the wine is in the cup, they do not fear the handwriting on the wall. 
    But the godly man, being regulated by true religion, puts a knife to his 
    throat—that he may cut the throat of intemperance.</p>
<p align="justify">He who makes true religion his business sees to it that 
    piety has an influence upon his <b>recreation</b>. The strings of the violin 
    must sometimes be slacked, lest they break. God affords His people generous 
    delights. The Scripture allows the use of recreation, but we are apt to 
    offend most in lawful things. More are killed with poison. True religion 
    sits as moderator in the soul. The man influenced by true religion dares not 
    make recreation an occupation. It is oil to quicken him in God's service, 
    not a sea to engulf him. He who is devoted to true religion puts bounds to 
    the Olympian sports. He sets up a pillar or boundary as immovable as one of 
    those which bear the name of Hercules, on which he writes, "No further than 
    this!"</p>
<p align="justify">He who makes true religion his business sees that true 
    religion has an influence upon his <b>buying </b>and <b>selling</b>. The 
    wicked get a livelihood often by deception; sometimes they depreciate 
    commodities; they sell the refuse of the wheat, Amos 8:6. They would pick 
    out the best grains of corn and then sell the rest. Sometimes they falsify 
    their weights. Hosea 12:7, "The balances of deceit are in his hand." But he 
    who makes true religion his business, is regulated by it in the shop. He is 
    just in his dealings; he dares not hold the Book of God in one hand and 
    false weights in the other. He is faithful to his neighbor, and makes as 
    much reckoning of the Ten Commandments as of his creed.</p>
<p align="justify">True religion has an influence upon his <b>marrying</b>. 
    He labors to graft upon a religious stock. He is not so ambitious of 
    nobility as of piety. Nor is his care so much to espouse dowry as virtue. In 
    a word, he seeks for a "helpmeet," one who may help him up the hill to 
    heaven. This is marrying "in the Lord." That marriage indeed is honorable 
    when the husband is joined to one who is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Here 
    is the man who makes true religion his business, who, in all his civil 
    transactions, is steered and influenced by true religion. True religion is 
    the <i>universal ingredient</i>.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Character 5. He who makes true religion his business—is 
    good in his calling and relations. </p></b></font><i>Relative grace </i>much 
    graces true religion. I shall suspect his goodness, who herein is deficient. 
    Some will pray and discourse well—but it appears they never made true 
    religion their business—but rather took it up for ostentation than 
    occupation because they are defective in relative duties. They are bad 
    husbands, bad children, etc. If one should draw a picture and leave out an 
    eye, it would greatly eclipse and take from the beauty of the picture. To 
    fail in a relation stains the honor of profession. He who makes true 
    religion his business, is like a star shining in the proper orb and station 
    wherein God has set him.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Character 6.</p></b></font> He who makes true religion his 
    business has a care of his company. He dares not twist into a cord of 
    friendship with sinners. Psalm 26:4, "I have not sat with vain people." 
    Diamonds will not cement with rubbish. It is dangerous to intermingle with 
    the wicked, lest their breath prove infectious; sin is very catching. Psalm 
    106:35-36, "They mingled among the pagans and adopted their evil customs. 
    And they served their idols, which were a snare unto them." If you mingle 
    bright and rusty armor together, the rusty will not be made bright—but the 
    bright will be made rusty. He who makes true religion his business, does not 
    like to be near those whose nearness sets him further off from God, and 
    whose embraces, like those of the spider, are to suck out the precious life. 
    The godly man engrafts himself into the communion of saints, and hereby, as 
    the scions, he partakes of the sap and virtue of their grace. He who makes 
    it his business to get to heaven associates only with those who may make him 
    better, or whom he may make better.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Character 7. He who makes true religion his 
    business—keeps his spiritual watch always by him.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">He watches his <b>eye</b>. Job 31:1, "I made a covenant 
    with my eyes." When Dinah was gadding, she was defiled, Genesis 34:1-2. When 
    the eye is gadding by impure glances, the heart is defiled.</p>
<p align="justify">He who makes true religion his business watches his <b>
    thoughts </b>lest they should turn to froth. Jeremiah 4:14, "How long shall 
    your vain thoughts lodge within you?" What a world of sin is minted in the 
    mind! A child of God sets a spy over his thoughts; he summons them in and 
    takes them captive "to the obedience of Christ," 2 Corinthians 10:5.</p>
<p align="justify">He who makes true religion his business watches his <b>
    passions</b>. Passion is like gunpowder, with which the devil, setting on 
    fire, blows up the soul. In a passion, Jonah quarreled with the Almighty, 
    Jonah 4:1, 9. He who is devoted to true religion watches his passions lest 
    the tide, growing high, should be carried down the stream and be drowned in 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">He who makes true religion his business watches his <b>
    duties</b>. Matthew 26:41, "Watch and pray."</p>
<p align="justify">First, he watches <b>in prayer</b>. The heart is subject 
    to remissness; if it is not dead in sin, it will be dead in prayer. A 
    Christian watches lest he should abate his fervor in duty. He knows if the 
    strings of his spiritual violin slacken, he cannot "make melody in his heart 
    to the Lord," Ephesians 5:19, Colossians 3:16.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, he watches <b>after prayer</b>. As a man is most 
    careful of himself when he comes out of a hot bath, the pores being then 
    most open and subject to cold, so a Christian is most careful when he comes 
    from an ordinance lest his heart should decoy him into sin. Therefore, when 
    he has prayed, he sets a watch. He deals with his heart as the Jews dealt 
    with Christ's sepulcher. Matthew 27:66 says that they "made the sepulcher 
    sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch." A godly Christian, having 
    been at the Word and sacrament (that sealing ordinance), after the sealing 
    sets a watch.</p>
<p align="justify">He who makes true religion his business watches his <b>
    temptation</b>. Temptation is the scout which the devil sends out to 
    discover our weaknesses. It is the fiery dart to blow up our grace. Satan 
    has his <i>depths </i>(Revelation 2:24), his <i>methods </i>(Ephesians 
    4:14), and his <i>devices </i>(2 Corinthians 2:11). He is continually 
    fishing for our souls, and if Satan is angling we need to be watching! He 
    who makes true religion his business is full of holy watchfulness. He lies 
    sentinel, and, with the prophet, stands upon his watchtower, Habakkuk 2:1. 
    Solomon said of a virtuous woman, Proverbs 31:18, "Her candle goes not out 
    by night." The godly Christian keeps his watch-candle always burning.</p>

<p align="justify">Character 8.</p></b></font> <font color="#008000"><b>He who 
    makes true religion his business—every day casts up his accounts to see how 
    things go in his soul</b></font>, Lamentations 3:40. Solomon said, "Know the 
    state of your flocks," Proverbs 27:23. A man who makes true religion his 
    work is careful to know the state of his soul. Before the Lord brings him to 
    a trial—he brings himself to a trial. He would rather use the looking-glass 
    of the Word to see his own heart—than put on the broad spectacles of censure 
    to see another's fault. He plays the critic upon himself. He searches what 
    sin is in his heart unrepented of; and, having found it out, he labors by 
    his tears, as by the waters of jealousy, to make the thigh of sin to rot, 
    Numbers 5:22.
<p align="justify">He searches whether he has grace or not—and he tries it 
    to see whether it is genuine or spurious. He is as much afraid of <i>painted 
    holiness—</i>as he is of going to a <i>painted heaven</i>. He traverses 
    things in his soul and will never leave until that question, whether he is 
    in the faith or not, is put out of question. Here is the man making true 
    religion his business. He is loath to be a spiritual bankrupt. Therefore, he 
    is still calling himself to account; and where he comes short, he gets 
    Christ to be his Surety.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Character 9. He who makes true religion his business will 
    be pious, whatever it costs him.</p></b></font> He is a <i>resolved </i>man. 
    Psalm 119:106, "I have sworn that I will keep Your righteous judgments." 
    There are some who will be <i>rich</i>—and there are some who will be <i>
    godly</i>. He who makes true religion his business will not, as Luther said, 
    be put off with other things. He can lack health, riches, or friends—but he 
    cannot lack Christ or grace. He <i>will </i>be godly. Let the times be what 
    they will, they shall not take him off the work of true religion. He will 
    follow Christ whatever the cost—the floods of persecution cannot drown his 
    zeal. He does not say, "There is a lion in the way." He will wrestle with 
    difficulties and march in the face of death. The Christians of the primitive 
    church cried out to the persecutor, "Hew us in pieces, burn us—but we will 
    never worship your idols." These were in good earnest for heaven.
<p align="justify">There is a great deal of difference between those who go 
    to sea for pleasure, and those mariners who are to go on a voyage to the 
    East Indies. The first, upon the least storm, retreat back to shore; but 
    those who are embarked for a voyage hold onto their course though the sea is 
    rough and stormy, and will venture their lives in hope of the golden harvest 
    at the Indies. Hypocrites seem religious when things are serene and calm—but 
    they will not sail in a <i>storm</i>. Only those who make true religion 
    their business, will hold out their voyage to heaven in the midst of 
    tempests and death-threatening dangers!</p>

    to God's bar. He walks "soberly, righteously, and godly," Titus 2:12. He 
    girds his loins, trims his lamp, and sets his house in order that when death 
    comes for him—he may have nothing to do but die. Behold here the man who 
    makes true religion his business.

<p align="justify">Use 3. Of Exhortation.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Let me persuade all you whose consciences may smite you 
    for former neglects—now set upon the work; make true religion your business; 
    bestir yourselves in this—as in a matter of life and death.</p>
<p align="justify">Question. But what must we do to make true religion our 
    business?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer. That you may be serious in this work, I shall lay 
    down several rules for your help and direction therein.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Rules for Making True religion Our Business</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 1.</p></b></font> If you would make true religion your 
    business—possess yourselves with this maxim—that true religion is the end of 
    your creation. God never sent men into the world only to eat and drink and 
    put on fine clothes—but the end of their creation is to honor Him. 1 Peter 
    4:11, "That God in all things may be glorified." Should the body only be 
    tended and looked after, this would be to trim the <i>scabbard </i>instead 
    of the <i>blade</i>. It would be to invert and frustrate the very end of our 
    being.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 2. </p></b></font>If you would make true religion your 
    business—get a change of <i>heart </i>wrought. Breathe after an inward 
    principle of holiness. He cannot make true religion his business who has no 
    true religion. Can the body move without a principle of life? Christian, get 
    your heart spiritualized by grace. An earthly heart will no more trade in 
    heaven, than a millstone will ascend, or a serpent fly in the air. The heart 
    must be divinely touched with the Spirit, like a needle with the magnet, 
    before it can cleave to God and follow Him fully, Numbers 14:24. Never 
    expect the practice to be holy until there is first a holy principle.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 3.</p></b></font> If you would make true religion your 
    business—set yourselves always under the eye of God. The master's eye makes 
    the servant work. God's eye will quicken our devotion. Psalm 16:8, "I have 
    set the Lord always before me." If we leave off work, or loiter in our work, 
    God sees. He has a window which opens into our breasts. This is, as 
    Chrysostom called it, "the eye of God which never sleeps," and would make us 
    active in the sphere of duty. If, indeed, God's eye were at any time off of 
    us, we might slacken our pace in piety. But He is always looking on. If we 
    take the wings of the morning we cannot fly from His presence. And He who is 
    now the <i>Spectator, </i>will be the <i>Judge!</i> Oh, how would this 
    consideration of God's omniscience keep us from being <i>truants </i>in 
    religion! How would it infuse a spirit of activity and gallantry into us, 
    making us put forward with all our might in the race to heaven!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 4.</p></b></font> If you would make true religion your 
    business—think often of the shortness of <b>time</b>. This life is but a 
    vapor, James 4:14; a shadow, 1 Chronicles 29:5; it is as nothing, Psalm 
    39:5. We are wheeling apace out of the world—and there is no work to be done 
    for our souls in the grave. Ecclesiastes 9:10, "Whatever your hand finds to 
    do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, where you are going, there 
    is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom." Now is the time 
    of life; now is the day of grace. You do not know how soon these two suns 
    may set. The shorter our life—the swifter should be our pace!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 5. </p></b></font>If you would make true religion your 
    business—get an understanding heart. Weigh things seriously in the balance 
    of reason and judgment. Think of the infinite importance of this 
    business—our eternal misery or happiness depends upon it! Other things are 
    but for convenience; this is of necessity. If <i>this </i>work is not 
    done—we are undone! If we do not do the work which <i>believers </i>are 
    doing, we must do the work which <i>devils </i>are doing. And if God gives 
    us a serious heart to lay ourselves out in the business of true religion, 
    our income will be greater than our expense. True religion is a good 
    trade—if it is well followed. It will remit the cost; it is like working in 
    gold. 1 Peter 1:9, "Receiving the end of your faith—even the salvation of 
    your souls." God will shortly take us from the <i>working house </i>to the
    <i>throne</i>, and will set upon our head a fresh garland made of the 
    flowers of paradise!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 6. </p></b></font>If you would make true religion your 
    business—implore the help of God's Spirit. All we can do is but lost labor, 
    unless the Spirit stimulates and empowers. Beg a gale from heaven. Song of 
    Solomon 4:16, "Awake, O north wind, and come south wind—blow upon my 
    garden." If the Spirit joins with our chariot, then we move to heaven 
    swiftly like a roe upon the mountains, or as the chariots of Amminadib, Song 
    of Solomon 2:17, 6:12.
<p align="justify">Now, having laid down the rules, let me, for a <i>
    conclusion</i>, press all Christians to this great duty of making true 
    religion their business. And I will use but <font color="#0000ff"><b>two 
    weighty considerations.</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The sweetness which is in true religion. </p></b></font>
    All her paths are pleasantness, Proverbs 3:17. The way of true religion is 
    strewn with roses, in regard to that inward peace which God gives. Psalm 
    19:11, "In keeping Your precepts there is great reward." As while the mother 
    tends her child, and sometimes beyond her strength too—yet finds a secret 
    delight in it; so, while a Christian is serving God, there is that inward 
    contentment and delight infused; and he meets with such transfigurations of 
    soul, that he thinks himself half in heaven. It was Christ's food and drink 
    to do His Father's will, John 4:34. True religion was Paul's <i>recreation</i>, 
    Romans 7:22. Though I should not speak of wages, the joys which God gives us 
    in this life are enough to make us be in love with His service.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Millions of people have eternally miscarried—for lack 
    of making true religion their business. </p></b></font>They have done <i>
    something </i>in religion—but not to any purpose. They have <i>begun</i>—but 
    have made too many stops and pauses. They have been <i>lukewarm </i>and <i>
    indifferent </i>in the business. They have served God—as if they served Him 
    not. They have <i>sinned </i>fervently, but <i>prayed </i>faintly. True 
    religion has been only an <i>incidental </i>thing. They have served God by 
    fits and starts—but have not made true religion their main business. 
    Therefore, they have miscarried to all eternity!
<p align="justify">If you could see a wicked man's tombstone in hell, you 
    might read this inscription upon it, "Here lies one in hellish flames—for 
    not making true religion his main business!" How many ships have suffered 
    shipwreck, notwithstanding all their glorious names of "The Hope," "The 
    Safeguard," and "The Triumph"! Just so—how many souls, notwithstanding their 
    glorious title of saintship, have suffered shipwreck in hell forever because 
    they have not made true religion their main business!</p>
