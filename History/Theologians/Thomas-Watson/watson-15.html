<p align="justify">In this <i>Song of Songs </i>we see the love of Christ and his 
    church running towards each other in a full torrent.</p>
<p align="justify">The text contains three general parts: </p>
<p align="justify">1. A symbol of affection: "My beloved." </p>
<p align="justify">2. A term of appropriation: "is mine." </p>
<p align="justify">3. A holy resignation: "I am his."</p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Doctrine: <b>There is a marital 
        union between Christ and believers</b>. The apostle, having treated at 
        large of marriage, winds up the whole chapter thus: "This is a great 
        mystery—but I speak concerning <i>Christ </i>and the <i>church</i>" 
        (Eph. 5:32). What is closer than union? What sweeter? There is <b>a 
        twofold union</b> with Christ: </font></p>
<p align="justify">1. A <u>natural</u> union. This all men have, Christ 
        having taken their nature on him and not that of the angels (Heb. 2:16). 
        But if there is no more than this natural union, it will give little 
        comfort. Thousands are damned—though Christ is united to their nature.
        </p>
<p align="justify">2. A <u>sacred</u> union. By this we are mystically 
        united to Christ. The union with Christ is not personal. If Christ's 
        essence were transfused into the person of a believer, then it would 
        follow that all that a believer does should be meritorious. </p>
<p align="justify">But the union between Christ and a saint is: </p>
<p align="justify">(a) <u>Federal</u>: "My beloved is mine." God the 
        Father gives the bride; God the Son receives the bride; God the Holy 
        Spirit ties the knot in marriage—he knits our wills to Christ and 
        Christ's love to us. </p>
<p align="justify">(b) <u>Effectual</u>. Christ unites himself to his 
        spouse <i>by his graces and influences</i>: "of his fullness have all we 
        received, and grace for grace" (John 1:16). Christ makes himself one 
        with the spouse by <i>conveying his image and stamping the impress of 
        his own holiness upon her!</i></p>

<p align="justify">This union with Christ may well be called <u>mystical</u>. 
        It is hard to describe the manner of it. It is hard to show how the soul 
        is united to the body—and how Christ is united to the soul. But though 
        this union is <i>spiritual</i>—it is <i>real</i>. Things in nature often 
        work insensibly, yet really (Eccles. 11:5). We do not see the hand move 
        on the sun-dial, yet it moves. The sun exhales and draws up the vapors 
        of the earth insensibly yet really. So the union between Christ and the 
        soul—though it is <i>imperceptible </i>to the eye of reason—is still <i>
        real </i>(1 Cor. 6:17). </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Before this union with Christ there must be a <b>
        separation</b></p></i>. The heart must be <i>separated from all other lovers</i>, 
        as in marriage there is a leaving of father and mother: "Forget your own 
        people, and your father's house." (Psalm 45:10). So there must be <i>a 
        leaving of our former sins, a breaking off the old league with hell 
        before we can be united to Christ</i>. "Ephraim shall say, What have I 
        to do any more with idols?" (Hos. 14:8), or as it is in the Hebrew, 
        "with sorrows." <i>Those sins which were looked on before as <b>lovers</b>, 
        are now <b>sorrows</b></i>. There must be a divorce, before a union. 
<b>
<p align="justify">The purpose of our marital union with Christ</p></b> is 
        twofold: 
<p align="justify">1. <u>Co-habitation</u>. This is one purpose of 
        marriage, <i>to live together</i>: "that Christ may <b>dwell</b> in your 
        hearts" (Eph. 2:17). It is not enough to pay Christ a few complimentary 
        visits in his ordinances—hypocrites may do so—but there must be a mutual 
        associating. We must dwell upon the thoughts of Christ: "he who <b>
        abides</b> in God" (I John 3:24). Married people should not live apart.
        </p>
<p align="justify">2. <u>Fruit bearing</u>: "That you may be married to 
        another; to Him who was raised from the dead—that we <i>should bear 
        fruit to God</i>." (Rom. 7:4). The spouse bears the fruits of the 
        Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness (Gal. 5:22). <i>
        Barrenness</i> is a shame in Christ's spouse!</p>
<p align="justify">This marriage union with Christ is <b>the most noble 
        and excellent union</b>: </p>
<p align="justify">(a) <u>Christ unites himself to many</u>. In other 
        marriages only <i>one </i>person is taken—but here <i>millions </i>are 
        taken! Otherwise, poor souls might cry out, "Alas! Christ has married 
        So-and-so, but what is that to me? I am left out." No, <i>Christ marries 
        thousands.</i> It is a holy and chaste polygamy. Multitudes of people do 
        not defile this marriage bed. <i>Any poor sinner who brings a humble, 
        believing heart may be married to Christ. </i></p>

<p align="justify">(b) There is <u>a closer union</u> in this holy 
        marriage than there can be in any other. In other marriages, two make <i>
        one flesh</i>—but Christ and the believer make <i>one spirit</i>: "But 
        he who is joined to the Lord is <i>one spirit</i> with Him." (ICor. 
        6:17). Now as the soul is more excellent than the body, and admits of 
        far greater joy, so <i>this spiritual union brings in more astonishing 
        delights and ravishments</i> than any other marriage relationship is 
        capable of. The joy that flows from the mystical union is unspeakable 
        and full of glory (I Peter 1:8). </p>
<p align="justify">(c) <u>This union with Christ never ceases</u>. Other 
        marriages are soon at an end. <i>Death </i>cuts asunder the marriage 
        knot—but <i>this marital union is eternal</i>. You who are once Christ's 
        spouse shall never again be a widow: "I will betroth you to me <i>
        forever</i>" (Hosea 2:19). To speak properly, our marriage with Christ 
        begins where other marriages end, at death. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">In this life there is only <i>the contract</i></p></b>. 
        The Jews had a time set between their engagement and marriage, sometimes 
        a year or more. In this life there is only the engagement and contract; 
        promises are made on both sides, and love passes secretly between Christ 
        and the soul. He gives some smiles of his face, and the soul sends up 
        her sighs and drops tears of love. But all this is only a <i>preliminary</i> 
        work, and something leading up to the marriage. The glorious completing 
        and solemnizing of the marriage is reserved for heaven. There, in 
        heaven, is the marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9) and the bed of 
        glory perfumed with love where the souls of the elect shall be 
        perpetually consoling themselves. "Then shall we ever be with the Lord" 
        (I Thess. 4:17). So <i>death merely begins our marriage with Christ.
</i><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">Application 1: </p></b></font><font face="Verdana">If 
        Christ is the <i>head</i> of the mystical body (Eph. 1:22), then this 
        doctrine <u>beheads the Pope</u>, that man of sin who usurps this 
        prerogative of being the head of the church, and so would defile 
        Christ's marriage bed. What blasphemy this is! Two heads are monstrous. 
        Christ is Head, as he is Husband. There is no vice-husband, no deputy in 
        his place. The Pope is the beast in Revelation (Rev. 13:11). To make him 
        head of the church, what would this be but to set the head of a beast 
        upon the body of a man? 
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">Application 2: </p></b></font><font face="Verdana">If 
        there is such a marital union, let us <u>test whether we are united to 
        Christ</u>: 
<p align="justify">1. Have we <b>chosen</b> Christ to set our love upon, 
        and is this choice founded on knowledge? </p>
<p align="justify">2. Have we <b>consented</b> to the match? It is not 
        enough that Christ is willing to have us—but are we willing to have him? 
        God does not so force salvation upon us that we shall have Christ 
        whether we want to or not. We must consent to have him. Many approve of 
        Christ—but do not give their consent. And this consent must be: </p>
<p align="justify">(a) <u>Pure and genuine</u>. We consent to have him 
        for his own worth and excellence: "You are fairer than the sons of men" 
        (Psalm. 45:2). </p>
<p align="justify">(b) A <u>present</u> consent: "now is the acceptable 
        time" (2 Cor. 6:2). If we put Christ off with delays and excuses, 
        perhaps he will stop coming. He will leave off wooing. "His spirit shall 
        no longer strive," and then, poor sinner, what will you do? When God's 
        wooing ends, your woes begin. </p>
<p align="justify">3. Have we <b>taken</b> Christ? <i>Faith is the bond 
        of the union</i>. Christ is joined to us by his Spirit, and we are 
        joined to him by faith. Faith ties the marriage knot. </p>
<p align="justify">4. Have we <b>given ourselves</b> up to Christ? Thus 
        the spouse in the text says, "I am his," as if she had said, "All I have 
        is for the use and service of Christ." <i>Have we made a surrender? </i>
        Have we given up our name and will to Christ? When the devil solicits by 
        a temptation, do we say, "We are not our own, we are Christ's; our 
        tongues are his, we must not defile them with oaths; our bodies are his 
        temple, we must not pollute them with sin?" If it is so, it is a sign 
        that the Holy Spirit has produced this blessed union between Christ and 
        us. </p>
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">Application 3:</p></b></font><font face="Verdana"> Is 
        there this mystical union? Then from that we may draw <b>many 
        inferences: 
<p align="justify">1. See the DIGNITY of all true believers.</p></b> They 
        are joined in marriage with Christ! There is not only assimilation but 
        union; they are not only <i>like</i> Christ but <i>one</i> with Christ. 
        All the saints have this honor. When a king marries a beggar, by virtue 
        of the union she is ennobled and made of the blood royal. As wicked men 
        are united to the prince of darkness, and he settles hell upon them as 
        their inheritance, so the godly are divinely united to Christ, who is 
        King of kings, and Lord of Lords (Rev. 19:16). By virtue of this sacred 
        union the saints are <i>dignified above the angels</i>. Christ is the 
        Lord of the angels—but not their husband. 
<b>
<p align="justify">2. See how HAPPILY all the saints are married.</p></b> 
        They are united to Christ, who is <b>the best Husband</b>, "the Chief 
        among ten thousand" (Song 5:10). Christ is a Husband who cannot be 
        paralleled: 
<p align="justify">(a) <u>For tender care</u>. The spouse cannot be as 
        considerate of her own soul and credit as Christ is considerate of her: 
        "He cares for you" (I Pet. 5:7). Christ has a debate with himself, 
        consulting and projecting how to carry on the work of our salvation. He 
        transacts all our affairs, he attends to our business as his own. 
        Indeed, he himself is concerned in it. He brings fresh supplies to his 
        spouse. If she <i>wanders</i> out of the way, he guides her. If she <i>
        stumbles</i>, he holds her by the hand. If she <i>falls</i>, he raises 
        her. If she is <i>dull</i>, he quickens her by his Spirit. If she is <i>
        perverse</i>, he draws her with cords of love. If she is <i>sad</i>, he 
        comforts her with promises. </p>
<p align="justify">(b) <u>For ardent affection</u>. No husband loves 
        like Christ. The Lord says to the people, "I have loved you," and they 
        say, "In what way have you loved us?" (Mal. 1:2). But we cannot say to 
        Christ, "In what way have you loved us?" Christ has given <i>real 
        demonstrations of his love</i> to his spouse. He has sent her his <i>
        Word</i>, which is a love-letter, and he has given her his <i>Spirit</i>, 
        which is a love-token. Christ loves more than any other husband: </p>
<p align="justify"><u>Christ puts a richer robe on his bride</u>: "For 
        He has clothed me with the <i>garments of salvation</i>, He has covered 
        me with the <i>robe of righteousness</i>, as a bridegroom decks himself 
        with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels." (Isa. 
        61:10).</p>
<p align="justify"><i>In this robe, God looks on us as if we had not 
        sinned!</i> This robe is as truly ours to justify us, as it is Christ's 
        to bestow on us. This robe not only <i>covers</i> but <i>adorns</i>. 
        Having on this robe, we are reputed righteous, not only as righteous as 
        angels—but <i>as righteous as Christ</i>: "that we might be made the 
        righteousness of God in him" (2 Cor.5:21). </p>
<p align="justify"><u>Christ gives his bride not only his golden 
        garments but his image!</u> <i>He loves her into his own likeness.</i> A 
        husband may have a dear affection for his wife—but he cannot stamp his 
        own image on her. If she is deformed, he may give her a veil to hide 
        it—but he cannot put his beauty on her. But Christ imparts "the beauty 
        of holiness" to his spouse: "Your fame went out among the nations 
        because of your <i>beauty</i>, for it was <i>perfect</i> through My 
        splendor which I had bestowed on you," (Ezek. 16:14). When Christ 
        marries a soul, he makes it lovely: "You are <i>all beautiful</i>, my 
        love" (Song 4:7). <i>Christ never thinks he has loved his spouse enough 
        until he can see his own face in her. </i></p>

<p align="justify"><u>Christ discharges those debts</u> which no other 
        husband can. Our sins are the worst debts we owe. If all the angels 
        should contribute money, they could not pay one of these debts—but 
        Christ frees us from these. He is both a Husband and a Surety. He says 
        to justice what Paul said concerning Onesimus, "But if he has wronged 
        you or owes anything, put that on my account." (Philem. 1:18). </p>
<p align="justify"><u>Christ has suffered more for his spouse</u> than 
        ever any husband did for a wife. He suffered <i>poverty</i> and <i>
        ignominy</i>. He who crowned the heavens with stars was himself crowned 
        with thorns. He was called a companion of sinners, so that we might be 
        made companions of angels. He had no regard of his life; <i>he leaped 
        into the sea of his Father's wrath to save his spouse from drowning!</i>
</p>
<p align="justify"><u>Christ's love does not end with his life</u>. He 
        loves his spouse <i>forever</i>: "I will betroth you to me <i>forever</i>" 
        (Hos. 2:19). Well may the apostle call it "a love which passes 
        knowledge" (Eph. 3:19). </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">3. See how RICH believers are.</p></b> They have married 
        into the crown of heaven, and by virtue of the marital union <i>all 
        Christ's riches go to believers</i>: "communion is founded in union." 
        Christ communicates his graces (John 1:16). As long as Christ has them, 
        believers shall not be in need. And he communicates his 
        privileges—justification, glorification. <i>He settles a kingdom on his 
        spouse as her inheritance</i> (Heb. 12:28). This is a key to the 
        apostle's riddle, "as having nothing, and yet <i>possessing all things</i>" 
        (2 Cor. 6:10). By virtue of the marriage union, <i>the saints have an 
        interest in all Christ's riches!</i> 
<b>
<p align="justify">4. See how fearful a sin it is, to abuse the saints.</p></b> 
        It is an injury done to Christ, for believers are mystically one with 
        him: "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute <i>me?"</i> (Acts 9:4). When the 
        body was wounded, the Head, being in heaven, cried out. In this sense, 
        men crucify Christ afresh (Heb. 6:6), because what is done to his 
        members is done to him. If Gideon was avenged upon those who slew his 
        brethren, will not Christ much more be avenged on those that wrong his 
        spouse (Judges 8:21)? Will a king tolerate having his treasure rifled, 
        his crown thrown in the dust, his queen beheaded? Will Christ bear with 
        the affronts and injuries done to his bride? The saints are the apple of 
        Christ's eye (Zech. 2:8), and let those who strike at his eye answer for 
        it. Isa 49:26 "I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh, 
        and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine" 
        (Isa.49:26). 
<b>
<p align="justify">5. See the reason why the saints so rejoice in the 
        Word and sacrament,</p></b> because here they meet with their Husband, 
        Christ! The wife desires to be in the presence of her husband. The <i>
        ordinances</i> are the chariot in which Christ rides, <i>the lattice 
        through which he looks forth and shows his smiling face. Here Christ 
        displays the banner of love</i> (Song 2:4). The Lord's Supper is nothing 
        other than a pledge and security of that eternal communion which the 
        saints shall have with Christ in heaven. <i>Then he will take the spouse 
        into his bosom.</i> If Christ is so sweet in an ordinance, when we have 
        only <i>short glances</i> and <i>dark glimpses </i>of him by faith, oh 
        then, <i>how delightful and ravishing will his presence be in heaven 
        when we see him face to face and are forever in his loving embraces! 
</i></font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">Application 4:</p></b></font><font face="Verdana"> <b>
        This mystical union affords much comfort to believers</b> in several 
        cases: 
<p align="justify">1. <u>In the case of the disrespect and unkindness of 
        the world</u>: "in wrath they hate me" (Psalm. 55:3). But <i>though we 
        live in an unkind world, we have a kind Husband:</i> "As the Father has 
        loved me, so have I loved you" (John 15:9). What angel can tell how God 
        the Father loves Christ? Yet the<i> Father's love to Christ is made the 
        copy and pattern of Christ's love to his spouse! </i>This love of Christ 
        as far exceeds all created love as the sun outshines the light of a 
        torch. And is not this a matter of comfort? Though the world hates me, 
        Christ still loves me. </p>
<p align="justify">2. <u>In the case of weakness of grace</u>. The 
        believer cannot lay hold on Christ, except with <i>a trembling hand</i>. 
        There is a "spirit of infirmity" on him. But oh, weak Christian, here is 
        strong consolation: you have a marital union to Christ! You are the 
        spouse of Christ! Will he will bear with you as the weaker vessel? Will 
        a husband divorce his wife because she is weak and sickly? No! he will 
        be the more tender with her. Christ <i>hates </i>divorce—but he will <i>
        pity </i>infirmity. When the spouse is faint and ready to be 
        discouraged, Christ puts his left hand under her head (Song 2:6). This 
        is the spouse's comfort when she is weak. Her Husband can infuse 
        strength into her: "My God shall be my strength" (Isa. 49:5).</p>
<p align="justify">3. <u>In the case of death</u>. When believers 
        die—they go to their Husband! Who would not be willing to cross the gulf 
        of death that they might meet with their Husband, Christ? "I desire to 
        loosen anchor" (Phil. 1:23), and be with Christ. What though the way is 
        dirty? We are going to our friend. When a woman is engaged, she longs 
        for the day of marriage<i>. After the saints' funeral, their marriage 
        begins. </i>The <i>body</i> is a <i>prison</i> to the soul. Who would 
        not desire to exchange a prison for a marriage bed? How glad Joseph was 
        to go out of prison to the king's court! God is wise; <i>he lets us meet 
        with changes and troubles here, so that he may wean us from the world 
        and make us long for death.</i> When the soul is divorced from the body, 
        it is married to Christ. </p>
<p align="justify">4. <u>In the case of passing sentence at the day of 
        judgment</u>. There is a marriage union and, oh Christian, <i>your 
        Husband shall be your judge!</i> A wife would not fear appearing at the 
        bar if her husband was sitting as judge. What though the devil should 
        bring in many indictments against you? <i>Christ will expunge your sins 
        in his blood.</i> Could he possibly say, "I shall condemn my spouse?" 
        Oh, what a comfort this is!<i> The Husband is judge!</i> Christ cannot 
        pass sentence against his spouse without passing it against himself. For 
        Christ and believers are one. </p>
<p align="justify">5. <u>In the case of the saints' suffering</u>. The 
        church of God is exposed in this life to many injuries—but she has a 
        Husband in heaven who is mindful of her and will "turn water into wine" 
        for her. Now it is a time of mourning with the spouse because the 
        Bridegroom is absent (Matt. 9:15). But shortly she shall put off her 
        mourning. Christ will wipe the tears of blood off the cheeks of his 
        spouse: "He will swallow up death forever, and the Lord God will wipe 
        away tears from all faces" (Isa. 25:8). Christ will comfort his spouse 
        for as much time as she has been afflicted. He will solace her with his 
        love; he will take away the cup of trembling and give her the cup of 
        consolation. And now she shall forget all her sorrows, being called into 
        the banqueting house of heaven and having the banner of Christ's love 
        displayed over her. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Application 5: Let me press several duties </p></b>upon 
        those who have this marriage union with Christ: 
<p align="justify">1. <u>Make use of this relationship</u> in two cases:
        </p>
<p align="justify">(a) <u>When the law brings in its indictments against 
        you</u>. The law says, "Here there are so many debts to be paid!" and it 
        demands satisfaction. Acknowledge the debt—but turn it all over to your 
        Husband, Christ. It is a maxim in law that the suit must not go against 
        the wife, as long as the husband is living. Tell Satan when he accuses 
        you, "It is true that the debt is mine—but go to my Husband, Christ! He 
        will discharge it." If we took this course, we might relieve ourselves 
        of much trouble. By faith we turn over the debt to our Husband. 
        Believers are not in a state of widowhood but of marriage. Satan will 
        never go to Christ—he knows that justice is satisfied and the debt book 
        cancelled—but he comes to us for the debt so that he may perplex us. We 
        should send him to Christ and then all lawsuits would cease. This is a 
        believer's triumph. <i>When he is guilty in himself, he is worthy in 
        Christ. When he is spotted in himself, he is pure in his Head. </i></p>

<p align="justify">(b) <u>In the case of desertion</u>. Christ may (for 
        reasons best known to himself) step aside for a time: "my beloved had 
        withdrawn himself" (Song 5:6). Do not say, therefore, that Christ has 
        gone for good. It is a fruit of jealousy in a wife, when her husband has 
        left her a while, to think that he has gone from her for good. Every 
        time Christ removes himself out of sight, it is wrong for us to say, 
        "The Lord has forsaken me" (Isa. 49:14). This is jealousy, and it is a 
        wrong done to the love of Christ and the sweetness of this marriage 
        relationship. Christ may forsake his spouse in regards to <i>comfort</i>—but 
        he will not forsake her in regard of <i>union</i>. A husband may be a 
        thousand miles distant from his wife—but he is still a husband. Christ 
        may leave his spouse—but the marriage knot still holds. </p>
<p align="justify">2. <u>Rejoice in your Husband, Christ</u>. Has Christ 
        honored you by taking you into the marriage relationship and making you 
        one with himself? This calls for joy. By virtue of the union, believers 
        are sharers with Christ in his riches. It was a custom among the Romans, 
        when the wife was brought home, for her to receive the keys of her 
        husband's house, intimating that the treasure and custody of the house 
        was now committed to her. When Christ brings his bride home to those 
        glorious mansions which he has gone ahead to prepare for her (John 
        14:2), <i>he will hand over the keys of his treasure to her, and she 
        shall be as rich as heaven can make her! </i>And shall not the spouse 
        rejoice and sing aloud upon her bed (Psalm. 149:5)? Christians, let the 
        times be ever so sad, you may rejoice in your spiritual espousals (Hab. 
        3:17,18). Let me tell you, it is a sin not to rejoice—you find fault 
        with your Husband, Christ. </p>
<p align="justify">When a wife is always sighing and weeping, what will 
        others say? "This woman has a bad husband!" Is this the fruit of 
        Christ's love to you, to reflect dishonor upon him? <i>A melancholy 
        spouse saddens Christ's heart.</i> I do not deny that Christians should 
        grieve for sins of daily occurrence—but to be always weeping (as if they 
        mourned without hope) is dishonorable to the marriage relationship. 
        "Rejoice in the Lord always" (Phil. 4:4). Rejoicing brings credit to 
        your husband. Christ loves a cheerful bride, and indeed the very purpose 
        of God's making us sad is to make us rejoice. We sow in tears, so that 
        we may reap in joy. The excessive sadness and contrition of the godly 
        will make others afraid to embrace Christ. They will begin to question 
        whether there is that satisfactory joy in religion which is claimed. Oh, 
        you saints of God, do not forget consolation; let others see that you do 
        not regret your choice. It is joy that puts liveliness and activity into 
        a Christian: "the joy of the Lord is your strength" (Neh. 8:10). <i>The 
        soul is swiftest in duty when it is carried on the wings of joy. </i></p>

<p align="justify">3. <u>Adorn this marriage relationship</u>, so that 
        you may be a crown to your husband. </p>
<p align="justify">(a) <u>Wear a veil</u>. We read of the spouse's veil 
        (Song 5:7). <i>This veil is <b>humility</b>. </i></p>

<p align="justify">(b) <u>Put on your jewels</u>. These are the <b>
        graces</b> which for their luster are compared to rows of pearl and 
        chains of gold (Song 1:1O). These precious jewels distinguish Christ's 
        bride from strangers. </p>
<p align="justify">(c) <u>Behave as becomes Christ's spouse</u>: </p>
<p align="justify"><b>In chastity</b>. Be chaste in your judgments; do 
        not defile yourselves with error. Error adulterates the mind (1 Tim. 
        6:5). It is one of Satan's artifices—first to defile the judgment, then 
        the conscience. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>In sanctity</b>. It is not for Christ's spouse to 
        behave like harlots. A half-naked breast and a wanton tongue—do not 
        befit a saint. Christ's bride must shine forth in gospel purity, so that 
        she may make her husband fall in love with her. A woman was asked what 
        dowry she brought her husband. She answered that she had no dowry—but 
        she promised to keep herself chaste. So though we can bring Christ no 
        dowry, yet he expects us to keep ourselves pure, not spotting the 
        breasts of our virginity by contagious and scandalous sins. </p>
<p align="justify">4. <u>Love your Husband, Christ</u> (Song 2:5). Love 
        him though he is reproached and persecuted. A wife loves her husband 
        when in prison. To inflame your love towards Christ, consider: </p>
<p align="justify">(a) <u>Nothing else is fit for you to love</u>. If 
        Christ is your Husband, it is not fit to have other lovers who would 
        make Christ grow jealous. </p>
<p align="justify">(b) <u>He is worthy of your love</u>. He is of 
        unparalleled beauty: "altogether lovely" (Song 5:16).</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">(c) <u>How fervent is Christ's love towards you!</u> 
        He loves you in your worst condition, he loves you in affliction. The 
        goldsmith loves his gold in the <i>furnace</i>. Just so, Christ loves 
        you notwithstanding your fears and blemishes. The <i>saints' infirmities
        </i>cannot wholly remove Christ's love from them (Jer. 3:1). Oh then, 
        how the spouse should be endeared in her love to Christ! Perfect love to 
        Christ, will be the excellence of heaven. Our love will then be like the 
        sun in its full strength!</p>
