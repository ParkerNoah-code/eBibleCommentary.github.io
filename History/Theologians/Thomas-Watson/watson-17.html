<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Good Practitioner</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    "If you <i>know </i>these things, happy are you if you <i><b>do </b></i>
    them." John 13:17</p>
<p align="justify">In this chapter our blessed Savior, the great Instructor 
    of the church, falls upon teaching His disciples. He taught them:</p>
<p align="justify">1. By <b>doctrine</b>. Verse 34, "A new commandment I 
    give unto you, that you love one another." Christ was now going out of the 
    world; and as a father, when he is dying, leaves a charge with his children 
    that they love one another, so our Savior leaves this solemn charge with His 
    disciples—that they love one another.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He taught them by <b>allegory</b>. Verse 4, "He got up 
    from the meal, took off His outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around His 
    waist." He thus taught them by a sacred allegory how He wrapped Himself with 
    our flesh. The blessed angels stood wondering at how the divine nature could 
    be girded with the human nature.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He taught them by <b>example</b>. Verse 5, "After 
    that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash His disciples' feet, 
    drying them with the towel that was wrapped around Him." He taught them 
    humility by His own example. He stooped to the lowest office. "He washes His 
    disciples feet", and this He did for their imitation. Verse 14, "you ought 
    also to wash one another's feet." Now our Lord Christ, having thus taught 
    His disciples by doctrine, allegory, and example—made use of all in the 
    words of the text, "If you <i>know </i>these things, happy are you if you <i>
    do </i>them."</p>
<p align="justify">This is a text that deserves to be engraved in letters of 
    gold upon our hearts; a text, that, if well observed, will help us to reap 
    benefit by all other texts. <i>A sermon is never rightly heard—until it is 
    practiced.</i> I shall, therefore, make this sermon to be, by the blessing of 
    God, as a stopcock, to keep the rest of the sermons you hear from leaking 
    out. That would be a wonderful sermon, which would help you to put all the 
    other sermons you have heard into practice.</p>
<p align="justify">"If you know these things." By the words "these things," 
    our Savior, gathers together all the matters of true religion; though more 
    particularly those two things He has been immediately before speaking of—<i>love
    </i>and <i>humility</i>. In the text there is:</p>
<p align="justify">1. A supposition, "if you know these things and do them."</p>
<p align="justify">2. A benediction, "happy are you." </p>
<p align="justify">From these two points, we see this doctrine: <b>It is not
    <i>knowledge </i>of the points of religion—but the <i>practice </i>of them, 
    which makes a man truly happy. </b>Had Christ said, "If you know these 
    things—happy are you," and there had stopped and gone no further, we would 
    have thought that knowledge would be enough to make one eternally happy and 
    blessed. Christ does not stop here, however—but goes further: "happy are you 
    if you do them." Christ does not put happiness upon <i>knowing—</i>but <i>
    doing</i>. It is not knowledge—but practice, which renders a man truly happy 
    and blessed.</p>
<p align="justify">This proposition consists of two branches, and I shall 
    handle them distinctly.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Knowledge alone, in the truths of Scripture—will not 
    make a man eternally happy and blessed.</p></b></font> Matthew 7:21. Luke 6:46, 
    "Why do you call Me <i>'Lord, Lord,' </i>and don’t do the things I say?" It 
    is not the mere knowledge and acceptance of the most glorious Gospel 
    truths—which will bring a man to heaven. If a man could fluently discourse 
    on all Scriptural truths, if his head were a treasury of wisdom, an ocean of 
    learning—yet this could not entitle him to happiness. His knowledge might 
    make him <i>admired--</i>but not <i>blessed</i>. If a man knew and believed 
    all the doctrines of Scripture—this could not crown him with happiness.
<p align="justify">Indeed, knowledge of the doctrines of Scripture, has a 
    beauty in it next to the pearl of grace; this gold is most precious. 
    Knowledge is the enriching of the mind. It is a fair garland to look 
    upon—but it is like Rachael. Though she was <i>beautiful</i>—yet being <i>
    barren </i>she said, "Give me children or I die!" Just so, if knowledge does 
    not bring forth the child of obedience—it will die and come to nothing. </p>
<p align="justify">I would by no means disparage knowledge. Knowledge is the 
    pilot to guide us in our obedience. If zeal is not according to knowledge, 
    it is will-worship; it is setting up an altar to an unknown God. Knowledge 
    must usher in obedience. It is as abominable to God to offer up the blind as 
    the lame. <i>Final ignorance damns! </i>Hosea 4:6, "My people are destroyed 
    for lack of knowledge." The Hebrew word is they are cut down or felled like 
    trees. So there is a <i>necessity </i>of knowledge. Knowledge is the elder 
    sister—but obedience is better than knowledge; here the elder must serve the 
    younger. Knowledge may put us into the way of happiness, but it is only 
    practice which brings us there. That <i>knowledge alone </i>cannot make a 
    man eternally happy and blessed—I shall prove by three demonstrations:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Knowledge alone, does not make a man <i>better</i>; 
    therefore, it cannot make him eternally happy and blessed.</p></b></font> Bare 
    knowledge has <i>no influence</i>; it does not leave a <i>spiritual tincture 
    of holiness </i>behind. Knowledge <i>informs</i>—not <i>transforms</i>. 
    Knowledge, of itself, has no power upon the heart to make it more divine. 
    Bare knowledge is like weak medicine, which does not work. It does not warm 
    the affections or purge the conscience; it does not fetch virtue from Christ 
    to dry up the bloody issue of sin. A man may receive the <i>light </i>of the 
    truth—yet not <i>love </i>the truth, "They perish because they refused to <i>
    love </i>the truth and so be saved." 2 Thessalonians 2:10. The Apostle calls 
    it "a form of knowledge," Romans 2:20. Knowledge alone, is but a dead form, 
    having nothing to animate it. He who has knowledge alone—is a spiritual 
    stillborn! He looks like a Christian—but has neither appetite nor motion. 
    Knowledge alone, makes men monsters in religion—they are all head but no 
    feet! They do not <i>walk </i>in Christ, Colossians 2:6. 
<p align="justify">A man may have right knowledge—and be neglectful of his 
    duty. Plutarch said of the Grecians that they knew what was just—but did not 
    practice justice. A man may have Scriptural knowledge—and still be profane! 
    He may have a <i>clear head </i>and a <i>foul heart!</i> The <i>
    understanding </i>may be illumined—when the <i>foot </i>treads in unholy 
    paths. If knowledge is divorced from practice, and does not make a man 
    better—then it cannot make a man eternally happy and blessed.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Knowledge alone, will not <i>save</i>; therefore, it cannot 
    make him eternally happy and blessed.</p></b></font> If bare knowledge will 
    save—then all who have knowledge shall be saved. But that is not true—for 
    then <b>Judas </b>would be saved—for he had knowledge enough. Then the <b>
    devil </b>would be saved! A man may have right knowledge, and be no better 
    than a devil! Hell is full of <i>learned heads! </i>Now, if knowledge alone 
    will not save—then it will not put a man into a state of blessedness.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Knowledge alone, makes a man's case <i>worse</i>; therefore, 
    it cannot make him eternally happy and blessed.</p></b></font> Knowledge takes 
    away all excuse and apology. John 15:22, "Now you have no cloak for your 
    sin." Knowledge adds to a man's torment. "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, 
    Bethsaida! I tell you, it will be <i>more tolerable </i>for the land of 
    Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!" It will be better with 
    heathen—than with professing Christians living in a contradiction to their 
    knowledge. Luke 12:47, "The servant will be <i>severely punished</i>, for 
    though he knew his duty, he refused to do it!" Knowledge without practice, 
    serves only as a torch to light men to hell—the brighter the light, the 
    hotter the fire! If a king causes his proclamation to be published, and the 
    subject knows it, but disobeys it—this incenses the king all the more 
    against him. He will punish that man for malicious contempt. Better to be 
    ignorant of Scriptural truth—than knowingly disobedient to it. Now, then, if 
    knowledge alone makes a man's case worse—then it is far from making him 
    eternally happy and blessed.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE. Get Scriptural knowledge—but do not <i>rest </i>in 
    it. </p></b></font>Will you rest in that which will not make you eternally happy 
    and blessed? In this sense, "he who increases knowledge, increases sorrow," 
    Ecclesiastes 1:18. His knowledge will only serve to condemn him. If 
    knowledge separated from practice would make men eternally happy and 
    blessed, the people of England would be a happy people. They do not lack 
    knowledge. Never since the time of the Apostles, did Biblical light shine 
    clearer; but here is the problem: most people know<i>—only to know</i>. It 
    may be said of the generality of people, as Seneca speaks—they would rather
    <i>dispute </i>well than <i>live </i>well. They would have knowledge to <i>
    bespangle </i>them—rather than <i>sanctify </i>them. Alas, knowledge alone 
    will never make them eternally happy and blessed. Men may build their nests 
    among the stars—yet make their bed in hell. They may have knowledge to crown 
    them—and God to damn them. O professor, who glories in your bare head 
    knowledge—in what do you excel a hypocrite? Where do you excel the devil? He 
    knows all the articles of the creed. He could say to Christ "It is written." 
    Is it not sad, that a man should have no better evidences to show for 
    heaven, than the devil!
<p align="justify">How unprofitable is a plethora of head knowledge? He who 
    is only filled with knowledge, is like a glass filled with froth. What a 
    vain, foolish thing it is, to have knowledge and make no spiritual use of 
    it! It is as if a man had several fountains in his garden, but never watered 
    his flowers with them; or as if an donkey should be laden with hay but eats 
    none of it. Just so, many a man carries a great deal of knowledge about 
    him—but does not feed upon the sweetness of it nor digests his knowledge 
    into practice.</p>
<p align="justify">To know <i>only to know</i>—is like one who knows certain 
    countries by the map and can discourse of them—but has never traveled into 
    them nor tasted the sweet spices of those countries. Just so, the gnostic in 
    religion has heard and read much of the beauty of holiness—but has never 
    traveled into piety or tasted how good the Lord is. What profit is it—to 
    have the Bible in our heads—but not in our hearts? Can mere notions be 
    cordials when we come to die?</p>
<p align="justify">To conclude this, men cannot properly be called 
    Christians from their knowledge alone. You do not call him a craftsman who 
    does not work in his trade. Let a man be ever so knowledgeable—yet you do 
    not call him a goldsmith who has never refined a vessel or tried gold. 
    Though a man has knowledge in surgery—yet you do not call him a surgeon who 
    has never lanced a wound or dressed a sore. Just so, it is improper to call 
    him a Christian who has knowledge, but no practice. He knows he should 
    mortify sin—but he does not. He knows he should show works of mercy—but he 
    does not. He never yet wrought in the trade of godliness.<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. I proceed to the second branch of the doctrine—that 
    it is the <i>practice</i> of true religion, which makes a man eternally 
    happy and blessed.</p></b></font> Knowledge without practice is like a fair 
    arbor without fruit. The art of <i>practice </i>is the most noble art. The 
    life-blood of religion runs through the veins of <i>obedience</i>. Here I 
    shall show why there must be practice, and that it is only the <i>practical </i>part 
    of religion which makes a man eternally happy and blessed.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The reason there must be practice, is because it is 
    only practice which answers God's end in giving us His Word</p></b></font>, both 
    written and preached. Leviticus 18:4, "You must <i>obey </i>my laws and be 
    careful to <i>follow </i>my decrees." Deuteronomy 26:16, "The Lord your God 
    is commanding you this day to <i>follow </i>these statutes and ordinances. 
    You must be careful to <i>follow </i>them with all your heart and all your 
    soul." Not only shall you <i>know </i>them, but <i>follow </i>them. The Word 
    of God is not only a rule of <i>knowledge</i>, but a rule of <i>duty</i>. If 
    you speak to your children and tell them what your mind is on a matter, it 
    is not only that they may <i>know </i>your mind—but <i>do </i>it. God gives 
    us His Word not only as a picture to <i>look </i>upon—but as a <i>copy </i>
    to <i>write </i>after. The master gives his servant a candle not to gaze 
    on—but to <i>work </i>by.
<p align="justify">The <i>light of Scripture </i>is to guide our <i>feet </i>
    into the way of obedience; and so David calls the Word of God not a lamp to 
    his eyes but a "lamp to his feet," Psalm 119:105, implying that the light of 
    the Word is rather to <i>walk </i>by—than to <i>see </i>by. God gives us His 
    Word as His will and testament, which He leaves in charge with us to see it
    <i>performed</i>. If God would only have had His laws to be <i>known </i>or
    <i>talked </i>of, He might have delivered them to parrots! If He would only 
    have had them kept safe, He might have "engraved them with an iron pen, and 
    laid in the rock forever," Job 19:24. But, therefore, He delivers the <i>
    records of heaven </i>to men that they should be <i>obeyed</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The Lord gives us His precepts as a physician gives the 
    patient his prescriptions—to take and apply. For this end are all God's 
    institutes, that we may, by practice, apply them for the purging out of sin 
    and bringing the soul into a more healthful temper. God gives us His Word as 
    the mother gives the child the breast—not only to look upon, but to draw 
    from. Many have gone to hell with the breast in their mouths, because they 
    have not drawn it and turned the milk of the Word into sacred nourishment!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It is only the practical part of religion, which makes 
    a man eternally happy and blessed.</p></b></font> This is clear if we consult 
    either with Scripture or reason.
<p align="justify">It appears by <font color="#008000"><b>Scripture</b></font>. 
    The Scripture knows no other way to happiness, but by practice. Psalm 15:5, 
    "He who <i>does </i>these things shall never be moved." The Psalmist does 
    not say, he who <i>knows </i>these things shall never perish—but he who <i>
    does </i>them. To be a doer of the Word entitles a man to blessedness. James 
    1:25, "But the one who looks intently into the perfect law of freedom and 
    perseveres in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts—this 
    person will be blessed in what he does." Not <i>for </i>his deed, as the 
    Papist's wrongly gloss—but <i>in </i>his deed. Obedience is rather an <i>
    evidence </i>of blessedness, than a cause of blessedness.</p>
<p align="justify">Search from one end of the Bible to the other—and you 
    shall find the crown still set upon the head of obedience! The renowned 
    saints of old have always received their commendations and titles of honor 
    from their obedience. "Moses was a man mighty in words and <i>deeds</i>," 
    Acts 7:22. When Christ pronounced the sentence of absolution, see how it 
    ran, "Then the King will say to those on His right—Come, you who are blessed 
    by My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of 
    the world. For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty 
    and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I 
    was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you took care of Me; I was in 
    prison and you visited Me." Matthew 25:34-36. Christ is not said at the last 
    day to reward men according to their <i>knowledge </i>but their <i>deeds</i>. 
    "Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me to repay each person 
    according to what he has done" Revelation 22:12. So, then, if the Scripture, 
    that unfailing measuring rod, points out no other way to happiness but 
    practice—then it is vain to expect it any other way.</p>
<p align="justify">This appears by <font color="#008000"><b>reason</b></font>. 
    Happiness is not attainable, but in the use of means. Now, the use of means 
    implies practice. Salvation must not only be sought out by knowledge, but 
    wrought out by practice, "work out your own salvation with fear and 
    trembling." Philippians 2:12. There can be no crown without <i>running</i>, 
    no recompense without <i>diligence</i>. If happiness comes only in the use 
    of means—then it is neither imaginable or feasible without practice.</p>
<p align="justify">If it is only the <i>doing </i>part of religion, which 
    makes men eternally happy and blessed—then it sharply reproves those who 
    know much—yet do nothing. They <i>talk </i>of God—but do not <i>walk </i>
    with God. Men are all for knowledge, because it is counted an ornament. They 
    would be adorned with this mirthful flower—but one leaf of the tree of <i>
    life </i>is worth all the tree of <i>knowledge</i>. <i>It is better to 
    practice one truth, than to know all truths. </i>Herein most Christians are 
    defective; they have with Rachael, good <i>eyes </i>but—they are <i>barren</i>. 
    Mephibosheth fell and became lame in his feet, 2 Samuel 4:4. Just so, since 
    Adam's fall, men are lame in their feet. They do not <i>walk </i>in the ways 
    of obedience. </p>
<p align="justify">Men know that <i>covetousness </i>is a sin. The Greek 
    word for covetousness signifies an immoderate desire of getting, like Midas 
    who desired that everything he touched might be turned to gold. The several 
    species of sin grow upon this root of covetousness, 2 Timothy 3:2. Yet men 
    live in this sin, and nothing can cure them of this cancer of covetousness. 
    Amos 2:7, "They pant after the dust of the earth." Men know <i>swearing </i>
    is a sin; for this the land mourns, Jeremiah 23:10. Sinners let their oaths 
    fly, and God sends a flying scroll against them, Zachariah 5:2-3—yet they 
    will not leave this sin. They know <i>drunkenness </i>to be a sin. There is 
    death in the cup—yet the drunkard will drink if off! Men know immorality to 
    be a sin, Exodus 20:14; it wastes their strength, blots their name, wounds 
    their conscience, wrongs their posterity, and damns their souls! Revelation 
    22:15. Yet they will follow this sin and burn in lust—though they burn in 
    hell.</p>
<p align="justify">Men know they should be winged with activity, in the 
    duties of piety—but they can be content to let these duties alone. They know 
    they should mortify the flesh, pray in their families, be just in their 
    dealing, and give alms to the poor. But if there were no other Bible to 
    teach us these things than the lives of most, we would not know there were 
    any such duties commanded! For the most part, men are not changed. What they 
    were twenty or thirty years ago—they are the same still—as proud and 
    unreformed as ever. The best tools have been either broken or worn out upon 
    their rocky hearts—yet they are as unhewn and unpolished as ever. The 
    bellows are burnt, the lungs of God's ministers are wasted—yet how much 
    reprobate silver remains still in many of our congregations! If none are 
    eternally happy and blessed but doers of the Word—how <i>few </i>will be 
    saved!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">WHY do so few come up to the practical part of religion?</p></b></font> 
    Surely it is:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Lack of practice, is for lack of deep HUMILITY. </p></b>
</font>He who has the spirit of bondage let loose upon him apprehends 
    himself, as it were, in the forlorn-hope. He sees the <i>sea of his sins </i>
    before him ready to swallow him up, and the justice of God behind pursuing 
    and ready to overtake him! He cries out as Paul, Acts 9:6, "Lord, what will 
    You have me do? Will You have me repent, or believe? I stand ready pressed 
    to whatever service You command." The humbled sinner does not <i>dispute—</i>but
    <i>obeys</i>. The seed that did not have <i>depth </i>of earth, withered and 
    came to nothing, Matthew 13:5-6. The reason men do not bring forth the 
    fruits of obedience, is because they have no <i>depth </i>of earth. They 
    were never yet deeply <i>humbled for sin</i>. A proud man will never obey. 
    Instead of trampling his sins under his feet—he tramples God's laws under 
    his feet, Jeremiah 43:3-4. He who <i>stoops in humility </i>is the likeliest 
    to put his neck under Christ's yoke. He who sees himself within an inch of 
    hell, asks the jailer's question, "What must I do to be saved?" Acts 16:30. 
    What will a condemned man not do, for a pardon!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Lack of practice, is for lack of FAITH.</p></b></font> 
    Isaiah 53:1, "Who has believed our report?" This makes sermons to be like 
    showers of rain, falling upon a <i>rock! </i>They neither <i>mollify </i>nor
    <i>fructify, </i>because men are in part, <i>infidels</i>. They would rather
    <i>dispute </i>than <i>believe</i>. Such as live as skeptics—die as 
    atheists. If men really believed that <b>sin </b>was so bitter, and that <i>
    wrath </i>and <i>hell </i>followed it—would they take this serpent into 
    their bosom! If they really believed that there was a beauty in holiness, if 
    they believed that godliness was gain, that there was joy in the way and 
    heaven at the end—would they not turn their feet into Christ's way? Men have 
    some slight transient thoughts of these things—but their minds are not fully 
    convinced, nor their conscience fully captivated into the belief of them. 
    This is Satan's masterpiece, his net by which he drags millions to hell, by 
    keeping them in unbelief. He knows that if he can only keep them from the 
    belief of the truth—he is sure to keep them from the practice of it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Men's backwardness to practice, is from the DIFFICULTY 
    of the practical part of religion. </p></b></font>It is easy to hear a truth, to 
    give some assent, to commend it, to make a profession of it. But to digest a 
    truth into practice is hard--because men are overgrown with sloth! They are 
    loathe to put themselves to too much trouble, "Laziness brings on deep 
    sleep." Proverbs 19:15. Can men dig for gold—and not for the pearl of great 
    price! Can they take pains in the pursuing of their sins—and will they be at 
    no pains for the saving of their souls! I dare be bold to say, it costs many 
    a sinner more sweat and labor in toiling for his lusts—than it costs a saint 
    in serving his God!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Lack of practice, is because the WORLD comes between 
    and hinders. </p></b></font>The <i>thorns </i>choke the seed of the Word. Men 
    practice so much in the <i>world</i>—that they have no time to practice 
    better things! The world is like a loud mill—it makes such a noise in carnal 
    hearts, that it drowns the sound of God's silver trumpet. Men's affections 
    are sometimes kindled by the preaching of the Word, and we begin to hope 
    that the <i>flame of godliness </i>will break forth in their lives; but then 
    comes the <i>earth—</i>and puts out this fire! How many sermons lie <i>
    buried in earthly hearts!
</i>
<p align="justify">Oh, that the lack of practice in this age, were more laid 
    to heart! This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation: many 
    professors are all ears. If we should see a creature made up of nothing but 
    ears, it would be a monster in nature! How many such monsters are there in 
    our churches? They <i>hear </i>and <i>hear—</i>and are never the better! 
    Like the salamander which lies in the fire, but, as naturalists say, it is 
    never the hotter.</p>
<p align="justify">Some satisfy themselves with having ordinances. Judges 
    17:13, "Then said Micah, Now know I that the Lord will do me good, seeing I 
    have a Levite as my priest." But what is medicine—if it is not applied? What 
    is it to have the sound of the Word in our ears—unless we have the Savior of 
    it in our hearts? It will be little comfort to men on their deathbeds, to 
    think that Christ has been preached in their streets, and they have been 
    lifted up to heaven in Gospel administrations, when their consciences shall 
    tell them they have been unholy and unreformed. They have come into God's 
    house as the beasts did into the ark: they came in unclean, and went out of 
    the ark unclean.</p>
<p align="justify">This exhorts all to become practitioners in religion. 
    There are three steps leading to heaven: knowledge, assent, and practice. It 
    is not taking the two first steps—but the third step which will make you 
    eternally happy and blessed. Obedience is the grand precept both of the law 
    and gospel. In this stands a Christian's duty, in this consists his 
    felicity. 1 Samuel 15:22, "To obey is better than sacrifice." It is <i>
    grateful </i>to God, and <i>graceful </i>to a Christian. </p>
<p align="justify">What is the excellency of a thing—but its practicalness 
    and usefulness? What are the fine feathers of a bird if it cannot sing? What 
    is a plant, though decked with leaves, if it brings forth no fruit? What is 
    it we commend in a horse, his eyes or his good spirit? Song of Solomon 5:5, 
    "My hands dropped with myrrh." Not only must a Christian's lips drop 
    knowledge—but his hands and his fingers must drop myrrh, that is, by working 
    the works of obedience.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Let me use some divine MOTIVES to entice Christians to 
    the practical part of godliness:</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Gospel-obedience is an evidence of sincerity. </p></b>
</font>As our Savior Christ said in another sense, John 10:25, "The works 
    which I do, bear witness of Me." Though no man ever spoke like Christ—yet 
    when he comes to put himself upon a trial, he will not be judged by his 
    words— but by his works. "They bear witness of Me." Just so, it is not a 
    Christian's golden <i>words</i>—but his <i>works </i>which testify of him. 
    Psalm 119:59, "I have turned my feet unto Your statutes." David not only 
    turned his <i>ears </i>to God's testimonies, but he turned his <i>feet </i>
    to them—he <i>walked </i>in them. We do not judge the health of a man, by 
    his high color—but by the pulse of the arm where the blood chiefly operates. 
    Just so, we do not judge a Christian's soundness by his knowledge or high 
    expressions. What is this but high color? Saul may be among the prophets—but 
    the estimate of a Christian is to be taken by his obediential actings 
    towards God.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. To be practitioners in religion will not only do 
    yourselves good, but others as well.</p></b></font> This will both honor 
    religion and propagate it.
<p align="justify">It will <b>honor </b>religion. The gospel may be compared 
    to a beautiful queen. The fruitful lives of professors are so many jewels, 
    which adorn this queen and make her shine forth in greater glory and 
    magnificence. What a honor it was to godliness, when the Apostle could say 
    that the faith of the Romans was trumpeted abroad in every place! Romans 
    1:8, "I thank my God that your faith is spoken of through the whole world." 
    That is, faith flourishing into obedience. 1 Thessalonians 1:2-3, "We give 
    thanks to God for you, remembering your <i>work </i>of faith, and <i>labor
    </i>of love." Christians should be ambitious to keep up the credit of 
    religion.</p>
<p align="justify">The practice of those truths we know, will greatly <b>
    propagate </b>religion. Practice is the best argument we can use, to prevail 
    with others. This will confirm them in the truth of religion. The emperor 
    Jovinian said to the Christians, "I cannot judge your <i>doctrine</i>—but I 
    can judge your <i>lives</i>." Their practice would preach loudest. If others 
    see us make a profession, and yet live in a contradiction to what we 
    profess; if they hear Jacob's voice but see Esau's hands—they will think 
    religion is but a devout sham. Why does the father forbid his children to 
    swear—when he himself swears? Would you gain many proselytes to religion? Be
    <i>doers </i>of the Word. Say as Abimilech said to his fellows, "What you 
    have seen me do, make haste and do as I have done." Judges 9:48. Would you 
    be as <i>magnets</i> to draw your children and servants to heaven? Set upon the 
    practice of holiness. Basil observes that the Christian religion greatly 
    flourished by the sanctity and liberality of those who professed it.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Thus we show our love to Christ. </p></b></font>John 
    14:21, "He who has My commandments and keeps them—he it is that loves Me." 
    We used to say, "If you love me, do such a thing." This should be a great 
    argument to obedience. By the love you bear to Jesus Christ—obey His Word. 
    Every man would be thought to love Christ, yes, but try your love by this 
    test—are you cast into a Gospel mold? Do you obey? It is a vain thing for a 
    man to say he loves Christ's <i>person</i>—when he slights His <i>commands</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Without practice you will come short of those who have 
    come short of heaven. </p></b></font>"Herod did many things," Mark 6:20. He was, 
    in many things, a practicer of John's ministry. Those who rest in the 
    speculative part of religion, are not as good as Herod.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. What unspeakable comfort will obedience yield both in 
    life, and death!</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">In life.</p></b></font> Is it not a comfort to a man when he 
    has been casting up his accounts—to find that he has gained in his trade? 
    You come here in the use of ordinances, the Word and prayer, to trade for 
    heaven. Now, if you find upon a true account that you have gained in the 
    trade of godliness and are filled with the fruits of the Spirit—will not 
    this be a great comfort to you? He who is full of good works, God will 
    gather the fruit and bless the tree!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">In death. </p></b></font>Obedience gives comfort at death. 
    What a joy was it to Paul, when he came to die, that he could make that 
    sweet appeal, 2 Timothy 4:7, "I have <i>kept </i>the faith!" That is, Paul 
    had kept the <i>doctrine </i>of faith—and had lived the <i>life </i>of 
    faith. Oh, what a comfort for a Christian to lay his life <i>down—</i>when 
    he has laid his <i>life </i>out in the service of God! This was a deathbed 
    cordial to king Hezekiah. Isaiah 38:3, "Remember, O Lord, I beseech You how 
    I have walked before You in truth." A man may repent of his fruitless <i>
    knowledge</i>—but never did any man repent of his <i>obedience </i>when he 
    came to die! Never did any Christian who is going to rest with God, repent 
    that he had walked with God.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. What is the end of all God's administrations, but 
    obedience? </p></b></font>What are all God's promises, but persuasions to 
    obedience? What is the end of all God's threatenings, which stand as the 
    angel with a flaming sword in his hand—but to drive us to obedience! 
    Deuteronomy 11:28, "A curse if you will not obey." What is the voice of 
    mercy, but to call us to duty? The father gives his child money to entice 
    him to obedience. The fire of God's mercies, is to make the sweet water of 
    obedience distill from us. "Mercy," as Ambrose said, "is a medicine which 
    God applies to us to cure our barrenness." What are all the examples of 
    God's justice upon others—but alarms to awaken us out of the bed of sloth 
    and put us into a posture of service? God's rod upon others, is a stick to 
    point us to obedience. If God does not have His end in respect of duty—we 
    cannot have our end in respect of glory.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Consider what a sin disobedience is! </p></b></font>
    Jeremiah 44:16 is a sad Scripture, "As for the word you have spoken to us in 
    the name of the Lord—we will not do."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Disobedience is a sin against reason.</p></b></font> Are 
    we able to stand it out, in defiance against God? 1 Corinthians 10:22, "Do 
    we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than He?" It is as if the 
    thorns should set themselves in battle array against the fire! Will the 
    sinner go to measure arms with the great God! What Solomon said of laughter, 
    Ecclesiastes 2:2, the same may he said of rebellion, "it is mad."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Disobedience is a sin against equity.</p></b></font> We 
    have our subsistence from God, "in Him we live and move, and have our 
    being." Is it not just and fitting that, as we live <i>upon </i>Him, we 
    should live <i>to </i>Him? Is it not just and fitting that, as God gives us 
    our <i>allowance</i>, we should give Him our <i>allegiance</i>? If the 
    general gives his soldier pay, the soldier is to march at his command, by 
    the law of <i>equity</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Disobedience is a sin against conscience.</p></b></font> 
    God, by creation, is our Father, so that conscience binds to duty. Malachi 
    1:6, "If then I am a Father—where is My honor?"
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Disobedience is a sin against our vows. </p></b></font>We 
    have taken the oath of allegiance, "Your vows are upon me O God," Psalm 
    65:12. We have many vows upon us—our baptismal vow, our sacramental, our 
    national, and our sickbed vows. Here are four cords to draw us to obedience, 
    and if we slip these sacred knots and cast these cords from us, will not God 
    come upon us for perjury! If our <i>oaths </i>will not bind us—God has <i>
    chains </i>that will!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Disobedience is a sin against our prayers. </p></b></font>
    We pray, "May Your will be done." So that, by non-obedience, we confute 
    ourselves and live in a contradiction to our own prayers. That man who is 
    self-confuted, is self-condemned.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Disobedience is a sin against God's kindness. </p></b>
</font>It is a great sin; it is a kicking against God's love, a 
    despising the riches of His goodness, Romans 2:4. Therefore, the Apostle 
    links these two sins together, 2 Timothy 3:2, disobedience and unthankfulness; and this dyes a sin a crimson color. One calls ingratitude,
    <i>the seminary of all sin</i>. It is an epitomizing sin. Brutus' unkindness 
    went deeper to Caesar's heart, than the stab.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Disobedience is a sin against nature. </p></b></font>Every 
    creature in its kind obeys God. <b>Animate </b>creatures obey Him. God spoke 
    to the fish to set Jonah ashore, and it did it immediately, Jonah 2:10. What 
    are the <i>birds' thankful hymns</i>, as Ambrose calls them—but tributes of 
    obedience?
<b>
<p align="justify">Inanimate </p></b>creatures obey God. "The <i>stars </i>in 
    their course fought against Sisera," Judges 5. "The <i>wind </i>and the <i>
    sea </i>obey Him," Mark 4:41. The very <i>stones</i>, if God gives them a 
    commission, will cry out against the sins of men. Habakkuk 2:11, "The stone 
    shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it." 
    If men would be silent—the stones would, in some manner, have testified of 
    Christ, Luke 19:40. At Christ's passion the rocks rent, Matthew 27:51; which 
    tearing rhetoric was a voice to tell the world that the Messiah was now 
    crucified. Shall every creature obey God—but man? Oh, man, think thus with 
    yourself: "If God had made me a stone, I would have obeyed Him; and now that 
    He has made me rational being, shall I refuse to obey?" This is against 
    nature. There are none who disobey God—but man and the devil. Can we find 
    none to join with, but the devil?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Disobedience is a sin against self-preservation.</p></b></font> 
    Disloyalty is treason, and by treason the sinner is bound over to the wrath 
    of God. 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, "The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven 
    with His mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who do not 
    obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting 
    destruction." He who refuses to obey God's will in commanding, shall be sure 
    to obey His will in punishing. The sinner, while he thinks to <i>slip the 
    knot of obedience</i>, twists the cord of his own damnation! 
<p align="justify">Thus you have seen the sin of disobedience set out in its 
    bloody colors. "Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the 
    earth. Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son," 
    Kiss Christ with a kiss of love; Kiss Him with a kiss of loyalty. "lest he 
    be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a 
    moment!" Psalm 2:10-12.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Another motive, is the benefit of obedience.</p></b></font> 
    Psalm 19:11, "In keeping His precepts there is great reward." <i>Obedience
    </i>is crowned with <i>happiness! </i>So the text says, "happy are you." If 
    this argument will not prevail, what will?
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But what happiness are you speaking of?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. All kinds of blessings are poured upon the head 
    of obedience, as the precious oil was poured on Aaron's head.</p>
<p align="justify">1. <b>Temporal </b>blessings. "You will experience all 
    these blessings if you obey the Lord your God: You will be blessed in your 
    towns and in the country. You will be blessed with many children and 
    productive fields. You will be blessed with fertile herds and flocks. You 
    will be blessed with baskets overflowing with fruit, and with kneading bowls 
    filled with bread. You will be blessed wherever you go, both in coming and 
    in going. If you obey the commands of the Lord your God and walk in his 
    ways, the Lord will establish you as his holy people as he solemnly promised 
    to do." Deuteronomy 28:2-6, 9. He who has a fruitful heart—shall have a 
    fruitful crop. God will make him to thrive in his estate; and his basket 
    shall not only be full, but blessed. God will bless what he has. Here is not 
    only the sack full of corn—but money in the mouth of the sack.</p>
<p align="justify">2. <b>Spiritual </b>blessings. Exodus 19:5, "If you will 
    obey me and keep my covenant, you will be <i>my own special treasure </i>
    from among all the nations of the earth." You shall be My portion, My 
    jewels, the apple of My eye. I will give kingdoms for your ransom. Jeremiah 
    7:23, "Obey, and I will be your God." I will make over Myself to you by a 
    deed of gift. What a superlative sovereign mercy is this! Psalm 14:4, "Happy 
    is that people, whose God is the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">3. <b>Eternal </b>blessings. Hebrews 5:9, "Christ became 
    the author of <i>eternal salvation</i>, to all who obey Him. Oh, then, who 
    would not be in love with obedience!" While we please God—we pleasure 
    ourselves. You see, brethren, you are no losers by obedience.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall lay down some <b>rules</b> to help Christians in their 
    obedience, that it may be the sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor to God.
    <font color="#0000ff"><b>Obedience must have these four ingredients in it:</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Obedience must be CORDIAL. </p></b></font>Deuteronomy 
    26:16, "The Lord your God is commanding you this day to follow these 
    statutes and ordinances. You must be careful to follow them with all your <i>
    heart </i>and all your <i>soul</i>." Romans 6:17, "You have obeyed from the
    <i>heart</i>." Obedience without the heart, is like fire on the altar 
    without incense. The heart is the mainspring of love, and it is love which 
    perfumes every duty. The heart makes service a freewill offering—or else it 
    is but a dead duty. Cain brought his sacrifice, not his heart. <i>Obedience 
    without the heart is hypocrisy! </i>"How can you say 'I love You', when your 
    heart is not with Me?" Judges 16:15.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Obedience must be EXTENSIVE. </p></b></font>It must reach 
    to all God's commandments, 1 Kings 9:4, Luke 1:6.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But who can arrive at this?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Though we cannot keep all God's commandments <i>
    legally</i>—yet we may <i>evangelically</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">A true Christian <b>consents</b> to the equity of the whole law. 
    Romans 7:12, "The law is holy, and just, and good." He sets his seal to 
    every law.</p>
<p align="justify">A true Christian makes <b>conscience</b> of every law. David had 
    respect to all God's commandments, Psalm 119:6; his eye was upon all. Every 
    command has such authority upon a Christian, that he does not know how to 
    dispense with it. Though he <i>fails </i>in every duty—yet he dares not <i>
    neglect </i>any duty.</p>
<p align="justify">The child of God <b>desires</b> to keep every command. Psalm 
    119:5, "Oh, that my ways were steadfast in obeying your decrees!" What a 
    child of God lacks in <i>strength</i>—he makes up in <i>will</i>. Romans 
    7:18, "To will is present." The regenerate will remains bent to all God's 
    precepts.</p>
<p align="justify">The gracious soul <b>mourns</b> that he can do no better. When 
    he fails—he weeps. "O wretched man that I am!" Romans 7:24. "Oh, this 
    unbelieving heart! How am I clogged with corruption!" Thus, a child of God 
    laments his failings, and judges himself for them, and this is, in a Gospel 
    sense, to keep every law.</p>
<p align="justify">Unsound hearts, as they are <i>slight </i>in their 
    obedience—so they are <i>partial </i>in their obedience. Some duties they 
    will dispense with; some sins they will indulge. "May the Lord pardon me in 
    this one thing," 2 Kings 5:18. The hypocrite will walk in <i>some </i>of 
    God's statutes, not in <i>all</i>. He is like a lame horse, which will not 
    set all his feet upon the ground—but favors one leg. There are lame 
    Christians who halt and limp and favor themselves in some things, though it 
    is to the hazard of their souls. Herod would just as soon die--as leave his 
    incest. But true obedience is universal. We owe to our God unlimited 
    obedience.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The third ingredient into obedience is FAITH. </p></b>
</font>Hebrews 11:6, "Without faith it is impossible to please God;" 
    therefore, it is called the <i>obedience of faith</i>, Romans 16:26. Abel, 
    by faith, is said to offer up a better sacrifice than Cain. Faith is a vital 
    principle; without faith all our services are dead. Therefore, the Scripture 
    speaks of dead works, Hebrews 6:1.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But why must this <i>silver thread of faith </i>
    run through the whole work of obedience?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Because faith looks at Christ in every duty, and 
    so both the <i>person </i>and <i>offering </i>are accepted. Ephesians 1:6, 
    "He has accepted us in the beloved." We are not accepted through our 
    duties—but through the Beloved. Faith looks at the merit of Christ to take 
    away the <i>guilt</i>, and the Spirit of Christ to take away the <i>filth
    </i>which cleaves to the most angelic services. Thus it procures acceptance.</p>
<p align="justify">Nay, faith not only <i>looks </i>at Christ—but it <i>
    unites </i>to Christ. Believers are part of Christ. Christ and the saints 
    make one body. No wonder—then if God casts a favorable aspect upon those 
    services which believers present to Him.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Obedience must he CONSTANT. </p></b></font>Revelation 
    2:26, "He who keeps My works <i>unto the end</i>—to Him will I give the 
    morning star." Faith must lead the caravan and perseverance must bring up 
    the rear.
<p align="justify">There is something still remaining for a Christian to 
    do—and he must not leave work until the night of death comes on. "An <i>old
    </i>disciple," Acts 21:16. What an honor is it for one to be gray-headed in 
    piety. What a credit when it shall be said of him, "His <i>last </i>works 
    are better than his first!" Revelation 2:19. A good Christian is like wine 
    full of spirits which is good to the last drop. An artist makes his last 
    work more complete and skillful. Blessed is that man who, the nearer he is 
    to death—moves swifter towards heaven!</p>
