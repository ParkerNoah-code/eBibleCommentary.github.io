        <p>
          Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people
          of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord
          thy God, and do his commandments.' Deut 27: 9, 10.
        </p>
        <p>What is the duty which God requireth of man?</p>
        <p>Obedience to his revealed will.</p>
        <p>
          It is not enough to hear God's voice, but we must obey. Obedience is a
          part of the honour we owe to God. If then I be a Father, where is my
          honour?' Mal 1: 6. Obedience carries in it the life-blood of religion.
          Obey the voice of the Lord God,' and do his commandments. Obedience
          without knowledge is blind, and knowledge without obedience is lame.
          Rachel was fair to look upon, but, being barren, said, Give me
          children, or I die;' so, if knowledge does not bring forth the child
          of obedience, it will die. To obey is better than sacrifice.' 1 Sam
          15: 22. Saul thought it was enough for him to offer sacrifices, though
          he disobeyed God's command; but to obey is better than sacrifice.' God
          disclaims sacrifice, if obedience be wanting. I spake not unto your
          fathers concerning burnt offerings, but this thing commanded I them,
          saying, Obey my voice.' Jer 7: 22. Not but that God did enjoin those
          religious rites of worship; but the meaning is that he looked chiefly
          for obedience -- without which, sacrifice was but devout folly. The
          end why God has given us his laws, is obedience. Ye shall do my
          judgements, and keep mine ordinances.' Lev 18: 4. Why does a king
          publish an edict, but that it may be observed?
        </p>
        <p>What is the rule of obedience?</p>
        <p>
          The written word. That is proper obedience which the word requires;
          our obedience must correspond with the word, as the copy with the
          original. To seem to be zealous, if it be not according to the word,
          is not obedience, but will-worship. Popish traditions which have no
          footing in the word, are abominable; and God will say, Quis quaesivit
          haec? Who has required this at your hand?' Isa 1: 12. The apostle
          condemns the worshipping of angels, which had a show of humility. Col
          2: 18. The Jews might say they were loath to be so bold as to go to
          God in their own persons; they would be more humble, and prostrate
          themselves before the angels, and desire them to present their
          petitions to God; but this show of humility was hateful to God,
          because there was no word to warrant it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What are the ingredients in our obedience that make it acceptable?
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) It must be cum animi prolubio, free and cheerful, or it is
          penance, not sacrifice. If ye be willing and obedient.' Isa 1: 19.
          Though we serve God with weakness, it may be with willingness. You
          love to see your servants go cheerfully about their work. Under the
          law, God will have a free-will offering. Deut 16: 10. Hypocrites obey
          God grudgingly, and against their will; facere bonum, but not velle
          [they do good but not willingly]. Cain brought his sacrifice, but not
          his heart. It is a true rule, Quicquid cor non facit, non fit; what
          the heart does not do, is not done. Willingness is the soul of
          obedience. God sometimes accepts of willingness without the work, but
          never of the work without willingness. Cheerfulness shows that there
          is love in the duty; and love is to our services what the sun is to
          fruit; it mellows and ripens them, and makes them come off with a
          better relish.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Obedience must be devout and fervent. Fervent in spirit,' &amp;c.
          Rom 12: 11. Quae ebullit prae ardore. As water that boils over; so the
          heart must boil over with hot affections in the service of God. The
          glorious angels, who, for burning in fervour and devotion, are called
          seraphims, are chosen by God to serve him in heaven. The snail under
          the law was unclean, because a dull, slothful creature. Obedience
          without fervency, is like a sacrifice without fire. Why should not our
          obedience be lively and fervent? God deserves the flower and strength
          of our affections. Domitian would not have his statue carved in wood
          or iron, but made of gold. Lively affections make golden services. It
          is fervency that makes obedience acceptable. Elijah was fervent in
          spirit, and his prayer opened and shut heaven; and again he prayed,
          and fire fell on his enemies.2 Kings 1: 10. Elijah's prayer fetched
          fire from heaven, because, being fervent, it carried fire up to
          heaven; quicquid decorum ex fide proficiscitur. Augustine.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Obedience must be extensive, it must reach to all God's commands.
          Then shall I not be ashamed (or, as it is in the Hebrew, lo Ehosh,
          blush), when I have respect unto all thy commandments.' Psa 119: 6.
          Quicquid propter Deum fit aequaliter fit [All God's requirements
          demand equal effort]. There is a stamp of divine authority upon all
          God's commands, and if I obey one precept because God commands, I must
          obey all. True obedience runs through all duties of religion, as the
          blood through all the veins, or the sun through all the signs of the
          zodiac. A good Christian makes gospel piety and moral equity kiss each
          other. Herein some discover their hypocrisy: they will obey God in
          some things which are more facile, and may raise their repute; but
          other things they leave undone. One thing thou lackest,' unum deest.
          Mark 10: 21. Herod would hear John Baptist, but not leave his incest.
          Some will pray, but not give alms, others will give alms, but not
          pray. Ye pay tithe of mint and anise, and have omitted the weightier
          matters of the law, judgement, mercy and faith.' Matt 23: 23. The
          badger has one foot shorter than the other; so these are shorter in
          some duties than in others. God likes not such partial servants, who
          will do some part of the work he sets them about, and leave the other
          undone.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Obedience must be sincere. We must aim at the glory of God in it.
          Finis specificat actionem; in religion the end is all. The end of our
          obedience must not be to stop the mouth of conscience, or to gain
          applause or preferment; but that we may grow more like God, and bring
          more glory to him. Do all to the glory of God.' 1 Cor 10: 31. That
          which has spoiled many glorious actions, and made them lose their
          reward, is, that men's aims have been wrong. The Pharisees gave alms,
          but blew a trumpet that they might have the glory of men. Matt 6: 2.
          Alms should shine, but not blaze. Jehu did well in destroying the
          Baal-worshippers, and God commended him for it; but, because his aims
          were not good (for he aimed at settling himself in the kingdom), God
          looked upon it as no better than murder. I will avenge the blood of
          Jezreel upon the house of Jehu.' Hos 1: 4. O let us look to our ends
          in obedience; it is possible the action may be right, and not the
          heart.2 Chron 25: 2. Amaziah did that which was right in the sight of
          the Lord, but not with a perfect heart. Two things are chiefly to be
          eyed in obedience, the principle and the end. Though a child of God
          shoots short in his obedience, he takes a right aim.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) Obedience must be in and through Christ. He has made us accepted
          in the beloved.' Eph 1: 6. Not our obedience, but Christ's merits
          procure acceptance. In every part of worship we must present Christ to
          God in the arms of our faith. Unless we serve God thus, in hope and
          confidence of Christ's merits, we rather provoke him than please him.
          As, when king Uzziah would offer incense without a priest, God was
          angry with him, and struck him with leprosy (2 Chron 26: 20); So, when
          we do not come to God in and through Christ, we offer up incense to
          him without a priest, and what can we expect but severe rebukes?
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) Obedience must be constant. Blessed [is] he that does
          righteousness at all times.' Psa 106: 3. True obedience is not like a
          high colour in a fit, but it is a right complexion. It is like the
          fire on the altar, which was always kept burning. Lev 6: 13.
          Hypocrites' obedience is but for a season; it is like plastering work,
          which is soon washed off; but true obedience is constant. Though we
          meet with affliction, we must go on in our obedience. The righteous
          shall hold on his way.' Job 17: 9. We have vowed constancy; we have
          vowed to renounce the pomps and vanities of the world, and to fight
          under Christ's banner to death. When a servant has entered into
          covenant with his master, and the indentures are sealed, he cannot go
          back, he must serve out his time; so there are indentures drawn in
          baptism, and in the Lord's Supper the indentures are renewed and
          scaled on our part, that we will be faithful and constant in our
          obedience; therefore we must imitate Christ, who became obedient unto
          death. Phil 2: 8. The crown is set upon the head of perseverance. He
          that keepeth my works unto the end, I will give him the morning star.'
          Rev 2: 26, 28.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. This condemns those who live in contradiction to the text,
          and have cast off the yoke of obedience. As for the word that thou
          hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto
          thee.' Jer 44: 16. God bids men pray in their family, but they live in
          the total neglect of it; he bids them sanctify the Sabbath, but they
          follow their pleasures on that day; he bids them abstain from the
          appearance of sin, but they do not abstain from the act; they live in
          the act of revenge, and in the act of uncleanness. This is a high
          contempt of God; it is rebellion, and rebellion is as the sin of
          witchcraft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence is it that men do not obey God? They know their duty, but do it
          not.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The not obeying God is for want of faith. Quis credidit? Who has
          believed our report?' Isa 53: 1: Did men believe sin were so bitter,
          that hell followed at the heels of it, would they go on in sin? Did
          they believe there was such a reward for the righteous, that godliness
          was gain, would they not pursue it; but they are atheists, not fully
          brought into the belief of these things; hence it is that they obey
          not. Satan's master-piece, his draw-net by which he drags millions to
          hell, is to keep them in infidelity; he knows, if he can but keep them
          from believing the truth, he is sure to keep them from obeying it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The not obeying God is for want of self-denial. God commands one
          thing, and men's lusts command another; and they will rather die than
          deny their lusts. If lust cannot be denied, God cannot be obeyed.
        </p>
        <p>Use two. Obey God's voice. This is the beauty of a Christian.</p>
        <p>What are the great arguments or incentives to obedience?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Obedience makes us precious to God, his favourites. If ye will
          obey my voice, ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all
          people;' you shall be my portion, my jewels, the apple of mine eye.
          Exod 19: 5. I will give kingdoms for your ransom.' Isa 43: 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) There is nothing lost by obedience. To obey God's will is the wav
          to have our will. Would we have a blessing in our estates? Let us
          obey. God. If thou shalt hearken to the voice of the Lord, to do all
          his commandments, blessed shalt thou be in the field: blessed shall be
          thy basket and thy store.' Deut 28: 1, 3, 5. To obey is the best way
          to thrive in your estates. [21 Would we have a blessing in our souls?
          Let us obey God. Obey, and I will be your God.' Jer 7: 23. My Spirit
          shall be your guide, sanctifier, and comforter. Christ became the
          author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.' Heb 5: 9.
          While we please God, we please ourselves; while we give him the duty,
          he gives us the dowry. We are apt to say, as Amaziah, What shall we do
          for the hundred talents?' 2 Chron 25: 9. You lose nothing by obeying.
          The obedient son has the inheritance settled on him. Obey, and you
          shall have a kingdom. It is your Father's good pleasure to give you
          the kingdom.' Luke 12: 32.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) What a sin is disobedience! It is an irrational sin. We are not
          able to stand it out in defiance against God. Are we stronger than
          he?' Will the sinner go to measure arms with God? 1 Cor 10: 22. He is
          the Father Almighty, who can command legions. If we have no strength
          to resist him, it is irrational to disobey him. It is irrational, as
          it is against all law and equity. We have our daily subsistence from
          him; in him we live and move. Is it not just that as we live by him,
          we should live to him? that as he gives us our allowance, so we should
          give him our allegiance?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a destructive sin. The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven
          with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that
          obey not the gospel.' 2 Thess 1: 7, 8. He who refuses to obey God's
          will in commanding, shall be sure to obey his will in punishing. While
          the sinner thinks to slip the knot of obedience, he twists the cord of
          his own damnation, and he perishes without excuse. The servant which
          knew his lord's will, neither did according to his will, shall be
          beaten with many stripes.' Luke 12: 47. God will say, Why did you not
          obey? you knew how to do good, but did not; therefore your blood is
          upon your own head.'
        </p>
        <p>What means shall we use that we may obey?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Serious consideration. Consider, God's commands are not grievous:
          he commands nothing unreasonable.1 John 5: 3. It is easier to obey the
          commands of God than sin. The commands of sin are burdensome -- let a
          man be under the power of any lust, how he tires himself! what hazards
          he runs, even to endangering his health and soul, that he may satisfy
          his lusts! What tedious journeys did Antiochus Epiphanies take in
          persecuting the Jews! They weary themselves to commit iniquity;' and
          are not God's commands more easy to obey? Chrysostom says, virtue is
          easier than vice; temperance is less burdensome than drunkenness. Some
          have gone with less pains to heaven, than others to hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          God commands nothing but what is beneficial. And now, Israel, what
          does the Lord require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to
          keep his statutes, which I command thee this day, for thy good?' Deut
          10: 12, 13. To obey God, is not so much our duty as our privilege; his
          commands carry meat in the mouth of them. He bids us repent; and why?
          That our sins may be blotted out. Acts 3: 19. He commands us to
          believe: and why? That we may be saved. Acts 16: 31. There is love in
          every command: as if a king should bid one of his subjects dig in a
          gold mine, and then take the gold to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Earnest supplication. Implore the help of the Spirit to carry you
          on in obedience. God's Spirit makes obedience easy and delightful. If
          the loadstone draw the iron, it is not hard for it to move; so if
          God's Spirit quicken and draw the heart, it is not hard to obey. When
          a gale of the Spirit blows, we go full sail in obedience. Turn his
          promise into a prayer. I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you
          to walk in my statutes.' Ezek 36: 27. The promise encourages us, the
          Spirit enables us to obey.
