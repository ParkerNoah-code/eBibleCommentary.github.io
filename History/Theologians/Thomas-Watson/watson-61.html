<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>Knowing and Doing Good</b></font></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"><i>"To him who knows to do good, and does it not—to him 
    it is sin."</i> James 4:17</p>
<p align="justify">The Apostle James, in former verses, had met with a sin 
    common in those days, a sinful boasting among men, verse 13-14, "Now listen, 
    you who say, <i>'Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a 
    year there, carry on business and make money.' </i>Why, you do not even know 
    what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears 
    for a little while and then vanishes." You may be in your graves before 
    tomorrow! A mist cannot continue long—it is raised by the sun—and dispersed 
    by the wind. Such is your life—a mist, a vapor, a short breath, a flying 
    shadow—which "appears for a little while and then vanishes!" Well might they 
    say, "What need do <i>we </i>have to be taught such a plain lesson? Who 
    doesn't know all of this—that life is a vapor, and that we ought not to 
    boast what we will do tomorrow?"</p>
<p align="justify">The Apostle seems in the text to meet with them by way of 
    answer, "Do you know all this? Then the greater is your sin—that you don't 
    do it. "To him who knows to do good, and does it not—to him it is sin." </p>
<p align="justify">I shall only explain this phrase, "to him it is sin"; 
    that is, it is a heinous sin.</p>
<p align="justify">Every infirmity, everything which falls <i>short </i>of 
    the rule, is sin—much more that which <i>contradicts </i>the rule. This 
    man's sin has an emphasis; it is a crimson sin, and it shall have a greater 
    punishment. "The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his 
    duty, he refused to do it!" Luke 12:47. If he who sins <i>ignorantly </i>is 
    damned—then he who sins <i>knowingly </i>shall be <i>doubly damned!</i></p>

<p align="justify">I. Doctrine implied—we ought to know to do good. We ought 
    to know our duty.</p>
<p align="justify">II. We ought not only to know to do good but to do it.</p>
<p align="justify">III. He who knows to do good and does it not is, of all 
    others, the most guilty.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Doctrine implied—we ought to know to do good.</p></b></font> 
    We ought to be well-informed of those things which are to be done by us in 
    order to salvation. The written Word is a rule of knowledge—and the preached 
    Word is a commentary upon the written Word. Both of them are to enrich our 
    understanding and to nurture us up in the knowledge of that which is good. 
    The reasons why we should know to do good are:
<p align="justify">1. Knowledge is our lamp and star to guide us in the 
    truth. It shows us what we are to do—and what we are to leave undone. If we 
    do not know that which is good—we can never practice it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Knowledge is the foundation of all <i>grace</i>. 
    "Those who know your name, will put their <i>trust </i>in you," Psalm 9:10. 
    "This is my prayer: that your <i>love </i>may abound more and more in 
    knowledge and depth of insight." Philippians 1:9 The Apostle joins these 
    two, knowledge and <i>perseverance</i>. Such as are unlearned will be 
    unstable.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The chief work in conversion consists in knowledge. 
    Romans 12:2, "Be transformed by the renewing of your mind." The mind being 
    renewed, the man is transformed. The first part of God's image consists in 
    knowledge, Colossians 3:10.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is nothing in religion, though ever so 
    excellent, which can do us good without knowledge.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">USE</p></b></font>. See how necessary it is to get the 
    knowledge of what is good; it ushers in salvation, 1 Timothy 2:4. <i>
    Ignorance of God is the cause of all sin!</i> "They go from one sin to 
    another; they do not acknowledge me," Jeremiah 9:3. <i>Ignorance of God 
    damns! </i>"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge." Hosea 4:6. It is 
    sad to be ignorant in gospel-times; but many, alas, do not only not know 
    God—but they are not willing to know. Jeremiah 9:6, "They <i>refuse </i>to 
    know Me, says the Lord."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. DOCTRINE. We ought not only to <i>know </i>to do 
    good—but to <i>do </i>it.</p></b></font> This the Apostle implies, "to him that
    <i>knows </i>to do good, and <i>does </i>it not...." He implies, that he who 
    knows to do good should do it. The end of knowledge, is practice. Search 
    from one end of the Bible to the other—and you will find that it is the 
    practical part of religion which is chiefly intended. The crown is not set 
    upon the head of <i>knowledge, </i>but <i>practice</i>. Revelation 22:14, 
    "Blessed are those who <i>do </i>His commandments, that they may have right 
    to the tree of life."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1.</p></b></font> It shows us wherein most professors are 
    defective in the times of gospel, namely, in the <i>doing </i>part of 
    religion. They know <i>how </i>to do good—but do it not. They know they 
    should abstain from evil
<p align="justify">and pursue holiness, but, though they know this—yet they 
    do it not.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. They know they should abstain from evil. </p></b>Thus they 
    know they should not <i>swear</i>, Matthew 5:34, "Do not swear at all"; yet 
    they swear. They are more free with their oaths than their alms. They know
    <i>immorality </i>to be a sin—that it wastes the body, wounds the 
    conscience, blots the name, and damns the soul! Galatians 5:19. Yet they 
    will go on in that sin and, for a cup of pleasure, drink a sea of wrath! 
    They know <i>drunkenness </i>to be a sin, that it makes them like beasts, 
    takes away their reason, makes them unfit for happiness, for they cannot 
    think of going reeling to heaven. They know that God is preparing a cup of 
    wrath for the drunkard, Revelation 16:19. Yet for all that, they will not 
    leave their cups. 
<p align="justify">Men know that <i>rash censuring </i>is a sin. James 4:11, 
    "Do not speak evil one of another, brethren"; yet they are guilty of this. 
    They will not swear—but they will slander and speak to the harm of others.
    <i>No physician can heal the wounds of the tongue!</i> </p>
<p align="justify">They know they should not vent their passions, James 
    1:26, "If any man among you seems to be religious, and bridles not his 
    tongue, this man's religion is vain." Origen observes that the rich man in 
    the Gospel had no water to cool his tongue. He had sinned most in his 
    tongue; therefore, he was punished most in it. How unworthy is it for men to 
    have their eyes and hands lifted up to heaven—and their tongues set on fire 
    from hell; at one time praying, and another time cursing! How can such pray 
    in a family, who are possessed with an angry devil?</p>
<p align="justify">Thus they know that <i>covetousness </i>is a sin, yes, 
    the root of all evil; yet the world engrosses all their time and thoughts. 
    They thirst after <i>gold </i>more than <i>grace</i>; and labor more to have 
    a <i>full purse </i>than a <i>good conscience</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus men know they should abstain from evil—but they 
    don't do it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. They know they should pursue holiness</p></b>—but they 
    don't do it. They know they should read the Word, use holy conference, pray 
    in their families, redeem the time, and walk circumspectly. They know to do 
    good—but don't do it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How is it that men know to do good—yet do it 
    not?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1.</p></b></font> It is for lack of sound conviction. 
    Men are not thoroughly convinced of the necessity of practical godliness. 
    They think there is a necessity of knowledge, because otherwise there is no 
    salvation. They will get some notions of Christ, that He is a Savior, and 
    has satisfied divine justice, and they hope they believe in Him. Well, then; 
    we tell them that faith and obedience go together. Then they say that God is 
    merciful and, though they are not as good as they should be, free grace will 
    save them. Thus men content themselves with general notions of religion—but 
    are not convinced of the <i>practical </i>part of godliness.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2.</p></b></font> Men know to do good yet do it 
    not—because they are not awakened out of their spiritual sloth. It is easy 
    to get the knowledge of a truth, to give assent to it, to commend it, and to 
    profess it. But to digest knowledge into practice, is the difficulty.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 3.</p></b></font> Men know to do good but do it 
    not—through unbelief; they are, in part, atheists. If they truly believed 
    that <b>sin </b>was so bitter, that <i>wrath </i>and <i>hell </i>followed 
    it—would they not leave off their sins? If they believed that to do the will 
    of God was a privilege, religion was their interest, that there is joy in 
    the way of godliness, and heaven at the end—would they not espouse holiness? 
    But people, though they have some slight transient thoughts of these 
    things—yet are not brought to the sincere belief of them. Therefore, though 
    they know to do good—yet they do it not. The reason why there are so few <i>
    doers </i>of the Word—is because there are so few true <i>believers</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 4. </p></b></font>Men know to do good but do it 
    not—because the knowledge in their head never works into their hearts. It 
    does not quicken them, nor warm their affections with love to the truth.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 5. </p></b></font>Men know to do good but do it 
    not—because of a prejudiced opinion. The things to be done in religion are 
    judged to be too strict and severe; they restrain sin too much or they press 
    too much to holiness.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 6.</p></b></font> Men know to do good yet do it 
    not—because they love their sin more than they love the Word. Hosea 4:8, 
    "They set their heart on their iniquity." Some content themselves with 
    having means of knowledge, judges 17:13, "Then said Micah, Now know I that 
    the Lord will do me good, seeing I have a Levite as my priest." But what is 
    one the better to know what medicine he should take—if he does not actually 
    take it?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2.</p></b> </font>Of exhortation. Let me beseech you all 
    who have been hearers of the Word, and have gotten a great measure of 
    knowledge, that, as you know to do good—you would do it. <i>Practice </i>is 
    the soul of religion. Luther says, "I had rather do the will of God, than be 
    able to work miracles." 
<b>
<p align="justify">First</p></b>, to do what you know—evidences your noble 
    relation to Christ. You count it an honor to be near allied to the crown—but 
    it is more honor to be akin to Christ.
<b>
<p align="justify">Second</p></b>, to know to do good and to do it—sets a crown 
    upon the gospel. Romans 16:19, "Everyone has heard about your obedience;" 
    not your knowledge—but your obedience. To know to do good and not to do 
    it—hardens others in sin, scandalizes religion, and makes people ready to 
    turn atheists.
<p align="justify">When some of the Spaniards came to Hispaniola, the 
    Spaniards' lives being loose and profane-the Indians asked them what God 
    they served? They answered, "The God of heaven." The Indians replied, 
    "Surely your God is not a good God, who has such bad servants." Thus, to 
    know to do good yet do it not—puts a scar in the face of religion, and 
    brings an evil report upon it. But to do what we know—trumpets forth the 
    fame of the gospel, and makes those who oppose it to admire it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Third</p></b>, to know to do good and to do it—entitles you 
    to blessedness. James 1:25, "He shall be blessed <i>in </i>his deed"; not <i>
    for </i>the deed—but <i>in </i>the deed.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. DOCTRINE. That he who knows to do good and does it 
    not—is, of all others, the most guilty. </p></b></font>To him it is sin—crimson 
    sin. That is, it is heinous sin, capital sin, sin emphatically, sin with a 
    witness, and punished with a vengeance!
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What is it to sin presumptuously?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. To sin presumptuously is to sin against the light 
    which shines in a man's conscience, when a man is convinced that those 
    things he does are sin. Conscience says, "Oh, do not this great evil!" 
    Conscience, like the cherubim, has a flaming sword in its hand to frighten 
    and deter the sinner—yet he will pluck the forbidden fruit! This is to sin 
    presumptuously. This sin is highly aggravating for two reasons:</p>
<p align="justify">First, because sinning presumptuously against 
    conscience—is after counsels, admonitions, and warnings. Such a person 
    cannot say he was never told of his sin; he has had ministers rising up 
    early who have told him what a damnable thing sin was—yet he ventured on. So 
    now he has no excuse. John 15:22, "Now you have no cloak for your sin."</p>
<p align="justify">Second, it is an aggravation to sin presumptuously 
    against conscience, when it is after afflictions. After God has made him 
    hear the <i>voice of the rod</i>, He has made him to feel sin bitter, to 
    read his sin in his punishment—yet he sins! His sin was following evil 
    company, and God has punished him for it. He has almost wasted his estate 
    with riotous living, or he has almost drunk himself blind—yet he will not 
    leave his sin! His sin was immorality, and his body is diseased and full of 
    noxious humors; yet, though he feels the smart of sin, he retains the love 
    of sin. Here is an aggravation of sin, 2 Chronicles 28:22, "In his time of 
    trouble, King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the Lord."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 3.</p></b></font> To know what is good, yet not to do 
    it—is to sin presumptuously. This sin is full of obstinacy and stubbornness. 
    It is so because men can say nothing in excuse for their sin—they can make 
    no defense for themselves—yet they are resolved to hold fast their iniquity 
    like those in Jeremiah 18:12, "We will continue to live as we want to, 
    following our own evil desires."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 4. </p></b></font>Take heed of presumptuous sin! If God 
    has been so terrible against sins of infirmity and anger, as we see in Moses 
    and Uzziah—Oh, how fierce will His anger be, against the presumptuous 
    sinner! Better never to have known the ways of God than to know and not to 
    do them! Oh! as you love your souls, take heed of this.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Presumptuous sins are desperate sins—because they are 
    committed with much <i>premeditation </i>and <i>forethought</i>.</p></b></font> 
    The
<p align="justify">presumptuous sinner does not sin unaware—but he projects 
    and casts in his mind how to bring his sin about, as Joseph's brethren did, 
    in betraying him; or as Judas did, in betraying Christ; or as those Jews 
    did, who laid wait for Paul.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Presumptuous sins are desperate—because they are 
    accompanied with <i>pride</i>.</p></b></font> The sinner who knows the mind of 
    God—yet will act contrary to it, says, like Pharaoh, "Who is the Lord that I 
    should obey Him!"
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Presumptuous sins are desperate—because they are 
    accompanied with <i>impudency</i></p></b></font>. Such sinners are hardened, 
    fearless, and without shame. Like Judas, they are hardened; though woes are 
    pronounced against them—they <i>will </i>sin! They are without fear, like 
    the leviathan, job 41:33, and they have sinned away shame. Zephaniah 3:5, 
    "The wicked know no shame." He has a forehead of brass. Nay, some are so far 
    from blushing—that they glory in their shame! Philippians 3:19.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. To sin presumptuously, to know what is good yet not to 
    do it, is heinous—because it is <i>ingratitude</i>.</p></b></font> It is a high 
    abuse of God's kindness—and God cannot endure, of all things, to have His 
    kindness abused. God's kindness is seen in this: that He has acquainted the 
    sinner with his mind and will, that He has not only instructed him—but 
    persuaded him. He has made mercy stoop and kneel to the sinner. He has wooed 
    him with His Spirit—that he would flee from sin and pursue holiness. 
    Kindness is seen in that God has spared the sinner so long and not struck 
    him dead in the act of sin! Kindness is seen in that, though the sinner has 
    sinned against his conscience—yet now, if he will repent of sin, God will 
    repent of His judgments and mercy shall be held forth. Jeremiah 3:1, "You 
    have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to Me, says the 
    Lord." But the sinner is not melted with all this love. His heart, like 
    clay, <i>hardens </i>under the sun. Here is a great abuse of God's kindness, 
    and God cannot endure to have His kindness abused. As the vulture draws 
    sickness from <i>perfumes</i>—so the sinner contracts wickedness from the 
    mercy of God. Here is high ingratitude!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. To sin presumptuously, to know what is good yet not to 
    do it—is a <i>contempt </i>done to God.</p></b></font> He cares not whether God 
    is pleased or not—he <i>will </i>have his sin! Therefore, the presumptuous 
    sinner is said to blaspheme God, Numbers 15:30, "Anyone who sins defiantly, 
    blasphemes the Lord". By his presumptuous sin, he acts as if God was either
    <i>ignorant </i>and did not know his wickedness; or <i>impotent </i>and was 
    not able to punish him. How horrid is this! There is a kind of blasphemy 
    against God—in every presumptuous sin.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. To sin presumptuously, to know what is good yet not to 
    do it—is a bold contest with God—a daring of God to punish!</p></b></font> The 
    man who sins against conscience presumptuously and will not be reclaimed, in 
    effect says, "What do I care for God's commands? They shall be no check upon 
    me—but I will go on in sin and let God do His worst."
<p align="justify">A godly man is said to fear the commandment, Proverbs 
    13:13. He dares not sin because the law of God stands in his way: but the 
    presumptuous sinner does not value the commandment. He will sin in spite of 
    God's law. <i>Oh, desperate madness—to dare God to His face! </i>1 
    Corinthians 10:22, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than 
    He?" Good reason, then, that we should take heed of presumptuous sin, since 
    it is so heinous and desperate! "To him that knows to do good—yet does it 
    not, to him it is sin"; it is heinous and presumptuous sin!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 5.</p></b></font> Trial. Let us examine if we are not 
    guilty of sinning thus presumptuously, knowing to do good—yet not to do it.
<p align="justify">Is it not to sin presumptuously—when we live in the total 
    neglect of duty? We know we ought to pray in our families—yet we do it not. 
    To live in the neglect of family duties—is not this to sin presumptuously?</p>
<p align="justify">Is it not to sin presumptuously, when we will venture 
    upon the same sins which we condemn in others? Romans 2. You condemn another 
    for pride—and yet you live in that sin yourself. A father condemns his son 
    for swearing—yet he himself swears. The master reproves his servant for 
    being drunk—yet he himself will he drunk. Is not this to sin presumptuously, 
    to live in those sins which we condemn in others!</p>
<p align="justify">Do not they sin presumptuously against conscience—who 
    will sin in spite of heaven? Though they see the judgments of God executed 
    on others—yet will adventure on the same sins. Daniel 5:22, "And you his 
    son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this"; 
    that is, you saw the judgments I inflicted on your father.</p>
<p align="justify">Do not they sin presumptuously, they who know to do good 
    yet do it not—who labor to stifle the convictions of their conscience and 
    will not let conscience speak freely to them? This the Scripture calls 
    "holding the truth in unrighteousness," Romans 1:18.</p>
<p align="justify">Do not they sin presumptuously who, after they have felt 
    the smart of sin—it has bred a worm in their conscience, and a moth in their 
    estate—yet, after all this, they again embrace their sins.</p>
<p align="justify">That I may show you what you have to fear, and that I may 
    beat you off from presumptuous sins—let these things be seriously laid to 
    heart:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. These presumptuous sins greatly harden the heart.</p></b></font> 
    These are two of the greatest blessings—a sound judgment and a soft heart. 
    But sinning presumptuously and knowingly, congeals and hardens the heart. It 
    both wastes the conscience and sears it, 1 Timothy 4:2. By sinning 
    knowingly, a person gets a <i>habit </i>of sin; and the habit of sinning 
    takes away the sense of sinning. Ephesians 4:19, "Being past feeling." Tell 
    the presumptuous sinner that there are treasures of wrath laid up for him, 
    he fears not; his heart is like a piece of marble which will take no 
    impression. When men know to do good yet do it not—their hearts are hardened 
    insensibly, and that is dangerous.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Such as sin presumptuously, or they who know to do 
    good yet do it not, are self-condemned.</p></b></font> Titus 3:11. The sinner 
    knows in his conscience, that he is guilty. He know that he has sinned 
    against warnings, education, and conviction. Therefore, his own heart <i>
    must</i>, and <i>does </i>condemn him. And when God judges and condemns him, 
    he will exonerate God, "You are right when You pass sentence; You are 
    blameless when You judge." Psalm 51:4.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Presumptuous sins make deep wounds in the soul.</p></b></font> 
    They lead to despair, and despair is the agony of the soul. The atheist 
    Spira, in despair, was like a living man in hell. Despair sucked out his 
    marrow and vital blood; it made him a skeleton. The sinner goes on 
    stubbornly—yet his foolish heart tells him all will be well; but, when God 
    begins to set his sins in order before him, and conscience, which was before 
    like a lion asleep, begins to be awakened and roars upon him and he sees 
    death and hell before him—now his heart faints! His <i>presumption </i>is 
    turned to <i>despair</i>—and he cries out as Cain, "My punishment is greater 
    than I can bear!" Genesis 4:13. Now the sinner begins to think with himself 
    thus, "I <i>would </i>have my sins and I had them; and now I have the wrath 
    of God upon me for them! Oh, how foolish was I to refuse instruction! But it 
    is too late now! The mercy-seat is quite covered with clouds. I am shut out 
    from all hope of mercy; my wounds are such that the balm of Gilead will not 
    heal!" The more presumption in the sins of this life—the more eternal 
    despair.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. If a person knows to do good and does not to do it, if 
    a person sins presumptuously, God may, in just judgment, leave such a one to 
    himself. </p></b></font>It is a terrible thing when God shall say, "You have, by 
    your presumptuous sin, affronted Me and provoked Me to My face! Therefore, I 
    will give you up to your own heart. You shall sin still; seeing you <i>will
    </i>be filthy—you <i>shall </i>be filthy still."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. To know what is good yet not to do it, to sin 
    presumptuously, is a great degree of the sin against the Holy Spirit. </p></b>
</font>Such as sin <i>presumptuously, </i>sin <i>willfully</i>. Though 
    presumption is not final apostasy—yet it comes very near to it; and a little 
    more sin will make you so guilty, that there remains no more sacrifice for 
    sin. To sin presumptuously against light may, in time, bring on malice and 
    despite to the Spirit; as it was with Julian, who threw up his dagger in the 
    air as if he would be revenged on God. When once it comes to this—there is 
    but one step lower a man can fall—and that is into hell.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. There is little hope for such as know to do good yet 
    do it not, who know what is evil but will not forbear. </p></b></font>There were 
    sacrifices for sins of <i>ignorance—</i>but no sacrifices for sins of <i>
    presumption</i>, Numbers 15:30. Indeed, presumptuous sinners hope all will 
    be well, Proverbs 14:16, "The fool rages and is confident." Such a fool is 
    spoken of Deuteronomy 29:19-20, "When he hears the words of this curse, he 
    blesses himself in his heart saying, <i>'I am safe, even though I am walking 
    in my own stubborn way.' </i>The Lord will not pardon such people. His anger 
    and jealousy will burn against them. All the curses written in this book 
    will come down on them, and the Lord will erase their names from under 
    heaven!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Such as sin presumptuously, who know to do good yet do 
    it not, who know what is evil yet will not forbear it—God refuses all their 
    services</p></b></font>—whether reading, hearing, praying, or communicating. God 
    abhors their sacrifice. Isaiah 1:15, "When you make many prayers—I will not 
    hear; your hands are full of blood." And Hosea 8:13, "The people of Israel 
    love their rituals of sacrifice, but to me their sacrifices are all 
    meaningless! I will call my people to account for their sins, and I will 
    punish them." 
<p align="justify">Thus you see what cause you have to tremble, who are 
    guilty of this sin; you see your misery. Besides all that has been said, 
    consider these two things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. You who sin presumptuously, who know to do good and do 
    it not, who know what is evil yet will not forbear—you cannot sin as cheaply 
    as others.</p>
<p align="justify">Though sin will cost everyone dearly—yet it will cost you 
    more dearly. You go directly against conscience; and, if there is either 
    justice in heaven, or fire in hell—you shall be sure to be punished!</p>
<p align="justify">2. You who sin presumptuously cannot take so much 
    pleasure in your sin as another may have. One whose conscience is less 
    enlightened, though his sin will be bitter to him afterwards—yet at present 
    he may roll it as honey under his tongue and find pleasure in it. But you 
    who sin against your knowledge cannot have as much pleasure in sin as he—for 
    your conscience will put forth a sting, and all the threatenings of the Word 
    will set themselves in battle array against you so that you can have no 
    quiet of conscience. That trouble which you feel now in your conscience, is 
    but the beginning of sorrow!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION.</p></b></font> What shall we do that we may not sin 
    presumptuously against conscience?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. </p></b></font>Take heed of little sins. Though, to 
    speak properly, there are no such things as little sins—there is no <i>
    little treason</i>. But I comparatively, one sin may be lesser than another. 
    Take heed of little sins! The frequent committing of lesser sins, will 
    prepare for greater sins. A lesser disease of the body, if it is left alone, 
    prepares for a greater disease. Being unjust in a little, prepares for being 
    unjust in much, Luke 16:10. Such as were, at first, more modest—yet, by 
    accustoming themselves to lesser sins—by degrees their sins have grown up to 
    a greater height of sin. <i>Jail </i>sins have begun as <i>little </i>sins!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2.</p></b></font> If you would not sin presumptuously, 
    knowingly and willfully—then reverence the dictates of conscience. Get 
    conscience well-informed by the Word, as you set your watch by the sun—and 
    then be ruled by it. Do nothing against conscience. If conscience says, "Do 
    such a thing," though ever so unpleasing, set upon the duty. When conscience 
    says, "Take heed of such a thing!" then do not come near the forbidden 
    fruit! Conscience is God's deputy in the soul. The voice of conscience, is 
    the voice of God. Do not trifle with checks of conscience, lest God allows 
    you to harden in sin and, by degrees, come to presumptuous sin.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 3. </p></b></font>Labor to have your knowledge 
    sanctified. Men sin against their knowledge, because their knowledge is not 
    sanctified. Sanctified knowledge works upon the soul. It inclines us to do 
    good. It makes us flee from sin. Sanctified knowledge is like a breastplate, 
    which keeps the arrow or presumptuous sin from entering!
