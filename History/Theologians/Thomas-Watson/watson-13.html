<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="center">"The fruit of the Spirit is <b>joy</b>." Gal. 5:22.</p>
<p align="justify">The third fruit of justification, adoption, and 
    sanctification—is <b>joy in the Holy Spirit</b>. Joy is setting the soul 
    upon the top of a pinnacle—it is the cream of the sincere milk of the word. 
    Spiritual joy is a sweet and delightful passion, arising from the 
    apprehension and feeling of some good, whereby the soul is supported under 
    present troubles, and fenced against future fear.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I. Joy is a delightful passion.</p></b> It is contrary to 
    sorrow, which is a perturbation of mind, whereby the heart is perplexed and 
    cast down. Joy is a sweet and pleasant affection—which eases the mind, and 
    exhilarates and comforts the spirits.
<b>
<p align="justify">II. Joy arises from the feeling of some good.</p></b> Joy is 
    not a mere imagination; but is rational, and arises from the feeling of some 
    good, as the sense of God's love and favor. Joy is so real a thing, that it 
    makes a sudden change in a person; and turns mourning into melody. As in the 
    spring-time, when the sun comes to our horizon, it makes a sudden alteration 
    in the face of the universe—the birds sing, the flowers appear, the fig-tree 
    puts forth her green figs; everything seems to rejoice and put off its 
    mourning, as being revived with the sweet influence of the sun. Just so, 
    when the Sun of Righteousness arises on the soul, it makes a sudden 
    alteration, and the soul is infinitely rejoiced with the golden beams of 
    God's love.
<b>
<p align="justify">III. By joy, the soul is supported under present 
    troubles.</p></b> Joy stupefies and swallows up troubles; it carries the heart 
    above them, as the oil swims above the water.
<b>
<p align="justify">IV. By joy, the heart is fenced against future fear.</p></b> 
    Joy is both a <i>cordial </i>and an <i>antidote</i>. It is a cordial which 
    gives present relief to the spirits when they are sad; and an antidote, 
    which fences off the fear of approaching danger. "I will fear no evil, for 
    you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me."
<b>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF">How is this joy wrought?</font></p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It arises partly from the promise.</p></b> As the bee 
    lies at the breast of the flower, and sucks out its sweetness; just so, 
    faith lies at the breast of a promise, and sucks out the quintessence of 
    joy. "Your comforts delight my soul;" that is, the comforts which distill 
    from the promises.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The Spirit of God who is called the 'Comforter', 
    sometimes drops this golden oil of joy into the soul."</p></b> John 14:26. The 
    Spirit whispers the remission of his sin to a believer—and sheds God's love 
    abroad in the heart, whence flows infinite joy and delight. Rom 5:5.
<b>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF">What are the SEASONS in which God 
    usually gives his people divine joys?</font></p></b> There are five Seasons. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Sometimes at the blessed Supper.</p></b> The soul comes
    <i>weeping after Christ </i>in the Lord's Supper, and God sends it away <i>
    weeping for joy</i>. The Jews had a custom at their feasts, of pouring 
    ointment on their guests and kissing them; in the Lord's Supper, God often 
    pours the oil of gladness on the saints, and kisses them with the kisses of 
    his lips. There are two grand ends of the Lord's Supper—the strengthening of 
    faith, and the flourishing of joy. Here, in this ordinance, God displays the 
    banner of his love; here believers taste not only sacramental bread—but 
    hidden manna. Not that God always meets the soul with joy. He may give 
    increase of <i>grace</i>, when not increase of <i>joy</i>. But oftentimes he 
    pours in the <i>oil of gladness</i>, and gives the soul a secret seal of his 
    love; as Christ made himself known in the breaking of bread to the two 
    disciples.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Before God calls his people to suffering.</p></b> "Be of 
    good cheer, Paul." Acts 23:11. When God was about to give Paul a cup of <i>
    blood </i>to drink—he spiced it with <i>joy</i>. "As the <i>sufferings </i>
    of Christ abound in us, so our <i>consolation </i>also abounds." 2 Cor 1:5. 
    This made the martyrs' flames, to be beds of roses to them. When Stephen was 
    being stoned he saw heaven open, and the Sun of Righteousness shone upon his 
    face. God candies our wormwood, with sugar.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) After sore conflicts with Satan. </p></b>He is the red 
    dragon who troubles the waters; he puts the soul into frights, makes it 
    believe that it has no grace, and that God does not love it. Though he 
    cannot blot out a Christian's evidence for heaven—yet he may cast such a 
    mist before his eyes, that he cannot read it. When the soul has been bruised 
    with temptations, God will comfort the bruised reed by giving joy—to confirm 
    a Christian's title to heaven. After Satan's <i>fiery darts, </i>comes the
    <i>white stone</i>. No better balm to heal a tempted soul, than the oil of 
    gladness! After Christ was tempted, an angel came to comfort him.
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) After spiritual desertion.</p></b> Desertion is a 
    poisoned arrow which shoots to the heart. "For the Almighty has struck me 
    down with his arrows. He has sent his poisoned arrows deep within my spirit. 
    All God's terrors are arrayed against me!" Job 6:4. God is called a fire and 
    a light: the deserted soul feels the fire—but does not see the light; it 
    cries out, as Asaph, "Has the Lord rejected me forever? Will he never again 
    show me favor? Is his unfailing love gone forever? Have his promises 
    permanently failed? Has God forgotten to be kind? Has he slammed the door on 
    his compassion?" Psalms 77:7-9. When the soul is in this case, and ready to 
    faint away in despair, God shines upon it, and gives it some apprehension of 
    his favor, and turns the <i>shadow of death </i>into the <i>light of the 
    morning</i>. God keeps his cordials for a time of fainting. Joy after a time 
    of desertion, is like a resurrection from the dead.
<b>
<p align="justify">(5.) At the hour of death. </p></b>Of those even who have had 
    no joy in their lifetime. God puts this <i>sugar </i>in the <i>bottom </i>of 
    the cup—to make their death sweet. At the last hour, when all other comforts 
    are gone, God sends the Comforter; and when their appetite to food fails, he 
    feeds them with hidden manna. As the wicked before they die, have some 
    apprehensions of hell and wrath in their conscience; so the godly have some 
    foretastes of God's everlasting favor, though sometimes their diseases may 
    be such, and their bodies so oppressed, that they cannot express what they 
    feel. Jacob laid himself to sleep on a stone and saw a vision of a ladder, 
    and the angels ascending and descending upon it. Just so, when saints lay 
    themselves down to sleep the sleep of death, they have often a vision—they 
    see the light of God's face, and have the evidences of his love sealed up to 
    them forever.
<b>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF">What are the differences between <i>
    worldly </i>joys and <i>spiritual </i>joys?</font></p></b><font color="#0000FF">
</font>The <i>gleanings </i>of spiritual joys, are better than the <i>
    vintage </i>of the worldly joys.
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Spiritual joys help to make us BETTER, worldly joys 
    often make us worse.</p></b> "I spoke unto you in your prosperity—but you said, 
    I will not hear." Jer 22:21. <i>Pride </i>and <i>luxury </i>are the two 
    worms which are bred from worldly pleasures. Wine is the inflamer of lust. 
    As Satan entered in the <i>sop</i>, so often in the <i>cup</i>. But 
    spiritual joy makes one better; it is like cordial medicine, which, as 
    physicians say, not only cheers the heart—but purges out the noxious humours. 
    Just so, divine joy is cordial medicine, which not only comforts but 
    purifies; it makes a Christian more holy; it causes an antipathy against 
    sin; it infuses strength to live and suffer for Christ. "The joy of the Lord 
    is your strength." Some colors not only <i>delight </i>the eye—but <i>
    strengthen </i>the sight. Just so, the joys of God not only <i>refresh </i>
    the soul—but <i>strengthen </i>it.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Spiritual joys are INWARD, they are heart joys</p></b>. 
    "Your heart shall rejoice." John 16:22. True joy is hidden within, worldly 
    joy lies on the outside, like the dew which wets the leaf. We read of those 
    who "rejoice in appearance," in the Greek, in the face. 2 Cor 5:12. It goes 
    no farther than the face, it is not within. "Laughter can conceal a heavy 
    heart; when the laughter ends, the grief remains." Proverbs 14:13. Like a 
    house which has a gilded frontispiece—but all the rooms within are hung in 
    mourning. But spiritual joy lies most <i>within</i>. "Your <i>heart </i>
    shall rejoice." Divine joy is like a spring of water which runs underground! 
    Others can see the sufferings of a Christian—but they see not his joy. "Each 
    heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can fully share its joy." 
    Prov 14:10. His joy is hidden manna—hidden from the eye of the world; he has 
    joyful music which others cannot hear. The marrow lies <i>within</i>, the 
    best joy is within the heart.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Spiritual joys are SWEETER than worldly joys. </p></b>
    "Your love is sweeter than wine!" Song of Songs 1:2. Spiritual joys are a 
    Christian's festival; they are the golden pot and the sweet manna, they are 
    so sweet, that they make everything else sweet! Spiritual joys sweeten 
    health and estate, as sweet water poured on flowers makes them more fragrant 
    and aromatic. Divine joys are so delicious and ravishing, that they put our 
    mouth out of taste for earthly delights; just as he who has been drinking 
    cordials tastes little sweetness in water. Paul had so tasted these divine 
    joys, that his mouth was out of taste for worldly things; the world was 
    crucified to him, it was like a dead thing, he could find no sweetness in 
    it. Gal 6:14.
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Spiritual joys are more PURE, they are not tempered 
    with any bitter ingredients.</p></b> A sinner's joy is mixed with dregs, it is 
    embittered with fear and guilt—he drinks wormwood wine. But spiritual joy is 
    not muddied with guilt—but like a crystal stream, it runs pure. It is a rose 
    without prickles; it is honey without wax.
<b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Spiritual joys are SATISFYING joys. </p></b>"Ask, that 
    your joy may be full." Worldly joys can no more fill the heart than a drop 
    can fill an ocean; they may please the palate or imagination—but cannot 
    satisfy the soul. "No matter how much we <i>see</i>—we are never satisfied. 
    No matter how much we <i>hear</i>—we are not content." Ecclesiastes 1:8. But 
    the joys of God satisfy. "Your comforts delight my soul." Psalm 94:19. There 
    is as much difference between spiritual joys and earthly joys—as between a 
    banquet which is <i>eaten</i>—and one which is <i>painted </i>on the wall!
<b>
<p align="justify">(6.) Spiritual joys are STRONGER joys than worldly joys.
    </p></b>"Strong consolation." Heb 6:18. They are strong joys indeed, which can 
    bear up a Christian's heart in trials and afflictions. "Having received the 
    word in much affliction, with joy." These joys are <i>roses which grow in 
    winter!</i> These joys can sweeten the bitter waters of Marah! He who has 
    these joys, can gather grapes from thorns, and fetch honey out of the 
    carcass of a lion! "As sorrowing—yet always rejoicing." 2 Cor 6: 10. At the 
    end of the <i>rod—</i>a Christian tastes <i>honey!
</i><b>
<p align="justify">(7.) Spiritual joys are UNWEARIED joys.</p></b> Other joys, 
    when in excess, often cause loathing; too much honey nauseates. One may be 
    tired of <i>pleasure</i>, as well as <i>labor</i>. King Xerxes offered a 
    reward to him who could find out a <i>new </i>pleasure! But the joys of God, 
    though they satisfy—yet they never glut. A <i>drop </i>of joy is sweet—but 
    the more of this wine the better! Such as drink of the joys of heaven—are 
    never glutted. Their satiety is without loathing, because they still desire 
    more of the joy with which they are satiated.
<b>
<p align="justify">(8.) Spiritual joys are ABIDING joys. </p></b>Worldly joys 
    are soon gone. Such as crown themselves with rosebuds, and bathe in the 
    perfumed waters of pleasure—may have joys which seem to be <i>sweet</i>—but 
    they are <i>swift</i>. They are like meteors, which give a bright and sudden 
    flash, and then disappear. But the joys which believers have are abiding; 
    they are a blossom of eternity—a pledge of those <i>rivers of pleasure </i>
    which run at God's right hand! "In Your presence is abundant joy; in Your 
    right hand are eternal pleasures!" Psalm 16:11
<b>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF">Why is this joy to be labored for?</font></p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Because it is self-existent.</p></b> Spiritual joy can 
    exist in the absence of all other carnal joy. This joy does not depend upon 
    outward things. As the philosophers said, when the musicians came to them, 
    "Philosophers can be merry without music;" so he who has this spiritual joy 
    can be cheerful in the deficiency of carnal joys; he can rejoice in God, in 
    sure hope of glory! "Even though the fig trees have no blossoms, and there 
    are no grapes on the vine; even though the olive crop fails, and the fields 
    lie empty and barren; even though the flocks die in the fields, and the 
    cattle barns are empty, yet I will <i>rejoice </i>in the Lord! I will be <i>
    joyful </i>in the God of my salvation. Habakkuk 3:17-18. Spiritual joy can 
    go without <i>silver crutches </i>to support it. Spiritual joy is built 
    higher, than upon creatures, for it is built on the love of God, on the 
    promises of Scripture, and on the blood of Christ.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Because spiritual joy carries the soul through duty 
    cheerfully. </p></b>Religion becomes a recreation. Fear and sorrow hinder us in 
    the discharge of duty; but a Christian serves God with activity, when he 
    serves him with joy. The <i>oil of joy </i>makes the <i>wheels of obedience
    </i>move faster. How fervently did they pray, whom God made joyful in the 
    house of prayer! "I will bring them also to my holy mountain of Jerusalem 
    and will fill them with joy in my house of prayer." Isaiah 56:7.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) It is called the kingdom of God, because it is a <i>
    taste </i>of that which the saints have in the kingdom of God.</p></b> "For the 
    Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life 
    of goodness and peace and <i>joy in the Holy Spirit</i>." Romans 14:17. What 
    is the heaven of the angels—but the smiles of God's face, the sensible 
    perception and feeling of those joys which are infinitely ravishing and full 
    of glory! 
<p align="justify">To encourage and quicken us in seeking after them, 
    consider, that Christ died to purchase this joy for his saints. He was a man 
    of sorrows—that we might be full of joy; he prayed that the saints might 
    have this divine joy. "And now I am coming to you. I have told them many 
    things while I was with them so they would be<i> filled with my joy</i>." 
    John 17:13. Christ knows we never love him so much—as when we <i>feel </i>
    his love; which may encourage us to seek after this joy. We pray for that 
    which Christ himself is praying for, when we pray that his joy may be 
    fulfilled in us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF">What shall we do to obtain this 
    spiritual joy?</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Walk consistently and spiritually. God gives joy after 
    long and close walking with him. </p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Observe your hours. Set time every day apart for 
    God. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Mourn for sin. "Mourning is the seed," as Basil 
    says, "out of which the flower of spiritual joy grows." "I will comfort 
    those who mourn." Isa 57:18.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Keep the <i>book of conscience</i> fair written. Do 
    not by presumptuous sins, blur your evidences. A good conscience is the <i>
    ark </i>in which God puts the hidden manna!</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Be often upon your knees—pray with life and 
    fervency. The same Spirit who fills the heart with sighs—fills it with joys. 
    The same Spirit who inspires the prayer—seals it. When Hannah had prayed, 
    her countenance was no longer sad. I Sam 1:18. Praying Christians have much 
    fellowship with God; and none are so likely to have the secrets of his love 
    imparted, as those who hold correspondence with him. By close walking with 
    God, we get clusters of Eshcol's grapes along the way, which are pledge of 
    future happiness.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF">How shall we comfort those who lack 
    joy?</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Such as walk in close communion with God—have more joy 
    than others.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Initial joy, joy in the seed. "Light is shed upon 
    the righteous, and joy on the upright in heart." Psalm 97:11. Grace in the 
    heart, is a seed of joy. Though a Christian lacks the <i>sun</i>, he has a 
    day-star in his heart.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A believer has <i>real </i>joy—though not <i>royal
    </i>comforts. He has, as Aquinas says, "joy <i>in </i>God, though not <i>
    from </i>God." Joy in God, is the delight and pleasure the soul takes in 
    God. "My soul shall be glad in the Lord." He who is truly gracious, is so 
    far joyful as to take comfort in God. Though he cannot say that God rejoices 
    in him; he can say that he rejoices in God.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) He has supporting joy—though not transporting 
    comforts. He has as much as keeps him from sinking. "You strengthen me with 
    strength in my soul." Psalm 138:3. If a Christian has not God's arm to <i>
    embrace </i>him—yet he has it to <i>uphold </i>him. Thus a Christian who 
    walks with God has something which bears up his heart from sinking; and it 
    is but waiting awhile, and he is sure of those eternal joys which are 
    unspeakable and full of glory!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000">Use one:</font> See that true 
    religion is no melancholy thing—it brings joy. </p></b>The fruit of the Spirit 
    is joy. Joy may vary—but it is never totally destroyed. A poor Christian who 
    exists on bread and water, may have purer joy than the greatest monarch. 
    Though he <i>fares </i>hard—he <i>feeds </i>high. He has a table spread from 
    heaven—angels' food, and the hidden manna. He has sometimes sweet raptures 
    of joy—which cause jubilation of spirit; he has that which is better <i>
    felt—</i>than can be <i>expressed</i>. "But I do know that I was caught up 
    into paradise and heard things so astounding that they cannot be told." 2 
    Corinthians 12:4.
<p align="justify"></p>
<b>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000">Use two:</font> If God gives his 
    people such joy in this life, oh! then, what glorious joy will he give them 
    in heaven! </p></b>"Enter into the joy of your Lord!" Matt 25:21. Here on 
    earth—joy begins to enter into us; there in heaven—we shall enter into joy. 
    God keeps his best wine until last. Heliogabalus bathed himself in sweet 
    perfumed waters. What joy will that be—when the soul shall forever bathe 
    itself in the pure and pleasant fountain of God's love! What joy will that 
    be—to see the orient brightness of Christ's face, and have the kisses of 
    those lips which drop sweet-smelling myrrh! "The Bride will rejoice in the 
    embrace of her Lord," Augustine. Oh! if a cluster of grapes here is so 
    sweet, what will the <i>full vintage</i> be! How may this set us all longing 
    for that place where <i>sorrow </i>cannot live—and where <i>joy </i>cannot 
    die!
