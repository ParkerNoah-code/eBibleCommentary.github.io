        <p>
          Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour,
          and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
          thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
          daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor
          thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made
          heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the
          seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath-day and hallowed
          it. Exod 20: 8-11.
        </p>
        <p>
          This commandment was engraven in stone by God's own finger, and it
          will be our comfort to have it engraven in our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sabbath-day is set apart for God's solemn worship; it is his own
          enclosure, and must not be alienated to common uses. As a preface to
          this commandment, he has put a memento to it, Remember to keep the
          Sabbath day holy.' This word, remember,' shows that we are apt to
          forget Sabbath holiness; therefore we need a memorandum to put us in
          mind of sanctifying the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. There is in these words a solemn command. Remember the Sabbath-day
          to keep it holy.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The matter of it. The sanctifying the Sabbath, which Sabbath
          sanctification consists in two things, in resting from our own works,
          and in a conscientious discharge of our religious duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The persons to whom the command of sanctifying the Sabbath is given.
          Either superiors, and they are, more private, as parents and masters;
          or more public, as magistrates; or inferiors, as natives, children,
          and servants, Thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy
          maidservant;' or foreigners, thy stranger that is within thy gates.'
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The arguments to obey this commandment of keeping holy the Sabbath
          are,
        </p>
        <p>
          From the rationality of it. Six days shalt thou labour and do all thy
          work;' as if God had said, I am not a hard master, I do not grudge
          thee time to look after thy calling, and to get an estate. I have
          given thee six days, to do all thy work in, and have taken but one day
          for myself. I might have reserved six days for myself, and allowed
          thee but one; but I have given thee six days for the works of thy
          calling, and have taken but one day for my own service. It is just and
          rational, therefore, that thou shouldest set this day in a special
          manner apart for my worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second argument for sanctifying the Sabbath, is taken from the
          justice of it. The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God;' as
          if God had said, The Sabbath-day is my due, I challenge a special
          right in it, and no other has any claim to it. He who robs me of this
          day, and puts it to common uses, is a sacrilegious person, he steals
          from the crown of heaven, and I will in nowise hold him guiltless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third argument for sanctifying the Sabbath, is taken from God's
          own observance of it. He rested the seventh day;' as if the Lord
          should say, Will you not follow me as a pattern? Having finished all
          my works of creation, I rested the seventh day; so having done all
          your secular work on the six days, you should now cease from the
          labour of your calling, and dedicate the seventh day to me, as a day
          of holy rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth argument for Sabbath-sanctification, is taken ab utili,
          from the benefit which redounds from a religious observation of the
          Sabbath. The Lord blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.' God not
          only appointed the seventh day, but he blessed it. It is not only a
          day of honour to God, but a day of blessing to us; it is not only a
          day wherein we give God worship, but a day wherein he gives us grace.
          On this day a blessing drops down from heaven. God himself is not
          benefited by it, we cannot add one cubit to his essential glory; but
          we ourselves are benefited. This day, religiously observed, entails a
          blessing upon our souls, our estate, and our posterity. Not keeping
          it, brings a curse. Jer 17: 27. God curses a man's blessings. Mal 2:
          2. The bread which he eats is poisoned with a curse; so the
          conscientious observation of the Sabbath, brings all manner of
          blessings with it. These are the arguments to induce
          Sabbath-sanctification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing I would have you now observe is, that the commandment of
          keeping the Sabbath was not abrogated with the ceremonial law, but is
          purely moral, and the observation of it is to be continued to the end
          of the world. Where can it be shown that God has given us a discharge
          from keeping one day in seven?
        </p>
        <p>Why has God appointed a Sabbath?</p>
        <p>
          (1) With respect to himself. It is requisite that God should reserve
          one day in seven for his own immediate service, that thereby he might
          be acknowledged to be the great Plenipotentiary, or sovereign Lord,
          who has power over us both to command worship, and appoint the time
          when he will be worshipped.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) With respect to us. The Sabbath-day is for our interest; it
          promotes holiness in us. The business of week-days makes us forgetful
          of God and our souls: the Sabbath brings him back to our remembrance.
          When the falling dust of the world has clogged the wheels of our
          affections, that they can scarce move towards God, the Sabbath comes,
          and oils the wheels of our affections, and they move swiftly on. God
          has appointed the Sabbath for this end. On this day the thoughts rise
          to heaven, the tongue speaks of God, and is as the pen of a ready
          writer, the eyes drop tears, and the soul burns in love. The heart,
          which all the week was frozen, on the Sabbath melts with the word. The
          Sabbath is a friend to religion; it files off the rust of our graces;
          it is a spiritual jubilee, wherein the soul is set to converse with
          its Maker.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should next show you the modes, or manner, how we should keep the
          Sabbath day holy; but before I come to that, we have a great question
          to consider.
        </p>
        <p>
          How comes it to pass that we do not keep the seventh-day Sabbath as it
          was in the primitive institution, but have changed it to another day?
        </p>
        <p>
          The old seventh-day Sabbath, which was the Jewish Sabbath, is
          abrogated, and in the room of it the first day of the week, which is
          the Christian Sabbath, succeeds. The morality or substance of the
          fourth commandment does not lie in keeping the seventh day precisely,
          but keeping one day in seven is what God has appointed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how comes the first day in the week to be substituted in the room
          of the seventh day?
        </p>
        <p>
          Not by ecclesiastic authority. The church,' says Mr Perkins, has no
          power to ordain a Sabbath.'
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The change of the Sabbath from the last day of the week to the
          first was by Christ's own appointment. He is Lord of the Sabbath.'
          Mark 2: 28. And who shall appoint a day but he who is Lord of it? He
          made this day. This is the day which the Lord has made.' Psa 118: 24.
          Arnobius and most expositors understand it of the Christian Sabbath,
          which is called the Lord's-day.' Rev 1: 10. As it is called the Lord's
          Supper,' because of the Lord's instituting the bread and wine and
          setting it apart from a common to a special and sacred use; so it is
          called the Lord's-day, because of the Lord's instituting it, and
          setting it apart from common days, to his special worship and service.
          Christ rose on the first day of the week, out of the grave, and
          appeared twice on that day to his disciples, John 20: 19, 26, which
          was to intimate to them, as Augustine and Athanasius say, that he
          transferred the Jewish Sabbath to the Lord's day.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The keeping of the first day was the practice of the apostles.
          Upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to
          break bread, Paul preached unto them.' Acts 20: 7; 1 Cor 16: 2. Here
          was both preaching and breaking of bread on this day. Augustine and
          Innocentius, and Isidore, make the keeping of our gospel Sabbath to be
          of apostolic sanction, and affirm, that by virtue of the apostles'
          practice, this day is to be set apart for divine worship. What the
          apostles did, they did by divine authority; for they were inspired by
          the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The primitive church had the Lord's-day, which we now celebrate,
          in high estimation. It was a great badge of their religion to observe
          this day. Ignatius, the most ancient father, who lived in the time of
          John the apostle, has these words, Let every one that loveth Christ
          keep holy the first day of the week, the Lord's-day.' This day has
          been observed by the church of Christ above sixteen hundred years, as
          the learned Bucer notes. Thus you see how the seventh-day Sabbath came
          to be changed to the first-day Sabbath.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grand reason for changing the Jewish Sabbath to the Lord's-day is
          that it puts us in mind of the Mystery of our redemption by Christ.'
          The reason why God instituted the old Sabbath was to be a memorial of
          the creation; but he has now brought the first day of the week in its
          room in memory of a more glorious work than creation, which is
          redemption. Great was the work of creation, but greater was the work
          of redemption. As it was said, The glory of this latter house shall be
          greater than of the former.' Hag 2: 9. So the glory of the redemption
          was greater than the glory of the creation. Great wisdom was seen in
          making us, but more miraculous wisdom in saving us. Great power was
          seen in bringing us out of nothing, but greater power in helping us
          when we were worse than nothing. It cost more to redeem than to create
          us. In creation it was but speaking a word (Psa 148: 5); in redeeming
          there was shedding of blood.1 Pet 1: 19. Creation was the work of
          God's fingers, Psa 8: 3, redemption was the work of his arm. Luke 1:
          51. In creation, God gave us ourselves; in the redemption, he gave us
          himself. By creation, we have life in Adam; by redemption, we have
          life in Christ. Col 3: 3. By creation, we had a right to an earthly
          paradise: by redemption, we have a title to a heavenly kingdom. Christ
          might well change the seventh day of the week into the first, as it
          puts us in mind of our redemption, which is a more glorious work than
          creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. The use I shall make of this is, that we should have the
          Christian Sabbath, we now celebrate, in high veneration. The Jews
          called the Sabbath, The desire of days, and the queen of days.' This
          day we must call a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable.' Isa 58:
          13. Metal that has the king's stamp upon it is honourable, and of
          great value. God has set his royal stamp upon the Sabbath; it is the
          Sabbath of the Lord, and this makes it honourable. We should look upon
          this day as the best day in the week. What the phoenix is among birds,
          what the sun is among planets the Lord's-day is among other days. This
          is the day which the Lord has made.' Psa 118: 24. God has made all the
          days, but he has blessed this. As Jacob got the blessing from his
          brother, so the Sabbath got the blessing from all other days in the
          week. It is a day in which we converse in a special manner with God.
          The Jews called the Sabbath a day of light;' so on this day the Sun of
          Righteousness shines upon the soul. The Sabbath is the market-day of
          the soul, the cream of time. It is the day of Christ's rising from the
          grave, and the Holy Ghost's descending upon the earth. It is perfumed
          with the sweet odour of prayer, which goes up to heaven as incense. On
          this day the manna falls, that is angels' food. This is the soul's
          festival-day, on which the graces act their part: the other days of
          the week are most employed about earth, this day about heaven; then
          you gather straw, now pearl. Now Christ takes the soul up into the
          mount, and gives it transfiguring sights of glory. Now he leads his
          spouse into the wine-cellar, and displays the banner of his love. Now
          he gives her his spiced wine, and the juice of the pomegranate. Cant
          2: 4, 8: 2. The Lord usually reveals himself more to the soul on this
          day. The apostle John was in the Spirit on the Lord's-day. Rev 1: 10.
          He was carried up on this day in divine raptures towards heaven. This
          day a Christian is in the altitudes; he walks with God, and takes as
          it were a turn with him in heaven.1 John 1: 3. On this day holy
          affections are quickened; the stock of grace is improved; corruptions
          are weakened; and Satan falls like lightning before the majesty of the
          word. Christ wrought most of his miracles upon the Sabbath; so he does
          still: dead souls are raised and hearts of stone are made flesh. How
          highly should we esteem and reverence this day! It is more precious
          than rubies. God has anointed it with the oil of gladness above its
          fellows. On the Sabbath we are doing angels' work, our tongues are
          tuned to God's praises. The Sabbath on earth is a shadow and type of
          the glorious rest and eternal Sabbath we hope for in heaven, when God
          shall be the temple, and the Lamb shall be the light of it. Rev 21:
          22, 23.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. SIX days shalt thou labour.' God would not have any live out
          of a calling: religion gives no warrant for idleness. It is a duty to
          labour six days, as well as keep holy rest on the seventh day. We hear
          that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at
          all. Now, them that are such, we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus,
          that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.' 2 Thess 3:
          11. A Christian must not only mind heaven, but his calling. While the
          pilot has his eye to the star, he has his hand to the helm. Without
          labour the pillars of a commonwealth will dissolve, and the earth,
          like the sluggard's field, will be overrun with briers. Prov 24: 31.
          Adam in innocence, though monarch of the world, must not be idle, but
          must dress and till the ground. Gen 2: 15. Piety does not exclude
          industry. Standing water putrifies. Inanimate creatures are in motion.
          The sun goes its circuit, the fountain runs, and the fire sparkles.
          Animate creatures work. Solomon sends us to the ant and pismire to
          learn labour. Prov 6: 6; 30: 25. The bee is the emblem of industry;
          some of the bees trim the honey, others work the wax, others frame the
          comb, others lie sentinel at the door of the hive to keep out the
          drone. And shall not man much more innate himself to labour? That law
          in paradise was never repeated. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
          eat bread.' Gen 3: 19. Such professors are to be disliked who talk of
          living by faith, but live out of a calling; they are like the lilies
          which toil not, neither do they spin.' Matt 6: 28. It is a speech of
          holy and learned Mr Perkins, Let a man be endowed with excellent
          gifts, and hear the word with reverence, and receive the sacrament,
          yet if he practice not the duties of his calling, all is but
          hypocrisy.' What is an idle person good for? What benefit is a ship
          that lies always on the shore? or armour that hangs up and rusts? To
          live out of a calling exposes a person to temptation. Melanchthon
          calls idleness the Devil's bath, because he bathes himself with
          delight in an idle soul. We do not sow seed in ground when it lies
          fallow; but Satan sows most of his seed of temptation in such persons
          as lie fallow, and are out of a calling. Idleness is the nurse of
          vice. Seneca, an old heathen, could say, Nullus mihi per otium dies
          exit; No day passes me without some labour.' An idle person stands for
          a cipher in the world, and God writes down no ciphers in the book of
          life. We read in Scripture of eating the bread of idleness,' and
          drinking the wine of violence.' Prov 31: 27; 4: 17. It is as much a
          sin to eat the bread of idleness,' as to drink the wine of violence.'
          An idle person can give no account of his time. Time is a talent to
          trade with, both in our particular and general callings. The slothful
          person hides his talent in the earth;' he does no good; his time is
          not lived, but lost. An idle person lives unprofitably, he cumbers the
          ground. God calls the slothful servant wicked.' Thou wicked and
          slothful servant.' Matt 25: 26. Draco, whose laws were written in
          blood, deprived those of their life who would not work for their
          living. In Hetruria they caused such persons to be banished. Idle
          persons live in the breach of the commandment, Six days shalt thou
          labour.' Let them take heed they be not banished from heaven. A man
          may as well go to hell for not working in his calling, as for not
          believing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having spoken of the reasons of sanctifying the Sabbath I come now to
        </p>
        <p>III. The manner of sanctifying the Sabbath.</p>
        <p>
          Negatively. We must do no work in it. This is the commandment. In it
          thou shall do no manner of work.' God has set apart this day for
          himself; therefore we are not to use it in common, by doing any civil
          work. As when Abraham went to sacrifice he left his servants and the
          ass at the bottom of the hill; so, when we are to worship God on this
          day, we must leave all worldly business behind, leave the ass at the
          bottom of the hill. Gen 22: 5. As Joseph, when he would speak with his
          brethren, thrust out the Egyptians, so, when we would converse with
          God on this day, we must thrust out all earthly employments. The
          Lord's day is a day of holy rest. All secular work must be forborne
          and suspended, as it is a profanation of the day. In those days saw I
          in Judah some treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in
          sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes and figs, and all
          manner of burdens which they brought into Jerusalem on the
          Sabbath-day; and I testified against them. Then I contended with the
          nobles of Judah, and said unto them, |What evil thing is this that ye
          do, and profane the Sabbath-day?' | Neh 13: 15, 17. It is sacrilege to
          rob for civil work the time which God has set apart for his worship.
          He that devotes any time of the Sabbath to worldly business, is a
          worse thief than he who robs on the highway; for the one does but rob
          man, but the other robs God. The Lord forbade mamma to be gathered on
          the Sabbath. Exod 16: 26. One might think it would have been allowed,
          as manna was the staff of their life,' and the time when it fell was
          between five and six in the morning, so that they might have gathered
          it betimes, and all the rest of the Sabbath might have been employed
          in God's worship; and besides, they needed not to have taken any great
          journey for it, for it was but stepping out of their doors, and it
          fell about their tents: and yet they might not gather it on the
          Sabbath; and for purposing only to do it, God was very angry. There
          went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they
          found none. And the Lord said, How long refuse ye to keep my
          commandments and my laws?' Exod 16: 27, 28. Surely anointing Christ
          when he was dead was a commendable work; but, though Mary Magdalene,
          and Mary the mother of James, had prepared sweet ointments to anoint
          the dead body of Christ, they went not to the sepulchre to embalm him
          till the Sabbath was past. They rested the Sabbath-day, according to
          the commandment.' Luke 23: 56. The hand cannot be busied on the
          Lord's-day but the heart will be defiled. The very heathen, by the
          light of nature, would not do any secular work in the time which they
          had set apart for the worship of their false gods. Clemens
          Alexandrinus reports of one of the emperors of Rome, who, on the day
          of set worship for his gods, put aside warlike affairs and spent the
          time in devotion. To do servile work on the Sabbath shows an
          irreligious heart, and greatly offends God. To do secular work on this
          day is to follow the devil's slough; it is to debase the soul. God
          made this day on purpose to raise the heart to heaven, to converse
          with him, to do angels' work; and to be employed in earthly work is to
          degrade the soul of its honour. God will not have his day entrenched
          upon, or defiled in the least thing. The man that gathered sticks on
          the Sabbath he commanded to be stoned. Numb.15: 35. It would seem a
          small thing to pick up a few sticks to make a fire; but God would not
          have this day violated in the smallest matters. Nay, the work which
          had reference to a religious use might not be done on the Sabbath, as
          the hewing of stones for the building of the sanctuary. Bezaleel, who
          was to cut the stones, and carve the timber out for the sanctuary,
          must forbear to do it on the Sabbath. Exod 31: 15. A temple is a place
          of God's worship, but it was a sin to build a temple on the
          Lord's-day. This is keeping the Sabbath-day holy negatively, in doing
          no servile work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Works of necessity and charity however may be done on this day. In
          these cases God will have mercy and not sacrifice. (1) It is lawful to
          take the necessary supplies of nature. Food is to the body as oil to
          the lamp. (2) It is lawful to do works of mercy, as helping a
          neighbour when either life or estate are in danger. Herein the Jews
          were too nice and precise, who would not suffer works of charity to be
          done on the Sabbath. If a man was sick, they thought they might not on
          this day use means for his recovery. Christ charges them with being
          angry because he had wrought a cure on the Sabbath. John 7: 23. If a
          house were on fire, the Jews thought they might not bring water to
          quench it; if a vessel leaked on this day, they thought they might not
          stop it. They were righteous overmuch;' it was seeming zeal, but
          wanted discretion to guide it. Except in these two cases, of necessity
          and charity, all secular work is to be suspended and laid aside on the
          Lord's-day. In it thou shalt do no manner of work.' This arraigns and
          condemns many among us who too much foul their fingers with work on
          that day; some in dressing great feasts, others in opening their
          shop-doors, and selling meat on the Sabbath. The mariner will not put
          to sea but on the Sabbath, and so runs full sail into the violation of
          this command. Others work on this day privately, put up their
          shop-windows, and follow their trade within doors; but though they
          think to hide their sin under a canopy, God sees it. Whither shall I
          flee from thy presence?' The darkness hideth not from thee.' Psa 139:
          7, 12. Such profane the day, and God will have an action of trespass
          against them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Positively. We keep the Sabbath-day holy, by consecrating and
          dedicating' this day to the service of the high God.' It is good to
          rest on the Sabbath-day from the works of our calling; but if we rest
          from labour and do no more, the ox and the ass keep the Sabbath as
          well as we; for they rest from labour. We must dedicate the day to
          God; we must not only keep a Sabbath,' but sanctify' a Sabbath.
          Sabbath-sanctification consists in two things: (1) Solemn preparation
          for it. If a prince were to come to your house, what preparation would
          you make for his entertainment! You would sweep the house, wash the
          floor, adorn the room with the richest tapestry and hangings, that
          there might be something suitable to the state and dignity of so great
          a person. On the blessed Sabbath, God intends to have sweet communion
          with you; he seems to say to you, as Christ to Zacchaeus, Make haste
          and come down, for this day I must abide at thy house.' Luke 19: 5.
          Now, what preparation should you make for entertaining this King of
          glory? When Saturday evening approaches, sound a retreat; call your
          minds off from the world and summon your thoughts together, to think
          of the great work of the approaching day. Purge out all unclean
          affections, which may indispose you for the work of the Sabbath.
          Evening preparation will be like the tuning of an instrument, it will
          fit the heart better for the duties of the ensuing Sabbath.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The sacred observation of it. Rejoice at the approach of the day,
          as a day wherein we have a prize for our souls, and may enjoy much of
          God's presence. John 8: 56. Abraham rejoiced to see my day.' So, when
          we see the light of a Sabbath shine, we should rejoice, and call the
          Sabbath a delight:' this is the queen of days, which God has crowned
          with a blessing. Isa 58: 13. As there was one day in the week on which
          God rained manna twice as much as upon any other day, so he rains down
          the manna of heavenly blessings twice as much on the Sabbath as on any
          other. This is the day wherein Christ carries the soul into the house
          of wine, and displays the banner of love over it; now the dew of the
          Spirit falls on the soul, whereby it is revived and comforted. How
          many may write the Lord's day, the day of their new birth! This day of
          rest is a pledge and earnest of the eternal rest in heaven. Shall we
          not then rejoice at its approach? The day on which the Sun of
          Righteousness shines should be a day of gladness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get up betides on the Sabbath morning. Christ rose early on this day,
          before the sun was up. John 20: 1. Did he rise early to save us, and
          shall not we rise early to worship and glorify him? Early will I seek
          thee.' Psa 63: 1. Can we be up betimes on other days? The husband man
          is early at his slough, the traveller rises early to go his journey,
          and shall not we, who on this day are travelling to heaven? Certainly,
          if we loved God as we should, we should rise on this day betimes, that
          we may meet with him whom our souls love. Such as sit up late at work
          on the night before, are so buried in sleep, that they will hardly be
          up betides on a Sabbath morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Having dressed your bodies, you must dress your souls for hearing
          the word. As the people of Israel were to wash themselves before the
          law was delivered to them, so we must wash and cleanse our souls; and
          that is done by reading, meditation, and prayer. Exod 19: 10.
        </p>
        <p>
          By reading the word. The word is a great means to sanctify the heart,
          and bring it into a Sabbath-frame. Sanctify them through thy truth,'
          &amp;c. John 17: 17. Read not the word carelessly, but with
          seriousness and affection; as the oracle of heaven, the well of
          salvation, the book of life. David, for its preciousness, esteemed it
          above gold; and for its sweetness, above honey. Psa 19: 10. By reading
          the word aright, our hearts, when dull, are quickened; when hard, are
          mollified; when cold and frozen are inflamed; and we can say as the
          disciples, Did not our heart burn within us?' Some step out of their
          bed to hearing. The reason why many get no more good on a Sabbath by
          the word preached, is because they did not breakfast with God in the
          morning by reading his word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meditation. Get upon the mount of meditation, and there converse with
          God. Meditation is the soul's retiring within itself, that, by a
          serious and solemn thinking upon God, the heart may be raised up to
          divine affections. It is a work fit for the morning of a Sabbath.
          Meditate on four things.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) On the works of creation. This is expressed in the commandment.
          |The Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,' &amp;c. The creation is a
          looking glass, in which we see the wisdom and power of God gloriously
          represented. God produced this fair structure of the world without any
          pre-existent matter, and with a word. By the word of the Lord were the
          heavens made.' Psa 33: 6. The disciples wondered that Christ could,
          with a word, calm the sea, but it was far more astounding with a word
          to make the sea. Matt 8: 26. On the Sabbath let us meditate on the
          infiniteness of the Creator. Look up to the firmament and see God's
          wonders in the deep.' Psa 107: 24. Look into the earth, where we may
          behold the nature of minerals, the power of the loadstone, the virtue
          of herbs, and the beauty of flowers. By meditating on these works of
          creation, so curiously embroidered, we shall learn to admire God and
          praise him. O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in wisdom hast thou
          made them all.' Psa 104: 24. By meditating on the works of creation,
          we shall learn to confide in God. He who can create, can provide; he
          that could make us when we were nothing, can raise us when we are low.
          Our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth.' Psa
          124: 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Meditate on God's holiness. Holy and reverend is his name.' Psa
          111: 9. Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil.' Hab 1: 13. God is
          essentially, originally, and efficiently holy. A11 the holiness in men
          and angels is but a crystal stream that runs from this glorious
          fountain. God loves holiness because it is his own image. A king
          cannot but love to see his own effigies stamped on coin. God counts
          holiness his glory, and the most sparkling jewel of his crown.
          Glorious unholiness.' Exod 15: 2: Here is meditation fit for the first
          entrance upon a Sabbath. The contemplation of this would work in us
          such a frame of heart as is suitable to a holy God; it would make us
          reverence his name and hallow his day. While musing; upon the holiness
          of God's nature, we shall begin to be transformed into his likeness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Meditate on Christ's love in redeeming us. Rev 1: 5. Redemption
          exceeds creation; the one is a monument of God's power, the other of
          his love. Here is fit work for a Sabbath. Oh, the infinite stupendous
          love of Christ in raising poor lapsed creatures from a state of guilt
          and damnation! That Christ who was God should die! that this glorious
          Sun of Righteousness should be in an eclipse! We can never admire
          enough this love, no, not in heaven. That Christ should die for
          sinners! not sinful angels, but sinful men. That such clods of earth
          and sin should be made bright stars of glory! Oh, the amazing love of
          Christ! This was Illustre amoris Christi mnemosynum. Brugensis. That
          Christ should not only die for sinners, but die as a sinner! He has
          made him to be sin for us' 2 Cor 5: 21. He who was among the glorious
          persons of the Trinity, was numbered with the transgressors.' Isa 53:
          12. Not that he had sin, but he was like a sinner, having our sins
          imputed to him. Sin did not live in him, but it was laid upon him.
          Here was an hyperbole of love enough to strike us with astonishment.
          That Christ should redeem us, when he could not expect to gain
          anything, or to be advantaged at all by us! Men will not lay out their
          money upon purchase unless it will turn to their profit; but what
          benefit could Christ expect in purchasing and redeeming us? We were in
          such a condition that we could neither deserve nor recompense Christ's
          love. We could not deserve it; for we were in our blood. Ezek 16: 6.
          We had no spiritual beauty to tempt him. Nay, we were not only in our
          blood, but we were in arms against him. When we were enemies, we were
          reconciled to God by the death of his Son;' Rom 5: 10. When he was
          shedding his blood, we were spitting out poison. As we could not
          deserve, so neither could we recompense it. After he had died for us,
          we could not so much as love him, till he made us love him. We could
          give him nothing in lieu of his love. Who has first given to him?' Rom
          11: 35. We were fallen into poverty. If we have any beauty, it is from
          him, It was perfect through my comeliness which I had put upon thee.'
          Ezek 16: 14. If we bring forth any good fruit, it is not of our own
          growth, it comes from him, the true vine. From me is thy fruit found.'
          Hos 14: 8. It was nothing but pure love for Christ to lay out his
          blood to redeem such as he could not expect to be really bettered by.
          That Christ should die so willingly! I lay down my life.' John 10: 17.
          The Jews could not have taken it away if he had not laid it down. He
          could have called to his Father for legions of angels to be his
          life-guard; but what need for even that, when his own Godhead could
          have defended himself from all assaults? He laid down his life. The
          Jews did not so much thirst for his death, as he thirsted for our
          redemption. I have a baptism to be baptised with, and how am I
          straitened till it be accomplished?' Luke 12: 50. He called his
          sufferings a baptism; he was to be baptised and sprinkled with his own
          blood; and he thought the time long before he suffered. To show
          Christ's willingness to die, his sufferings are called an offering.
          Through the offering of the body of Jesus.' Heb 10: 10. His death was
          a free-will offering. That Christ should not grudge nor think much of
          all his sufferings! Though he was scourged and crucified, he was well
          contented with what he had done, and, if it were needful, he would do
          it again. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
          satisfied.' Isa 53: 11. As the mother who has had hard labour, does
          not repent of her pangs when she sees a child brought forth, but is
          well contented; so Christ, though he had hard travail upon the cross,
          does not think much of it; he is not troubled, but thinks his sweat
          and blood well bestowed, because he sees the man-child of redemption
          brought forth into the world. That Christ should make redemption
          effectual to some, and not to others! Here is surprising love. Though
          there is sufficiency in his merits to save all, yet some only partake
          of their saving virtue; all do not believe. There are some of you that
          believe not.' John 6: 64. Christ does not pray for all. John 17: 9.
          Some refuse him. This is the stone which the builders refused.' Psa
          118: 22. Others deride him. Luke 16: 14. Others throw off his yoke. We
          will not have this man to reign over us.' Luke 19: 14. SO that all
          have not the benefit of salvation by him. Herein appears the
          distinguishing love of Christ, that the virtue of his death should
          reach some, and not others. Not many wise men after the flesh, not
          many mighty, not many noble are called.' 1 Cor 1: 26. That Christ
          should pass by many of birth and parts, and that the lot of free grace
          should fall upon thee; that he should sprinkle his blood upon thee;
          Oh, the depth of the love of Christ!' That Christ should love us with
          such a transcendent love! The apostle calls it Love which passeth
          knowledge.' Eph 3: 19. That he should love us more than the angels. He
          loves them as his friends, but believers as his spouse. He loves them
          with such a kind of love as God the Father bears to him. As the Father
          has loved me, so have I loved you.' John 15: 9. Oh, what an hyperbole
          of love does Christ show in redeeming us! That Christ's love in our
          redemption should be everlasting! Having loved his own, he loved them
          unto the end.' John 13: 1. As Christ's love is matchless, so it is
          endless. The flower of his love is sweet; and that which makes it
          sweeter is that it never dies. His love is eternized. Jer 31: 3. He
          will never divorce his elect spouse. The failings of his people cannot
          quite take off his love; they may eclipse it, but not wholly remove
          it; their failings may make Christ angry with them, but not hate them.
          Every failing does not break the marriagebond. Christ's love is not
          like the saint's love. They sometimes have strong affections towards
          him, at other times the fit is off, and they find little or no love
          stirring in them; but it is not so with Christ's love to them, it is a
          love of eternity. When the sunshine of Christ's electing love is once
          risen upon the soul, it never finally sets. Death may take away our
          life from us, but not Christ's love. Behold here a rare subject for
          meditation on a Sabbath morning. The meditation of Christ's wonderful
          love in redeeming us would work in us a Sabbath-frame of heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would melt us in tears for our spiritual unkindness, that we should
          sin against so sweet a Saviour; that we should be no more affected
          with his love, but requite evil for good; that like the Athenians,
          who, notwithstanding all the good service Aristides had done them,
          banished him out of their city, we should banish him from our temple;
          that we should grieve him with our pride, rash anger, unfruitfulness,
          animosities, and strange factions. Have we none to abuse but our
          friend? Have we nothing to kick against but the bowels of our Saviour?
          Did not Christ suffer enough upon the cross, but we must needs make
          him suffer more? Do we give him more gall and vinegar to drink?' Oh,
          if anything can dissolve the heart in sorrow, and melt the eyes to
          tears, it is unkindness offered to Christ. When Peter thought of
          Christ's love to him, how he had made him an apostle, and revealed his
          bosom-secrets to him, and taken him to the mount of transfiguration,
          and yet that he should deny him; it broke his heart with sorrow; he
          went out and wept bitterly.' Matt 26: 75. What a blessed thing is it
          to have the eyes dropping tears on a Sabbath! and nothing would sooner
          fetch tears than to meditate on Christ's love to us, and our
          unkindness to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meditating on a Lord's-day morning on Christ's love, would kindle love
          in our hearts to him. How can we look on his bleeding and dying for us
          and our hearts not be warmed with love to him? Love is the soul of
          religion, the purest affection. It is not rivers of oil, but sparks of
          love that Christ values. And sure, as David said, While I was musing
          the fire burned' (Psa 39: 3), so, while we are musing of Christ's love
          in redeeming us, the fire of our love will burn towards him; and then
          the Christian is in a blessed Sabbath-frame, when, like a seraphim, he
          is burning in love to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) On a Sabbath morning meditate on the glory of heaven. Heaven is
          the extract and essence of happiness. It is called a kingdom. Matt 25:
          34. A kingdom for its riches and magnificence. It is set forth by
          precious stones, and gates of pearl. Rev 21: 19, 21. There is all that
          is truly glorious; transparent light, perfect love, unstained honour,
          unmixed joy; and that which crowns the joy of the celestial paradise
          is eternity. Suppose earthly kingdoms were more glorious than they
          are, their foundations of gold, their walls of pearl, their windows of
          sapphire, yet they are corruptible; but the kingdom of heaven is
          eternal; those rivers of pleasure run for evermore.' Psa 16: 11. That
          wherein the essence of glory consists, and makes heaven to be heaven,
          is the immediate sight and fruition of the blessed God. I shall be
          satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.' Psa 17: 15. Oh, think of
          the Jerusalem above!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is proper for a Sabbath. The meditation of heaven would raise our
          hearts above the world. oh, how would earthly things disappear and
          shrink into nothing, if our minds were mounted above visible things,
          and we had a prospect of glory! How would the meditation of heaven
          make us heavenly in our Sabbath exercises! It would quicken affection,
          would add wings to devotion, and cause us to be in the Spirit on the
          Lord's-day.' Rev 1: 10. How vigorously does he serve God who has a
          crown of glory always in his eye!
        </p>
        <p>
          We dress our souls on a Sabbath-morning by prayer; When thou prayest,
          enter into thy closet,' &amp;c. Matt 6: 6. Prayer sanctifies a
          Sabbath.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The things we should pray for in the morning of the Sabbath. Let
          us beg a blessing upon the word which is to be preached; that it may
          be a savour of life to us; that by it our minds may be more
          illuminated, our corruptions more weakened, and our stock of grace
          more increased. Let us pray that God's special presence may be with
          us, that our hearts may burn within us while God speaks, that we may
          receive the word into meek and humble hearts, and that we may submit
          to it, and bring forth fruits. James 1: 21. Nor should we only pray
          for ourselves, but for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pray for him who dispenses the word; that his tongue may be touched
          with a coal from God's altar; that God would warm his heart who is to
          help to warm others. Your prayers may be a means to quicken the
          minister. Some complain they find no benefit by the word preached;
          perhaps they did not pray for their minister as they should. Prayer is
          like the whetting and sharpening of an instrument, which makes it cut
          better. Pray with and for your family. Yea, pray for all the
          congregations that meet on this day in the fear of the Lord; that the
          dew of the Spirit may fall with the manna of the word; that some souls
          may be converted, and others strengthened; that gospel ordinances may
          be continued, and have no restraint put upon them. These are the
          things we should pray for. The tree of mercy will not drop its fruit,
          useless it be shaken by the hand of prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The manner of our prayer. It is not enough to say a prayer; to
          pray in a dull, cold manner, which asks God to deny; but we must pray
          with reverence, humility, fervency, and hope in God's mercy. Luke 22:
          44. Christ prayed more earnestly. That we may pray with more fervency,
          we must pray with a sense of our wants. He who is pinched with wants,
          will be earnest in craving alms. He prays most fervently who prays
          most feelingly. This is to sanctify the morning of a Sabbath; and it
          is a good preparation for the word preached. When the ground is broken
          up by the slough, it is fit to receive the seed; when the heart has
          been broken by prayer, it is fit to receive the seed of the preached
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Having thus dressed your souls on a morning, for the further
          sanctification of the Sabbath, address yourself to the hearing of the
          preached word.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you sit down in your seat, lift up your eyes to heaven for a
          blessing upon the word to be dispensed; for you must know that the
          word preached does not work as physic, by its own inherent virtue, but
          by a virtue from heaven, and the co-operation of the Holy Ghost.
          Therefore put up a short ejaculatory prayer for a blessing upon the
          word, that it may be made effectual to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word being begun to be preached, hear it with reverence and holy
          attention. A certain woman, named Lydia, attended unto the things
          which were spoken of Paul.' Acts 16: 14. Constantine, the emperor, was
          noted for his reverent attention to the word. Christ taught daily in
          the temple: and all the people were very attentive to hear him.' Luke
          19: 48. In the Greek, they hung upon his lip.' Could we tell men of a
          rich purchase, they would diligently attend; and should they not much
          more, when the gospel of grace is preached unto them? That we may
          sanctify and hallow the Sabbath by attentive hearing, beware of these
          two things in hearing: distraction and drowsiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Distraction. That ye may attend open the Lord without distraction.' 1
          Cor 7: 35. It is said of Bernard, that when he came to the
          church-door, he would say, Stay here all my earthly thoughts.' So
          should we say to ourselves, when we are at the door of God's house,
          Stay here all my worldly cares and wandering cogitations; I am now
          going to hear what the Lord will say to me.' Distraction hinders
          devotion. The mind is tossed with vain thoughts, and diverted from the
          business in hand. It is hard to make a quicksilver heart fix. Jerome
          complains of himself, Sometimes when I am about God's service, per
          porticus diambulo, I am walking in the galleries, and sometimes
          casting up accounts.' How often in hearing the word, the thoughts
          dance up and down; and, when the eye is upon the minister, the mind is
          upon other things. Distracted hearing is far from sanctifying the
          Sabbath. It is very sinful to give way to vain thoughts at this time;
          because, when we are hearing the word, we are in God's special
          presence. To do any treasonable action in the king's presence is high
          great impudence. Yea, in my house have I found their wickedness.' Jer
          23: 11. So the Lord may say, In my house, while they are hearing my
          word, I have found wickedness; they have wanton eyes, and their soul
          is set on vanity.'
        </p>
        <p>Whence do these roving and distracting thoughts in hearing come?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Partly from Satan. The devil is sure to be present in our
          assemblies. If he cannot hinder us from hearing, he will hinder us in
          hearing. When the sons of God came to present themselves before the
          Lord, Satan came also among them.' Job 1: 6. The devil sets vain
          objects before the fancy to cause a diversion. His great design is to
          render the word fruitless. As when one is writing, another jogs him
          that he cannot write even, so when we are hearing, the devil will be
          jogging us with a temptation, that we should not attend to the word
          preached. He shewed me Joshua the high-priest standing before the
          angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist
          him.' Zech 3: 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) These wandering thoughts in hearing come partly from ourselves. We
          must not lay all the blame upon Satan.
        </p>
        <p>
          They come from the eye. A wandering eye causes wandering thoughts. As
          a thief may come into the house at a window, so vain thoughts may be
          at the eye. As we are bid to keep our feet when we enter into the
          house of God (Eccl 5: 1), so we had need make a covenant with our
          eyes, that we be not distracted by beholding other objects. Job 31: 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wandering thoughts in hearing rise out of the heart. These sparks come
          out of our own furnace. Vain thoughts are the mud which the heart, as
          from a troubled sea, casts up. For from within, out of the heart of
          men, proceed evil thoughts.' Mark 7: 21. As the foulness of the
          stomach sends up fumes into the head, so the corruption of the heart
          sends up evil thoughts into the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Distracted thoughts in hearing proceed from an evil habit. We inure
          ourselves to vain thoughts at other times, and therefore we cannot
          hinder them on a Sabbath. Habit is a second nature. Can the Ethiopian
          change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good
          that are accustomed to do evil?' Jer 13: 23. He that is used to bad
          company, knows not how to leave it; so such as have vain thoughts to
          keep them company all the week, know not how to get rid of them on the
          Sabbath. Let me show you how evil these vain distracting thoughts in
          hearing are: --
        </p>
        <p>
          To have the heart distracted in hearing, is a disrespect to God's
          omniscience. God is an all-seeing Spirit; and thoughts speak louder in
          his ears than words do in ours. He declareth unto man what is his
          thought.' Amos 4: 13. To make no conscience of wandering thoughts in
          hearing, is an affront to God's omniscience, as if he knew not our
          heart, or did not hear the language of our thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          To give way to wandering thoughts in hearing is hypocrisy. We pretend
          to hear what God says, and our minds are quite upon another thing. We
          present God with our bodies, but do not give him our hearts. Hos 7:
          11. This hypocrisy God complains of. This people draw near me with
          their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their
          hearts far from me.' Isa 29: 13. This is to prevaricate and deal
          falsely with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vain thoughts in hearing discover much want of love to God. Did we
          love him we should listen to his words as oracles, and write them upon
          the table of our heart. Prov 3: 3. When a friend whom we love speaks
          to us, and gives us advice, we attend with seriousness, and suck in
          every word. Giving our thoughts leave to ramble in holy duties, shows
          a great defect in our love to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vain impertinent thoughts in hearing defile an ordinance. They are as
          dead flies in the box of ointment. When a string of a lute is out of
          tune, it spoils the music; so distraction of thought puts the mind out
          of tune, and makes our services sound harsh and unpleasant. Wandering
          thoughts poison a duty, and turn it into sin. Let his prayer become
          sin.' Psa 109: 7. What can be worse than to have a man's praying and
          hearing of the word become sin? Would it not be sad, if the meat we
          eat should increase bad humours? How much more when hearing the word,
          which is the food of the soul, is turned into sin!
        </p>
        <p>
          Vain thoughts in hearing offend God. If the king were speaking to one
          of his subjects, and he should not give heed to what the king says,
          but be thinking on another business, or playing with a feather, would
          not the king be provoked? So, when we are in God's presence, and he is
          speaking to us in his word, and we mind not much what he says, but our
          hearts go after covetousness, will it not offend God to be thus
          slighted? Ezek 33: 31. He has pronounced a curse upon such. Cursed be
          the deceiver, which has in his flock a male, and sacrificeth unto the
          Lord a corrupt thing.' Mal 1: 14. To have strong lively affections is
          to have a male in the flock; but to hear the word with distraction, is
          to give God duties fly-blown with vain thoughts, and to offer to the
          Lord a corrupt thing, which brings a curse. Cursed be the deceiver.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Vain thoughts in hearing, when allowed and not resisted, make way for
          hardening the heart. A stone in the heart is worse than in the
          kidneys. Distracted thoughts in hearing do not better the heart, but
          harden it. Vain thoughts take away the holy awe of God which should be
          upon the heart; they make conscience less tender, and hinder the
          efficacy the word should have upon the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vain and distracting thoughts rob us of the comfort of an ordinance. A
          gracious soul often meets with God in the sanctuary, and can say, I
          found him whom my soul loveth.' Cant 3: 4. He is like Jonathan, who,
          when he had tasted the honey on the rod, had his eyes enlightened. But
          vain thoughts hinder the comfort of an ordinance, as a black cloud
          hides the warm comfortable beams of the sun. Will God speak peace to
          us when our minds are wandering and our thoughts are travelling to the
          ends of the earth? Prov 17: 24. If ever you would hear the word with
          attention, do as Abraham when he drove away the fowls from the
          sacrifice. Gen 15: 2. When you find these excursions and sinful
          wanderings in hearing, labour to drive away the fowls; get rid of
          these vain thoughts; they are vagrants, and must not be entertained.
        </p>
        <p>How shall we get rid of these vagabond thoughts?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Pray and watch against them. (2) Let the sense of God's omniscient
          eye overawe your hearts. The servant will not sport in his master's
          presence. (3) Labour for a holy frame of heart. Were the heart more
          spiritual, the mind would be less feathery. (4) Bring more love to the
          word. We fix our minds upon that which we love. He that loves his
          pleasures and recreations, fixes his mind upon them, and can follow
          them without distraction. Were our love more set upon the preached
          word, our minds would be more fixed upon it; and surely there is
          enough to make us love the word preached; for it is the word of life,
          the inlet to knowledge, the antidote against sin, the quickener of all
          holy affections. It is the true manna, which has all sorts of sweet
          tastes in it; the pool of Bethesda, in which the rivers of life spring
          forth to heal the broken in heart; and a sovereign elixir or cordial
          to revive the sorrowful spirit. Get love to the word preached, and you
          will not be so distracted in hearing. What the heart delights in, the
          thoughts dwell upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take heed of drowsiness in hearing. Drowsiness shows much irreverence.
          How lively are many when they are about the world, but in the worship
          of God how drowsy, as if the devil had given them opium to make them
          sleep! A drowsy feeling here is very sinful. Are you not in prayer
          asking pardon of sin? Will the prisoner fall asleep when he is begging
          pardon? In the preaching of the word, is not the bread of life broken
          to you? and will a man fall asleep over his food? Which is worse, to
          stay from a sermon, or sleep at a sermon? While you slept, perhaps the
          truth was delivered which might have converted your souls. Besides,
          sleeping is very offensive in a holy assembly; it not only grieves the
          Spirit of God, but makes the hearts of the righteous sad. Ezek 13: 22.
          It troubles them to see any show such contempt of God and his worship;
          to see them busy in the shop, but drowsy in the temple. Therefore, as
          Christ said, Could ye not watch one hour?' so, can ye not wake one
          hour? Matt 26: 40. I deny not but a child of God may sometimes,
          through weakness and indisposition of body, drop asleep at a sermon,
          but not voluntarily or ordinarily. The sun may be in an eclipse, but
          not often. If sleeping be customary and allowed, it is a very bad
          sign, and a profanation of the ordinance. A good remedy against
          drowsiness is to use a spare diet upon the Sabbath. Such as indulge
          their appetite too much on a Sabbath, are fitter to sleep on a couch
          than pray in the temple. That you may throw off distracting thoughts
          and drowsiness on the Lord's-day, and may hear the word with reverend
          attention, consider --
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) It is God that speaks to us in his word; therefore the preaching
          of the word is called the breath of his lips.' Isa 11: 4. Christ is
          said now to speak to us from heaven,' as a king speaks in his
          ambassador. Heb 12: 25. Ministers are but pipes and organs, it is the
          Spirit of the living God that breathes in them. When we come to the
          word, we should think within ourselves, God is speaking in this
          preacher. The Thessalonians heard the word Paul preached, as if God
          himself had spoken unto them. When ye received the word of God, which
          ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is
          in truth) the word of God.' 1 Thess 2: 13. When Samuel knew it was the
          Lord that spake to him, he lent his ear.1 Sam 3: 10. If we do not
          regard God when he speaks to us, he will not regard us when we pray to
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Consider how serious and weighty the matters delivered to us are.
          Moses said, I call heaven and earth to record this day, that I have
          set before you life and death.' Deut 30: 19. Can men be regardless of
          the word, or drowsy when the weighty matters of eternity are set
          before them? We preach faith, and holiness of life, and the day of
          judgement and eternal retribution. Here life and death are set before
          you; and does not all this call for serious attention? If a letter
          were read to one of special business, wherein his life and estate were
          concerned, would he not be very serious in listening to it? In the
          preaching of the word your salvation is concerned; and if ever you
          would attend, it should be now. It is not a vain thing for you;
          because it is your life.' Deut 32: 47.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) To give way to vain thoughts and drowsiness in hearing, gratifies
          Satan. He knows that not to mind a duty, is all one in religion as not
          to do it. What the heart does not do, is not done.' Therefore Christ
          says of some, Hearing, they hear not.' Matt 13: 13. How could that be?
          Because, though the word sounded in their ear, yet they minded not
          what was said to them, their thoughts were upon other things;
          therefore, it was all as one as if they did not hear. Does it not
          please Satan to see men come to the word, and as good stay away? They
          are haunted with vain thoughts; they are taken off from the duty while
          they are in it; their body is in the assembly, their heart in their
          shop. Hearing, they hear not.'
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Each Sabbath may be the last we shall ever keep; we may go from
          the place of hearing to the place of judging; and shall not we give
          reverend attention to the word? Did we think when we come into God's
          house Perhaps this will be the last time that ever God will counsel us
          about our souls, and before another sermon death's alarm will sound in
          our ears; with what attention and devotion should we feel, and our
          affections would be all on fire in hearing!
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) You must give an account for every sermon you hear. Redde
          rationem: Give an account of thy stewardship.' Luke 16: 2. So will God
          say, Give an account of thy hearing. Hast thou been affected with the
          word? Hast thou profited by it?' How can we give a good account, if we
          have been distracted in hearing, and have not taken notice of what has
          been said to us? The judge to whom we must give an account is God.
          Were we to give account to man, we might falsify accounts; but we must
          give an account to God. Nec donis corrumpitur, nec blanditiis
          fallitur. Bernard. He is so just a God that he cannot be bribed, and
          so wise that he cannot be deceived.' Therefore, having to give an
          account to such an impartial Judge, how should we observe every word
          preached, remembering the account! Let all this make us shake off
          distraction and drowsiness in hearing, and have our ears chained to
          the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. IN order to hear the word aright, let the following things be
          attended to: --
        </p>
        <p>
          Lay aside those dispositions which may render the preached word
          ineffectual. As,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Curiosity. Some go to hear the word preached, not so much to get
          grace, as to enrich themselves with notions: having itching ears.' 2
          Tim 4: 3. Augustine confesses that, before his conversion, he went to
          hear Ambrose for his eloquence rather than for the spirituality of the
          matter. Thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that has a
          pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument.' Ezek 33: 32. Many
          go to the word to feast their ears only; they like the melody of the
          voice, the mellifluous sweetness of the expression, and the novelty of
          the opinions. Acts 17: 21. This is to love the garnishing of the dish
          more than the food; it is to desire to be pleased rather than edified.
          Like a woman that paints her face, but neglects her health -- they
          paint and adorn themselves with curious speculations, but neglect
          their soul's health. This hearing neither sanctifies the heart nor the
          Sabbath.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Lay aside prejudice. Prejudice is sometimes against the truths
          preached. The Sadducees were prejudiced against the doctrine of the
          resurrection. Luke 20: 27. Sometimes prejudice is against the person
          preaching. There is one Micaiah, by whom we may inquire of the Lord,
          but I hate him.' 1 Kings 22: 8. This hinders the power of the word. If
          a patient has an ill opinion of his physician, he will not take any of
          his medicines, however good they may be. Prejudice in the mind is like
          an obstruction in the stomach, which hinders the nutritive virtue of
          the meat. It poisons the word, and causes it to lose its efficacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Lay aside covetousness. Covetousness is not only getting worlds
          gain unjustly, but loving it inordinately. This is a great hindrance
          to the preached word. The seed which fell among thorns was choked,
          Matt 13: 22; a fit emblem of the word when preached to a covetous
          hearer. The covetous man is thinking on the world when he is hearing;
          his heart is in his shop. They sit before thee as my people, and they
          hear thy words, but their heart goes after their covetousness.' Ezek
          33: 31. A covetous hearer derides the word. The Pharisees, who were
          covetous, heard all these things, and they derided him.' Luke 16: 14.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Lay aside partiality. Partiality in hearing is, when we like to
          hear some truths preached, but not all. We love to hear of heaven, but
          not of self-denial; of reigning with Christ, but not of suffering with
          him; of the more facile duties of religion, but not those which are
          more knotty and difficult; as mortification, laying the axe to the
          root, and hewing down our beloved sin. Speak smooth things' (Isa 30:
          10), such as may not grate upon the conscience. Many like to hear of
          the love of Christ, but not of loving their enemies; they like the
          comforts of the word, but not its reproofs. Herod heard John the
          Baptist gladly; he liked many truths, but not when he spake against
          his incest.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) Lay aside censoriousness. Some, instead of judging themselves for
          sin, sit as judges upon the preacher; his sermon had either too much
          gall in it, or it was too long. They would sooner censure a sermon
          than practice it. God will judge the judger. Matt 7: 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) Lay aside disobedience. All day long I have stretched forth my
          hands unto a disobedient people.' Rom 10: 21. It is said of the Jews
          that God stretched out his hands in the preaching of the word, but
          they rejected Christ. Let there be none among you that wilfully refuse
          the counsels of the word. It is sad to have an adder's ear and an
          adamant heart. Zech 7: 11, 12. If, when God speaks to us in his word,
          we are deaf, when we speak to him in prayer, he will be dumb.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would hear the word aright, have good ends in hearing. Come to
          the word to be made better.' Some have no other end in hearing but
          because it is in fashion, or to gain repute, or stop the mouth of
          conscience; but come to the word to be made more holy. There is a
          great difference between one who goes to a garden for flowers to wear
          in her bosom, and another that goes for flowers to make syrups and
          medicines. We should go to the word for medicine to cure us; as Naaman
          the Syrian went to Jordan to be healed of his leprosy. Desire the
          sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.' 1 Pet 2: 2. Go to
          the word to be changed into its similitude. As the seal leaves its
          print upon the wax, so labour that the word preached may leave the
          print of its own holiness upon your heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Labour that the word' may have such a virtue in you, as the water of
          jealousy, to kill and make fruitful; that it may kill your sins, and
          make your souls fruitful in grace. Numb 5: 27.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would hear the word aright, go to it with delight. The word
          preached is a feast of fat things. With what delight do men go to a
          feast! The word preached anoints the blind eye; mollifies the rocky
          heart; it beats off our fetters, and turns us from the power of Satan
          unto God.' Acts 26: 18. The word is the seed of regeneration, and the
          engine of salvation. James 1: 18. Hear the word with delight and
          complacency. Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word
          was the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.' Jer 15: 16. How sweet are
          thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.' Psa
          119: 103. Love the word that comes most home to the conscience; bless
          God when your corruptions have been met with, when the sword of the
          Spirit has divided between you and your sins. Who cares for the physic
          which will not work?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would hear the word aright, mix it with faith. Believe the
          truth of the word preached, that it is the word by which you must be
          judged. Not only give credence to the word preached, but apply it to
          your own souls. Faith digests the word, and turns it into spiritual
          nourishment. Many hear the word, but it may be said of them, as in Psa
          106: 24 They believed not his word.' As Melanchthon once said to some
          Italians Ye Italians worship God in the bread, when ye do not believe
          him to be in heaven;' so, many hear God's words, but do not believe
          that God is; they question the truth of his oracles. If we do not mix
          faith with the word, it is like leaving out the chief ingredient in a
          medicine, which makes it ineffectual. Unbelief hardens men's hearts
          against the word. Divers were hardened, and believed not.' Acts 19: 9.
          Men hear many truths delivered concerning the preciousness of Christ,
          the beauty of holiness, and the felicity of a glorified estate; but,
          if through unbelief and atheism, they question these truths, we may as
          well speak to stones and pillars of the church as to them. That word
          which is not believed, can never be practised. Ubi male creditur, ibi
          nec bene vivitur [When belief is unstable, conduct also wavers].
          Jerome. Unbelief makes the word preached of no effect. The word
          preached did not profit, not being mixed with faith in them that heard
          it.' Heb 4: 2. The word to an unbeliever is like a cordial put into a
          dead man's mouth, which loses all its virtue. If there be any
          unbelievers in our congregations, what shall ministers say of them to
          God at the last day? Lord, we have preached to the people thou sentest
          us to, we have showed them our commission, we have declared unto them
          thy whole counsel, but they have not believed a word we spake. We told
          them what would be the fruit of sin, but they would not heed. They
          would drink their sugared draught, though there was death in the cup.
          Lord, we are free from their blood. God forbid that ministers should
          ever have to make this report to him of their people. But this they
          will be forced to do if their hearers live and die in unbelief. Would
          you sanctify a Sabbath by hearing the word aright? Hear it with faith.
          The apostle puts the two together, belief and salvation.' We are of
          them that believe to the saving of the soul.' Heb 10: 39.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would hear the word aright, hear it with meek spirits. James 1:
          21. Receive the word in mansuetudine, with meekness'. Meekness is a
          submissive frame of heart to the word. Contrary to this meekness is
          fierceness of spirit, when men rise up in rage against the word; as if
          the patient should be angry with the physician when he gives him a
          medicine to purge out his bad humours. When they heard these things,
          they were cut to the heart, and gnashed on him [Stephen] with their
          teeth.' Acts 7: 54. Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a
          prison house.' 2 Chron 16: 10. Pride and guilt make men fret at the
          word. What made Asa enraged but pride? He was a king, and thought he
          was too good to be told of his sin. What made Cain angry when God said
          to him, Where is Abel, thy brother?' He replied, Am I my brother's
          keeper?' What made him so touchy but guilt? He had imbrued his hands
          in his brother's blood. If you would hear the word aright, lay aside
          your passions. Receive the word with meekness;' get humble hearts to
          submit to the truths delivered. God takes the meek person for his
          scholar. The meek will he teach his way.' Psa 25: 9. Meekness makes
          the word preached to be an ingrafted word.' James 1: 21. A good scion
          grafted in a bad stock changes the nature of it, and makes it bear
          good and generous fruit; so, when the word preached is grafted into
          men's hearts, it sanctifies them and makes them bring forth the sweet
          fruits of righteousness. By meekness it becomes an ingrafted word.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would hear the word aright, be not only attentive, but
          retentive. Lay it up in your memories and hearts. The seed on the good
          ground are they, which, having heard the word, keep it.' Luke 8: 15.
          The Greek word for to keep,' signifies to hold the word fast, that it
          does not run from us. If the seed be not kept in the ground, but is
          presently washed away, it is sown to little purpose; so if the word
          preached be not kept in your memories and hearts, it is preached in
          vain. Many persons have memories like leaky vessels. If the word goes
          out as fast as it comes in, how can it profit? If a treasure be put in
          a chest and the chest be not locked, it may easily be taken out; so a
          bad memory is a chest without a lock, out of which the devil can
          easily take all the treasure. Then comes the devil and taketh away the
          word out of their hearts.' Luke 8: 12. Labour to keep in memory the
          truths you hear. The things we esteem are not easily forgotten. Can a
          maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire?' Jer 2: 32. Did we
          prize the word more, we should not forget it so soon. If meat does not
          stay in the stomach, but rises up as fast as we eat it, it cannot
          nourish; so, if the word stays not in the memory, but is presently
          gone, it can do the soul but little good.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would hear aright, practice what you hear. Practice is the life
          of all. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have
          right to the tree of life.' Rev 22: 14. Hearing only will be no plea
          at the day of judgement -- merely to say, Lord, I have heard many
          sermons.' God will say, What fruits of obedience have ye brought
          forth?' The word preached is not only to inform you but reform you;
          not only to mend your sight, but to mend your pace in the way to
          heaven. A good hearer opens and shuts to God as the heliotrope to the
          sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) If you do not hear the word to practice it, you lose all your
          labour. How many a weary step have you taken, your body has been
          crowded, and your spirit faint, if you are not bettered by hearing! If
          you are as proud, as vain, and as earthly as ever, all your hearing is
          lost. You would be loath to trade in vain, and why not to hear sermons
          in vain? Why then labour I in vain?' Job 9: 29. Put this question to
          your own soul: Why labour I in vain? Why do I take all these pains to
          hear, and yet have not grace to practice it? I am as bad as ever! Why
          then do I labour in vain?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) If you hear the word, and are not bettered by it, you are like the
          salamander, no hotter in the fire; and your hearing will increase your
          condemnation. That servant which knew his lord's will, neither did
          according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.' Luke 12:
          47. We pity such as know not where to hear; it will be worse with such
          as care not how they hear. To graceless disobedient hearers, every
          sermon will be a faggot to heat hell. It is sad to go loaded to hell
          with ordinances. Oh, beg the Spirit to make the word preached
          effectual! Ministers can but speak to the ear, the Spirit speaks to
          the heart. While Peter spake, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which
          heard the word.' Acts 10: 44.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having heard the word in a holy and spiritual manner, for the further
          sanctification of the Sabbath, confer with the word. We are forbidden
          on this day to speak our own words, but we must speak of God's word.
          Isa 58: 13. Speak of the sermons as you sit together; which is one
          part of sanctifying the Sabbath. Good discourse brings holy truths
          into our memories, and fastens them upon our hearts. Then they that
          feared the Lord, spake often one to another.' Mal 3: 16. There is
          great power and efficacy in good discourse. How forcible are right
          words!' Job 6: 25. By holy conference on a Sabbath, one Christian
          helps to warm another when he is frozen, and to strengthen another
          when he is weak. Latimer confessed he was much furthered in religion
          by having conference with Mr. Bilney the martyr. My tongue shall speak
          of thy word.' Psa 119: 172. One reason why preaching the word on a
          Sabbath does no more good is because there is so little good
          conference. Few speak of the word they have heard, as if sermons were
          such secrets that they must not be spoken of again, or as if it were a
          shame to speak of that which will save us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Close the Sabbath evening with repetition, reading, singing Psalms,
          and prayer. Ask that God would bless the word you have heard. Could we
          but thus spend a Sabbath, we might be in the Spirit on the
          Lord's-day,' our souls would be nourished and comforted; and the
          Sabbaths we now keep, would be earnests of the everlasting Sabbaths
          which we shall celebrate in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. See here the Christian's duty, to keep the Sabbath-day holy.'
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The whole Sabbath is to be dedicated to God. It is not said, Keep
          a part of the Sabbath holy, but the whole day must be religiously
          observed. If God has given us six days, and taken but one to himself,
          shall we grudge him any part of that day? It were sacrilege. The Jews
          kept a whole day to the Lord; and we are not to abridge or curtail the
          Sabbath, as Augustine says, more than the Jews did. The very heathen,
          by the light of nature, set apart a whole day in honour of false gods;
          and Scaevola, a high-priest of theirs, affirms that the wilful
          transgression of that day could have no expiation or pardon. If any
          one robs any part of the Christian Sabbath for servile work or
          recreation, Scaevola, the high priest of the heathenish gods, shall
          rise up in judgement to condemn him. Let those who say, that to keep a
          whole Sabbath is too Judaical, show where God has made any abatement
          of the time of worship; where he has said, you shall keep but a part
          of the Sabbath; and if they cannot show that, it robs God of his due.
          That a whole day be designed and set apart for his special worship, is
          a perpetual statute, while the church remains upon the earth, as Peter
          Martyr says. Of this opinion also were Theodore, Augustine, Irenaeus,
          and the chief of the fathers.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) As the whole Sabbath is to be dedicated to God, so it must be kept
          holy. You have seen the manner of sanctifying the Lord's-day by
          reading, meditation, prayer, hearing the word, and by singing of
          psalms to make melody to the Lord. Now, besides what I have said upon
          keeping this day holy, let me make a short comment or paraphrase on
          that Scripture. If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from
          doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the
          holy of the Lord, honourable: and shalt honour him, not doing thine
          own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own
          words.' Isa 58: 13. Here is a description of rightly sanctifying a
          Sabbath.
        </p>
        <p>
          If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath.' This may be understood
          either literally or spiritually. Literally, that is, if thou
          withdrawest thy foot from taking long walks or journeys on the
          Sabbath-day. So the Jewish doctors expound it. Or, spiritually, if
          thou turn away thy affections (the feet of thy soul) from inclining to
          any worldly business.
        </p>
        <p>
          From doing thy pleasure on my holy day.' That is, thou must not do
          that which may please the carnal part, as in sports and pastimes. This
          is to do the devil's work on God's day.
        </p>
        <p>
          And call the Sabbath a delight.' Call it a delight, that is, esteem it
          so. Though the Sabbath be not a day for carnal pleasure, yet holy
          pleasure is not forbidden. The soul must take pleasure in the duties
          of a Sabbath. The saints of old counted the Sabbath a delight: the
          Jews called the Sabbath dies lucis, a day of light. The Lord's day, on
          which the Sun of Righteousness shines, is both a day of light and
          delight. This is the day of sweet intercourse between God and the
          soul. On this day a Christian makes his sallies out to heaven; his
          soul is lifted above the earth; and can this be without delight? The
          higher the bird flies, the sweeter it sings. On the Sabbath the soul
          fixes its love on God; and where love is, there is delight. On this
          day the believer's heart is melted, quickened, and enlarged in holy
          duties; and how can all this be, and not a secret delight go along
          with it? On a Sabbath a gracious soul can say, I sat down under his
          shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.' Cant
          2: 3. How can a spiritual heart choose but call the Sabbath a delight?
          Is it not delightful to a queen to be putting on her wedding robes in
          which she shall meet the king her bridegroom? When we are about
          Sabbath exercises, we are dressing ourselves, and putting on our
          wedding robes in which we are to meet our heavenly bridegroom the Lord
          Jesus; and is not this delightful? On the Sabbath God makes a feast of
          fat things; he feasts the ear with his word, and the heart with his
          grace. Well then may we call the Sabbath a delight. To find this holy
          delight, is to be in the Spirit on the Lord's-day.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The holy of the Lord, honourable.' In the Hebrew, it is glorious. To
          call the Sabbath honourable, is not to be understood so much of an
          outward honour given to it, by wearing richer apparel, or having
          better diet on this day, as the Jewish doctors corruptly gloss. This
          is the chief honour that some give to this day; but by calling the
          Sabbath honourable, is meant that honour of the heart which we give to
          the day, reverencing it, and esteeming it as the queen of days. We are
          to count the Sabbath honourable, because God has honoured it. All the
          persons in the Trinity have honoured it. God the Father blessed it,
          God the Son rose upon it, God the Holy Ghost descended on it. Acts 2:
          1: This day is to be honoured by all good Christians, and had in high
          veneration. It is a day of renown, on which a golden sceptre of mercy
          is held forth. The Christian Sabbath is the very crepusculum and
          dawning of the heavenly Sabbath. It is honourable, because on this day
          God comes down to us and visits us.' To have the King of heaven
          present in a special manner in our assemblies, makes the Sabbath-day
          honourable. Besides, the work done on this day makes it honourable.
          The six days are filled up with servile work, which makes them lose
          much of their glory; but on this day sacred work is done. The soul is
          employed wholly about the worship of God; it is praying, hearing,
          meditating; it is doing angels' work, praising, and blessing God.
          Again, the day is honourable by virtue of a divine institution. Silver
          is of itself valuable; but when the royal stamp is put upon it, it is
          honourable; so God has put a sacred stamp upon this day, the stamp of
          divine authority, and the stamp of divine benediction. This makes it
          honourable; and this is sanctifying the Sabbath, to call it a delight,
          and honourable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not doing thine own ways.' That is, thou shalt not defile the day by
          doing any servile work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor finding thine own pleasure.' That is, not gratifying the fleshly
          part by walks, visits, or pastimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor speaking thine own Words.' That is, words heterogeneous and
          unsuitable for a Sabbath; vain, impertinent words; discourses of
          worldly affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. If the Sabbath-day is to be kept holy, they are reproved who,
          instead of sanctifying the Sabbath, profane it. They take the time
          which should be dedicated wholly to God, and spend it in the service
          of the devil and their lusts. The Lord has set apart this day for his
          own worship, and they make it common. He has set a hedge about this
          commandment, saying, Remember;' and they break this hedge; but he who
          breaks this hedge, a serpent shall bite him. Eccl 10: 8. The Sabbath
          day in England lies bleeding; and oh! that our parliament would pour
          some balm into the wounds which it has received! How is this day
          profaned, by sitting idle at home, by selling meat, by vain discourse,
          by sinful visits, by walking in the fields, and by sports! The people
          of Israel might not gather manna on the Sabbath, and may we use sports
          and dancings on this day? Truly it should be matter of grief to us to
          see so much Sabbath-profanation. When one of Darius's eunuchs saw
          Alexander setting his feet on a rich table of Darius's, he wept.
          Alexander asked him why he wept? He said it was to see the table which
          his master so highly esteemed now made a footstool. So may we weep to
          see the Sabbath-day, which God highly esteems, and has honoured and
          blessed, made a footstool, and trampled upon by the feet of sinners.
          To profane the Sabbath is a great sin; it is a wilful contempt of God;
          it is not only casting his law behind our back, but trampling it under
          foot. He says, Keep the Sabbath holy;' but men pollute it. This is to
          despise God, to hang out the flag of defiance, to throw down the
          gauntlet, and challenge God himself. Now, how can God endure to be
          thus saucily confronted by proud dust? Surely he will not suffer this
          high impudence to go unpunished. God's curse will come upon the
          Sabbath-breaker; and it will blast where it comes. The law of the land
          lets Sabbath-breakers alone, but God will not. No sooner did Christ
          curse the fig-tree, but it withered. God will take the matter into his
          own hand; he will see after the punishing of Sabbath violation. And
          how does he punish it?
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) With spiritual plagues. He gives up Sabbath profaners to hardness
          of heart, and a scared conscience. Spiritual judgements are sorest. So
          I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust.' Psa 81: 12. A sear in the
          conscience is a brand-mark of reprobation.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) God punishes this sin by giving men up to commit other sins. To
          revenge the breaking of his Sabbath, he suffers them to break open
          houses, and so come to be punished by the magistrate. How many such
          confessions have we heard from thieves going to be executed! They
          never regarded the Sabbath, and God suffered them to commit those sins
          for which they are to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) God punishes Sabbath-breaking by sudden visible judgements on men
          for this sin. He punishes them in their estates and in their persons.
          While a certain man was carrying corn into his barn on the Lord's-day,
          both house and corn were consumed with fire from heaven. In Wiltshire
          there was a dancing match appointed upon the Lord's-day; and while one
          of the company was dancing, he suddenly fell down dead. The Theatre of
          God's Judgements' relates of one, who used every Lord's-day to hunt in
          sermon-time, who had a child by his wife with a head like a dog, and
          it cried like a hound. His sin was monstrous, and it was punished with
          a monstrous birth. The Lord threatened the Jews, that if they would
          not hallow the Sabbath-day, he would kindle a fire in their gates. Jer
          17: 27. The dreadful fire which broke out in London began on the
          Sabbath-day; as if God would tell us from heaven he was then punishing
          us for our Sabbath profanation. Nor does he punish it only in this
          life with death, but hereafter with damnation. Let such as break God's
          Sabbath see if they can break those chains of darkness in which they
          and the devils shall be held.
        </p>
        <p>Use three. It exhorts us to Sabbath holiness.</p>
        <p>
          Make conscience of keeping this day holy. The other commandments have
          an affirmative in them only, or a negative; this fourth commandment
          has both an affirmative in it and a negative. Thou shalt keep the
          Sabbath day holy,' and, thou shalt not do any manner of work in it,'
          shows how carefully God would have us observe this day. Not only must
          you keep this day yourselves, but have a care that all under your
          charge keep it; Thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy
          man-servant, and thy maidservant;' that is, thou who art a superior, a
          parent or a master, thou must have a care that not only thou thyself,
          but those who are under thy trust and tuition, sanctify the day. Those
          masters of families are to blame who are careful that their servants
          serve them, but have no care that they serve God; who care not though
          their servants should serve the devil, so long as their bodies do them
          service. That which Paul says to Timothy, Serva depositum, That good
          thing, which was committed unto thee, keep,' is of large meaning.1 Tim
          1: 11. Not only have a care of thy own soul, but have a care of the
          souls thou art entrusted with. See that they who are under thy charge
          sanctify the Sabbath. God's law provided, that if a man met with an ox
          or an ass going astray, he should bring him back again; much more,
          when thou sees the soul of thy child or servant going astray from God,
          and breaking his Sabbath, thou shouldest bring him back again to a
          religious observation of this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          That I may press you to Sabbath-sanctification, consider what great
          blessings God has promised to the strict observers of this day. Isa
          58: 14. (1) A promise of joy. Then shalt thou delight thyself in the
          Lord.' Delighting in God is both a duty and a reward. In this text it
          is a reward, Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord;' as if God
          had said, If thou keep the Sabbath conscientiously, I will give thee
          that which will fill thee with delight; if thou keep the Sabbath
          willingly, I will make thee keep it joyfully. I will give thee those
          enlargements in duty, and that inward comfort, which shall abundantly
          satisfy thee; thy soul shall overflow with such a stream of joy, that
          thou shalt say, Lord, in keeping thy Sabbath there is great reward.
          (2) Of honour. And I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of
          the earth.' That is, I will advance thee to honour, ascendere faciam;
          so Munster interprets it. Some, by the high places of the earth,
          understand Judea; so Grotius. I will bring thee into the land of
          Judea, which is situated higher than the other countries adjacent. (3)
          Of earth and heaven. And I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob;'
          that is, I will feed thee with all the delicious things of Canaan, and
          afterwards I will translate thee to heaven, whereof Canaan was but a
          type. Another promise is, Blessed is the man that does this, that
          keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it.' Isa 56: 2. Blessed is the
          man;' in the Hebrew it is, blessednesses.' To him that keeps the
          Sabbath holy, here is blessedness upon blessedness belonging to him;
          he shall be blessed with the upper and nether springs; he shall be
          blessed in his name, estate, soul, progeny. Who would not keep the
          Sabbath from polluting it that shall have so many blessings entailed
          upon him and his posterity after him? Again, a conscientious keeping
          of the Sabbath seasons the heart for God's service all the week after.
          Christian the more holy thou art on a Sabbath, the more holy thou wilt
          be on the week following.
