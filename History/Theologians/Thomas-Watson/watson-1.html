<p align="center"><b>A Treatise Concerning Meditation</b></p>
<p align="center">By Thomas Watson<font color="#ff0000"><b> <br/>

 </b></font></p>
<p align="justify">"His delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he

    <b>meditates </b>day and night." Psalm 1:2</p>
<p align="justify">Having led you through the <i>Chamber of Delight</i> in 

    my previous discourse, I will now bring you into the <i>Withdrawing Room of 

    Meditation</i>. "On His law he <i>meditates</i><b> </b>day and night."<br/>

 </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b><i>
<p align="justify">I. The opening of the Words, and the Proposition asserted</p></i>.
</b></font><i>
<p align="justify">Grace </p></i>breeds <i>delight </i>in God, and delight 

    breeds <i>meditation</i>. Meditation is a duty wherein consists the 

    essentials of religion, and which nourishes the very life-blood of it. That 

    the Psalmist may show how much the godly man is habituated to this blessed 

    work of meditation, he subjoins, "On His law he <i>meditates</i><b> </b>
    day and night" not but that there may be sometimes intermission: God allows time 

    for our calling, he grants some relaxation; but when it is said, the godly 

    man meditates day and night, the meaning is, <i>frequently</i>—he is much 

    conversant in the duty. 
<p align="justify">It is a command of God to pray without ceasing, 1 Thess. 

    5:17. The meaning is—not that we should be always praying—but that we should 

    every day set some time apart for prayer. We read in the Old law it was 

    called the <i>continual</i> sacrifice, Numb. 28:24, not that the people of 

    Israel did nothing else but sacrifice—but because they had their stated 

    hours, every morning and evening they offered, therefore it was called the 

    continual sacrifice. Thus the godly man is said to meditate day and night, 

    that is, he is often at this work, he is no stranger to meditation.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Doctrine</p></i>. The proposition that results out of the 

    text is this—that <i>a godly Christian is a meditating Christian</i>, Psalm 

    119:15. "I will meditate in your precepts." 1 Tim. 4:15, "Meditate upon 

    these things." Meditation is the <i>chewing </i>upon the truths we have 

    heard. The beasts in the old law which did not chew the cud, were unclean; 

    the professor who does not by meditation chew the cud, is to be accounted 

    unclean. Meditation is like the watering of the seed, it makes the fruits of 

    grace to flourish.<br/>

 
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>
<p align="justify">II. Showing the NATURE of Meditation</p></i>.
</font></b>
<p align="justify">If it be inquired what meditation is, I answer—Meditation 

    is the soul's retiring of itself, that by a serious and solemn thinking upon 

    God, the heart may be raised up to heavenly affections. This description has 

    three branches.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation is the soul's retiring of itself.</p></b></font> 

    A Christian, when he goes to meditate, must lock up himself from the world. 

    The world spoils meditation; Christ went <i>by himself </i>into the 

    mountainside to pray, Matt. 14:23, so, go into a solitary place when you are 

    to meditate. "<i>Isaac </i>went out to meditate in the field," Gen. 24:63; 

    he sequestered and retired himself that he might take a walk with God by 

    meditation. <i>Zaccheus </i>had a mind to see Christ, and he got out of the 

    crowd, "He ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him," Luke 

    19:3, 4. So, when we would see God, we must get out of the crowd of worldly 

    business; we must climb up into the tree by retiredness of meditation, and 

    there we shall have the best prospect of heaven. 
<i>
<p align="justify">The world's music </p></i>will either play us asleep, or 

    distract us in our meditations. When a mote has gotten into the eye—it 

    hinders the sight. Just so, when worldly thoughts, as motes, are gotten into 

    the mind, which is the eye of the soul—it cannot look up so steadfastly to 

    heaven by contemplation. Therefore, as when Abraham went to sacrifice, "he 

    left his servant and the donkey at the bottom of the hill," Gen. 22:5, so, 

    when a Christian is going up the hill of meditation, he should leave all 

    secular cares at the bottom of the hill, that he may be alone, and take a 

    turn in heaven. If the wings of the bird are full of slime, she cannot fly. 

    Meditation is the wing of the soul; when a Christian is beslimed with earth, 

    he cannot fly to God upon this wing. Bernard when he came to the 

    church-door, used to say, "Stay here all my worldly thoughts, that I may 

    converse with God in the temple." So say to yourself, "I am going now to 

    meditate, O all you vain thoughts stay behind, come not near!" When you are 

    going up the mount of meditation, take heed that the world does not follow 

    you, and throw you down from the top of this pinnacle. This is the first 

    thing, the soul's retiring of itself—lock and bolt the door against the 

    world.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The second thing in meditation, is, a serious and 

    solemn thinking upon God. </p></b></font>The Hebrew word to <i>meditate</i>, 

    signifies with intenseness to recollect and gather together the thoughts. 

    Meditation is not a cursory work, to have a few transient thoughts of 

    religion; like the dogs of Nilus that lap and then run away; but there must 

    be in meditation a fixing the heart upon the object, a <i>steeping </i>the 

    thoughts. Carnal professors have their thoughts roving up and down, and will 

    not fix on God; like the bird that hops from one branch to another, and 

    stays in no one place. David was a man fit to meditate, "O God, my heart is 

    fixed," Psalm 108:1. 
<p align="justify">In meditation there must be a staying of the thoughts 

    upon the object; a man who rides quickly through a town or village—he minds 

    nothing. But an artist who is looking on a curious piece, views the whole 

    portraiture of it, he observes the symmetry and proportion, he minds every 

    shadow and color. A carnal, flitting professor, is like the traveler, his 

    thoughts ride hastily—he minds nothing of God. A wise Christian is like the 

    artist, he views with seriousness, and ponders the things of religion, Luke 

    2:19. "But Mary kept all these things, and <i>pondered </i>them in her 

    heart."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The third thing in meditation, is, the raising of the 

    heart to holy affections. </p></b></font>A Christian enters into meditation, as 

    a man enters into the hospital—that he may be healed. Meditation heals the 

    soul of its deadness and earthliness; but more of this afterwards.<br/>

 
<font color="#ff0000"><b><i>
<p align="justify">III. Proving Meditation to be a DUTY</p></i>.
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Meditation is a duty lying upon every Christian, and 

    there is no disputing our duty. Meditation is a duty, 1. Imposed. 2. 

    Opposed.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation is a duty imposed</p></b></font>—it is not 

    arbitrary. The same God who has bid us believe, has bid us meditate, Josh. 

    1:8. "This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth—but you <i>

    shall meditate</i> therein day and night." These words, though spoken to the 

    person of Joshua, yet they concern everyone; as the promise made to Joshua 

    concerned all believers, Josh. 1:5 compared with Heb. 13:5. So this precept 

    made to the person of Joshua, <i>you shall meditate in this book of the law</i>, 

    takes in all Christians. As God's Word does direct, so his will must enforce 

    obedience.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation is a duty opposed.</p></b></font> We may 

    conclude it is a good duty, because it is against the stream of corrupt 

    nature. As one said, "you may know that religion is right—which Nero 

    persecutes;" so you may know that is a good duty—which the heart opposes. We 

    shall find naturally a strange averseness from meditation. We are swift to 

    hear—but slow to meditate. To think of the world, if it were all day long, 

    is delightful. But as for holy meditation, how does the heart wrangle and 

    quarrel with this duty; it is like doing of penance. Now truly, there needs 

    no other reason to prove a duty to be good, than the reluctancy of a carnal 

    heart. To instance in the duty of "Let a man deny himself," Mat. 16:24, 

    self-denial is as necessary as heaven—but what disputes are raised in the 

    heart against it? What! to deny my <i>reason</i>, and become a fool that I 

    may be wise; nay, not only to deny my reason—but my <i>righteousness</i>? 

    What, to cast it overboard, and swim to heaven upon the plank of Christ's 

    merits? This is such a duty that the heart does naturally oppose, and enter 

    its dissent against. This is an argument to prove the duty of self-denial 

    good; just so it is with this duty of meditation; the secret antipathy the 

    heart has against it, shows it to be good; and this is reason enough to 

    enforce meditation.
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    IV. <i>Showing how Meditation differs from MEMORY</i>.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The memory (a glorious faculty) which Aristotle calls the 

    soul's scribe, sits and pens all things that are done. Whatever we read or 

    hear, the memory does register; therefore, God does all his works of wonder 

    that they may be had in remembrance. There seems to be some analogy and 

    resemblance between meditation and memory. But I conceive there is a double 

    difference.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation has more sweetness in it, than the bare 

    remembrance. </p></b></font>The memory is the chest or cupboard to lock up a 

    truth, meditation is the palate to feed on it. The memory is like the ark in 

    which the manna was laid up, meditation is like Israel's eating of manna. 

    When David began to meditate on God, it was "sweet to him as marrow," Psalm 

    63:5, 6. There is as much difference between a truth remembered, and a truth 

    meditated on, as between a cordial in a <i>glass</i>—and a cordial <i>drunk 

    down</i>.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The remembrance of a truth, without the serious 

    meditation on it, will but create matter of sorrow another day. </p></b></font>

    What comfort can it be to a man when he comes to die, to think he remembered 

    many excellent notions about Christ—but never had the grace so to meditate 

    on them, as to be transformed into them! a sermon remembered—but not 

    ruminated, will only serve to increase our condemnation.
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    V. <i>Showing how Meditation differs from STUDY</i>.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The student's life looks like meditation—but does vary 

    from it. Meditation and study differ three ways.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They differ in their <b>nature</b>. Study is a work of 

    the brain, meditation of the heart; study sets the mind on work, meditation 

    sets the heart on work.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They differ in their <b>design</b>. The design of 

    study is notion, the design of meditation is piety. The design of study is 

    the finding out of a truth; the design of meditation is the spiritual 

    improvement of a truth. The one <i>searches </i>for the vein of gold; the 

    other <i>digs </i>out the gold.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They differ in the outcome and <b>result</b>. Study 

    leaves a man never a whit the better; it is like a winter sun that has 

    little warmth and influence. Meditation leaves one in a holy frame: it melts 

    the heart when it is frozen, and makes it drop into tears of love. <br/>

 </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">VI. <i>Showing the SUBJECTS of Meditation</i>.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The next particular to be discussed, is the 

    subject-matter of meditation; <i>what </i>a Christian should meditate upon. 

    I am now gotten into a large field—but I shall only glance at things; I 

    shall but do as the disciples, pluck some ears of corn as I pass along.</p>
<p align="justify">Some may say, "alas, I am so barren I know not what to 

    meditate upon!" To help Christians therefore in this blessed work, I shall 

    show you some choice select matter for meditation. There are fifteen things 

    in the Word of God, which we should principally meditate upon.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 1. Meditate on God's ATTRIBUTES. </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The Attributes of God are the several beams by which the 

    divine nature shines forth to us; and there are six special attributes which 

    we should fix our meditations upon.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Meditate upon God's OMNISCIENCE.</p></b></font> His eye is 

    continually upon us; he has a window open into the conscience; our thoughts 

    are unveiled before him. He can tell the words we speak "in our bedchamber," 

    2 Kings 2:12. He is described with <i>seven eyes</i>, to show his 

    omniscience. "You number my steps," Job 14:16. The Hebrew word signifies to 

    take an exact account. God is said to number our steps, when he makes a 

    precise and critical observation of our actions; God sets down every step of 

    our lives, and keeps as it were, a day book of all we do, and enters it down 

    into the book. Meditate much on this omniscience.
<p align="justify">Meditation on God's omniscience would have these <b>

    effects</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It would be as a bridle to check and restrain us from 

    sin. Will the thief steal—when the judge looks on?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on God's omniscience would be a good means 

    to make the heart sincere. God has set <i>a window</i> in every man's 

    breast, "does not he see all my ways?" Job 31:4. If I harbor proud, 

    malicious thoughts, if I look at my own interest more than Christ's, if I 

    juggle in my repentance—the God of heaven takes notice! Meditation on his 

    omniscience, would make a Christian sincere, both in his actions and aims. 

    Only a fool would dare to be<i> a hypocrite before God!</i></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Meditate on the HOLINESS of God.</p></b> </font>Holiness is 

    the embroidered robe God wears: it is the glory of the Godhead, Exod. 15:11. 

    "Glorious in holiness!" Holiness is the most orient pearl of the crown of 

    heaven. God is the exemplar and pattern of holiness. It is primarily and 

    originally in God as light in the sun; you may as well separate weight from 

    lead, or heat from fire, as holiness from the divine nature; God's holiness 

    is that whereby his heart rises against any sin, as being most diametrically 

    opposite to his essence, Hab. 1:13. "You are of purer eyes than to behold 

    iniquity." Meditate much on this attribute.
<p align="justify">Meditation on God's holiness would have this effect; it 

    would be a means to transform us into the similitude and likeness of God; 

    God never loves us until we are like him. There is a story of a deformed 

    man, who set lovely pictures before his wife, that seeing them she might 

    have lovely children, and so she had. Be that as it may, while by meditation 

    we are looking upon the beams of holiness, which are gloriously transparent 

    in God, we shall grow like him, and be holy as he is holy. Holiness is a 

    beautiful thing, Psalm 110. It puts a kind of angelical brightness upon us; 

    it is the only coin which will pass current in heaven; by the frequent 

    meditation on this attribute, we are changed into God's image.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Meditate on the WISDOM of God.</p></b></font> He is called 

    "the only wise God," 1 Tim. 1:17. His wisdom shines forth in the works of 

    providence; he sits at the helm guiding all things regularly and 

    harmoniously; he brings light out of darkness; he can strike a straight 

    stroke by a crooked stick; he can make use of the injustice of men to do 

    that which is just; he is infinitely wise, he breaks us by afflictions, and 

    upon these broken pieces of the ship, brings us safely to shore; meditate on 

    the wisdom of God.
<p align="justify">Meditation on God's wisdom would sweetly calm our hearts.

    </p>
<p align="justify">1. When we see things go badly in the public. The 

    all-wise God holds the reins of government in his hand; and whoever the 

    earthly ruler—God over-rules; he knows how to turn all to good; his work 

    will be beautiful in its season. </p>
<p align="justify">2. When things go badly with us in particular, the 

    meditation on God's wisdom would rock our hearts quiet. The wise God has set 

    me in this condition, and whether health or sickness, his wisdom will order 

    it for the best. God will make a golden cordial from poison, all things 

    shall be beneficial and medicinal to me; either the Lord will expel some 

    sin, or exercise some grace. Meditation on this would silence murmuring.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Meditate on the POWER of God. </p></b></font>His power is 

    visible in the creation. "He hangs the earth upon nothing," Job 26:7. What 

    cannot that God do—who can create? Nothing can stand before a creating 

    power! He needs no pre-existent matter to work upon; he needs no instruments 

    to work with, he can work without tools; he it is before whom the angels 

    veil their faces, and the kings of the earth cast their crowns. He it is who 

    "removes the earth out of her place," Job 9:6. An earthquake makes the earth 

    tremble upon her pillars—but God can shake it out of its place. God can with 

    a word, unpin the wheels, and break the axle of the creation. He can suspend 

    natural agents, stop the lion's mouth, cause the sun to stand still, make 

    the fire not burn! Xerxes, the Persian monarch, threw fetters into the sea, 

    as if he would have chained up the unruly waters; but when God commands, 

    "the winds and sea obey him," Matt. 8:27. If he speaks the word, an army of 

    stars appear, Judg. 5:20. If he stamps with his foot, a multitude of angels 

    are presently in battalia; if he lifts up an ensign, and does but hiss, his 

    very enemies shall be up in arms to revenge his quarrel, Isaiah 5:56. Who 

    would provoke this God! "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the 

    living God," Heb. 10:31. As a lion—"he tears in pieces his adversaries," 

    Psalm 50:22. Oh meditate on this power of God.
<p align="justify">Meditation on God's power would be a great stay to faith. 

    A Christian's faith may anchor safely upon the rock of God's power. It was 

    Samson's riddle, "Out of the strong came forth sweetness;" Judges 14:14. 

    While we are meditating on the power of God, out of this strong comes forth 

    sweetness. Is the church of God low? he can "create praises in Jerusalem," 

    Isaiah 65:28. Is your corruption strong? God can break the head of this 

    leviathan. Is your heart as hard as a stone? God can dissolve it. "The 

    Almighty makes my heart soft." Faith triumphs in the power of God: out of 

    this strong comes forth sweetness. Abraham meditating on God's power, did 

    not stagger through unbelief, Romans 4:20. He knew God could make a dead 

    womb fruitful, and dry breasts give suck.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Meditate upon the MERCY of God.</p></b></font> Mercy is an 

    innate disposition in God to do good; as the sun has an innate property to 

    shine, Psalm 86:5. "You Lord are good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous 

    in mercy to all them that call upon you. God's mercy is so sweet, that it 

    makes all his other attributes sweet. Holiness without mercy, and justice 

    without mercy, would be dreadful. Geographers write that the city of 

    Syracuse in Sicily is curiously situated, that the sun is never out of 

    sight; though the children of God are under some clouds of affliction, yet 

    the sun of mercy is never quite out of sight. God's <i>justice </i>reaches 

    to the clouds; his <i>mercy </i>reaches above the clouds. 
<p align="justify">How slow is God to anger. He was longer in destroying 

    Jericho, than in making the world; he made the world in six days—but he was 

    seven days in demolishing the walls of Jericho. How many warning arrows did 

    God shoot against Jerusalem, before he shot off his destroying arrow? 

    Justice goes by <i>foot</i>, Gen. 18:21. Mercy has <i>wings</i>. The sword 

    of justice often lies a long time in the scabbard, and rusts, until sin 

    draws it out and sharpens it against a nation. God's justice is like the <i>

    widow's oil</i>, which ran a while, and ceased, 1 Kings 4:6. God's mercy is 

    like <i>Aaron's oil</i>, which rested not on his head—but ran down to the 

    skirts of his garment, Psalm 133:2. So the golden oil of God's mercy does 

    not rest upon the head of a godly parent—but is often poured on his 

    children, and so runs down, "To the third and fourth generation," even the 

    borders of a pious seed. Often meditate upon the mercy of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Meditation on mercy would be a powerful loadstone to draw 

    sinners to God by repentance. It would be as a cork to the net—to keep the 

    heart from sinking in despair. Behold a city of refuge to fly to—"God is the 

    Father of mercies," 2 Cor. 1:3. Mercy does as naturally issue from him, as 

    the child from the parent. God "delights in mercy," Micah 7:18. Chrysostom 

    says, it is delightful to the mother to have her breasts drawn; and how 

    delightful is it to God to have the breasts of mercy drawn! Mercy finds out 

    the worst sinner; mercy comes not only with <i>salvation </i>in its hand—but 

    with <i>healing </i>under its wings.</p>
<p align="justify">Meditation on God's mercy would melt a sinner into tears: 

    One reading a pardon sent to him from the king, fell a weeping, and burst 

    out into these words, "A pardon has done that which death could not do, it 

    has made my heart relent."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Meditate upon the TRUTH of God. </p></b></font>Mercy makes 

    the promise, and Truth performs it, Psalm 89:33, "I will not allow my 

    faithfulness to fail." God can as well deny himself as his word. He is 

    "abundant in truth," Exod. 34:6. That is—if God has made a promise of mercy 

    to his people, he will be so far from coming short of his Word, that he will 

    be <i>better </i>than his Word. God often does more than he has said, never 

    less; he often shoots beyond the mark of the promise he has set, never short 

    of it. He is abundant in truth. God may sometimes <i>delay </i>a promise, he 

    will not <i>deny </i>it. The promise may lie a long time as seed hidden 

    under ground—but it is all the while a ripening. The promise of Israel's 

    deliverance lay four hundred and thirty years under ground; but when the 

    time was come, the promise did not go a day beyond its reckoning, Exod. 

    12:41. "The strength of Israel will not lie," 1 Sam. 15:29. Meditation on 

    God's truth would—
<p align="justify">1. Be a pillar of support for faith. The world hangs upon 

    God's power, and faith hangs upon his truth.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on God's truth would make us ambitious to 

    imitate him. We should be true in our words, true in our dealings. 

    Pythagoras being asked, "What makes men like God?" answered, "When they 

    speak truth."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 2. Meditate upon the PROMISES of God.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The promises of God are flowers growing in the paradise 

    of scripture; meditation, like the bee, sucks out the sweetness of them. The 

    promises are of no use or comfort to us, until they are meditated upon. 

    Roses hanging in the garden may give a fragrant redolence, yet their sweet 

    water is distilled only by the fire. Just so, the promises are sweet in 

    reading over—but the water of these roses, the spirits and quintessence of 

    the promises, are distilled into the soul only by meditation. The incense, 

    when it is <i>pounded </i>and <i>beaten</i>, smells sweetest. Meditating on 

    a promise, like the beating of the incense, makes it more fragrant and 

    pleasant. The promises may be compared to a gold mine, which only enriches 

    when the gold is dug out. By holy meditation, we dig out that spiritual gold 

    which lies hidden in the midst of the promise, and so we come to be 

    enriched!</p>
<p align="justify">Cardan says that every precious gem-stone has some hidden 

    virtue in it. They are called <i>precious </i>promises, 2 Pet. 1:4. When 

    they are applied by meditation, then their virtue appears, and they become 

    precious indeed. There are three sorts of promises which we should meditate 

    upon.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Promises of REMISSION. </p></b></font>"I, even I am he who 

    blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember your 

    sins," Isaiah 43:25. Whereas the poor sinner may say, "Alas, I am deep in 

    debt with God, I fear I have not filled his bottle with my tears—but I have 

    filled his book with my debts!" Well, but meditate on his promise, "I am he 

    who blots out," etc. The word there in the original to blot out, is a 

    metaphor alluding to a merchant, who when his debtor has paid him, he blots 

    out the debt, and gives him an acquittance. So says God, "I will blot out 

    your sin, I will cross out the debt-book!" In the Hebrew it is, "I <i>am </i>

    blotting out your transgressions." "I have taken my pen, and am crossing out 

    your debt!" Oh, but may the sinner say, "There is no reason God should do 

    thus for me." Well, but acts of <i>grace </i>do not go by <i>reason</i>, "I 

    will blot out your sins—<i>for my name's sake." </i>Oh, but says the sinner, 

    "Will not the Lord call my sins again to remembrance?" No, he promises to 

    send them into oblivion; "I will not upbraid you with your sins—I will 

    remember your sins no more." Here is a sweet promise to meditate upon; it is 

    a <i>hive full of the honey of the gospel</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditate upon promises of SANCTIFICATION. </p></b></font>

    The earth is not so apt to be overgrown with weeds and thorns, as the heart 

    is to be overgrown with lusts! Now, God has made many promises of <i>healing</i>, 

    Hos. 14:4, and <i>purging</i>, Jer. 33:8. Promises of sending his Spirit, 

    Isaiah 44:3, which, for its sanctifying nature, is compared sometimes to <i>

    water </i>which cleanses the vessel; sometimes to <i>wind</i>, which is the 

    fan to winnow and purify the air; sometimes to <i>fire</i>, which refines 

    the metals. Meditate often on that promise, Isaiah 1:18, "Though your sins 

    be as scarlet—they shall be as white as snow!" Scarlet is so deep a dye, 

    that all the art of man cannot take it out; but behold here a promise—God 

    will whiten the soul; he will make a <i>scarlet sinner</i>—into a <i>snow 

    white saint! </i>By virtue of this refining and consecrating work, a 

    Christian is made partaker of the divine nature; he has a suitability and 

    fitness to have communion with God forever. Meditate much on this promise.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Meditate upon promises of REMUNERATION.</p></b></font> 

    "The haven of rest," Heb. 4:9. The beatifical sight of God, Matt. 5:8. The 

    glorious mansions, John 14:2. Meditation on these promises will be as choice 

    cordials to keep us from fainting under our sins and sorrows.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 3. Meditate upon the Love of Christ.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Christ is full of love, as he is of merit. What was it 

    but love—that he should save <i>us</i>—and not the fallen angels? Among the 

    rarities of the loadstone, this is not the least—that leaving the <i>gold

    </i>and <i>pearl</i>, it should draw <i>iron </i>to it—which is a baser kind 

    of metal. Just so, that Christ should leave the <i>angels</i>, those more 

    noble spirits, the <i>gold </i>and <i>pearl</i>—and draw <i>mankind </i>to 

    him—how does this proclaim his love? <i>Love was the wing on which he flew 

    into the virgin's womb!</i> </p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. How TRANSCENDENT is Christ's love to the saints!</p></b></font> 

    The apostle calls it a love "which passes knowledge," Eph. 3:19. It is such 

    a love as God the Father bears to Christ; the same for quality, though not 

    equality, John 15:9. "As the Father has loved me—so have I loved you." A 

    believer's heart is the garden where Christ has planted this sweet flower of 

    his love. It is the channel through which the golden stream of his affection 

    runs. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. How SOVEREIGN is Christ's love! </p></b></font>"Brothers, 

    think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were <i>wise

    </i>by human standards; not many were <i>influential</i>; not many were of

    <i>noble birth</i>." 1 Corinthians 1:26 In the old law God passed by the 

    noble <i>lion </i>and the <i>eagle</i>—and took the <i>dove </i>for 

    sacrifice. That God should pass by so many of noble birth and abilities, and 

    that the lot of free grace should fall upon <i>me</i>—O the depth of divine 

    grace! 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. How INVINCIBLE is the love of Christ!</p></b></font> "It 

    is strong as death," Cant. 8:6. Death might take away Christ's life—but not 

    his love! Neither can our sin wholly quench that divine flame of love; the 

    church had her infirmities, her sleepy fits, Cant. 5:2, but though blacked 

    and sullied, yet she is still a dove; Christ could <i>see </i>the <i>faith</i>, 

    and <i>wink </i>at the <i>failing</i>. He who painted Alexander, drew him 

    with his finger over the scar on his face. Just so, Christ puts the finger 

    of mercy upon the scars of the saints! He will not throw away his pearls for 

    every speck of dirt! That which makes this love of Christ the more 

    stupendous, is that there was nothing in us to excite or draw forth his 

    love! He did not love us because we were worthy—but by loving us he made us 

    worthy! 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. How IMMUTABLE is Christ's love! </p></b></font>"Having 

    loved his own, he loved them to the end," John 13:1. The saints are like 

    letters of gold engraved upon Christ's heart, which cannot be erased out. 

    Meditate much upon the love of Christ.
<p align="justify">1. Serious meditation on the love of Christ, would make 

    us love him in return. "Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be 

    burnt?" Proverbs 6:28. Who can tread by meditation upon these hot coals of 

    Christ's love, and his heart not burn in love to him?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on Christ's love, would set our eyes 

    abroach with tears for our gospel unkindnesses. O that we should sin against 

    so sweet a Savior! had we none to abuse—but our best friend? Had we nothing 

    to kick against—but affections of love? Did not Christ suffer enough upon 

    the cross—but must we needs make him suffer more? Do we give him more gall 

    and vinegar to drink? O, if anything can dissolve the heart into mourning, 

    it is the unkindness offered to Christ. When Peter thought of Christ's love 

    to him—Christ could deny Peter nothing, yet he could deny Christ, this made 

    his eyes to water; "Peter went out and wept bitterly."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Meditation on Christ's love would make us love our 

    enemies. Jesus Christ showed love to his enemies. We read of "the fire 

    licking up the water," 1 Kings 18:38. It is usual for <i>water </i>to quench 

    the fire, but for <i>fire </i>to dry up and consume the water, which was not 

    capable of burning, this was miraculous! Such a miracle did Christ show; his 

    love burned where there was no fit matter to work upon—nothing but sin and 

    enmity. He loved his enemies; the fire of his love consumed and licked up 

    the water of their sins! He prayed for his enemies, "Father forgive them;" 

    he shed his <i>tears</i>—for those who shed his <i>blood!</i> Those who gave 

    him gall and vinegar to drink—to them he gave his sin-forgiving blood to 

    drink. Meditation on his love—should melt our hearts in love to our enemies. 

    Augustine says, "Christ made a pulpit of the cross, and the great lesson he 

    taught Christians was, to love their enemies."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Meditation on Christ's love would be a means to 

    support us in case of his absence. Sometimes he is pleased to withdraw 

    himself, Cant. 5:6, yet when we consider how entire and immutable his love 

    is, it will make us wait with patience until he sweetly manifests himself to 

    us. He is love, and he cannot forsake his people very long, Micah 7:19. The 

    sun may be gone a while from our climate—but it returns in the spring. 

    Meditation on Christ's love may make us wait for the return of this Sun of 

    Righteousness; Heb. 10:37, "For yet a little while and he who shall come 

    will come." He is truth, therefore he <i>shall </i>come; he is love, 

    therefore he <i>will </i>come.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 4. Meditate upon SIN.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditate on the GUILT of sin. </p></b></font>We are in 

    Adam as in a common head, or root—and <i>he </i>sinning, <i>we </i>become 

    guilty, Romans 5:12, "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one 

    man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because 

    all sinned." By his treason—our blood is tainted. This <i>guilt </i>brings

    <i>shame </i>with it, as its twin! Romans 6:21.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditate upon the FILTH of sin.</p></b></font> Not only is

    <i>the guilt of Adam's sin </i>imputed, but <i>the <b>poison </b>of his 

    nature </i>is disseminated to us! Our virgin nature is defiled! If the <i>

    heart </i>is spotted—how then can the <i>actions </i>be pure? If the water 

    in the <i>well </i>is foul—it cannot be clean in the <i>bucket!</i> Isaiah 

    64:6, "We are all as an unclean thing." We are like a patient under the 

    physician's care—who has no sound part in him, his head is bruised, his 

    liver is swelled, his lungs are gasping, his blood is infected, his feet are 

    gangrened. Thus is it with us before saving grace comes! In the <i>mind </i>

    there is darkness! In the <i>memory </i>there is slipperiness! In the <i>

    heart </i>there is hardness! In the <i>will </i>there is stubborness! "You 

    are sick from head to foot—covered with bruises, welts, and infected 

    wounds—without any ointments or bandages!" Isaiah 1:6. A sinner befilthied 

    with sin, is <i>no better than a devil in man's shape! 
</i>
<p align="justify">And which is sadly to be laid to heart--is the <b>

    adherency </b>of this sin. Sin is natural to us. The apostle calls it, "the 

    sin that so <i>easily ensnares</i> us!" Heb. 12:1. Sin is not easily cast 

    off. A man may as well shake off the <i>skin </i>of his body—as the <i>sin

    </i>of his soul! <i>There is no shaking off this viper </i>until death!</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, often meditate on this <b>contagion </b>of sin. How 

    strong is that poison—a drop whereof is able to poison a whole sea? How 

    venomous and malignant was that <i>apple</i>—a <i>taste </i>of which 

    poisoned all mankind! Meditate sadly on this. Meditation on sin would make 

    the <i>plumes of pride </i>fall off! If our <i>knowledge </i>makes us 

    proud—that is sin enough to make us humble. The best saint alive who is 

    taken out of the <i>grave of sin</i>—yet has the smell of the grave-clothes 

    still upon him!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Meditate upon the CURSE of sin.</p></b></font> Gal. 3:10. 

    "Cursed is everyone who does not <i>continue </i>to do <i>everything </i>

    written in the Book of the Law." This curse is like a deadly canker upon 

    fruit, which keeps it from thriving. Sin is not only a <i>defiling </i>

    thing—but a <i>damning </i>thing! It is not only a <i>spot </i>in the 

    face—but a <i>stab </i>at the heart! Sin betrays us into the devil's 

    hands—who writes all his laws in blood. Sin binds us over to the <i>wrath

    </i>of God! What then, are all our <i>earthly enjoyments</i>—with the sword 

    of divine vengeance hanging over our head! Sin brings forth the "scroll 

    written with curses" against a sinner, Zech. 5:5, and it is a "<i>flying </i>

    scroll"—it comes <i>swiftly</i>—if <i>mercy </i>does not stop it. "You are 

    cursed with a curse!" Mat. 3:9. Thus it is until the <i>head </i>of this 

    curse is cut off by Christ. Oh meditate upon this curse due to sin.
<p align="justify">1. Meditation on this curse would make us afraid of <i>

    retaining </i>sin. When Micah had stolen his mother's money, and heard her 

    curse him, he dared not keep it any longer, but restored it, Judg. 17:2. He 

    was afraid of his <i>mother's </i>curse; what then is <i>God's </i>curse!

    </p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on this curse would make us afraid of <i>

    entertaining </i>sin. We would not willingly entertain one in our house who 

    had a deadly plague! Sin brings along with it, the plague of God's curse, 

    which cleaves to a sinner. Meditation on this, would make us fly from sin! 

    While we sit under the shadow of this bramble of sin—fire will come out of 

    the bramble eternally to devour us! Judg. 9:15.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 5. Meditate upon the Vanity of the CREATURE.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">When you have sifted out the <i>finest flour </i>that the 

    creature can give, you will find something either to <i>dissatisfy </i>or <i>

    nauseate</i>. The best <i>wine </i>has its froth, the sweetest <i>rose </i>

    has its prickles, and the purest <i>comforts </i>have their dregs. The 

    creature cannot be said to be full—unless we say that it is full of vanity; 

    as a sail may be filled with <i>wind</i>. Job 20:22, "At the height of his 

    success distress will come to him; the full weight of misery will crush 

    him." Those who think to find happiness here on earth, are like Apollo who 

    embraced a tree, instead of the lovely Daphne. Meditate on this vanity of 

    the creature. The world is like a broken looking glass—which shows a false 

    beauty.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation on worldly vanity would be like the digging 

    about the roots of a tree, to <i>loosen it from the earth</i>. It would much 

    loosen our hearts from the world, and be an excellent preservative against 

    the love of earthly things. Let a Christian think thus with himself, "Why am 

    I so serious about such a worthless vanity? if the whole earth were changed 

    into a globe of gold, it could not fill my heart!"</p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on the creature's vanity would make us look 

    after more solid comforts—the favor of God, the blood of Christ, the 

    influences of the Spirit. When I see that the life which I fetch from the <i>

    cistern </i>is vain—I will go the more to the <i>ocean! </i>In Christ there 

    is an inexhaustible treasury! When a man finds the bough begin to break, he 

    lets go of the bough, and catches hold on the trunk of the tree. Just so, 

    when we find the creature to be but a rotten bough, then by faith we shall 

    catch hold on Christ, the tree of life! Rev. 2:7. The creature is but a <i>

    shaking reed</i>, God is the immoveable <i>rock </i>of ages!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 6. Meditate on the Excellency of GRACE.</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">1. Grace is precious in itself.</p></b> 2. Pet. 1:1, precious 

    faith.
<p align="justify">1. Grace is precious, in its <b>original</b>, it comes 

    from above, James 3:17. </p>
<p align="justify">2. Grace is precious, in its <b>nature</b>; it is the 

    seed of God, 1 John 3:9. Grace is the spiritual embroidery of the soul; it 

    is the very signature and engraving of the Holy Spirit. Grace does not lose 

    its color: it is such a commodity, that the longer we keep it, the better it 

    is—it changes into <i>glory!</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. </p></b>As grace is precious in itself, so <b>it makes us 

    precious to God</b>; as a rich diamond adorns the one who wears it. Isaiah 

    43:4, 'Since you were <i>precious </i>in my sight." The saints who are 

    invested with grace, are God's jewels, Mal. 3:17, though sullied with 

    reproach, though besmeared with blood—yet, jewels! All the world besides, is 

    but chaff. These are the jewels—and heaven is the golden cabinet where they 

    shall be locked up safe! A gracious man is the glory of the age he lives in. 

    So illustrious in God's eye is a soul bespangled with grace, that he does 

    not think the world worthy of him, Heb. 11:38, "Of whom the world was not 

    worthy." Therefore God calls his people home so fast, because they are too 

    good to live in the world, Proverbs 2:26, "The righteous is more excellent 

    than his neighbor." 
<p align="justify">Grace is the best blessing; it has a transcendency above 

    all other things. <i>There are two things which sparkle </i>much in our 

    eyes—but grace infinitely outshines both. </p>
<p align="justify">1. GOLD.<i> </i>The sun does not shine so much in our 

    eyes as gold; it is the mirror of beauty, "money answers all things," Eccl. 

    10:19. But grace weighs heavier than gold; gold draws the heart <i>from </i>

    God, grace draws the heart <i>to </i>God. Gold does but enrich the mortal 

    part, grace the angelic part. Gold perishes, 1 Pet. 1:7, grace perseveres. 

    The rose, the fuller it is blown, the sooner it sheds—is an emblem of all 

    things, besides grace.</p>
<p align="justify">2. GIFTS. These are nature's pride. Gifts and abilities, 

    like Rachel, are fair to look upon—but grace excels. I had rather be <i>holy

    </i>than <i>eloquent</i>. An <i>heart </i>full of grace, is better than an

    <i>head </i>full of notions. Gifts commend no man to God. It is not the <i>

    skin </i>of the apple we esteem, though of a vermilion color—but the <i>

    fruit</i>. We judge not the better of a horse for his trappings and 

    ornaments, unless he has good mettle. What are the most glorious abilities, 

    if there is not the metal of grace in the heart? Gifts may be bestowed upon 

    one for the good of others, as the nurse's breasts are given her for the 

    child—but grace is bestowed for a man's own eternal advantage. God may send 

    away reprobates with <i>gifts</i>, as Abraham gave the sons of the 

    concubines some <i>gifts</i>, Gen. 25:6—but he entails the <i>inheritance

    </i>only upon grace. O, often meditate upon the excellency of grace!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The musing on the beauty of grace would make us fall 

    in LOVE with it. </p></b></font>He who meditates on the worth of a diamond, 

    grows in love with it. Damascen calls the graces of the Spirit the very 

    characters and impressions of the divine nature. Grace is that <i>flower of 

    delight</i>, which, like the vine in the parable, Judg. 9:13, "cheers the 

    heart of God and man."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on the excellency of grace would make us 

    earnest in the PURSUIT after it.</p></b></font> We <i>dig </i>for gold in the 

    mine, we <i>sweat </i>for it in the furnace. Did we meditate on the worth of 

    grace, we would dig in the mine of ordinances for it. What sweating and 

    wrestling in prayer would we have! We would put on a modest boldness, and 

    not take a denial. "What will you give me (says Abraham) seeing I go 

    childless?" Gen. 15:2. So would the soul say, "Lord, what will you give me, 

    seeing I go graceless? Who will give me to drink of the water of the well of 

    life?"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Meditation on the excellency of grace would make us 

    endeavor to be instrumental to CONVEY grace to others. </p></b></font>Is grace 

    so transcendently precious, and have I a child who lacks grace? Oh that I 

    might be a means to convey this treasure into his soul! I have read of a 

    rich Florentine, who being about to die, called all his sons together, and 

    used these words to them, "It much rejoices me now upon my death-bed, that I 

    shall leave you all <i>wealthy</i>;" but a parent's ambition should be 

    rather to convey <i>sanctity</i>, that he may say, "O my children, it 

    rejoices me that I shall leave you gracious; it comforts me that before I 

    die, I shall see Jesus Christ live in you."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 7. Meditate upon your SPIRITUAL STATE.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Enter into a serious meditation on the state of your 

    souls; while you are meditating on other things, do not forget yourselves; 

    the great work lies at home. It was Solomon's advice, "know the state of 

    your <i>flock</i>," Proverbs 27:23, much more know the state of your <i>soul</i>; 

    for lack of this meditation, men are like travelers, skilled in other 

    countries—but ignorant of their own: so they know other things—but know not 

    how it goes with their souls, whether they are in a good state or bad; there 

    are few who by holy meditation, enter within themselves. There are two 

    reasons why so few meditate upon the state of their souls.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. Self-guiltiness.</p></b> Men are reluctant to look into 

    their hearts by meditation, lest they should find that which would trouble 

    them. The <i>cup </i>is in their sack. Most are herein like tradesmen, who 

    being ready to sink in their estates, are reluctant; to look into their 

    account books, lest they should find their estate low; but had you not 

    better enter into your heart by <i>meditation</i>, than God should in a sad 

    manner enter into <i>judgment </i>with you?
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Presumption.</p></b> Men hope all is well; men will not 

    take their land upon trust—but will have it surveyed; yet they will take 

    their spiritual estate upon trust, without any surveying. They are confident 

    their case is good; Proverbs 14:16. They presume that it is a thing not to 

    be disputed on, and this confidence is but conceit. The foolish virgins, 

    though they had no oil in their lamps, yet how confident were they? "They 

    came knocking"—they doubted not of admittance. Just so, many do not possess 

    salvation—but remain secure; they presume all is well, never seriously 

    meditating whether they have oil or not. O Christian, meditate about your 

    soul! See how the case stands between God and you; do as merchants, cast up 

    your estate, that you may see what you are worth. See if you are rich 

    towards God, Luke 12:21. Meditate about three things:
<p align="justify">1. About your <b>debts</b>, see if your debts are paid or 

    not, that is, your sins pardoned; see if there be no arrears, no sin in your 

    soul unrepented of. </p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditate about your <b>will</b>; see if your will is 

    made yet. Have you resigned up all the interest in yourself? Have you given 

    up your love to God? Have you given up your will? This is to make your will. 

    Meditate about your will; make your spiritual will in the time of health; if 

    you put off the making of your will until death, it may be invalid; perhaps 

    God will not accept of your soul then. </p>
<p align="justify">3. Meditate about your <b>evidences</b>. These evidences 

    are the graces of the Spirit; see whether you have any evidences. What 

    desires have you after Christ? what faith? see whether there are any flaws 

    in your evidences; are your desires true? do you as well desire heavenly <i>

    principles</i>, as heavenly <i>privileges</i>? O meditate seriously upon 

    your evidences.</p>
<p align="justify">To sift our hearts thus by meditation, is very necessary; 

    if we find our estate is not sound, the mistake is discovered, and the 

    danger can be prevented. If our spiritual estate is sound, we shall have the 

    comfort of it. What gladness was it to Hezekiah, when he could say, 

    "Remember now, O Lord, how I have walked before you in truth, and with a 

    perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight," Isaiah 38:3. 

    So, what unspeakable comfort will it be, when a Christian, upon a serious 

    meditation and review of his spiritual condition, can say, "I have something 

    to show for heaven—I know I have passed from death to life," l John 3:14, 

    and as a holy man once said, "I am Christ's, and the devil has nothing to do 

    with me."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 8. Meditate upon the small number of those who 

    shall be saved.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The eighth subject of meditation is, the small number 

    that shall be saved; "but <i>few </i>are chosen," Mat. 20:16. Among the 

    millions in Rome—there are but few senators; and among the swarms of people 

    in the world—there are but few believers. One said, all the names of the 

    good emperors might be engraved in a little ring. There are not many names 

    in the book of life. We read of four kinds of ground in the parable, and but 

    one good ground, Matt. 13. How few in the world know Christ. How few that 

    believe in him? Who has believed our report? Isaiah 53:1. How few bow to 

    Christ's scepter. The heathen idolaters and Mahometans possess almost all 

    Asia, Africa, America; in many parts of the world the devil is worshiped, as 

    among the Parthians and Pilapians; Satan takes up most <i>climates—</i>and

    <i>hearts</i>. How many <i>formalists </i>are in the world? 2 Tim. 3:5, 

    "having a form of godliness." <i>Formalists </i>are like wool which receives 

    a slight tincture, not a deep dye, whose religion is a <i>paint</i>—not an 

    engraving, (which a storm of persecution will wash off). These look like <i>

    Christ's doves</i>—but are the <i>serpent's brood</i>. They hate God's 

    image, like the panther, that hates the picture of a man.</p>
<p align="justify">O often meditate on the small number of those who shall 

    be saved. </p>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation on this, would keep us from marching along 

    with the multitude. "You shall not follow a multitude," Exod. 23:2. The <i>

    multitude </i>usually goes wrong: most men walk "after the course of this 

    world," Eph. 2:2. That is, the lusts of their hearts, and the fashions of 

    the times. They march after the prince of the air. Meditation on this would 

    make us turn out of the common road.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on the fewness of those who shall be saved, 

    would make us walk tremblingly. Few <i>find </i>the way; and when they have 

    found it, few <i>walk </i>in the way. The thoughts of this would work holy 

    fear, Heb. 4:1, not a despairing fear—but a jealous and cautious fear. This 

    reverential fear, the eminent saints of God have had. Augustine says of 

    himself, he knocked at heaven's gate with a trembling hand. This fear is 

    joined with hope, Psalm 147:1. "The Lord takes pleasure in those who fear 

    him, in those who hope in his mercy." A child of God <i>fears</i>, because 

    the gate is strait; but <i>hopes</i>, because the gate is open.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Meditation on the fewness of those who shall be saved, 

    would be a whetstone to holy industry. It would put us upon working out our 

    salvation; if there are so few that shall be crowned, it would make us the 

    swifter in the race. This meditation would be an alarm to sleepy Christians.</p>

<p align="justify">Section 9. Meditate upon Final APOSTASY.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Think what a sad thing it is to begin in religion to 

    build, and not be able to finish. Joash was good while his uncle Jehoiada 

    lived—but after he died, Joash grew wicked—all his religion was buried in 

    his uncle's grave. We live in the fall of the leaf; how many are fallen to 

    damnable heresies? 2 Pet. 2:1. Meditate seriously on that scripture, Heb. 

    6:4-6. "It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have 

    tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have 

    tasted the goodness of the Word of God and the powers of the coming age, if 

    they fall away, to be brought back to repentance." A man may be enlightened, 

    and that from a double lamp—the Word and Spirit; but these beams, though 

    they are irradiating, yet not penetrating. It is possible he may have a <i>

    taste </i>of the heavenly gift; he may <i>taste </i>but not be <i>nourished

    </i>by it. This taste may not only <i>illuminate</i>—but <i>refresh</i>; it 

    may carry some sweetness in it, there may be a kind of delight in spiritual 

    things. Thus far a man may go and yet fall away finally. Now this will be 

    very sad (it being such a God-affronting, and Christ reproaching sin) "Know 

    therefore it is an <i>evil </i>and <i>bitter </i>thing that you have 

    forsaken the Lord," Jer. 2:19. Meditate upon final relapses.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation on this would make us earnest in prayer to 

    God—for soundness of heart, "Make my heart sound in your statutes," Psalm 

    119:80. Lord, let me not be an <i>almost </i>Christian. Work a thorough work 

    of grace upon me: though I am not washed perfectly, let me be washed 

    thoroughly, Psalm 51:2. That which begins in <i>hypocrisy</i>, ends in <i>

    apostasy!</i> </p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on hypocrites final falling away, would 

    make us earnest in prayer for perseverance. "Hold up my goings in your paths 

    that my footsteps slip not," Psalm 17:5. "Lord, hold me up that I may hold 

    out. You have set the crown at the end of the race, let me run the race, 

    that I may wear the crown!" It was Beza's prayer—let it be ours, "Lord 

    perfect what you have begun in me, that I may not suffer shipwreck when I am 

    almost at the haven."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 10. Meditate upon DEATH.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">We say we must all die—but how rare it is—that anyone 

    meditates seriously upon death?</p>
<p align="justify">1. Meditate on the <b>certainty </b>of death; it is 

    appointed for all, once to die, Heb. 9:27. Death is an inviolable reality.

    </p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditate upon the <b>proximity </b>of death, it is 

    near to us.We are almost setting our feet upon the dark entry of death. The 

    poets painted time with wings; it <i>flies</i>—and carries us upon its 

    wings. <i>The race is short between the cradle and the grave! </i>The 

    sentence of death is already passed, Gen. 3:19. "To dust you shall return;" 

    so that our life is but a short reprieve from death which is granted to a 

    condemned man. "You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my 

    years is as <i>nothing </i>before you. Each man's life is but a breath." 

    Psalm 39:5. Nay, our life is less than nothing, reckoned with eternity. </p>
<p align="justify">3. Meditate upon the <b>uncertainty of time</b>. We have 

    no lease—but may be turned out the next hour; there are so many casualties, 

    that it is a wonder if life be not cut off by untimely death. How soon may 

    God seal us a lease of ejectment? Our grave may be dug before night. Today 

    we may lie upon a pillow of <i>down</i>, tomorrow we may be laid upon a 

    pillow of <i>dust</i>. Today the sermon-bell tolls, to morrow our death bell 

    may toll. </p>
<p align="justify">4. Think seriously, that to die is to be but once done, 

    and after death our state is <i>eternally fixed</i>. If you die in your 

    impenitency, there is no repenting in the grave. If you leave your work at 

    death half done, there is no finishing it in the grave, Eccl. 9:10, "There 

    is no work, nor device, nor wisdom in the grave where you go." If a garrison

    <i>surrenders </i>at the first summons, there is mercy. But if it battles 

    until it is stormed and captured, there is no mercy then. Now it is a day of 

    grace, and God holds forth the <i>white flag of mercy </i>to the penitent; 

    if we battle with God until he storms us by death—there is no mercy. There 

    is nothing to be done for our souls after death. O meditate on death. It is 

    reported of Zeleucus, that the first piece of house-hold stuff he brought to 

    Babylon, was a tomb-stone; think often of your tomb-stone. Meditation on 

    death would work these admirable effects.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation on death would pull down the plumes of <b>

    pride</b>; you are but <i>animated dust! </i>Shall dust and ashes be proud? 

    You body will be turned into grass—and shall shortly be mowed down!</p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on death would be a means to give a 

    death-wound to <b>sin</b>. No stronger antidote against sin, says Augustine, 

    than the frequent meditation on death. Am I now sinning—and tomorrow I may 

    be dying? what if death should take me doing the devil's work, would it not 

    send me to <i>him </i>to receive double pay! Carry the thoughts of death as 

    a book always about you, and when sin tempts, pull out this book, and read 

    in it—and you shall see sin will vanish. <i>We should look upon sin in two 

    looking-glasses—the glass of Christ's blood, and the glass of death.</i></p>

<p align="justify">3. Meditation on death would be a bridle for <b>

    intemperance</b>; shall I pamper that body which must lie down in the house 

    of rottenness? Our Savior at a feast breaks forth into mention of his 

    burial, Mat. 26. Feeding upon the <i>thoughts of death </i>would be an 

    excellent preservative against gluttony.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Meditation on death would make us use <b>time </b>

    better, and crowd up much work in a little space. Many meet in taverns to <i>

    trifle </i>away time; the apostle bids us <i>redeem </i>time. "Redeeming the 

    time." Our lives should be like jewels, though little in bulk, yet great in 

    worth. Some die young, yet with gray hairs upon them. We must be like grass 

    of the field, useful; not like grass of the house-top, which withers before 

    it is grown up. To live and not be serviceable, is not life—but wasting 

    life. </p>
<p align="justify">5. Meditation on death would spur us on in the pursuit 

    after holiness. Death is the great plunderer, it will shortly plunder us of 

    all our outward comforts. Our <i>feathers </i>of beauty and honor must be 

    laid in the dust—but death cannot plunder us of our graces. The commonwealth 

    of Venice, in their armory, have this inscription, "happy is he who in time 

    of <i>peace, </i>thinks of <i>war</i>." He who often meditates of death—will 

    make the best preparation for it.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 11. Meditate on the Day of JUDGMENT.</p>
</b></font><i>
<p align="justify">Feathers </p></i>float upon the water—but <i>gold </i>sinks 

    in it. Just so, light feathery professors float in vanity, they mind not the 

    day of judgment—but serious spirits sink deep into the meditation on it. 

    Most men put far away from them, the evil day, Amos 3:6. They report of the 

    Italians, that in a great thunder they use to ring the bells—that the sound 

    of their bells may drown the noise of the thunder. Just so, the devil 

    delights men with the <i>music of the world</i>, that the noise should drown 

    the noise of the day of judgment, and make them forget the sound of the last 

    trumpet. Most men are <i>guilty</i>, therefore they do not love to hear of 

    the day of judgment. When Paul preached of <i>judgment</i>, Felix trembled, 

    he had a bad conscience. Josephus tells us of Felix, that he was a wicked 

    man—the woman that lived with him (Drusilla) he enticed away from her 

    husband, and when he heard of judgment, he fell a trembling. Oh I beseech 

    you meditate upon this last and solemn day; while others are thinking how 

    they may get <i>riches</i>, let us bethink ourselves how we may fare on the 

    day of judgment.
<p align="justify">1. Meditation on the day of judgment would make us to 

    evaluate all our actions; Christ will come with his <i>fan </i>and his <i>

    sieve</i>. "Will this action of mine, bide the test at that great day.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on the last day would make us labor to 

    approve our hearts to God—the great judge of the world. It is no matter what

    <i>men </i>think of us—but what is our <i>Judge's </i>opinion of us? To <i>

    him </i>we must stand or fall. The galaxy, or milky way, as the astronomers 

    call it, is a bright circle in the heavens containing many stars—but they 

    are so small that they have no name, nor are they taken cognizance of by the 

    astrologers. Give me permission to apply it; possibly others may take no 

    notice of us; we are so small as to have no name in the world, yet if we are 

    true stars, and can approve our hearts to God, we shall hold up our heads 

    with boldness, when we come to stand before our Judge.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 12. Meditate upon HELL.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">1. Meditate upon the pain of <b>loss</b>, Matt. 25:10, 

    "and the door was shut." To have Christ's face veiled over, and a perpetual 

    eclipse and midnight in the soul; to be cast out of God's presence, in whose 

    presence is fullness of joy—this accentuates and embitters the condition of 

    the damned. It is like mingling <i>gall </i>with <i>wormwood</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditate upon the pain of <b>sense</b>. Psalm 9:17, 

    "The wicked shall be turned into hell." And here meditate of two things,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The place of hell. 2. The company.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditate on the PLACE of hell.</p></b></font> It is called 

    "a place of torment," Luke 16:28. There are two things especially in hell to 

    torment.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The FIRE.</p></b></font> Rev. 20:15. It is called a lake 

    of burning fire. Augustine, Peter Lombard, Gregory the Great, say, this fire 

    of hell is a material fire, though they say it is infinitely hotter than any 

    culinary fire—which is but <i>painted fire </i>compared to hell-fire. <i>I 

    wish none of us may experience what kind of fire it is! </i>I rather think 

    the fire of hell is partly material, and partly spiritual; the material fire 

    is to work upon the body, the spiritual to torture the soul. This is the 

    wrath of God, which is both fire and bellows; "who knows the power of your 

    anger?" Psalm 90:11.
<p align="justify">But it may be objected, if there is material fire in 

    hell, it will <i>consume </i>the bodies there. I answer, It shall <i>burn 

    without consuming</i>, as Moses' bush did, Exod. 3:2. The <i>power of God

    </i>silences all disputes. If God by his infinite power could make the fire 

    not to consume the three Hebrew children; cannot he make the fire of hell 

    burn and not consume? Augustine tells of a strange salt in Sicily, which if 

    it be put in the fire, swims; that God who can make salt, contrary to its 

    nature, swim in the fire—can make the bodies of the damned not consume in 

    the fire.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The WORM.</p></b></font> Mark 19:44, "Where the worm never 

    dies." Homer in his Odyssey feigns, that Titus' liver was gnawed by two 

    vultures in hell. This never-dying worm Christ speaks of, is the gnawing of 

    a guilty conscience. Melancthon calls it a hellish fury—they that will not 

    hear conscience <i>preaching</i>, shall feel conscience <i>gnawing</i>; and 

    so great is the extremity of these two, the fire which burns, and the worm 

    which bites, that there will follow "gnashing of teeth," Matt. 8:12, the 

    damned will gnash their teeth for horror and anguish. That must needs be sad 

    fare (as Latimer says) where <i>weeping </i>is served for the first course, 

    and <i>gnashing of teeth </i>for the second. To <i>endure </i>this hell will 

    be intolerable, to <i>escape </i>it will be impossible!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditate of the COMPANY in hell</p></b></font>—the devil 

    and his demons, Matt. 25:41. Job complains he was a companion to owls, 

    chapter 30:29. What will it be to be a companion to devils? Consider, 
<p align="justify">1. Their <i>ghastly deformity</i>—they make hell look 

    blacker. </p>
<p align="justify">2. Their <i>deadly antipathy</i>—they are fired with rage 

    against mankind. First they become <i>tempters</i>—then <i>tormentors</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Meditate much on hell. Let us go into hell by <i>

    contemplation</i>—that we may not go into hell by <i>condemnation</i>. How 

    restless and hopeless, is the condition of the damned! The ancients feign of 

    Endymion, that he got permission from Jupiter <i>always to sleep</i>. What 

    would the damned in hell give for such a license! In their pains is neither

    <i>intermission</i>, nor <i>mitigation</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The serious meditation on hell, would make us fear <i>

    sin </i>as hell. <i>Sin is hell's fuel! </i>Sin like Samson's foxes, carries 

    devouring fire in its tail.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on hell would cause <i>rejoicing </i>in a 

    child of God. The saint's fear of hell is like the two Marys' fear, Matt. 

    28:8, "They departed from the sepulcher with fear and great joy." A believer 

    may fear to think of the place of torment—but rejoice to think he shall 

    never come into that place. When a man stands upon a high rock, he trembles 

    to look down into the sea, yet he rejoices that he is not there struggling 

    with the waves. A child of God, when he thinks of hell, he rejoices with 

    trembling. A prison is not made for the king's son to be put in. A great 

    naturalist observes that nothing will so soon quench fire as <i>salt </i>and

    <i>blood</i>; but I am sure of this—the salt brinish tears of repentance, 

    and the blood of Christ will quench the fire of hell to a believer. Christ 

    himself has felt the pains of hell for you. <i>The Lamb of God being roasted 

    in the fire of God's wrath</i>—by this burnt-offering the Lord is now 

    appeased towards his people. Oh how may the godly rejoice! "There is no 

    condemnation to those who are in Christ!" Romans 8:1. When the Son of God 

    was in the furnace, Dan. 3:25, the fire did no hurt the three children. Just 

    so, Christ being for a time in the fiery furnace of God's wrath, that fire 

    can do a believer no hurt. The saints have the garment of Christ's 

    righteousness upon them, and the fire of hell can never singe this garment.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 13. Meditate upon HEAVEN.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">From the mount of <i>meditation</i>, as from mount <i>

    Nebo</i>, we may take a view and prospect of the <i>land of promise</i>. 

    Christ has taken possession of heaven in the name of all believers, Heb. 

    6:20, "Jesus, who went before us, has entered on our behalf." Heaven must 

    needs be a glorious city, which has God both for its <i>builder </i>and <i>

    inhabitant</i>. Heaven is the extract and quintessence of all blessedness. 

    There the saints shall have all their holy hearts can desire. Augustine 

    wished that he might have seen three things before he died, Rome in its 

    glory, Paul in the pulpit, and Christ in the flesh. But the saints shall see 

    a better sight; they shall see, not Rome—but heaven in its glory; they shall 

    see Paul, not in the pulpit—but on the throne, and shall sit with him; they 

    shall see Christ's flesh, not veiled over with infirmities and disgraces—but 

    in its spiritual embroidery; not a crucified—but a glorified body. They 

    shall "behold the king in his beauty," Isaiah 33:17. </p>
<p align="justify">What a glorious place will this be! In heaven "God will 

    be all in all," 1 Cor. 15:28, <i>beauty </i>to the eye, <i>music </i>to the 

    ears, <i>joy </i>to the heart; and this he will be to the poorest saint, as 

    well as the richest. O Christian, who are now at your hard labor, perhaps 

    following the plough—you shall sit on the throne of glory! Rev. 3:21. 

    Quintus Curtius writes of one who was digging in his garden, and was 

    suddenly made king, and a purple garment richly embroidered with gold put 

    upon him. Just so shall it be done to the poorest believer—he shall be taken 

    from his laboring work, and set at the right hand of God, having the crown 

    of righteousness upon his head!</p>
<p align="justify">Meditate often on the Jerusalem above.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation on heaven would excite and quicken 

    OBEDIENCE.</p></b></font> It would put spurs to our sluggish hearts, and make us 

    "abound in the work of God, knowing that our labor is not in vain in the 

    Lord," 1 Cor. 15:58. The <i>weight of glory </i>would not hinder us in our 

    race—but cause us to run the faster! This weight would add <i>wings </i>to 

    duty.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on heaven would make us strive after heart 

    PURITY,</p></b></font> because only the "pure in heart shall see God," Matt. 

    5:8. It is only a <i>clear </i>eye which can look on a bright transparent 

    object.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Meditation on heaven would be a pillar of SUPPORT 

    under our sufferings</p></b></font>. Heaven will make amends for all. One hour 

    in heaven will make us forget all our sorrows! The sun dries up the water; 

    just so—one beam of God's glorious face will dry up all our tears.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 14. Meditate on ETERNITY.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Millions of years stand only for <i>ciphers </i>in 

    eternity, and signify nothing. What an amazing word is <i>eternity!</i> 

    Eternity to the godly--is a day which has no sun-setting! Eternity to the 

    wicked--is a night which has no sun-rising! Eternity is a gulf which may 

    swallow up all our thoughts: Meditate on that scripture, "And they will go 

    away into eternal <i>punishment</i>, but the righteous will go into eternal

    <i>life</i>." Matthew 25:46. </p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditate upon eternal PUNISHMENT. </p></b></font>The <i>

    bitter cup</i> the damned drink of, shall never pass away from them. The 

    sinner and the furnace shall never be parted. God's vial of wrath will be 

    always dropping upon a wicked man. When you have reckoned up so many myriads 

    and millions of years, nay, <i>ages</i>—as have passed the bounds of all 

    arithmetic, eternity is not yet begun! This word <b>forever </b>breaks the 

    heart! If the tree falls hell-ward—there it lies to all eternity! Now is the 

    time of God's long-suffering, after death will be the time of the sinner's 

    long-suffering, when he shall "suffer the vengeance of eternal fire!" Jude 

    7.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditate upon eternal LIFE. </p></b></font>The soul that 

    is once landed at the heavenly shore, is past all storms. The glorified soul 

    shall be forever bathing itself in the rivers of pleasure. "You have made 

    known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, 

    with <i>eternal pleasures </i>at your right hand." Psalms 16:11. This is 

    what makes heaven to be heaven—"We shall be <i>forever </i>with the Lord!" 1 

    Thess. 4:17. Augustine says, "Lord, I am content to suffer any pains and 

    torments in this world—if I might see your face one day. But alas, were it 

    only a day, then to be ejected from heaven—it would rather be an aggravation 

    of misery!" But this word, "forever with the Lord," makes up the garland of 

    glory! A state of <i>eternity</i>, is a state of <i>security</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation on eternity, would make us very SERIOUS in 

    what we do. </p></b></font>Zeuxes being asked, why he took so long to paint a 

    picture, answered, "I paint for eternity." The thoughts of an irreversible 

    condition after this life, would make us <i>pray </i>and <i>live </i>as for 

    eternity.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on eternity, would make us overlook present 

    WORLDLY things—as flitting and fading.</p></b></font> What is this present 

    world, to him who has eternity in his eye? it is but nothing. He who thinks 

    of eternity will despise "the passing pleasures of sin."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Meditation on eternity would be a means to keep us 

    from envying the wicked's prosperity. </p></b></font>Here the wicked may be 

    "dressed in purple and fine linen, and live in luxury every day." But what 

    is this, compared to eternity? As long as there is such a thing as eternity, 

    God has time enough to reckon with all his enemies!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Section 15. Meditate upon your EXPERIENCES.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The last subject of meditation is your experiences. Look 

    over your receipts: </p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Has not God provided liberally for you, and given you 

    those spiritual mercies, which he has denied to others who are better than 

    you?</p></b></font> Here is an experience, Gen: 48:15. "The God who has fed me 

    all my days." You never <i>eat</i>—but mercy carves for you. You never go to 

    bed—but mercy draws the curtain, and sets a guard of angels about you. <b>

    Whatever you have, is out of the treasury of free grace! </b>Here is an 

    experience to meditate upon.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Has not God prevented many dangers—has he not kept 

    watch and ward about you? </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">1. What <b>temporal </b>dangers has God screened off? 

    Your neighbor's house on fire—but it has not kindled in your dwellings. 

    Another is infected with the plague—but you are healthy. Behold the <i>

    golden feathers of protection </i>covering you!</p>
<p align="justify">2. What <b>spiritual </b>dangers has God prevented? when 

    others have been <i>poisoned with error</i>, you have been preserved. God 

    has sounded a retreat to you; you have heard "a voice behind you saying—This 

    is the way, walk in it!" When you had enlisted yourself, and taken pay on 

    the devil's side—yet God has "plucked you as a brand out of the fire," 

    turned your heart, and now you espouse Christ's quarrel against sin. Behold

    <i>preventing </i>grace! Here is an experience to meditate upon.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Has not God <b>spared </b>you a long time? Why is it, 

    that others are struck dead in the act of sin—as Ananias and Sapphira—and 

    you are preserved as a monument of God's patience? </p>
<p align="justify">Here is an experience: God has done more for you than for 

    the fallen angels; he never granted them repentance—but he has waited for 

    you year after year, Isaiah 30:18. Therefore "will the Lord wait that he may 

    be gracious." He has not only <i>knocked </i>at your heart in the ministry 

    of the word—but he has <i>waited </i>at the door. How long has his Spirit 

    striven with you; like an importunate suitor, who after many denials, yet 

    will not give over the suit. Methinks I see JUSTICE with a sword in its hand 

    ready to strike! But MERCY steps in for the sinner, "Lord, have patience 

    with him a while longer!" Methinks I hear the angels say to God, as the king 

    of Israel once said to the prophet Elisha, 2 Kings 6:22, "Shall I smite 

    them? shall I smite them?" Methinks I hear the angels say, "Shall we take 

    off the head of such a drunkard, swearer, blasphemer?" But MERCY seems to 

    answer as the vine-dresser, Luke 13:8, "Let him alone this year," see if he 

    will repent. Is not here an experience worth meditating upon? <i>Mercy </i>

    turns <i>justice </i>into a rainbow; the rainbow is a bow indeed—but has no 

    arrow in it! That <i>justice </i>has been like the rainbow without an 

    arrow—that it has not shot you to death—here is a monument of patience to 

    read over and meditate upon.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Has not God often come in with <b>assisting grace</b>? 

    When he has bid you mortify such a lust, and you have said as Jehoshaphat, 2 

    Chron. 20:12, "I have no might against this great army!" Then God has come 

    in with auxiliary force, and "his grace has been sufficient." When God has 

    bid you pray for such a mercy, and you have found yourself very unfit; your 

    heart was at first dead and flat, all of a sudden you are carried above your 

    own strength; your tears drop, and your love flames! God has come in with 

    assisting grace. If the heart burns in prayer—God has struck the fire! The 

    Spirit has been <i>tuning </i>your soul, and now you make <i>sweet melody

    </i>in prayer. Here is an experience to meditate upon.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Has not God <b>vanquished Satan</b> for you? When the 

    devil has tempted to infidelity, to self-murder, when he would make you 

    believe either that your graces were but a fiction, or God's promise but a 

    counterfeit bond; yet you have not been <i>foiled by the tempter</i>—it is 

    God who has kept the garrison of your heart, else Satan's fiery darts would 

    have entered! Here is an experience to meditate on.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Have you not had many signal <b>deliverances</b>? When 

    you have been even at the gates of death, God has miraculously recovered 

    you, and renewed your strength as the eagle! May not you write that writing 

    which Hezekiah did? Isaiah 38:6, "The writing of Hezekiah King of Judah, 

    when he had been sick, and was <i>recovered </i>of his sickness." You 

    thought the <i>sun of your life </i>was quite setting—but God made this sun 

    turn back many degrees. Here is an experience for meditation to feed upon.

    </p>
<p align="justify">When you have been imprisoned by sin—your foot taken in 

    the snare, and the Lord has broken the snare, nay, has made those to break 

    it, who were the instruments of laying it—behold an experience to meditate 

    on! Oh let us often revolve in mind, our experiences. You who have rare 

    receipts of mercy—be often by meditation, looking over your receipts.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation on our experiences would raise us to 

    THANKFULNESS.</p></b></font> Considering that God has set a hedge of <i>

    providence </i>about us—he has strewed our way with roses—this would make us 

    take the harp and violin—and praise the Lord, (1 Chron. 16:4). And not only 

    praise—but record our blessings. The meditating Christian keeps a register 

    or chronicle of God's mercies, that their memory does not decay. God would 

    have the <i>manna </i>kept in the ark many hundred years, that the 

    remembrance of that miracle might be preserved; a meditating soul takes care 

    that the spiritual manna of an experience be kept safe.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation on our experiences would engage our hearts 

    to God in OBEDIENCE. </p></b></font>Mercy would be a <i>needle </i>to sew us to 

    him! We would cry out as Bernard, "I have, Lord, two mites—a soul and a 

    body—and I give them both to you."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Meditation on our experiences would serve to convince 

    us that GOD is no hard master</p></b></font>. We might bring in our experiences 

    as a sufficient confutation of that slander. When we have been <i>falling</i>—has 

    not God taken us by the hand? "When I said, 'My foot is slipping,' your 

    love, O Lord, supported me!" Psalm 94:18. How often has God supported our <i>

    head </i>and <i>heart—</i>when we have been fainting? And is he a hard 

    Master? Is there any Master besides God—who will wait upon his servants? 

    Christians, summon in your experiences. What spiritual enjoyments have you 

    had? What inward serenity and peace—which neither the world can give, nor 

    death take away! A Christian's own experiences may plead for God—against 

    those who desire to censure his ways rather than to try them; and to cavil 

    at them, rather than to walk in them.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Meditation on our experiences would make us 

    communicative to others.</p></b></font> We would be willing to tell our children 

    and acquaintances, what God has done for our souls— At such a time we were 

    brought low, and God raised us; at such a time in desertion, and God brought 

    a promise to remembrance which dropped in comfort. Meditation on God's 

    gracious dealing with us, would make us transmit and propagate our 

    experience to others, that the mercies of God shown to us, may bear a 

    plentiful crop of praise when we are dead and gone!
<p align="justify">So much for the subject <b>matter </b>of meditation; I 

    proceed next to the <b>necessity </b>of meditation.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    VII. Showing the NECESSITY of Meditation.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">It is not enough to <i>carry </i>'God's book' about 

    us—but we must <i>meditate </i>on it. The necessity of meditation will 

    appear in three particulars. </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The end why God has given us his Word written and 

    preached, is not only to <i>know </i>it—but that we should <i>meditate </i>

    in it.</p></b></font> The Scripture is a love letter which the great God has 

    written to us. We must not run it over in haste—but meditate upon God's <i>

    wisdom </i>in writing, and his <i>love </i>in sending it to us. Why does the 

    physician give his patient a remedy; is it only that he should read it over 

    and <i>know </i>the remedy—or that he should <i>apply </i>it? The end why 

    God communicates his gospel remedies to us, is, that we should apply them by 

    fruitful meditation. Do you think that God would ever have been at the pains 

    of writing his law with his own finger—only that we should have the <i>

    theory </i>and <i>notion </i>of it? Is it not that we should <i>meditate </i>

    on it? Would he ever have been at the cost to send abroad his ministers into 

    the world, to furnish them with gifts, Eph. 4, and must they for the work of 

    Christ be near unto death—that the Christians should only have an empty head 

    knowledge of the truths published? Is it <i>speculation </i>or <i>

    meditation—</i>which God aims at?
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The necessity of meditation appears in this, because 

    without it we can never be godly Christians</p></b></font>. A Christian without 

    meditation is like a soldier without weapons, or a workman without tools.

    
<p align="justify">Without meditation, the truths of God will not stay with 

    us. The <i>heart </i>is hard, and the <i>memory </i>slippery—and without <i>

    meditation </i>all is lost! Meditation imprints and fastens a truth in the 

    mind. Serious meditation is like the engraving of letters in gold or marble 

    which endures. Without meditation, all our preaching is but like writing in 

    sand, or like pouring water into a sieve. Reading and hearing without 

    meditation, is like weak medicine which will not work. Lack of meditation 

    has made so many sermons in this age, to have a miscarrying womb and dry 

    breasts!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Without meditation the truths which we know will never 

    affect our hearts.</p></b></font> Deut. 6:6, "These words which I command this 

    day shall be in your <i>heart</i>." How can the Word be in the heart—unless 

    it be wrought in by meditation? As an hammer drives a nail to the head—so 

    meditation drives a truth to the heart. It is not the taking in of food—but 

    the stomach's <i>digesting </i>it, which makes it turn into nourishment. 

    Just so, it is not the taking in of a truth at the ear—but the meditating on 

    it, which is the digestion of it in the mind, which makes it nourish. 

    Without meditation, the Word preached may increase <i>notion</i>, but not <i>

    affection</i>. There is as much difference between the knowledge of a truth, 

    and the meditation on a truth, as there is between the light of a torch, and 

    the light of the sun. Set up a lamp or torch in the garden, and it has no 

    influence. But the sun has a sweet influence, it makes the plants to grow, 

    and the herbs to flourish. Just so, knowledge is like a torch lighted in the 

    understanding, which has little or no influence—it does not make not a man 

    the better. But meditation is like the shining of the sun—it operates upon 

    the affections, it warms the heart and makes it more holy. Meditation 

    fetches <i>life </i>in a truth. There are many truths which lie, as it were, 

    in the heart dead—which when we meditate upon, they begin to have life and 

    heat in them. Meditation on a truth is like rubbing a man in a swoon—it 

    fetches life. <i>It is meditation, which makes a Christian!
</i><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Without meditation we make ourselves guilty of 

    slighting God and his Word.</p></b></font> If a man lets a thing lie aside, and 

    never minds it—it is a sign he slights it. God's Word is the book of life; 

    not to meditate in it—is to undervalue it. If a king puts forth an edict or 

    proclamation, and the subjects never mind it—it is a slighting of the king's 

    authority. God puts forth his law as a royal edict; if we do not meditate on 

    it, it is a slighting his authority, and contempt done to the divine 

    majesty!
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    VIII. Showing the reason WHY there are so few godly Christians.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Use 1. <b>Information</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">It gives us a true account why there are so few <i>godly

    </i>Christians in the world; namely, because there are so few <i>meditating

    </i>Christians. We have many who have <i>Bible ears</i>, they are swift to

    <i>hear</i>—but slow to <i>meditate</i>. This duty is grown almost out of 

    fashion, people are so much in the <i>shop</i>, that they are seldom on the

    <i>Mount </i>with God. Where is the meditating Christian? Where is he who 

    meditates on sin, hell, eternity, the recompense of reward—who takes a 

    prospect of heaven every day? Where is the meditating Christian? It is to be 

    bewailed in our times, that so many who go under the name of professors, 

    have banished godly discourse from their tables, and meditation from their 

    closets. Surely the hand of Joab is in this.</p>
<p align="justify">The devil is an enemy to meditation; he cares not how 

    much people <i>read </i>and <i>hear</i>; he knows that <i>meditation </i>is 

    a means to compose the heart, and bring it into a gracious frame. Satan is 

    content that you should be <i>hearing </i>and <i>praying </i>Christians, 

    just so long as you are not <i>meditating </i>Christians. He can stand your 

    small shot, provided you do not put in this bullet.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    IX. A REPROOF to such as do not Meditate in God's Word.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Of <b>reproof</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">It serves to reprove those who meditate indeed—but not in 

    the Word of God. They turn all their meditations the wrong way; like a man 

    who lets forth the water of his mill which should grind his corn, into the 

    highway, where it does no good. Just so, there are many who let out their 

    meditations upon other <i>fruitless things </i>which are in no way 

    beneficial to their souls.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The <i>farmer </i>meditates on his acres of land, not 

    upon his soul. His meditation is how he may improve a barren piece of <i>

    ground</i>, not how he may improve a barren mind; he will not let his <i>

    ground </i>lie fallow—but he lets his <i>heart </i>lie fallow; there is no 

    spiritual culture, not one seed of grace sown there.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The <i>physician </i>meditates upon his remedies—but 

    seldom on those remedies which the gospel prescribes for his salvation, 

    faith and repentance. Commonly the devil is physician to the physician, 

    having given him such stupefying drug, that for the most part he dies of a 

    lethargy.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The <i>lawyer </i>meditates upon the common law; but 

    as for God's law he seldom meditates in it either day or night. The lawyer 

    while he is meditating on his client's evidences, often forgets his own; 

    most have their spiritual evidences to <i>seek</i>, when they should have 

    them to <i>show</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The <i>tradesman </i>is for the most part meditating 

    upon his wares; his study is how he may increase his estate, and make the 

    ten talents into a hundred. He is "cumbered about many things;" he does not 

    meditate in the book of God's book—but in his account-book day and night. In 

    the long run you will see these were fruitless meditations, you will find 

    that you are but <i>golden beggars</i>, and have gotten but the <i>fool's 

    purchase </i>when you die, Luke 12:20.</p>
<p align="justify">5. There is another sort that meditate only upon <i>

    mischief</i>, "who devise iniquity," Mic. 2:1. They meditate how to defame 

    and to defraud; Amos 8:5, "They make the ephah small, and the shekel great." 

    The ephah was a measure used in buying, the shekel a weight used in selling. 

    Many who should <i>support</i>, too often <i>supplant </i>one another. And 

    how many meditate <i>revenge</i>? It is sweet to them as dropping honey. 

    "Their hearts shall meditate terror," Isaiah 38:18. The sinner is a felon to 

    himself, and God will make him a terror to himself.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    X. A holy PERSUASIVE to Meditation.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Use 3. Of <b>Exhortation</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">I am in the next place to exhort Christians to this so 

    necessary duty of meditation. If ever there were a duty I would press upon 

    you with more earnestness and zeal, it would be this, because so much of the 

    vitals and spirit of religion lies in it. The plant may as well bear fruit 

    without watering, the food may as well nourish without digesting, as we can

    <i>fructify in holiness </i>without meditation. God provides the food, 

    ministers can but cook and dress it for you—but it must be inwardly digested 

    by meditation. For lack of this you may cry out with the prophet, Isaiah 

    24:16, "My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me." O let me persuade such as 

    fear God, seriously to set upon this duty. If you have formerly neglected 

    it, bewail your neglect, and now begin to make conscience of it! Lock up 

    yourselves with God (at least once a day) by holy meditation. Ascend this 

    hill, and when you have gotten to the top of it—you shall see a fair 

    prospect—Christ and heaven before you. Let me put you in mind of that saying 

    of Bernard, "O saint, know you not that your husband Christ is bashful, and 

    will not be affectionate in company, retire yourself by meditation into the 

    closet, or the field, and there you shall have Christ's embraces." Cant. 

    7:11, 12, "Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field, there will I 

    give you my love." </p>
<p align="justify">O that I might invite Christians to this rare duty. Why 

    is it that you do not meditate in God's law? Let me expostulate the case 

    with you; what is the reason? Methinks I hear some say, "We are indeed 

    convinced of the necessity of the duty—but alas there are many things that 

    hinder!" There are two great objections that lie in the way, I shall remove 

    them, and then hope the better to persuade to this duty.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    XI. The answering of OBJECTIONS.</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">Objection 1. I have so much business in the world, that I 

    have no time to meditate.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer. The world indeed is a great enemy to meditation. 

    It is easy to lose one's purse in a crowd; and in a crowd of worldly 

    employments, it is easy to lose all the thoughts of God. So long as the 

    heart is an <i>Exchange</i>, I do not expect that it should be a <i>Temple</i>. 

    But, to answer the objection; have you so much business that you have no 

    time for meditation—as if piety were a minor matter—a thing fit only for 

    idle hours? What! No time to meditate! What is the business of your life—but 

    meditation? God never sent us into the world to get riches, (I speak not 

    against labor in a vocation) but I say this is not the end of our existence. 

    The errand God sent us into the world about, is salvation; and that we may 

    attain the end, we must use the means, namely, holy meditation. Now, have 

    you no time to meditate? just as if a farmer should say that he has so much 

    business, that he has no time to plough or sow; why, what is his occupation 

    but plowing and sowing! </p>
<p align="justify">What a madness is it to hear Christians say they have no 

    time to meditate? what is the business of their lives but meditation? O take 

    heed lest by growing rich, you grow worth nothing at last. Take heed that 

    God does not sue out the statute of bankruptcy against you, and you be 

    disgraced before men and angels. No time for meditation! You shall observe 

    that others in former ages have had as much business as you, and public 

    affairs to look after, yet they were called upon to meditate, Josh. 1:8. 

    "You shall meditate in this book of the Law." Joshua might have pleaded an 

    excuse, he was a soldier, a commander, and the care of marshaling his army 

    lay chiefly upon him, yet this must not take him off from piety; Joshua must 

    meditate in the book of God's law. God never intended that the great 

    business of piety should give way to a shop or farm; or that a <i>particular 

    vocation </i>should jostle out the <i>general duty</i> to holiness.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Objection. But this duty of meditation is hard. </p></b>To 

    set time apart every day to get the heart into a meditating frame is very 

    difficult; Gerson reports of himself, that he was sometimes three or four 

    hours before he could work his heart into a spiritual frame.
<p align="justify">Answer. Does this hinder? To this I shall give a 

    threefold reply.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The price that God has set heaven at, is labor. Our 

    salvation cost <i>Christ blood</i>, it may well cost <i>us sweat</i>. "The 

    kingdom of heaven suffers violence," Matt. 11:12. It is as a garrison which 

    holds out, and the duties of religion are the taking it by storm. A godly 

    Christian must offer violence to himself, (though not natural-self, yet 

    sinful-self.) Self is nothing but the flesh. The flesh cries out for ease, 

    it is a libertine! It is reluctant to take pains, reluctant to pray, to 

    repent—it is reluctant to put its neck under Christ's yoke! Now a Christian 

    must hate himself; no man ever yet hated his own flesh, Eph. 5:29. Yes, in 

    this sense he must hate his own flesh, "The lusts of the flesh," Romans 

    8:13. He must offer violence to himself by mortification and meditation. You 

    say that it is hard to meditate. Is it not harder to lie in hell?</p>
<p align="justify">2. We do not argue so in other things; riches are hard to 

    come by, therefore I will sit still and be without them. No!<i> Difficulty

    </i>is the whetstone of <i>industry</i>. How will men venture for gold? and 

    shall we not spend and be spent for that which is more precious than the 

    gold of Ophir? By meditation we suck out the quintessence of a promise.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Though while we are first entering upon meditation it 

    may seem hard, yet when once we are entered it is sweet and pleasant. 

    Christ's yoke at the first putting on, may seem heavy—but when once it is 

    on, it becomes easy; it is not a yoke, but a crown. "Lord," says Austin, 

    "the more I meditate on you, the sweeter you are to me!" According to holy 

    David, "My meditation on you shall be sweet," Psalm 104:34. The poets say 

    the top of Olympus was always quiet and serene. Just so, it is hard climbing 

    up the rocky hill of meditation—but when we are got up to the top, there is 

    a pleasant prospect, and we shall sometimes think ourselves even in heaven. 

    By holy meditation the soul does as it were, <i>breakfast with God </i>every 

    morning. When a Christian is upon the mount of meditation, he is like Peter 

    on the mount when Christ was transfigured, Matt. 17. He cries out, "Lord, it 

    is good to be here!" He is reluctant to go down the mount again. If you come 

    to him, and tell him of a purchase, he thinks you bid him to his loss!</p>
<p align="justify">What hidden manna does the soul taste, now that it is on 

    the mount! How sweet are the visits of God's Spirit! When Christ was alone 

    in the wilderness, then the angel came to comfort him. When the soul is 

    alone in holy meditation and prayer, then not an angel—but God's own Spirit 

    does come to comfort him. A Christian who meets with God in the mount, would 

    not exchange his hours of meditation for the most orient pearls or sparkling 

    beauties that the world can afford. No wonder David spent the whole day in 

    meditation, Psalm 119:97. Nay, as if the day had been too little, he borrows 

    a part of the night too, Psalm 63:6, "when I remember you upon my bed, and 

    meditate on you in the night watches." When others were sleeping, David was 

    meditating. He who is given much to meditation, shall with Sampson find a 

    honeycomb in this duty. Therefore let not the difficulty, discourage. The 

    pleasantness will infinitely countervail the pains.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    XII. Concerning OCCASIONAL Meditations.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Having removed these two objections out of the way, let 

    me again revive the exhortation to "meditate in God's law day and night." 

    And there are two sorts of meditation which I would persuade to—</p>
<p align="justify">1. Occasional, and 2. Deliberate.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. OCCASIONAL meditations</p></b></font>, such as are taken 

    up on any sudden occasion. There is nothing almost which occurs—but we may 

    presently raise some meditation upon. As a good herbalist extracts the 

    spirits and quintessence out of every herb, so a Christian may extract 

    matter of meditation, from every occurrence. A gracious heart, like fire, 

    turns all objects into fuel for meditation. I shall give you some instances. 

    When you look up to the <i>heavens</i>, and see them richly embroidered with 

    light, you may raise this meditation. If the <i>footstool </i>is so 

    glorious, what is the <i>throne </i>where God himself sits! When you see the 

    skies bespangled with stars, think, what is Christ The Bright Morning Star! 

    Monica, Augustine's mother, standing one day, and seeing the sun shine, 

    raised this meditation, "Oh! if the sun is so bright, what is the light of 

    God's presence?" When you hear <i>music </i>which delights the senses, 

    presently raise this meditation, "What music like a good conscience; this is 

    the bird of paradise within, whose chirping melody does enchant and ravish 

    the soul with joy!" He who has this music all day, may take David's pillow 

    at night, and say with that sweet singer, "I will lay me down in peace and 

    sleep," Psalm. 4:8. How blessed is he who can find heaven in his own bosom!

    
<p align="justify">When you are dressing yourselves in the morning, awaken 

    your meditation, think thus—but have I been dressing the hidden man of the 

    heart? <i>Have I looked at my heart in the glass of God's Word? </i>I have 

    put on my clothes—but have I put on Christ? it is reported of Pambo, that 

    seeing a gentlewoman dressing herself all the morning by her glass, he fell 

    a-weeping: "O says he, this woman has spent the morning in dressing her 

    body, and I sometimes spend scarcely an hour in dressing my soul!" When you 

    sit down to dinner, let your meditation feed upon this <i>first course</i>, 

    "How blessed are those who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God! What a 

    royal feast will that be, which God prepares! What a love-feast will that 

    be, where none shall be admitted but friends!"</p>
<p align="justify">When you go to bed at night, imagine thus, "Shortly I 

    shall put off the earthly clothes of my body, and make my bed in the grave!" 

    When you see the judge going to court, and hear the trumpet blow, think with 

    yourselves, as Hierom did, that you are still hearing that shrill trumpet 

    sounding in your ears, "Arise you dead and come to judgment!" When you see a 

    poor man going on the streets, raise this meditation, "Here is a walking 

    picture of Christ!" He had no place where to lay his head, Matt. 8:10. My 

    Savior became poor, that I through his poverty might be made rich!" When you 

    go to church, think thus, "I am now going to hear <i>God </i>speak, let me 

    not stop my ear; if I refuse to hear him speaking in his <i>Word</i>, I 

    shall next hear him speaking in his <i>wrath</i>!" Psalm 2:5. </p>
<p align="justify">When you walk abroad in your orchard, and see the plants 

    bearing, and the herbs nourishing, think how pleasing a sight it is to 

    God—to see a thriving Christian; how beautiful are the trees of 

    righteousness when they are hung full of fruit—when they abound in faith, 

    humility, knowledge! When you pluck a rose-bud in your gardens, raise this 

    contemplation, "How lovely are the early buddings of grace! God prizes a 

    Christian in the bud, he likes the <i>blooming of youth, </i>rather than the

    <i>shedding of old age!" </i>When you eat a grape from the tree, think of 

    Christ the true vine; how precious is the blood of that grape! such rare 

    clusters grow there, that the angels themselves delight to taste of!</p>
<p align="justify">It is said of Augustine, he was much in these extempore 

    meditations. A gracious heart, like the philosopher's magic stone, turns all 

    into gold—he has heavenly meditations from earthly occurrences. The skilled 

    chemist, when several metals are mingled together, can by his skill extract 

    the gold and silver from the baser metals. Just so, a Christian, by a divine 

    chemistry, can extract golden meditations from the various earthly objects 

    he beholds! Indeed it argues a spiritual heart, to turn everything to a 

    spiritual use; and we have Christ's own example for these occasional 

    meditations, John 4:7-14. While he sat on Jacob's well, he presently 

    meditates on that, and breaks forth into a most excellent discourse 

    concerning the water of life. So much for <i>occasional </i>meditations.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Be exhorted to DELIBERATE meditations</p></b></font>, 

    which are the chief. Set some time apart every day, that you may in a 

    serious and solemn manner converse with God in the mount: A godly man, is a 

    man set apart, Psalm 4:3, as God sets him apart by <i>election</i>, so he 

    sets him apart by <i>meditation</i>.
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    XIII. The fittest TIME for Meditation.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Question 1. What is the fittest time for meditation?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer. For the timing of it, it is rather hard to 

    prescribe, because of men's various callings and employments. But if I may 

    freely speak my thoughts, the <i>morning </i>is the fittest time for 

    meditation. The best time to converse with God is, when we may be most in 

    private, that is, before worldly concerns stand knocking as so many suitors 

    at the door to be let in. The morning is, as it were, the <i>cream of the 

    day</i>—let the cream be taken off, and let God have it. In the distilling 

    of strong-water, the first water that is drawn from the still is more full 

    of spirits, the second drawing is weaker; so the first meditations that are 

    stilled from the mind in a morning, are the best, and we shall find them to 

    be most full of life and spirits. The morning is the golden hour. God loved 

    the <i>first-fruits</i>, Exod. 23:19. "The first of the first-fruits you 

    shall bring into the house of the Lord." Let God have the first-fruits of 

    the day; the first of our thoughts must be reserved for heaven. The student 

    takes the morning for his study. The usurer gets up in the morning and looks 

    over his books of account: a Christian must begin with God in the morning. 

    David was with God before break of day, Psalm 119:147. "I rise <i>before 

    dawn </i>and cry out for help; I put my hope in Your Word."</p>
<p align="justify">Question 2. But why the morning for meditation?</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 1. Because in the morning the mind is fittest for 

    holy duties</p></b></font>; a Christian is most himself then. What <i>weary </i>

    devotion will there be at night when a man is even tired out with the 

    business of the day! He will be fitter to <i>sleep, </i>than to <i>meditate</i>. 

    The morning is the queen of the day; then the <i>imagination </i>is 

    quickest, the <i>memory </i>strongest, the <i>spirits </i>freshest, the body 

    most refreshed, having restored its strength by sleep. It is a sure rule, 

    then is the best time to serve God, when we find ourselves most in tune. In 

    the morning the heart is like a violin—strung and put in tune, and then it 

    makes the sweetest melody.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The morning thoughts stay longest with us the whole 

    day afterwards.</p></b></font> The wool takes the first dye best, and is not 

    easily worn out. When the mind receives the impression of good thoughts in 

    the morning, it holds this sacred dye the better; and like an ingrained 

    color, it will not easily be lost. The heart keeps the relish of morning 

    meditations, as a cup receives a tincture and savor of the wine which is 

    first put into it; or as linen in a cedar chest—which keeps the scent a 

    great while after. Perfume your mind with heavenly thoughts in the 

    morning—and it will not lose its spiritual fragrancy! Wind up your heart 

    towards heaven in the beginning of the day—and it will go the better all the 

    day afterwards. It is with receiving thoughts into the mind, as it is with 

    receiving guests into an inn—the first guests which come, will get the best 

    rooms in the house; if others come afterwards, they get the worse rooms. 

    Just so, when the mind entertains holy meditations for its morning-guests, 

    if afterwards earthly thoughts come, they are put into some of the worst 

    rooms—they lodge lowest in the affections. The best rooms are taken up in 

    the morning, for Christ. He who loses his heart in the morning, in the 

    world; will hardly find it again all the day after.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. It is a part of that solemn respect and honor we give 

    to God—to let him have the first thoughts of the day.</p></b></font> We give 

    people of quality, the best treatment—we let them take the first place. If 

    we honor God (whose name is reverend and holy) we will let the thoughts of 

    God take first place. When the <i>world </i>has the first of our thoughts, 

    it is a sign the world lies uppermost, we love it most. The first thing a 

    covetous man meditates on in the morning, is his money; a sign his gold lies 

    nearest to his heart. O! Christians, let God have your morning meditations. 

    He takes it in disdain, to have the world served before him. Suppose a king 

    and a criminal were to dine in the same room, and to sit at two tables; if 

    the criminal would have his food brought up, and be served first, the king 

    might take it in high disdain, and look upon it as a contempt done to his 

    person. When the <i>world </i>is served first, all our morning thoughts 

    attending it; and the Lord shall be put off with the <i>dregs of the day</i>, 

    when our thoughts begin to run low—is not this a contempt done to the God of 

    glory!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Equity requires it. </p></b></font>God deserves the first 

    of our thoughts; some of his first thoughts were upon us; we had a being in 

    his thoughts; before we had a being he thought upon us, Eph. 1:4. "Before 

    the foundations of the world." Before we fell, he was thinking how to raise 

    us. We had the morning of his thoughts. O! what thoughts of free grace, what 

    thoughts of peace has he had towards us! We have taken up his thoughts from 

    eternity; if we have had some of God's first thoughts, well may he have our 

    first thoughts.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. This is to imitate the pattern of the saints.</p></b></font>
<i>Job </i>rose early in the morning, and offered sacrifice, Job 1:5. David, 

    when he awaked, was with God, Psalm 139:17, and indeed this is the way to 

    have a morning blessing. "In the <i>morning </i>the <i>dew </i>fell," Exod. 

    16:13. The dew of a blessing falls <i>early</i>—now we are likeliest to have 

    God's company. If you would meet with a friend, you go early in the morning 

    before he be gone out. We read that the Holy Spirit came down upon the 

    apostles, Acts 2:3, 4, and it was in the morning, as may be gathered from 

    Peter's sermon, verse 15, it was but "the third hour of the day." The 

    morning is the time for fruitfulness, "In the morning shall you make your 

    seed to flourish," Isaiah 17:11. By morning meditation, we make the seed of 

    grace to flourish.
<p align="justify">I would not by this, wholly exclude <b>EVENING meditation</b>. 

    Isaac went out to meditate in the eventide, Gen. 24:63. When business is 

    over, and everything calm, it is good to take a turn with God in the 

    evening. God had his evening sacrifice, as well as his morning, Ex. 29:39. 

    As the <i>cream </i>at the top is sweet, so is the <i>sugar </i>at the 

    bottom; in two cases, the evening meditation does well.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In case such has been the urgency of business, that 

    you have time only for reading and prayer; then recompense the lack of the 

    morning meditation, with evening meditation.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In case you find yourself more inclinable to good 

    thoughts in the evening, for sometimes there is a greater impetus upon the 

    heart, a greater aptitude and tuneableness of mind, dare not neglect 

    meditation at such a time. Who knows but it may be a quenching the Spirit; 

    do not drive this blessed dove from the ark of your soul. In these cases 

    evening meditation is seasonable. But I say, if I may cast in my verdict, 

    the morning is to be preferred; as the flower of the sun opens in the 

    morning to take in the sweet beams of the sun, so open your soul in the 

    morning to take in the sweet thoughts of God. So much for the timing of 

    meditation.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    XIV. How LONG Christians should meditate.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Question 2. But how long should I meditate?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer. If we consider how long the world has, it is fit 

    that we give God at least one half hour every day. I shall only say this for 

    a general rule—meditate so long until you find your heart grow warm in this 

    duty.</p>
<p align="justify">If when a man is cold, you ask how long he should stand 

    by the fire? Surely, until he be thoroughly warm, and made fit for his work. 

    So, Christian, your heart is cold; never a day, no not the hottest day in 

    summer—but your heart freezes; now stand at the fire of meditation until you 

    find your affections warmed, and you are made fit for spiritual service. 

    David mused until his heart waxed hot within him, Psalm 39:3. I will 

    conclude this with that excellent saying of Bernard, "Lord, I will never 

    come away from you—without you." Let this be a Christian's resolution—not to 

    leave off his meditations of God until he finds something of God in him—some 

    "moving of affections after God," Cant. 5:4. Some "flamings of love," Cant. 

    6:8.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    XV. Concerning the USEFULNESS of Meditation.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Having answered these questions, I shall next show the <i>

    benefit </i>and <i>usefulness </i>of meditation. I know not any duty that 

    brings in greater income and revenue than this. It is reported of Thales, 

    that he left the affairs of state to become a contemplating philosopher. O! 

    did we know the advantage which comes by this duty, we would often retire 

    from the noise and hurry of the world, that we might give ourselves to 

    meditation.</p>
<p align="justify">The benefit of meditation appears in seven particulars.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation is an excellent means to profit by the 

    Word.</p></b></font> Reading may bring a truth into the <i>head</i>, meditation 

    brings it into the <i>heart!</i> It is better to meditate on one sermon—than 

    to hear five sermons. Many complain that they do not profit from sermons; 

    this may be the chief reason—because they chew not the cud—they do not 

    meditate on what they have heard. If an angel should come from heaven, and 

    preach to men, nay, if Jesus Christ himself were their preacher, they would 

    never profit without meditation. It is the settling of the milk that makes 

    it turn to cream; and it is the settling of a truth in the mind, that makes 

    it turn to spiritual nourishment. The bee sucks the flower, and then works 

    it in the hive, and makes honey of it. The hearing of a truth preached is 

    the sucking of a flower, there must be a working it in the <i>hive of the 

    heart </i>by meditation, then it turns to honey. There is a disease in 

    children called the rickets, when they have large heads—but their lower 

    parts are small and thrive not. Many professors have the <i>spiritual 

    rickets</i>, they have large heads, much knowledge—but yet they thrive not 

    in godliness, their heart is faint, their feet feeble, they don't walk 

    vigorously in the ways of God; and the cause of this disease is, the lack of 

    meditation. <b>Bible <i>knowledge </i>without <i>meditation</i>, makes us no 

    better than devils! </b>Satan is an angel of <i>light</i>, yet <i>black </i>

    enough.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation makes the heart serious, and then it is 

    ever best.</p></b></font> Meditation ballasts the heart; when the ship is 

    ballasted, it is not so soon overturned by the wind; and when the heart is 

    ballasted with meditation, it is not so soon overturned with vanity. Some 

    Christians have light hearts, Zeph. 3:4, "his prophets are light." A light 

    Christian will be blown into any opinion or vice; you may blow a feather any 

    way: there are many <i>feathery Christians</i>; the devil no sooner comes 

    with a temptation but they are ready to take fire. But meditation makes the 

    heart serious, and God says of a serious Christian, as David of Goliath's 

    sword, "there is none like that, give it to me." Meditation consolidates a 

    Christian; solid gold is best; the solid Christian is the only metal that 

    will pass current with God. The more <i>serious </i>the heart grows, the 

    more <i>spiritual</i>, and the more spiritual, the more it resembles the 

    Father of spirits. When a man is serious he is fittest for employment. The 

    serious Christian is fittest for service, and it is meditation which brings 

    the heart into this blessed frame.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Meditation is the bellows of the affections.</p></b></font> 

    Meditation hatches good affections, as the hen hatches her young ones by <i>

    sitting </i>on them. We light affection at this fire of meditation, "while I 

    was musing the fire burned," Psalm 39:3. David was meditating on mortality, 

    and see how his heart was affected with it, verse 4, "Lord, remind me how 

    brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered, and 

    that my life is fleeing away." <i>The reason our affections are so chill and 

    cold in spiritual things, is, because we do not warm ourselves more at the 

    fire of meditation. </i>Illumination makes us <i>shining </i>lamps, 

    meditation makes us <i>burning </i>lamps. What is it to know Christ by <i>

    speculation, </i>and not by <i>affection</i>? It is the proper work of 

    meditation to excite and blow up holy affections. What sparkling of love in 

    such a soul! When David had meditated on God's law, he could not <i>choose

    </i>it, but <i>love </i>it, Psalm 119:97. "O how love I your law! it is my 

    meditation all the day." When the spouse had by meditation viewed those 

    singular beauties in her beloved, white and ruddy, Cant. 5. she grew 

    lovesick, verse 8. Galeatius Caraccialus, that famous Marquis of Vico, who 

    had been much in the contemplation of Christ, breaks out into a holy pathos, 

    "Let their money perish with them, who esteem all the gold in the world 

    worth one hour's communion with Jesus Christ!"
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Meditation fits for holy duties.</p></b></font> The 

    musician first puts his instrument in tune—and then he plays a song. Just 

    so, meditation tunes the heart—and then it is fit for any holy service. As 

    the sails to the ship, so is meditation to duty, it carries on the soul more 

    swiftly.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation fits for HEARING.</p></b></font> When the 

    ground is softened by meditation, now is a fit time for the seed of the Word 

    to be sown.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Meditation fits for PRAYER.</p></b></font> Prayer is the 

    spiritual pulse of the soul, by which it beats strongly after God. There is 

    no living without prayer; a man cannot live—unless he breathes; no more can 

    the soul live—unless it breathes out its desires to God. Prayer <i>ushers in</i> 

    mercy, and prayer <i>sanctifies </i>mercy, it makes mercy to be mercy, 1 

    Tim. 4:5. Prayer has power over God, Hos. 12:4. Prayer comes with letters of 

    request to heaven. <i>Prayer is the spiritual leech—which sucks the poison 

    of sin out of the soul. </i>What a blessed (shall I say <i>duty </i>or) <i>

    privilege </i>is prayer! Meditation is a <i>help </i>to prayer; Gerson calls 

    it the <i>nurse </i>of prayer. Meditation is like oil to the lamp; the lamp 

    of prayer will soon go out unless meditation feeds it. Meditation and prayer 

    are like <i>two turtles-doves</i>—if you separate one, the other dies. A 

    skillful angler observes the time and season when the fish bite best, and 

    then he throws in his hook. Just so, when the heart is warmed by meditation, 

    now is the best season to throw in the hook of prayer, and fish for mercy. 

    After Isaac had been in the field meditating, he was fit for prayer when he 

    came home. When the gun is full of powder, it is fittest to discharge. So 

    when the mind is full of good thoughts, a Christian is fittest by prayer to 

    discharge, now he sends up whole volleys of sighs and groans to heaven. 
<p align="justify">Meditation has a double benefit in it—it pours <i>in</i>, 

    and pours <i>out</i>. First it pours good thoughts into the mind, and then 

    it pours out those thoughts again into prayer. Meditation first furnishes 

    with <i>matter </i>to pray, and then it furnishes with a <i>heart </i>to 

    pray, Psalm 39:3. "I was musing," says David, and the very next words are a 

    prayer, "Lord make me to know my end;" and Psalm 143:5, 6, "I muse on the 

    works of your hands, I stretch forth my hands to you;" the musing of his 

    head made way for the stretching forth of his hands in prayer. When Christ 

    was upon the mount, then he prayed. Just so, when the soul is upon the mount 

    of meditation, now it is in tune for prayer. <i>Prayer is the child of 

    meditation. </i>Meditation leads the van, and prayer brings up the rear.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Meditation fits for HUMILIATION. </p></b></font>When David 

    had been contemplating the works of creation, their splendor, harmony, 

    motion, influence—the plumes of pride fall off—and he begins to have 

    self-abasing thoughts, Psalm 8:3, 4. "When I consider the heavens, the work 

    of your fingers, the moon and stars which you have ordained—What is man that 

    you are mindful of him!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Meditation is a strong antidote against SIN.</p></b></font> 

    Most sin is committed for lack of meditation. Men often sin through 

    ignorance. Would they be so brutishly sensual as they are, if they did 

    seriously meditate upon what sin is? Would they take this <i>viper </i>in 

    their hand—if they did but consider its <i>sting</i>? Sin puts a worm into 

    conscience, a sting into death, and a fire into hell. Did men meditate on 

    this—that after all their dainty dishes, death will bring in the reckoning, 

    and they must pay the reckoning in hell—they would say as David in another 

    sense, "let me not eat of their dainties," Psalm 141:4. The <i>devil's apple

    </i>has a <i>bitter core </i>in it. Did men think of this—surely it would 

    put them into a cold sweat, and be as the angel's drawn sword to affright 

    them! <i>Meditation is a golden shield to beat back sin! </i>When Joseph's 

    mistress tempted him to wickedness, meditation did preserve him, "How can I 

    do this great wickedness and sin against God?" Meditation makes the heart 

    like wet tinder—it will not take the devil's fire!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Meditation is a cure of COVETOUSNESS.</p></b></font> The 

    covetous man is an idolater, Col. 3:5. Though he will not bow down to an 

    idol, yet he worships engraved images in his coins. Now meditation is an 

    excellent means to lessen our esteem of the world. Great things seem little 

    to him who stands high; if he could live among the stars—the earth would 

    seem as nothing. To a Christian who stands high upon the pinnacle of 

    meditation—how do all worldly things disappear, and seem as nothing to him! 

    He does not see in them, what men of the world see. He is gotten into his 

    tower, and heaven is his prospect. What is said of God, "He dwells on high, 

    he humbles himself to behold the things done on the earth," Psalm 113:6, I 

    may allude to with reverence. The Christian who dwells on high by 

    meditation, accounts it an abasing of himself, to look down upon the earth, 

    and behold the things done in this lower region. Paul, whose meditations 

    were sublime and seraphic, looked at things which were not seen, 2 Cor. 4 

    ult. How did he trample upon the world, how did he scorn it? "I am crucified 

    to the world," Gal. 6:14, as if he had said, "it is too much below me, to 

    mind it!" He who is catching at a crown, will not fish for minnows. A 

    Christian who is elevated by holy meditation, will not set his <i>heart </i>

    where his <i>feet </i>should be—upon the earth.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Holy meditation banishes vain and sinful thoughts.</p></b></font> 

    It purges the <i>imagination</i>, "How long shall vain thoughts lodge within 

    you," Jer. 4:14. <i>The mind is the shop where sin is first framed. </i>Sin 

    begins at the thoughts. The thoughts are the first plotters and contrivers 

    of evil. The mind and imagination are the stage where sin is first acted. 

    The malicious man acts over sin in his thoughts, he contemplates revenge. 

    The impure person acts over immorality in his thoughts, he contemplates 

    lust. The Lord humbles us for our contemplative wickedness, Proverbs 30:32. 

    "If you have <i>thought </i>evil, lay your hand upon your mouth." How much 

    sin do men commit in the chamber of their imagination? 
<p align="justify">Meditating in God's law would be a good means to banish 

    these sinful thoughts. If David had carried the book of the law about him, 

    and meditated in it, he would not have looked on Bathsheba with a lascivious 

    eye, 2 Sam. 2:11. Holy meditation would have quenched that wildfire of lust. 

    The Word of God is pure, Psalm 119:140, not only subjectively—but 

    effectively. It is not only pure in itself—but it makes them pure who 

    meditate in it. Christ whipped the buyers and sellers out of the temple, 

    John 2:15. Holy meditation would whip out idle and vagrant thoughts, and not 

    allow them to lodge in the mind. What is the reason the angels in heaven 

    have not one vain thought? They have a sight of God, their eye is never off 

    him. If the eye of the soul were fixed on God by meditation, how would vain 

    impure thoughts vanish! As when that woman was in the tower, and Abimelech 

    came near to the tower to have entered, but she threw a mill-stone out of 

    the tower upon him, and killed him, Judg, 9:52. Just so, when we have gotten 

    into the high tower of meditation, and sinful thoughts would come near to 

    enter, we may from this tower throw a millstone upon them, and destroy them. 

    And thus you have seen the benefit of meditation.</p>

<p align="justify"><br/>

    XVI. The EXCELLENCY of Meditation.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Aristotle places felicity, in the contemplation of the 

    mind. Meditation is highly commended by Augustine, Chrysostom, and 

    Cyprian—as the <i>nursery of piety</i>. Hierom calls it his <i>Paradise</i>. 

    With what words shall I set it forth? Other duties have done excellently—but 

    "you excel them all." Meditation is a friend to all the graces, it helps to 

    water the plantation. I may call it in Basil's expression, <i>the treasury 

    where all the graces are locked up</i>; and with Theophylact, <i>the very 

    gate and portal by which we enter into glory</i>. By meditation the spirits 

    are raised and heightened to a kind of angelic frame. Meditation sweetly 

    puts us in heaven, before we arrive there. Meditation brings God and the 

    soul together, 1 John 3:2.</p>
<p align="justify">Meditation is the saints' looking glass, by which they 

    see things invisible. Meditation is the golden ladder by which they ascend 

    to paradise. Meditation is the <i>spy</i> they send abroad to search the 

    land of promise, and it brings a cluster of the grapes of Eshcol with it. 

    Meditation is the dove they send out, and it brings an olive branch of peace 

    in its mouth. But who can tell how sweet honey is, save they that taste it? 

    The excellency of meditation I leave to <i>experienced </i>Christians, who 

    will say the comfort of it may be better <i>felt </i>than <i>expressed</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">To excite all to this so <i>useful</i>, <i>excellent </i>

    (I had almost said <i>angelic</i>) duty, let me lay down some divine motives 

    to meditation; and how glad would I be, if I might revive this duty among 

    Christians.</p>

<p align="justify"><br/>

    XVII. Divine MOTIVES to Meditation.</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Meditation manifests what a man really is.</p></b></font> 

    By this he may take a measure of his heart, whether it be good or bad. 

    Proverbs 23:7, "For as he thinks in his heart—so he is." As the meditation 

    is—such is the man. Meditation is the touchstone of a Christian, it shows 

    what metal he is made of. Meditation is a spiritual index. The index shows 

    what is in the book—so meditation shows what is in the heart. If all a man's 

    meditations are how he may get power against sin, how he may grow in grace, 

    how he may have more communion with God; this shows what is in his heart—the 

    frame of his heart is spiritual. By the beating of this pulse, judge of the 

    health of your soul. It is made the character of a godly man—that he fears 

    God, "and <i>thinks </i>on his name," Mal. 3:17. As are the thoughts—such is 

    the heart.
<p align="justify">But the thoughts of the ungodly are taken up with pride 

    and lust. "Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity," Isa, 59:7. When vain 

    sinful thoughts come, ungodly men make much of them, they make room for 

    them, they shall eat and lodge with them. But if a good thought happens to 

    come into their mind, it is soon turned out of doors, as an unwelcome guest; 

    this argues much unsoundness of heart. Let this provoke to holy meditation.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The thoughts of God, as they bring <i>delight </i>with 

    them—so they leave <i>peace </i>behind them. </p></b></font>Those are the best 

    hours which are spent with God. Conscience, as the bee, gives honey. It will 

    not grieve us when we come to die—that we have spent our time in holy 

    soliloquies and meditations. But what honor will the sinner have, when he 

    shall ask conscience the question as Joram did Jehu, 2 Kings 9:22, "Is it 

    peace, conscience, is it peace?" And conscience shall say as Jehu, "What 

    peace, as long as the whoredoms of your mother Jezebel, and her witchcrafts 

    are so many?" Oh how sad will it be with a man at such a time? Christians, 

    as you desire peace, "meditate in God's law day and night."
<p align="justify">This duty of meditation being neglected, the heart will 

    run wild, it will not be a <i>vineyard</i>—but a <i>wilderness</i>.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Meditation keeps the heart in a good spiritual health.</p></b></font> 

    It plucks up the weeds of sin, it prunes the wasteful branches, it waters 

    the flowers of grace, it sweeps all the walks in the heart, that Christ may 

    walk there with delight. For lack of holy meditation, the heart lies like 

    the sluggard's field, Proverbs 24:31, all overgrown with thorns and 

    briars—with unclean, earthly thoughts. It is rather <i>the devil's hog stye,

    </i>than <i>Christ's garden</i>. It is like a house fallen to ruin, fit only 

    for unclean spirits to inhabit.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The fruitlessness of all worldly meditations. </p></b>
</font>One man lays out his thoughts about laying up money; his meditations 

    are how to raise himself in the world, and when he has arrived at an estate, 

    often God blows upon it, Hag. 1:9. His care is for his child, and perhaps 

    God takes it away, or if it lives, it proves a cross. Another meditates how 

    to satisfy his ambition, "Honor me before the people," 1 Sam. 15:30. Alas, 

    what is honor—but a meteor in the air; a torch lighted by the <i>breath </i>

    of people, with the least puff blown out! How many live to see their names 

    buried before them? When this sun is in its meridian splendor—it soon sets 

    in a <i>cloud</i>.
<p align="justify">Thus fruitless are those meditations which do not center 

    upon God. It is but to carry dust against the wind. But especially at death; 

    then a man sees all those thoughts which were not spent upon God, to be 

    fruitless, Psalm 146:4. "In that very day his thoughts perish." I may allude 

    to it in this sense—all worldly, vain thoughts, in that day of death perish, 

    and come to nothing! What good will the whole globe of the world do at such 

    a time? Those who have reveled out their thoughts in impertinences, will but 

    be the more disquieted; it will cut them to the heart, to think how they 

    have spun a fool's thread!</p>
<p align="justify">A Scythian captain having, for a draught of water, 

    yielded up the city, cried out, "What have I lost!" So will it be with that 

    man when he comes to die, who has spent all his meditations upon the world; 

    he will say, "What have I lost! I have lost heaven, I have betrayed my 

    soul!" And should not the consideration of this fix our minds upon the 

    thoughts of God and glory? All other meditations are fruitless; like a piece 

    of ground which has much cost laid out upon it—but it yields no crop.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Holy meditation is never lost.</p></b></font> <i>God has a 

    pen </i>to write down all our good thoughts, Mal. 3:5. "A book of 

    remembrance was written for those who thought upon his name." God has all 

    our meditations written in his book. God pens our closet devotion.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">6. See the blessedness affixed to the meditating 

    Christian. </p></b></font>"<i>Blessed </i>is the man who does not walk in the 

    counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of 

    mockers. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and <i>on his law he 

    meditates day and night." </i>Psalm 1:1-2. Say not it is hard to meditate. 

    It brings much blessedness. Lycurgus could draw the Lacedemonians to do 

    anything, by giving them <i>rewards</i>. If ungodly men can meditate with 

    delight on that which will make them cursed; shall not we meditate on that 

    which will make us blessed? nay, in the Hebrew it is in the plural, <i>

    blessednesses</i>, we shall have one blessedness upon another.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Delightful meditation in God's law is the best way for 

    a man to prosper in his estate. </p></b></font>Josh. 1:8. "This book of the law 

    shall not depart out of your mouth—but you shall meditate therein; for then 

    shall you make your way prosperous." I leave this to their consideration who 

    are desirous to thrive in the world; and let this serve for a motive to 

    meditation.
<p align="justify">The next thing remaining, is to lay down some rules about 

    meditation.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

    XVIII. RULES concerning Meditation.</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 1. When you go to meditate—be very SERIOUS in the 

    work.</p></b></font> Let there be a deep impression upon your soul. That you may 

    be serious in meditation, do these two things: 
<b>
<p align="justify">1. </p></b>Get yourself into a posture of holy reverence. 

    Over-awe your heart with the thoughts of God, and the incomprehensibleness 

    of his Majesty. When you are at the work of meditation, remember you are now 

    to deal with GOD. If an <i>angel </i>from heaven did appoint to meet you at 

    such an hour, would you not prepare yourself with all seriousness and 

    solemnity, to meet him? Behold—a greater than an angel is here; the God of 

    glory is present! He has an eye upon you, he sees the state of your heart 

    when you are alone. Think with yourself, O Christian, when you are going to 

    meditate—that you are now to deal with him in private—before whom the angels 

    adore, and the devils tremble! Think with yourself, that you are now in his 

    presence before whom you must shortly stand and all the world with you—to 

    receive their everlasting sentence. You must die, and how soon you know not; 

    from the <i>closet </i>to the <i>tribunal</i>.
<b>
<p align="justify">2. </p></b>That your heart may be serious in meditation, 

    labor to possess your thoughts with the solemnity and greatness of the work 

    you are now going about. As David said concerning his building a house for 

    God—the work is great, 1 Chron. 29:1. So it may be said of meditation—the 

    work is great, and we had need gather and rally together all the powers of 

    the soul to the work! If you were to set about a work wherein your life was 

    concerned, how serious would you be in the thoughts of it? In the business 

    of meditation, your soul is concerned; eternity depends upon it! If you 

    neglect it, or are slight in it—it will have eternal consequences. If 

    Archimedes was so serious in drawing his mathematical line, that he minded 

    not the sacking of the city; O how serious should a Christian be when he is 

    drawing a line for eternity! <i>When you are going to meditate, you are 

    going to the greatest work in the world!
</i><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule. 2. READ before you meditate. </p></b></font>"Do not let 

    this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, 

    so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be 

    prosperous and successful." Joshua 1:8. Read before you meditate. The Law 

    must be in Joshua's mouth; he was first to read--and then meditate. 
<p align="justify">"Give attendance to reading," 1 Timothy 4:13. Then it 

    follows, "meditate on these things," verse 15. Reading furnishes the mind 

    with matter. Reading is the oil which feeds the lamp of meditation. Reading 

    helps to rectify meditation. Augustine well says that, "meditation without 

    reading will be erroneous." Naturally, the mind is defiled, and will be 

    minting thoughts; and how many untruths does it mint! Therefore first read 

    in the book of the Law—and then meditate! Be sure your meditations are 

    grounded upon Scripture.</p>
<p align="justify">There is a strange Utopia in the imaginations of some 

    men; they take those for true principles, which are false; and if they 

    mistake their principles they must needs be wrong in their meditations. Thus 

    the mind having laid in wrong principles--the meditation must be erroneous, 

    and a man at last goes to hell upon a mistake! Therefore be sure you read 

    before you meditate--that you may say, "it is written!" Meditate on nothing 

    but what you believe to be a truth; believe nothing to be a truth, but what 

    can show its letters of credence from the Word.</p>
<p align="justify">Observe this rule--let reading usher in meditation. <i>

    Reading without meditation—is unfruitful! Meditation without reading—is 

    dangerous!</i></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 3. Do not multiply the subjects of meditation. </p></b>
</font>That is, meditate not on too many things at once; like the bird that 

    hops from one branch to another, and stays in no one place. Single out 

    rather some one topic at a time, which you will meditate upon. Too much 

    variety distracts. One truth driven home by meditation, will most greatly 

    affect the heart! A man that is to shoot, sets up one target which he aims 

    at to hit. When you are to shoot your mind above the world by meditation, 

    set one thing before you to hit! If you are to meditate on the passion of <i>

    Christ</i>, let that take up all thoughts! If you are to meditate upon <i>

    death</i>, confine your thoughts to that. One subject at a time is enough. 

    Martha while she was cumbered about <i>many </i>things, neglected the <i>one 

    needful </i>thing; so while our meditations are taken up about many things, 

    we lose that one thing which should affect our hearts, and do us more good. 

    Drive but one wedge of meditation at a time—but be sure you drive it home to 

    the heart. Those who aim at a whole flock of birds hit none. Several 

    medicines taken together, the one hinders the virtue of the other; whereas a 

    single medicine might do good.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 4. To meditation, join EXAMINATION.</p></b></font> When 

    you have been meditating on any spiritual subject, put an enquiry to your 

    soul, and though it is short, let it be serious. "O my soul, is it thus with 

    you—or not?" When you have been meditating about the <i>fear of God</i>—that 

    it is the "beginning of wisdom"—make an enquiry, "O my soul, is this fear 

    planted in your heart? You are almost come to the end of your days, are you 

    yet come to the beginning of wisdom?" When you have been meditating on 

    Christ, his virtues, his privileges, make an enquiry, "O my soul, do you 

    love him who is so lovely; and are you ingrafted into him? Are you a living 

    branch of this living vine?" When you have been meditating upon the graces 

    of the Spirit, make an enquiry, "O my soul, are you adorned as the bride of 

    Christ with this chain of pearl? Have you your certificate for heaven ready? 

    Will my graces be to <i>seek, </i>when I should have them to <i>show</i>?" 

    Thus should a Christian in his retirements, parley often with his heart.
<p align="justify">For lack of this examination, meditation evaporates and 

    comes to nothing. For lack of examination while in meditation, many are 

    strangers to their own hearts; though they live known to others, they die 

    unknown to themselves. <i>Meditation </i>is like a telescope by which we 

    contemplate heavenly objects; but <i>self-examination </i>is like a looking 

    glass by which we see into our own souls, and can judge how it is with us.

    <i>Meditation </i>joined with <i>examination</i>, is like the sun on the 

    dial, which shows how the day goes, it shows us how our hearts stand 

    affected to spiritual things.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 5. Seal up meditation with PRAYER. </p></b></font>Pray 

    over your meditations. Prayer sanctifies everything; without prayer they are 

    but unhallowed meditations. <i>Prayer fastens meditation upon the soul. </i>

    Prayer is a tying a <i>knot </i>at the end of meditation—so that it does not 

    slip. Pray that God will keep those holy meditations in your mind forever, 

    that the savor of them may abide upon your hearts, 1 Chron. 29:18. "O Lord, 

    keep this desire in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts 

    loyal to you." So let us pray, that when we have been musing on heavenly 

    things, and our hearts have waxed hot within us, we may not cool into a 

    sinful tepidness and lukewarmness—but that our affections may be as the lamp 

    of the sanctuary—always burning.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Rule 6. The last rule is, let meditation be reduced to 

    PRACTICE.</p></b></font> Live out your meditation. "Do not let this Book of the 

    Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be

    <i>careful to <b>do </b>everything written in it. </i>Then you will be 

    prosperous and successful." Joshua 1:8. Meditation and practice, like two 

    sisters, must go hand in hand. Cassian says, that "the contemplative life 

    cannot be perfected without the practice." We read that the angels had <i>

    wings</i>, and <i>hands </i>under their wings, Ezek. 1:8. It may be an 

    emblem of this truth; Christians must not only fly upon the wing of 

    meditation—but they must be active in obedience, they must have <i>hands </i>

    under their <i>wings</i>! The end of meditation is <i>action</i>. We must 

    not only <i>meditate </i>in God's law—but <i>walk </i>in his law, Deut. 

    28:9. Without this, we are like those Gnostics, who had much knowledge—but 

    were licentious in their lives. Christians must be like the sun, which does 

    not only send forth heat—but goes its <i>circuit </i>round the world. It is 

    not enough that the affections are heated by meditation—but we must go our 

    circuit too, that is, move regularly in the sphere of obedience. After 

    warming at the fire of <i>meditation</i>, we must be fitter for <i>work</i>. 

    Meditation is the life of piety; and practice is the life of meditation. It 

    is said in the honor of Gregory Nazianzen, that <i>he lived out his own 

    sermons</i>. So a godly Christian must live out his own meditations. For 

    instance: 
<p align="justify">1. When you have been meditating on <b>sin</b>, which, 

    for its <i>bitterness</i>, is compared to grapes of gall; for its <i>

    damnableness </i>to poison of asps, and you begin to burn in a holy 

    indignation against sin—now put your meditations in practice—give sin a bill 

    of divorce, Job 11:14. "If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and 

    let not wickedness dwell in your tabernacles."</p>
<p align="justify">2. When you have been meditating on the <b>graces </b>of 

    the Spirit, let the verdure and luster of these graces be seen in you. Live 

    these graces. Meditate, "that you may observe and do." It was Paul's counsel 

    to Timothy, "<i>Exercise </i>yourself to godliness." Meditation and practice 

    are like a pair of compasses, the one part of the compass fixes upon the 

    center, and the other part goes round the circumference. Just so, a 

    Christian by meditation fixes upon God as the center, and by practice goes 

    around the circumference of the commandments.</p>
<p align="justify">A man who has let his thoughts run out upon riches, will 

    not only have them in the <i>notion</i>—but will endeavor to <i>get </i>

    riches. Let your meditation be practical. When you have been meditating upon 

    a <i>promise</i>, live upon a promise. When you have been meditating on a 

    good conscience, never leave until you can say as Paul, "Herein I exercise 

    myself, to have a good conscience," Acts 24:16. Beloved, here lies the very 

    essence of true religion.</p>
<p align="justify">That this rule may be well observed, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is only the <i>practical </i>part of religion, 

    which will make a man blessed. Meditation is a beautiful flower—but Rachel 

    said to her husband: "Give me children or I die," Gen. 30:1. So, If 

    meditation is barren, and does not bring forth the <i>child of obedience</i>—it 

    will die and come to nothing!</p>
<p align="justify">2. If when you have <i>meditated </i>in God's law, you do 

    not <i>obey </i>his law, you will come short of those who have come short of 

    heaven. It is said of Herod, Mark 6:20, "He <i>did </i>many things;" he was 

    in many things a practicer of John's ministry. Those who meditate in God's 

    law, and do not practice it, are not so good as Herod. Nay, they are no 

    better than the devil; he <i>knows </i>much—but still he is a devil.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Meditation without practice will increase a man's 

    condemnation. If a father writes a letter to his son, and the son shall <i>

    read </i>over this letter, and <i>study </i>it—yet not <i>do </i>as his 

    father writes, this would be an aggravation of his fault, and would but 

    provoke his father the more against him. Thus when we have meditated upon 

    the <i>evil of sin</i>, and the<i> beauty of holiness</i>—yet we do not 

    eschew the one, nor espouse the other, it will but incense the divine 

    Majesty so much the more against us, and we shall "be beaten with <i>many

    </i>stripes."</p>
