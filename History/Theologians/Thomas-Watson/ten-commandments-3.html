          And God spake all these words, saying, I am the LORD thy God,' &amp;c.
          Exod 20: 1, 2.
        </p>
        <p>What is the preface to the Ten Commandments?</p>
        <p>The preface to the Ten Commandments is, I am the Lord thy God.'</p>
        <p>
          The preface to the preface is, God spake all these words, saying,'
          &amp;c. This is like the sounding of a trumpet before a solemn
          proclamation. Other parts of the Bible are said to be uttered by the
          mouth of the holy prophets (Luke 1: 70), but here God spake in his own
          person.
        </p>
        <p>
          How are we to understand that, God spake, since he has no bodily parts
          or organs of speech?
        </p>
        <p>
          God made some intelligible sound, or fanned a voice in the air, which,
          to the Jews was as though God himself was speaking to them. Observe:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The lawgiver. God spake.' There are two things requisite in a
          lawgiver. Wisdom. Laws are founded upon reason; and he must be wise
          that makes laws. God, in this respect, is most fit to be a lawgiver:
          he is wise in heart.' Job 9: 4. He has a monopoly of wisdom. The only
          wise God.' 1 Tim 1: 17. Therefore he is the fittest to enact and
          constitute laws. Authority. If a subject makes laws, however wise they
          may be, they want the stamp of authority. God has the supreme power in
          his hand: he gives being to all; and he who gives men their lives, has
          most right to give them their laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The law itself. All these words.' That is, all the words of the
          moral law, which is usually styled the decalogue, or ten commandments.
          It is called the moral law because it is the rule of life and manners.
          The Scripture, as Chrysostom says, is a garden, and the moral law is
          the chief flower in it: it is a banquet, and the moral law is the
          chief dish in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moral law is perfect. The law of the Lord is perfect.' Psa 19: 7.
          It is an exact model and platform of religion; it is the standard of
          truth, the judge of controversies, the pole-star to direct us to
          heaven. The commandment is a lamp.' Prov 6: 23. Though the moral law
          be not a Christ to justify us, it is a rule to instruct us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moral law is unalterable; it remains still in force. Though the
          ceremonial and judicial laws are abrogated, the moral law delivered by
          God's own mouth is of perpetual use in the church. It was written in
          tables of stone, to show its perpetuity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moral law is very illustrious and full of glory. God put glory
          upon it in the manner of its promulgation. The people, before the
          moral law was delivered, were to wash their clothes, whereby, as by a
          type, God required the sanctifying of their ears and hearts to receive
          the law. Exod 19: 10. There were bounds set that none might touch the
          mount, which was to produce in the people reverence to the law. Exod
          19: 12. God wrote the law with his own finger, which was such an
          honour put upon the moral law, as we read of no other such writing.
          Exod 31: 18. God by some mighty operation, made the law legible in
          letters, as if it had been written with his own finger. God's putting
          the law in the ark to be kept was another signal mark of honour put
          upon it. The ark was the cabinet in which He put the ten commandments,
          as ten jewels. At the delivery of the moral law, many angels were in
          attendance. Deut 33: 2. A parliament of angels was called, and God
          himself was the speaker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. Here we may notice God's goodness, who has not left us
          without a law. He often sets down the giving his commandments as a
          demonstration of his love. He has not dealt so with any nation: and as
          for his judgements they have not known them.' Psa 147: 20. Thou gavest
          them true laws, good statutes and commandments.' Neh 9: 13. What a
          strange creature would man be if he had no law to direct him! There
          would be no living in the world; we should have none born but Ishmaels
          -- every man's hand would be against his neighbour. Man would grow
          wild if he had not affliction to tame him, and the moral law to guide
          him. The law of God is a hedge to keep us within the bounds of
          sobriety and piety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. If God spake all these words of the moral law, then it
          condemns: (1) The Marcionites and Manichees, who speak lightly, yea,
          blasphemously, of the moral law; who say it is below a Christian, it
          is carnal; which the apostle confutes, when he says, The law is
          spiritual, but I am carnal.' Rom 7: 14. (2) The Antinomians, who will
          not admit the moral law to be a rule to a believer. We say not that he
          is under the curse of the law, but the commands. We say not the moral
          law is a Christ, but it is a star to lead to Christ. We say not that
          it saves, but sanctifies. They who cast God's law behind their backs,
          God will cast their prayers behind his back. They who will not have
          the law to rule them, shall have the law to judge them. (3) The
          Papists, who, as if God's law were imperfect, and when he spake all
          these words he did not speak enough, add to it their canons and
          traditions. This is to tax God's wisdom, as if he knew not how to make
          his own law. This surely is a high provocation. If any man shall add
          to these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written
          in this book.' Rev 22: 18. As it is a great evil to add anything to a
          man's sealed will, so much more to add anything to the law which God
          himself spake, and wrote with his own fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use three. If God spake all the words of the moral law, several duties
          are enjoined upon us: (1) If God spake all these words, then we must
          hear all these words. The words which God speaks are too precious to
          be lost. As we would have God hear all our words when we pray, so we
          must hear all his words when he speaks. We must not be as the deaf
          adder, which stoppeth her ears: he that stops his ears when God cries,
          shall cry himself, and not be heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) If God spake all these words, then we must attend to them with
          reverence. Every word of the moral law is an oracle from heaven. God
          himself is the preacher, which calls for reverence. If a judge gives a
          charge upon the bench, all attend with reverence. In the moral law God
          himself gives a charge, God spake all these words;' with what
          veneration, therefore, should we attend! Moses put off his shoes from
          his feet, in token of reverence, when God was about to speak to him.
          Exod 3: 5, 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3)If God spake all these words of the moral law, then we must
          remember them. Surely all God speaks is worth remembering; those words
          are weighty which concern salvation. It is not a vain thing for you,
          because it is your life.' Deut 32: 47. Our memory should be like the
          chest in the ark where the law was kept. God's oracles are ornaments,
          and shall we forget them? Can a maid forget her ornaments?' Jer 2: 32.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) If God spake all these words, then believe them. See the name of
          God written upon every commandment. The heathens, in order to gain
          credit to their laws, reported that they were inspired by the gods at
          Rome. The moral law fetches its pedigree from heaven. Ipse dixit. God
          spake all these words. Shall we not give credit to the God of heaven?
          How would the angel confirm the women in the resurrection of Christ?
          Lo (said he), I have told you.' Matt 28: 7. I speak in the word of an
          angel. Much more should the moral law be believed, when it comes to us
          in the word of God. God spake all these words.' Unbelief enervates the
          virtue of God's word, and makes it prove abortive. The word did not
          profit, not being mixed with faith.' Heb 4: 2. Eve gave more credit to
          the devil when he spake than she did to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) If God spake all these words, then love the commandments. Oh, how
          love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.' Psa 119: 97.
          Consider how I love thy precepts.' Psa 119: 159. The moral law is the
          copy of God's will, our spiritual directory; it shows us what sins to
          avoid, what duties to pursue. The ten commandments are a chain of
          pearls to adorn us, they are our treasury to enrich us; they are more
          precious than lands of spices, or rocks of diamonds. The law of thy
          mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.' Psa 119:
          72. The law of God has truth and goodness in it. Neh 9: 13. Truth, for
          God spake it; and goodness, for there is nothing the commandment
          enjoins, but it is for our good. O then, let this command our love.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) If God spake all these words, then teach your children the law of
          God. These words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thy
          heart, and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children.' Deut
          6: 6, 7. He who is godly, is both a diamond and a loadstone: a diamond
          for the sparkling of his grace, and a loadstone for his attractive
          virtue in drawing others to the love of God's precepts. Vir bonus
          magis aliis prodest quam sibi [A good man benefits others more than
          himself]. You that are parents, discharge your duty. Though you cannot
          impart grace to your children, yet you may impart knowledge. Let your
          children know the commandments of God. Ye shall teach them your
          children.' Deut 11: 19. You are careful to leave your children a
          portion: leave the oracles of heaven with them; instruct them in the
          law of God. If God spake all these words, you may well speak them over
          again to your children.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7) If God spake all these words, the moral law must be obeyed. If a
          king speaks, his word commands allegiance; much more, when God speaks,
          must his words be obeyed. Some will obey partially, obey some
          commandments, not others; like a slough, which, when it comes to a
          stiff piece of earth, makes a baulk; but God, who spake all the words
          of the moral law, will have all obeyed. He will not dispense with the
          breach of one law. Princes, indeed, for special reasons, sometimes
          dispense with penal statutes, and will not enforce the severity of the
          law; but God, who spake all these words, binds men with a subpoena to
          yield obedience to every law.
        </p>
        <p>
          This condemns the church of Rome, which, instead of obeying the whole
          moral law, blots out one commandment, and dispenses with others. They
          leave the second commandment out of their catechism, because it makes
          against images; and to fill up the number of ten, they divide the
          tenth commandment into two. Thus, they incur that dreadful
          condemnation: If any man shall take away from the words of this book,
          God shall take away his part out of the book of life.' Rev 22: 19. As
          they blot out one commandment, and cut the knot which they cannot
          untie, so they dispense with other commandments. They dispense with
          the sixth commandment, making murder meritorious in case of
          propagating the Catholic cause. They dispense with the seventh
          commandment, wherein God forbids adultery; for the Pope dispenses with
          the sin of uncleanness, yea, incest, by paying fines and sums of money
          into his coffer. No wonder the Pope takes men off their loyalty to
          kings and princes, when he teaches them disloyalty to God. Some of the
          Papists say expressly in their writings, that the Pope has power to
          dispense with the laws of God, and can give men license to break the
          commandments of the Old and New Testament. That such a religion should
          ever again get foot in England, the Lord in mercy prevent! If God
          spake all the commandments, then we must obey all; he who breaks the
          hedge of the commandments, a serpent shall bite him.
        </p>
        <p>But what man can obey all God's commandments?</p>
        <p>
          To obey the law in a legal sense -- to do all the law requires -- no
          man can. Sin has cut the lock of original righteousness, where our
          strength lay; but, in a true gospel-sense, we may so obey the moral
          law as to find acceptance. This gospel obedience consists in a real
          endeavour to observe the whole moral law. I have done thy
          commandments' (Psa 119: 166); not, I have done all I should do, but I
          have done all I am able to do; and wherein my obedience comes short, I
          look up to the perfect righteousness and obedience of Christ, and hope
          for pardon through his blood. This is to obey the moral law
          evangelically; which, though it be not to satisfaction, yet it is to
          acceptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We come now to the preface itself, which consists of three parts: I. I
          am the Lord thy God'; II. which have brought thee out of the land of
          Egypt'; III. out of the house of bondage'.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I am the Lord thy God. Here we have a description of God; (1) By
          his essential greatness, I am the Lord;' (2) By his relative goodness,
          Thy God.'
        </p>
        <p>
          By his essential greatness, I am the Lord:' or, as it is in the
          Hebrew, JEHOVAH. By this great name God sets forth his majesty.
          Sanctius habitum fuit, says Buxtorf. The name of Jehovah was had in
          more reverence among the Jews than any other name of God. It signifies
          God's self-sufficiency, eternity, independence, and immutability.
          Mal.3: 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. If God be Jehovah, the fountain of being, who can do what he
          will, let us fear him. That thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful
          name, Jehovah.' Deut 28: 58.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. If God be Jehovah, the supreme Lord, the blasphemous Papists
          are condemned who speak after this manner: Our Lord God the Pope.' Is
          it a wonder the Pope lifts his triple crown above the heads of kings
          and emperors, when he usurps God's title, showing himself that he is
          God'? 2 Thess 2: 4. He seeks to make himself Lord of heaven, for he
          will canonise saints there; Lord of earth, for with his keys he binds
          and looses whom he pleases; Lord of hell, for he frees men out of
          purgatory. God will pull down these plumes of pride; he will consume
          this man of sin with the breath of his mouth, and the brightness of
          his coming.' 2 Thess 2: 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is described by his relative goodness; thy God.' Had he called
          himself Jehovah only, it might have terrified us, and made us flee
          from him; but when he says, thy God,' it allures and draws us to him.
          This, though a preface to the law, is pure gospel. The word Eloeha,
          thy God,' is so sweet, that we can never suck all the honey out of it.
          I am thy God,' not only by creation, but by election. This word, thy
          God,' though it was spoken to Israel, is a charter which belongs to
          all the saints. For the further explanation, here are three questions.
        </p>
        <p>How comes God to be our God?</p>
        <p>
          Through Jesus Christ. Christ is a middle person in the Trinity. He is
          Emmanuel, God with us.' He brings two different parties together:
          makes our nature lovely to God, and God's nature lovely to us; by his
          death, causes friendship, yea, union; and brings us within the verge
          of the covenant, and thus God becomes our God.
        </p>
        <p>What is implied by God being our God?</p>
        <p>
          It is comprehensive of all good things. God is our strong tower; our
          fountain of living water; our salvation. More particularly, being our
          God implies the sweetest relations.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The relation of a father. I will be a Father unto you;' 2 Cor 6:
          18. A father is full of tender care for his child. Upon whom does he
          settle the inheritance but his child? God being our God, will be a
          father to us; a Father of mercies,' 2 Cor 1: 3; The everlasting
          Father.' Isa 9: 6. If God be our God, we have a Father in heaven that
          never dies.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) It imports the relation of a husband. Thy Maker is thine husband.'
          Isa 54: 5. If God be our husband, he esteems us precious to him, as
          the apple of his eye. Zech 2: 8. He imparts his secrets to us. Psa 25:
          14. He bestows a kingdom upon us for our dowry. Luke 12: 32.
        </p>
        <p>How may we know that by covenant union, God is our God?</p>
        <p>
          (1) By having his grace planted in us. Kings' children are known by
          their costly jewels. It is not having common gifts which shows we
          belong to God; many have the gifts of God without God; but it is grace
          that gives us a true genuine title to God. In particular, faith is
          vinculum unionis, the grace of union, by which we may spell out our
          interest in God. Faith does not, as the mariner, cast its anchor
          downwards, but upwards; it trusts in the mercy and blood of God, and
          trusting in God, engages him to be our God. Other graces make us like
          God, faith makes us one with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) We may know God is our God by having the earnest of his Spirit in
          our hearts.2 Cor 1: 22. God often gives the purse to the wicked, but
          the Spirit only to such as he intends to make his heirs. Have we had
          the consecration of the Spirit? If we have not had the sealing work of
          the Spirit, have we had the healing work? Ye have an unction from the
          Holy One.' 1 John 2: 20. The Spirit, where it is, stamps the impress
          of its own holiness upon the heart; it embroiders and bespangles the
          soul, and makes it all glorious within. Have we had the attraction of
          the Spirit? Draw me, we will run after thee.' Cant 1: 4. Has the
          Spirit, by its magnetic virtue, drawn our hearts to God? Can we say, O
          thou whom my soul loveth?' Cant 1: 7. Is God our paradise of delight?
          our Segullah, or chief treasure! Are our hearts so chained to God that
          no other object can enchant us, or draw us away from him? Have we had
          the elevation of the Spirit? Has it raised our hearts above the world?
          The Spirit lifted me up.' Ezek 3: 14. Has the Spirit made us, superna
          anhelare, seek the things above where Christ is? Though our flesh is
          on earth, is our heart in heaven? Though we live here, trade we above?
          Has the Spirit thus lifted us up? By this we may know that God is our
          God. Where God gives his Spirit for an earnest, there he gives himself
          for a portion.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) We may know God is our God, if he has given us the hearts of
          children. Have we obediential hearts? Psa 27: 8. Do we subscribe to
          God's commands when his commands cross our will? A true saint is like
          the flower of the sun, which opens and shuts with the sun: he opens to
          God, and shuts to sin. If we have the hearts of children, God is our
          Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) We may know God is ours, and we have an interest in him, by
          standing up for his interest. We shall appear in his cause and
          vindicate his truth, wherein his glory is so much concerned.
          Athanasius was the bulwark of truth; he stood up for it, when most of
          the world were Asians. In former times the nobles of Polonia, when the
          gospel was read, laid their hands upon their swords, signifying that
          they were ready to defend the faith, and hazard their lives for the
          gospel. There is no better sign of having an interest in God than
          standing up for his interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) We may know God is ours, and we have an interest in him, by his
          having an interest in us. My beloved is mine, and I am his.' Cant 2:
          16. When God says to the soul, Thou art mine;' the soul answers, Lord,
          I am thine; all I have is at thy service; my head shall be thine to
          study for thee; my tongue shall be thine to praise thee.' If God be
          our God by way of donation, we are his by way of dedication; we live
          to him, and are more his than we are our own. Thus we may come to know
          that God is our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. Above all things, let us get this great charter confirmed,
          that God is our God. Deity is not comfortable without propriety. Let
          us labour to get sound evidences that God is our God. We cannot call
          health, liberty, estate, ours; but let us be able to call God ours,
          and say as the church, God, even our own God, shall bless us.' Psa 67:
          6. Let every soul labour to pronounce this Shibboleth, My God.' That
          we may endeavour to have God for our God, consider the misery of such
          as have not God for their God, in how sad a condition are they, when
          the hour of distress comes! This was Saul's case when he said I am
          sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is
          departed from me.' 1 Sam 28: 15. A wicked man in time of trouble, is
          like a vessel tossed on the sea without an anchor, which strikes on
          rocks or sands. A sinner who has not God to be his God, may make a
          shift while health and estate last, but when these crutches on which
          he leaned are broken, his heart must sink. It is with him as it was
          with the old world when the flood came. The waters at first came to
          the valleys, but then the people would get to the hills and mountains;
          but when the waters came to the mountains, then there might be some
          trees on the high hills, and they would climb up to them; ay, but the
          waters rose above the tops of the trees; and then their hearts failed
          them, and all hopes of being saved were gone. So it is with a man that
          has not God to be his God. If one comfort be taken away, he has
          another; if he lose a child, he has an estate; but when the waters
          rise higher, death comes and takes away all, and he has nothing to
          help himself with, no God to go to, he must needs die in despair. How
          great a privilege it is to have God for our God! Happy is that people
          whose God is the Lord.' Psa 144: 15. Beatitudo hominis est Deus [Man's
          happiness is God himself]. Augustine. That you may see the privilege
          of this charter: --
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) If God be our God, then though we may feel the stroke of evil, yet
          not the sting. He must needs be happy who is in such a condition, that
          nothing can hurt him. If he lose his name, it is written in the book
          of life; if he lose his liberty, his conscience is free; if he lose
          his estate, he is possessed of the pearl of price; if he meets with
          storms, he knows where to put in for harbour; God is his God, and
          heaven is his heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) If God be our God, our soul is safe. The soul is the jewel, it is
          a blossom of eternity. I was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my
          body;' in the Chaldee, it is in the midst of my sheath.' Dan 7: 15.
          The body is but the sheath; the soul is the princely part of man,
          which sways the sceptre of reason; it is a celestial spark, as
          Damascene calls it. If God be our God, the soul is safe, as in a
          garrison. Death can do no more hurt to a virtuous heaven-born soul,
          than David did to Saul, when he cut off the skirt of his garment. The
          soul is safe, being hid in the promises; hid in the wounds of Christ;
          hid in God's decree. The soul is the pearl, and heaven is the cabinet
          where God will lock it up safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) If God be our God, then all that is in God is ours. The Lord says
          to a saint in covenant, as the king of Israel to the king of Syria, I
          am thine, and all that I have.' 1 Kings 20: 4. So saith God, I am
          thine:' how happy is he who not only inherits the gift of God, but
          inherits God himself! All that I have shall be thine; my wisdom shall
          be thine to teach thee; my power shall be thine to support thee; my
          mercy shall be thine to save thee. God is an infinite ocean of
          blessedness, and there is enough in him to fill us: as if a thousand
          vessels were thrown into the sea, there is enough in the sea to fill
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) If God be our God, he will entirely love us. Property is the
          ground of love. God may give men kingdoms, and not love them; but he
          cannot be our God, and not love us. He calls his covenanted saints,
          Jediduth Naphshi, The dearly beloved of my soul.' Jer 12: 7. He
          rejoiceth over them with joy, and rests in his love. Zeph 3: 17. They
          are his refined silver (Zech 13: 9); his jewels (Mal 3: 17); his royal
          diadem (Isa 62: 3). He gives them the cream and flower of his love. He
          not only opens his hand and fills them, but opens his heart and fills
          them. Psa 145: 16.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) If God be our God, he will do more for us than all the world
          besides can. What is that? He will give us peace in trouble. When
          there is a storm without, he will make music within. The world can
          create trouble in peace, but God can create peace in trouble. He will
          send the Comforter, who, as a dove, brings an olive-branch of peace in
          his mouth. John 14: 16. God will give us a crown of immortality. The
          world can give a crown of gold, but that crown has thorns in it and
          death in it; but God will give you a crown of glory that fadeth not
          away.1 Pet.5: 4. The garland made of the flowers of paradise never
          withers.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) If God be our God, he will bear with many infirmities. He may
          respite sinners awhile, but long forbearance is no acquittance; he
          will throw them to hell for their sins; but if he be our God, he will
          not for every failing destroy us; he bears with his spouse as with the
          weaker vessel. He may chastise. Psa 89: 32. He may use the rod and the
          pruning-knife, but not the bloody axe. He has not beheld iniquity in
          Jacob.' Numb 23: 21. He will not see sin in his people so as to
          destroy them, but their sins so as to pity them. He sees them as a
          physician a disease in his patient, to heal him. I have seen his ways,
          and will heal him.' Isa 57: 18. Every failing does not break the
          marriage-bond asunder. The disciples had great failings, they all
          forsook Christ and fled; but this did not break off their interest in
          God; therefore, says Christ, at his ascension, Tell my disciples, I go
          to my God and to their God.'
        </p>
        <p>
          (7) If God be once our God, he is so for ever. This God is our God for
          ever and ever.' Psa 48: 14. Whatever worldly comforts we have, they
          are but for a season, and we must part with all. Heb 11: 25. As Paul's
          friends accompanied him to the ship, and there left him (Acts 20: 38),
          so all our earthly comforts will but go with us to the grave, and
          there leave us. You cannot say you have health, and shall have it for
          ever; you have a child, and shall have it for ever; but if God be your
          God, you shall have him for ever. This God is our God for ever and
          ever.' If God be our God, he will be a God to us as long as he is a
          God. Ye have taken away my gods,' said Micah. Judges 18: 14. But it
          cannot be said to a believer, that his God is taken away; He may lose
          all things else, but cannot lose his God. God is ours from everlasting
          in election, and to everlasting in glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          (8) If God be our God, we shall enjoy all our godly relations with him
          in heaven. The great felicity on earth is to enjoy relations. A father
          sees his own picture in a child; and a wife sees herself in her
          husband. We plant the flower of love among our relations, and the loss
          of them is like the pulling off a limb from the body. But if God be
          ours, with the enjoyment of God we shall enjoy all our pious relations
          in glory. The gracious child shall see his godly father, the virtuous
          wife shall see her religious husband in Christ's arms; and then there
          will be a dearer love to relations than there ever was before, though
          in a far different manner; then relations shall meet and never part.
          And so shall we be ever with the Lord.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. To such as can realise this covenant union we have several
          exhortations.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) If God be our God, let us improve our interest in him, let us cast
          all our burdens upon him: the burden of our fears, our wants and our
          sins. Cast thy burden upon the Lord.' Psa 55: 22. Wicked men who are a
          burden to God have no right to cast their burden upon him; but such as
          have God for their God are called upon to cast their burden on him.
          Where should the child ease all its cares but in the bosom of its
          parent? Let all thy wants lie upon me.' Judges 19: 20. So God seems to
          say to his children, Let all your wants lie upon me.' Christian, what
          troubles thee? Thou hast a God to pardon thy sins and to supply thy
          wants; therefore roll your burden on him. Casting all your care upon
          him.' 1 Pet 5: 7. Why are Christians so disquieted in their minds?
          They are taking care when they should be casting care.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) If God be our God, let us learn to be contented, though we have
          the less of other things. Contentment is a rare jewel, it is the cure
          of care. If we have God to be our God, well may we be contented. I
          know whom I have believed.' 2 Tim 1: 12. There was Paul's interest in
          God. As having nothing, and yet possessing all things.' 2 Cor 6: 10.
          Here was his content. That such who have covenant-union with God may
          be filled with contentment of spirit, consider what a rich blessing
          God is to the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is bonum sufficiens, a sufficient good. He who has God has enough.
          If a man be thirsty, bring him to a spring, and he is satisfied; in
          God there is enough to fill the heaven-born soul. He gives grace and
          glory.' Psa 84: 11. There is in God not only a sufficiency, but a
          redundancy; he is not only full as a vessel, but as a spring. Other
          things can no more fill the soul than a mariner's breath can fill the
          sails of a ship; but in God there is a cornucopia, an infinite
          fulness; he has enough to fill the angels, therefore enough to fill
          us. The heart is a triangle, which only the Trinity can fill.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is bonum sanctificans, a sanctifying good. He sanctifies all our
          comforts and turn them into blessings. Health is blessed, estate is
          blessed. He gives with the venison a blessing. I will abundantly bless
          her provision.' Psa 132: 15. He gives us the life we have, tanquam
          arrhabo, as an earnest of more. He gives the little meal in the barrel
          as an earnest of the royal feast in paradise. He sanctifies all our
          crosses. They shall not be destructive punishments, but medicines;
          they shall corrode and eat out the venom of sin; they shall polish and
          refine our grace. The more the diamond is cut, the more it sparkles.
          When God stretches the strings of his viol, it is to make the music
          better.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is bonum selectum, a choice good. All things, sub sole, are but
          bona scabelli, as Augustine says, the blessings of the footstool, but
          to have God himself to be ours, is the blessing of the throne. Abraham
          gave gifts to the sons of the concubines, but he settled the
          inheritance upon Isaac. Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.' Gen
          25: 5. God may send away the men of the world with gifts, a little
          gold and silver; but in giving us himself, he gives us the very
          essence, his grace, his love, his kingdom: here is the crowning
          blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is bonum summum, the chief good. In the chief good there must be
          delectability; it must have something that is delicious and sweet: and
          where can we suck those pure essential comforts, which ravish us with
          delight, but in God? In Deo quadam dulcedine delectatur anima, immo
          rapitur [In God's character there is a certain sweetness which
          fascinates or rather enraptures the soul]. At thy right hand there are
          pleasures.' Psa 16: 11: In the chief good there must be transcendence,
          it must have a surpassing excellence. Thus God is infinitely better
          than all other things. It is below the Deity to compare other things
          with it. Who would weigh a feather against a mountain of gold? God is
          fons et origo, the spring of all entities, and the cause is more noble
          than the effect. It is God that bespangles the creation, that puts
          light into the sun, that fills the veins of the earth with silver.
          Creatures do but maintain life, God gives life. He infinitely
          outshines all sublunary glory. He is better than the soul, than
          angels, and than heaven. In the chief good, there must be not only
          fulness, but variety. Where variety is wanting we are apt to nauseate.
          To feed only on honey would breed loathing; but in God is all variety
          of fulness. Col 1: 19. He is a universal good, commensurate to all our
          wants. He is bonum in quo omnia bona [the good in which is every
          good], a son, a portion, a horn of salvation. He is called the God of
          all comfort.' 2 Cor 1: 3. There is a complication of all beauties and
          delights in him. Health has not the comfort of beauty, nor beauty of
          riches, nor riches of wisdom; but God is the God of all comfort. In
          the chief good there must be eternity. God is a treasure that can
          neither be drawn low, nor drawn dry. Though the angels are continually
          spending what is his, he can never be spent; he abides for ever.
          Eternity is a flower of his crown. Now, if God be our God, there is
          enough to let full contentment into our souls. What need we of
          torchlight, if we have the sun? What if God deny the flower, if he has
          given us the jewel? How should a Christian's heart rest on this rock!
          If we say God is our God, and we are not content, we have cause to
          question our interest in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) If we can clear up this covenant-union, that God is our God, let
          it cheer and revive us in all conditions. To be content with God is
          not enough, but to be cheerful. What greater cordial can you have than
          union with Deity? When Jesus Christ was ready to ascend, he could not
          leave a richer consolation with his disciples than this, I ascend to
          my God and to your God.' John 20: 17. Who should rejoice, if not they
          who have an infinite, all-sufficient, eternal God to be their portion,
          who are as rich as heaven can make them? What though I want health? I
          have God who is the health of my countenance, and my God. Psa 42: 11.
          What though I am low in the world? If I have not the earth, I have him
          that made it. The philosopher comforted himself by saying, Though I
          have no music or vine-trees, yet here are the household gods with me;'
          so, though we have not the vine or fig-tree, yet we have God with us.
          I cannot be poor, says Bernard, as long as God is rich; for his riches
          are mine. O let the saints rejoice in this covenant-union! To say God
          is ours, is more than to say heaven is ours, for heaven would not be
          heaven without him. All the stars cannot make day without the sun; all
          the angels, those morning stars, cannot make heaven without Christ the
          Sun of Righteousness. And as to have God for our God, is matter of
          rejoicing in life, so especially it will be at death. Let a Christian
          think thus, I am going to my God. A child is glad when he is going
          home to his father. It was Christ's comfort when he was leaving the
          world, I ascend to my God.' John 20: 17. And this is a believer's
          deathbed cordial, I am going to my God; I shall change my place, but
          not my kindred; I go to my God and my Father.'
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) If God be our God, let us break forth into praise. Thou art my
          God, and I will praise thee.' Psa 118: 28. Oh, infinite, astonishing
          mercy, that God should take dust and ashes into so near a bond of love
          as to be our God! As Micah said, What have I more?' Judges 18: 24. So,
          what has God more? What richer jewel has he to bestow upon us than
          himself? What has he more? That God should put off most of the world
          with riches and honour, that he should pass over himself to us by a
          deed of gift, to be our God, and by virtue of this settle a kingdom
          upon us! O let us praise him with the best instrument, the heart; and
          let this instrument be screwed up to the highest pitch. Let us praise
          him with our whole heart. See how David rises by degrees. Be glad in
          the Lord, and rejoice, and shout for joy.' Psa 32: 11. Be glad, there
          is thankfulness; rejoice, there is cheerfulness; shout, there is
          triumph. Praise is called incense, because it is a sweet sacrifice.
          Let the saints be choristers in God's praises. The deepest springs
          yield the sweetest water; the more deeply sensible we are of God's
          covenant-love to us, the sweeter praises we should yield. We should
          begin here to eternise God's name, and do that work on earth which we
          shall be always doing in heaven. While I live will I praise the Lord.'
          Psa 146: 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) Let us carry ourselves as those who have God to be our God; that
          is, walk so that others may see there is something of God in us. Live
          homily. What have we to do with sin, which if it does not break, will
          weaken our interest? What have I to do any more with idols?' Hos 14:
          8. So would a Christian say, God is my God; what have I to do any more
          with sin, with lust, pride, malice! Bid me commit sin! As well bid me
          drink poison. Shall I forfeit my interest in God? Let me rather die
          than willingly offend him who is the crown of my joy, the God of my
          salvation.'
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt. Egypt and the
          house of bondage are the same; only they are represented to us under
          different expressions. The first expression is, Which have brought
          thee out of the land of Egypt.'
        </p>
        <p>Why does the Lord mention the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Because of the strangeness of the deliverance. God delivered his
          people Israel by strange signs and wonders, by sending plague after
          plague upon Pharaoh, blasting the fruits of the earth, and killing all
          the first-born in Egypt. Exod 12: 29. When Israel marched out of
          Egypt, God made the waters of the sea to part, and become a wall to
          his people, while they went on dry ground; and he made the same sea a
          causeway to Israel, and a grave to Pharaoh and his chariots. Well
          might the Lord make mention of this strange deliverance. He wrought
          miracle upon miracle for the deliverance of that people.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) God mentions Israel's deliverance out of Egypt because of the
          greatness of the deliverance. He delivered Israel from the pollutions
          of Egypt. Egypt was a bad air to live in, it was infected with
          idolatry; the Egyptians were gross idolaters; they were guilty of that
          which the apostle speaks of in Rom 1: 23. They changed the glory of
          the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and
          to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.' The Egyptians,
          instead of the true God, worshipped corruptible man; they deified
          their king Apis, forbidding all, under pain of death, to say that he
          was a man. They worshipped birds, as the hawk. They worshipped beasts,
          as the ox. They made the image of a beast to be their god. They
          worshipped creeping things, as the crocodile, and the Indian mouse.
          God mentions it therefore as a signal favour to Israel, that he
          brought them out of such an idolatrous country. I brought thee out of
          the land of Egypt.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing I would note is, that it is no small blessing to be
          delivered from places of idolatry. God speaks of it no less than ten
          times in the Old Testament, I brought you out of the land of Egypt;'
          an idolatrous place. Had there been no iron furnace in Egypt, yet so
          many altars being there, and false gods, it was a great privilege to
          Israel to be delivered out of Egypt. Joshua reckons it among the chief
          and most memorable mercies of God to Abraham, that he brought him out
          of Ur of the Chaldees, where Abraham's ancestors served strange gods.
          Josh 24: 2, 3. It is well for the plant that is set in a bad soil, to
          be transplanted to a better, where it may grow and flourish; so it is
          a mercy when any who are planted among idolaters, are removed and
          transplanted into Zion, where the silver drops of God's word make them
          grow in holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherein does it appear to be so great a blessing to be delivered from
          places of idolatry?
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) It is a great mercy, because our nature is prone to idolatry.
          Israel began to be defiled with the idols of Egypt. Ezek 22: 3. Dry
          wood is not more prone to take fire than our nature is to idolatry.
          The Jews made cakes to the queen of heaven, that is, to the moon. Jer
          7: 15.
        </p>
        <p>Why is it that we are prone to idolatry?</p>
        <p>
          Because we are led much by visible objects, and love to have our
          senses pleased. Men naturally fancy a god that they may see; though it
          be such a god that cannot see them, yet they would see it. The true
          God is invisible; which makes the idolater worship something that he
          can see.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) It is a mercy to be delivered from idolatrous places, because of
          the greatness of the sin of idolatry, which is giving that glory to an
          image which is due to God. All divine worship God appropriates to
          himself; it is a flower of his crown. The fat of the sacrifice is
          claimed by him. Lev 3: 3. Divine worship is the fat of the sacrifice,
          which he reserves for himself. The idolater devotes this worship to an
          idol, which the Lord will by no means endure. My glory will I not give
          to another, neither my praise to graven images.' Isa 42: 8. Idolatry
          is spiritual adultery. With their idols have they committed adultery.'
          Ezek 23: 37. To worship any other than God, is to break wedlock, and
          makes the Lord disclaim his interest in a people. Plead with your
          mother, plead: for she is not my wife.' Hos 2: 2. Thy people have
          corrupted themselves;' no more my people, but thy people. Exod 32: 7.
          God calls idolatry, blasphemy. In this your fathers have blasphemed
          me.' Idolatry is devil worship. Ezek 20: 27, 31. They sacrificed unto
          devils, not to God; to new gods.' Deut 32: 17. These new gods were old
          devils. And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils.'
          Lev 17: 7. The Hebrew word La-sairim, is the hairy ones, because the
          devils were hairy, and appeared in the forms of satyrs and goats. How
          dreadful a sin is idolatry; and what a signal mercy is it to be
          snatched out of an idolatrous place, as Lot was snatched by the angels
          out of Sodom!
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) It is a mercy to be delivered out of idolatrous places, because
          idolatry is such a silly and irrational religion. I may say, as Jer 8:
          9: What wisdom is in them?' Is it not folly to refuse the best, and
          choose the worst? The trees in the field of Jotham's parable, despised
          the vine-tree, which cheers both God and man, and the olive which is
          full of fatness, and the fig-tree which is full of sweetness, and
          chose the bramble to reign over them -- which was a foolish choice.
          Judg 9. So it is for us to refuse the living God, who has power to
          save us, and to make choice of an idol, that has eyes and sees not,
          feet but walks not. Psa 115: 6, 7. What a prodigy of madness is this?
          Therefore to be delivered from committing such folly is a mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) It is a mercy to be delivered from idolatrous places, because of
          the sad judgements inflicted upon idolaters. This is a sin which
          enrages God, and makes the fury come up in his face. Ezek 38: 18.
          Search through the whole book of God, and you shall find no sin he has
          followed with more plagues than idolatry. Their sorrows shall be
          multiplied that hasten after another god.' Psa 16: 4. They moved him
          to jealousy with their graven images.' Psa 78: 58. When God heard this
          he was wrath, and greatly abhorred Israel; so that he forsook the
          tabernacle of Shiloh.' Verses 59, 60. Shiloh was a city belonging to
          the tribe of Ephraim, where God set his name. Jer 7: 12. But, for
          their idolatry, God forsook the place, gave his people up to the
          sword, caused his priests to be slain, and his ark to be carried away
          captive, never more to be returned. How severe was God against Israel
          for worshipping the golden calf! Exod 32: 27. The Jews say, that in
          every misery that befalls them, there is uncia aurei vituli, an ounce
          of the golden calf in it.' Come out of her, my people, that ye be not
          partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.'
          Rev.18: 4. Idolatry, lived in, cuts men off from heaven.1 Cor 6: 9. So
          then it is no small mercy to be delivered out of idolatrous places.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. See the goodness of God to our nation, in bringing us out of
          mystic Egypt, delivering us from popery, which is Romish idolatry, and
          causing the light of his truth to break forth gloriously among us. In
          former times, and more lately in the Marian days, England was
          overspread with idolatry. It worshipped God after a false manner; and
          it is idolatry, not only to worship a false god, but the true God in a
          false manner. Such was our case formerly; we had purgatory,
          indulgences, the idolatrous mass, the Scriptures locked up in an
          unknown tongue, invocation of saints and angels, and image-worship.
          Images are teachers of lies. Hab 2: 18. Wherein do they teach lies?
          They represent God, who cannot be seen, in a bodily shape. Ye saw no
          similitude, only ye heard a voice.' Deut 4: 12. Quod invisibile est,
          pingi non potest. Ambrose. God cannot be pictured by any finger; not
          the soul even, being a spirit, much less God. To whom then will ye
          liken God?' Isa 40: 18. The Papists say they worship God by the image;
          which is a great absurdity, for if it be absurd to fall down to the
          picture of a king when the king himself is present, much more to bow
          down to the image of God when God himself is present. Jer 23: 24. What
          is the popish religion but a bundle of ridiculous ceremonies? Their
          wax, flowers, pyres, agnus Dei, cream and oil, beads, crucifixes; what
          are these but Satan's policy, to dress up a carnal worship, fitted to
          carnal minds? Oh! what cause have we to bless God for delivering us
          from popery! It was a mercy to be delivered from the Spanish invasion,
          and the powder treason; but it is a far greater to be delivered from
          the popish religion, which would have made God give us a bill of
          divorce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. If it be a great blessing to be delivered from the Egypt of
          popish idolatry, it shows the sin and folly of those who, being
          brought out of Egypt, are willing to return to it again. The apostle
          says, Flee from idolatry.' 1 Cor 10: 14. But these rather flee to
          idolatry; and are herein like the people of Israel, who,
          notwithstanding all the idolatry and tyranny of Egypt, longed to go
          back to Egypt. Let us make a captain and let us return into Egypt.'
          Numb 14: 4. But how shall they go back into Egypt? How shall they have
          food in the wilderness? Will God rain down man any more upon such
          rebels? How will they get over the Red Sea? Will God divide the water
          again by miracle, for such as leave his service, and go into
          idolatrous Egypt? Yet they say, Let us make a captain.' And are there
          not such spirits among us, who say, Let us make a captain and go back
          to the Romish Egypt again'? If we do, what shall we get by it? I am
          afraid the leeks and onions of Egypt will make us sick. Do we ever
          suppose that, if we drink in the cup of fornication, we shall drink in
          the cup of salvation? Oh! that any should so forfeit their reason, as
          to enslave themselves to the see of Rome; that they should be willing
          to hold a candle to a mass-priest, and bow down to a strange God! Let
          us not say we will make a captain, but rather say as Ephraim, What
          have I to do any more with idols?' Hos 14: 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use three. If it be a mercy to be brought out of Egypt, it is not
          desirable or safe to plant one's self in an idolatrous place, where it
          may be a capital crime to be seen with a Bible in our hands. Some, for
          secular gain, thrust themselves among idolaters, and think there is no
          danger to live where Satan's seat is. They pray God would not lead
          them into temptation, but led themselves. They are in great danger of
          being polluted. It is hard to be as the fish, which keeps fresh in
          salt waters. A man cannot dwell among blackamoors, but he will be
          discoloured. You will sooner be corrupted by idolaters, than they will
          be converted by you. Joseph got no good by living in an idolatrous
          court; he did not teach Pharaoh to pray, but Pharaoh taught him to
          swear. They were mingled among the heathen, and served their idols.'
          Psalm 106: 35, 36. I fear it has been the undoing of many; that they
          have seated themselves amongst idolaters, for advancing their trade,
          and at last have not only traded with them in their commodities, but
          in their religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use four. It is a mercy to be brought out of the land of Egypt, a
          defiled place, and where sin reigns. It reproaches such parents as
          show little love for the souls of their children, whether it be in
          putting them out to service, or matching them. In putting them out to
          service, their care is chiefly for their bodies, that they may be
          provided for, and they care not what becomes of their souls. Their
          souls are in Egypt, in houses where there is drinking, swearing,
          Sabbath-breaking, and where God's name is every day dishonoured. In
          matching their children, they look only at money. Be ye not unequally
          yoked.' 2 Cor 6: 14. If their children be equally yoked for estate,
          they care not whether they be unequally yoked for religion. Let such
          parents think how precious the soul of their child is; that it is
          immortal, and capable of communion with God and angels. Will you let a
          soul be lost by placing it in a bad family? If you had a horse you
          loved, you would not put him in a stable with other horses that were
          sick and diseased; and do you not love your child better than your
          horse? God has intrusted you with the souls of your children; you have
          a charge of souls. God says, as 1 Kings 20: 39: Keep this man: if he
          be missing, then shall thy life be for his life.' So says God, if the
          soul of thy child miscarry by thy negligence, his blood will I require
          at thy hand. Think of this, all ye parents; take heed of placing your
          children in Egypt, in a wicked family; do not put them in the devil's
          mouth. Seek for them a sober, religious family, such as Joshua's. As
          for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.' Josh 14: 15. Such a
          family as Cranmer's, which was palaestra pietatis, a nursery of piety,
          a Bethel, of which it may be said, The church which is in his house.'
          Col.4: 15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use five. Let us pray that God would keep our English nation from the
          defilements of Egypt, that it may not be again overspread with
          superstition and idolatry. Oh, sad religion! not only to have our
          estates, our bodies enslaved, but our consciences. Pray that the true
          Protestant religion may still nourish among us, that the sun of the
          gospel may still shine in our horizon. The gospel lifts a people up to
          heaven, it is columna et corona regni, the crown and glory of the
          kingdom'; if this be removed, Ichabod, the glory is departed. The top
          of the beech tree being cut off, the whole body of the tree withers
          apace; so the gospel is the top of all our blessings; if this top be
          cut, the whole body politic will soon wither. O pray that the Lord
          will continue the visible tokens of his presence among us, his
          ordinances, that England may be called, Jehovah-shammah, The Lord is
          there.' Ezek 48: 35. Pray that righteousness and peace may kiss each
          other, that so glory may dwell in our land.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Out of the house of bondage. Egypt and the house of bondage are
          the same, only they are expressed under a different notion. By Egypt
          is meant a place of idolatry and superstition; by the house of bondage
          is meant a place of affliction. Israel, while in Egypt, were under
          great tyranny; they had cruel task-masters set over them, who put them
          to hard labour, and set them to make bricks, yet allowed them no
          straw; therefore, Egypt is called, in Deut 4: 20, the iron furnace,
          and here the house of bondage. From this expression, I brought thee
          out of the house of bondage,' two things are to be noted; God's
          children may sometimes be under sore afflictions. In the house of
          bondage.' But God will, in due time, bring them out of their afflicted
          state. I brought thee out of the house of bondage.'
        </p>
        <p>
          God's children may sometimes be under sore afflictions, in domo
          servitutis, in the house of bondage. God's people have no writ of ease
          granted them, no charter of exemption from trouble in this life. While
          the wicked are kept in sugar, the godly are often kept in brine. And,
          indeed, how could God's power be seen in bringing them out of trouble,
          if he did not sometimes bring them into it? or how should God wipe
          away the tears from their eyes in heaven, if on earth they shed none?
          Doubtless, God sees there is need that his children should be
          sometimes in the house of bondage. If need be, ye are in heaviness.' 1
          Peter 1: 6. The body sometimes needs a bitter portion more than a
          sweet one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why does God let his people be in the house of bondage or in an
          afflicted state?
        </p>
        <p>
          He does it, (1) For probation or trial. Who led thee through that
          terrible wilderness, that he might humble thee and prove thee.' Deut
          8: 15, 16. Affliction is the touch-stone of sincerity. Thou O God,
          hast proved us; thou hast tried us as silver; thou laidst affliction
          upon our loins.' Psa 66: 10, 11. Hypocrites may embrace the true
          religion in prosperity, and court this queen while she has a jewel
          hung at her ear; but he is a good Christian who will keep close to God
          in a time of suffering. All this is come upon us, yet have we not
          forgotten thee.' Psa 44: 17. To love God in heaven, is no wonder; but
          to love him when he chastises us, discovers sincerity. (2) For
          purgation; to purge our corruption. Ardet palea, purgatur aurum. And
          this is all the fruit, to take away his sin.' Isa 28: 9. The eye,
          though a tender part, yet when sore, we put sharp powders and waters
          into it to eat out the pearl; so though the people of God are dear to
          him, yet, when corruption begins to grow in them, he will apply the
          sharp powder of affliction, to eat out the pearl in the eye.
          Affliction is God's flail to thresh off our husks; it is a means God
          uses to purge out sloth, luxury, pride, and love of the world. God's
          furnace is in Zion. Isa 31: 5. This is not to consume, but to refine.
          What if we have more affliction, if by this means we have less sin!
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) For augmentation; to increase the graces of the Spirit. Grace
          thrives most in the iron furnace. Sharp frosts nourish the corn; so
          sharp afflictions nourish grace. Grace in the saints is often as fire
          hid in the embers, affliction is the bellows to blow it up into a
          flame. The Lord makes the house of bondage a friend to grace. Then
          faith and patience act their part. The darkness of the night cannot
          hinder the brightness of a star; so, the more the diamond is cut the
          more it sparkles; and the more God afflicts us, the more our graces
          cast a sparkling lustre.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) For preparation; to fit and prepare the saints for glory.2 Cor 4:
          17. The stones which are cut out for a building, are first hewn and
          squared. The godly are called living stones.' 1 Pet 2: 5. God first
          hews and polishes them by affliction, that they may be fit for the
          heavenly building. The house of bondage prepares for the house not
          made with hands.2 Cor 5: 1: The vessels of mercy are seasoned with
          affliction, and then the wine of glory is poured in.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do the afflictions of the godly differ from the afflictions of the
          wicked?
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) They are but castigations, but those on the wicked are
          punishments. The one come from a father, the other from a judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Afflictions on the godly are fruits of covenant-mercy.2 Sam 7: 17.
          Afflictions on the wicked are effects of God's wrath. He has much
          wrath with his sickness.' Eccl 5: 17. Afflictions on the wicked are
          the pledge and earnest of hell; they are like the pinioning of a
          malefactor, which presages his execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Afflictions on the godly make them better, but afflictions on the
          wicked make them worse. The godly pray more; Psa 130: 1: The wicked
          blaspheme more. Men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the
          name of God.' Rev 16: 9. Afflictions on the wicked make them more
          impenitent; every plague upon Egypt increased the plague of hardness
          in Pharaoh's heart. To what a prodigy of wickedness do some persons
          come after great sickness. Affliction on the godly is like bruising
          spices, which are most sweet and fragrant: affliction on the wicked is
          like pounding weeds with a pestle, which makes them more unsavoury.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. (1) We are not to wonder to see Israel in the house of
          bondage.1 Pet 4: 12. The holiness of the saints will not excuse them
          from sufferings. Christ was the holy one of God, yet he was in the
          iron furnace. His spouse is a lily among thorns. Cant 2: 2. Though his
          sheep have the ear-mark of election upon them, yet they may have their
          wool fleeced off. The godly have some good in them, therefore the
          devil afflicts them; and some evil in them, therefore God afflicts
          them. While there are two seeds in the world, expect to be under the
          black rod. The gospel tells us of reigning, but first of suffering.2
          Tim 2: 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Affliction is not always the sign of God's anger. Israel, the
          apple of God's eye, a peculiar treasure to him above all people, were
          in the house of bondage. Exod 19: 5. We are apt to judge and censure
          those who are in an afflicted state. When the barbarians saw the viper
          on Paul's hand, they said, No doubt this man is a murderer.' Acts 28:
          4. So, when we see the viper of affliction fasten upon the godly, we
          are apt to censure them, and say, these are greater sinners than
          others, and God hates them; but this rash censuring is for want of
          wisdom. Were not Israel in the house of bondage? Was not Jeremiah in
          the dungeon, and Paul a night and day in the deep? God's afflicting is
          so far from evidencing hatred, that his not afflicting does. I will
          not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom.' Hos 4: 14. Deus
          maxime irascitur cum non irascitur. Bernard. God punishes most when he
          does not punish; his hand is heaviest when it seems to be lightest.
          The judge will not burn him in the hand whom he intends to execute.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) If God's own Israel may be in the house of bondage, then
          afflictions do not of themselves demonstrate a man miserable. Indeed,
          sin unrepented of, makes one miserable; but the cross does not. If God
          has a design in afflicting his children to make them happy, they are
          not miserable; but God's afflicting them is to make them happy,
          therefore they are not miserable. Happy is the man whom God
          correcteth.' Job 5: 17. The world counts them happy who can keep out
          of affliction; but the Scripture calls them happy who are afflicted.
        </p>
        <p>How are they happy?</p>
        <p>
          Because they are more holy. Heb 12: 10. Because they are more in God's
          favour. Prov 3: 12. The goldsmith loves his gold when in the furnace.
          Because they have more of God's sweet presence. Psa 91: 15. They
          cannot be unhappy who have God's powerful presence in supporting, and
          his gracious presence in sanctifying, their affliction. Because the
          more affliction they have, the more degrees of glory they shall have;
          the lower they have been in the iron furnace, the higher they shall
          sit upon to throne of glory; the heavier their crosses, the heavier
          shall be their crown. So then, if afflictions make a Christian happy,
          they cannot call him miserable.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) See the merciful providence of God to his children. Though they
          may be in the house of bondage, and smart by affliction, yet they
          shall not be hurt by affliction. What hurt does the fan to the corn?
          it only separates the chaff from it; or the lance to the body? it only
          lets out the abscess. The house of bondage does that which sometimes
          ordinances will not; it humbles and reforms. If they be holden in
          cords of affliction, he openeth their ear to discipline, and
          commandeth that they return from iniquity.' Job 36: 8, 10. Oh! what a
          merciful providence is it that, though God bruise his people, yet,
          while he is bruising them, he is doing them good! It is as if one
          should throw a bag of money at another, which bruises him a little,
          but yet it enriches him. Affliction enriches the soul and yields the
          sweet fruits of righteousness. Heb.12: 11.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) If Israel be in the house of bondage, if the Lord deals so with
          his own children, then how severely will he deal with the wicked! If
          he be so severe with those he loves, how severe will he be with those
          he hates! If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done
          in the dry?' Luke 13: 31. If they that pray and mourn for sin be so
          severely dealt with, what will become of those that swear and break
          the Sabbath, and are unclean! If Israel be in the iron furnace, the
          wicked shall lie in the fiery furnace of hell. It should be the
          saddest news to wicked men, to hear that the people of God are
          afflicted. Let them think how dreadful the case of sinners will be.
          Judgement must begin at the house of God; and if it first begin at us,
          what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel?' 1 Pet 4: 17.
          If God thresh his wheat, he will burn the chaff. If the godly suffer
          castigation, the wicked shall suffer condemnation. If he mingle his
          people's cup with wormwood he will mingle the wicked's cup with fire
          and brimstone.
        </p>
        <p>Use two. If Israel be in the house of bondage,</p>
        <p>
          (1) Do not entertain too hard thoughts of affliction. Christians are
          apt to look upon the cross and the iron furnace as frightful things,
          and do what they can to shun them. Nay, sometimes, to avoid
          affliction, they run themselves into sin. But do not think too hardly
          of affliction; do not look upon it as through the multiplying-glass of
          fear. The house of bondage is not hell. Consider that affliction comes
          from a wise God, who prescribes whatever befalls us. Persecutions are
          like apothecaries: they give us the physic which God the physician
          prescribes. Affliction has its light side, as well as its dark one.
          God can sweeten our afflictions, and candy our wormwood. As our
          sufferings abound, so does also our consolation.2 Cor 1: 5. Argerius
          dated his letters from the pleasant garden of the Leonine prison. God
          sometimes so revives his children in trouble, that they had rather
          bear their afflictions than want their comforts. Why then should
          Christians entertain such hard thoughts of afflictions? Do not look at
          its grim face, but at the message it brings, which is to enrich us
          with both grace and comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) If Israel be sometimes in the house of bondage, in an afflicted
          state, think beforehand of affliction. Say not as Job (29: 18), I
          shall die in my nest.' In the house of mirth think of the house of
          bondage. You that are now Naomi, may be Mara. Ruth 1:20. How quickly
          may the scene turn, and the hyperbole of joy end in a catastrophe! All
          outward things are given to change. The forethoughts of affliction
          would make us sober and moderate in the use of lawful delight; it
          would cure a surfeit. Christ at a feast mentions his burial; a good
          antidote against a surfeit. The forethought of affliction would make
          us prepare for it; it would take us off the world; it would put us
          upon search of our evidences.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should see what oil we have in our lamps, what grace we can find,
          that we may be able to stand in the evil day. That soldier is
          imprudent who has his sword to whet when he is just going to fight. He
          who forecasts sufferings, will have the shield of faith, and the sword
          of the Spirit ready, that he may not be surprised.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) If afflictions come, let us labour to conduct ourselves wisely as
          Christians, that we may adorn our sufferings: that is, let us endure
          with patience. Take, my brethren, the prophets for an example of
          suffering affliction and patience.' James 5: 10. Satan labours to take
          advantage of us in affliction, by making us either faint or murmur; he
          blows the coals of passion and discontent, and then warms himself at
          the fire. Patience adorns sufferings. A Christian should say as Jesus
          Christ did, Lord, not my will but thy will be done.' It is a sign the
          affliction is sanctified when the heart is brought to a sweet
          submissive frame. God will then remove the affliction: he will take us
          out of the iron furnace.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may consider these words, Which brought thee out of the house of
          bondage,' either, Literally; or Spiritually and Mystically. In the
          letter, I brought thee out of the house of bondage;' that is, I
          delivered you out of the misery and servitude you sustained in Egypt,
          where you were in the iron furnace. Spiritually and mystically, by
          which I brought thee out of the house of bondage,' is a type of our
          deliverance by Christ from sin and hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Literally, I brought thee out of the house of bondage,' out of great
          misery and slavery in the iron furnace. The thing I note here is that,
          though God brings his people sometimes into trouble, yet he will bring
          them out again. Israel was in the house of bondage, but at last was
          brought out.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall endeavour to show: 1. That God does deliver out of trouble.2.
          In what manner.3. At what seasons.4. Why he delivers.5. How the
          deliverances of the godly and wicked out of trouble differ.
        </p>
        <p>
          God does deliver his children out of troubles. Our fathers trusted in
          thee; they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.' Psa 22: 4. And I was
          delivered out of the mouth of the lion,' namely, from Nero.2 Tim 4:
          17. Thou laidst affliction upon our loins, but thou broughtest us out
          into a wealthy place.' Psa 66: 11, 12. Weeping may endure for a night,
          but joy comes in the morning.' Psa 30: 5. God brought Daniel out of
          the lions' den, Zion out of Babylon. In his due time he gives an issue
          out of trouble. Psa 68: 20. The tree which in the winter seems dead,
          revives in the spring. Post nubila Phoebus [The sun emerges after the
          storms]. Affliction may leap on us as the viper did on Paul, but at
          last it shall be shaken off. It is called a cup of affliction. Isa 51:
          17. The wicked drink a sea of wrath, the godly drink only a cup of
          affliction, and God will say shortly, Let this cup pass away.' God
          will give his people a gaol-delivery.
        </p>
        <p>In what manner does God deliver his people out of trouble?</p>
        <p>
          He does it like a God, in wisdom. (1) He does it sometimes suddenly.
          As the angel was caused to fly swiftly (Dan 9: 21), so God sometimes
          makes a deliverance fly swiftly, and on a sudden turns the shadow of
          death into the light of the morning. As he gives us mercies above what
          we can think (Eph 3: 20), so sometimes before we can think of them.
          When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them
          that dream;' it came suddenly upon us as a dream. Psa 126: 1. Joseph
          could not have thought of such a sudden alteration, to be the same day
          freed out of prison, and made the chief ruler in the kingdom. Mercy
          sometimes does not stick long in the birth, but comes forth on a
          sudden. (2) God sometimes delivers his people strangely. Thus the
          whale which swallowed up Jonah was the means of bringing him safe to
          land. He sometimes delivers his people in the very way which they
          think will destroy. In bringing Israel out of Egypt, he stirred up the
          heart of the Egyptians to hate them (Psa 105: 25), and that was the
          means of their deliverance. He brought Paul to shore by a contrary
          wind, and upon the broken pieces of the ship. Acts 27: 44.
        </p>
        <p>
          When are the times and seasons that God usually delivers his people
          out of the bondage of affliction?
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) When they are in the greatest extremity. Though Jonah was in the
          belly of hell, he says, Thou hast brought up my life from corruption.'
          Jonah 2: 6. When there is but a hair's breadth between the godly and
          death, God ushers in deliverance. When the ship was almost covered
          with waves Christ awoke and rebuked the wind. When Isaac was upon the
          altar, and the knife about to be put to his throat, the angel comes
          and says, Lay not thy hand upon the child.' When Peter began to sink,
          Christ took him by the hand. Cum duplicantur lateres, venit Moses:
          when the tale of brick was doubled, then Moses the temporal saviour
          comes. When the people of God are in the greatest danger the morning
          star of deliverance appears. When the patient is ready to faint the
          cordial is given.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The second season is, when affliction has done its work upon them;
          when it has effected that which God sent it for. As, When it has
          humbled them. Remembering my affliction, the wormwood and gall, my
          soul is humbled in me.' Lam 3: 19, 20. Then God's corrosive has eaten
          out the proud flesh. When it has tamed their impatience. Before, they
          were proud and impatient, like froward children that struggle with
          their parents; but when their cursed hearts are tamed, they say, I
          will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against
          him' (Micah 7: 9); and as Eli, It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth
          him good:' Let him hedge me with thorns, if he will plant me with
          grace.' 1 Sam 3: 18.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) When they are partakers of more holiness, and are more full of
          heavenly-mindedness. Heb 12: 10. When the sharp frost of affliction
          has brought forth the spring-flowers of grace, the cross is
          sanctified, and God will bring them out of the house of bondage.
          Luctus in laetitiam vertetur, cineres in corollas [Sorrow will turn to
          joy, ashes to garlands]. When the metal is refined it is taken out of
          the furnace. When affliction has healed us, God takes off the smarting
          plaister.
        </p>
        <p>Why does God bring his people out of the house of bondage?</p>
        <p>
          Hereby he makes way for his own glory. His glory is dearer to him than
          anything besides; it is a crown jewel. By raising his people he raises
          the trophies of his own honour; he glorifies his own attributes; his
          power, truth, and goodness are triumphant.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) His power. If God did not sometimes bring his people into trouble,
          how could his power be seen in bringing them out? He brought Israel
          out of the house of bondage, with miracle upon miracle; he saved them
          with an outstretched arm. What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou
          fleddest?' &amp;c. Psa 114: 5. Of Israel's march out of Egypt it is
          said, when the sea fled, and the waters were parted each from other.
          Here was the power of God set forth. Is there any thing too hard for
          me?' Jer 32: 27. God loves to help when things seem past hope. He
          creates deliverance. Psa 124: 8. He brought Isaac out of a dead womb,
          and the Messiah out of a virgin's womb. oh! how does his power shine
          forth when he overcomes seeming impossibilities, and works a cure when
          things look desperate!
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) His truth. God has made promises to his people, when they are
          under great pressures, to deliver them; and his truth is engaged in
          his promise. Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee.'
          Psa 50: 15. He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea in seven.' Job
          5: 19. How is the Scripture bespangled with these promises as the
          firmament is with stars! Either God will deliver them from death, or
          by death; he will make a way of escape.1 Cor 10: 13. When promises are
          verified, God's truth is magnified.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) His goodness. God is full of compassion to such as are in misery.
          The Hebrew word, Racham, for mercy, signifies bowels. God has sounding
          of bowels.' Isa 63: 15. And this sympathy stirs up God to deliver. In
          his love and pity he redeemed them.' Isa 63: 9. This makes way for the
          triumph of his goodness. He is tender-hearted, he will not over
          afflict; he cuts asunder the bars of iron, he breaks the yoke of the
          oppressor. Thus all his attributes ride in triumph in saving his
          people out of trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do the deliverance of the godly and tricked out of trouble differ?
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The deliverances of the godly are preservations; of the wicked
          reservations. The Lord knows how to deliver the godly, and to reserve
          the unjust to be punished.' 2 Pet 2: 9. A sinner may be delivered from
          dangerous sickness, and out of prison; but all this is but a
          reservation for some greater evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) God delivers the wicked, or rather spares them in anger.
          Deliverances to the wicked are not given as pledges of his love, but
          symptoms of displeasure; as quails were given to Israel in anger. But
          deliverances of the godly are in love. He delivered me because he
          delighted in me'.2 Sam 22: 20. Thou hast in love to my soul delivered
          it from the pit of corruption;' or, as in the Hebrew, Chashiaqta
          Naphshi. Isa 38: 17. Thou hast loved me from the pit of corruption. A
          wicked man may say, Lord, thou hast delivered me out of the pit of
          corruption;' but a godly man may say, Lord, thou hast loved me out of
          the pit of corruption.' It is one thing to have God's power deliver
          us, and another thing to have his love deliver us. O,' said Hezekiah,
          Thou hast in love to my soul, delivered me from the pit of
          corruption.'
        </p>
        <p>How may it be known that a deliverance comes in love?</p>
        <p>
          (1) When it makes our heart boil over in love to God. I love the Lord
          because he has heard my voice.' Psa 116: 1. It is one thing to love
          our mercies, another thing to love the Lord. Deliverance is in love
          when it causes love.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Deliverance is in love when we have hearts to improve it for God's
          glory. The wicked, instead of improving their deliverance for God's
          glory, increase their corruption; they grow worse, as the metal when
          taken out of the fire grows harder; but our deliverance is in love
          when we improve it for God's glory. God raises us out of a low
          condition, and we lift him up in our praises, and honour him with our
          substance. Prov 3: 9. He recovers us from sickness, and we spend
          ourselves in his service. Mercy is not as the sun to the fire, to dull
          it and put it out, but as oil to the wheel, to make it move faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Deliverance comes in love when it makes us more exemplary in
          holiness; and our lives are walking Bibles. A thousand praises and
          doxologies do not honour God so much as the mortifying of one lust.
          Upon mount Zion there shall be deliverance and holiness,' Obadiah 17.
          When these two go together, deliverance and holiness; when, being made
          monuments of mercy, we are patterns of piety; then a deliverance comes
          in love, and we may say as Hezekiah, Thou hast in love to my soul
          delivered it from the pit of corruption.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. If God brings his people out of bondage, let none despond in
          trouble. Say not I shall sink under this burden;' or as David, I shall
          one day perish by the hand of Saul.' God can make the text good,
          personally and nationally, to bring his people out of the house of
          bondage. When he sees a fit season, he will put forth his arm and save
          them; and he can do it with ease. Lord, it is nothing with thee to
          help.' 2 Chron 14: 11. He that can turn tides, can turn the times; he
          that raised Lazarus when he was dead, can raise thee when thou art
          sick. I looked, and there was none to help, therefore mine own arm
          brought salvation.' Isa 63: 5. Do not despond; believe in God's power:
          faith sets God to work to deliver us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. Labour, if you are in trouble, to be fitted for deliverance.
          Many would have deliverance, but are not fitted for it.
        </p>
        <p>When are we fitted for deliverance?</p>
        <p>
          When, by our afflictions, we are conformed to Christ; when we have
          learned obedience. He learned obedience by the things which he
          suffered;' that is, he learned sweet submission to his Father's will.
          Heb 5: 8. Not my will, but thine, be done.' Luke 22: 42. When we have
          thus learned obedience by our sufferings, we are willing to do what
          God would have us do, and be what God would have us be. We are
          conformed to Christ, and are fitted for deliverance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use three. If God has brought you at any time out of the house of
          bondage, out of great and eminent troubles, be much in praise.
          Deliverance calls for praise. Thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
          girded me with gladness; to the end that my glory may sing praise to
          thee.' Psa 30: 11, 12. My glory, that is, my tongue, which is the
          instrument of glorifying thee. The saints are temples of the Holy
          Ghost.1 Cor 3: 16. Where should God's praises be sounded but in his
          temple? Beneficium postulat officium [Gratitude should follow a
          favour]. The deepest springs yield the sweetest water; and hearts
          deeply sensible of God's deliverances yield the sweetest praises.
          Moses tells Pharaoh, when he was going out of Egypt, We will go with
          our flocks and our herds.' Exod 10: 9. Why so? Because he might have
          sacrifices of thanksgiving ready to offer to God for their
          deliverance. To have a thankful heart for deliverance is a greater
          blessing than the deliverance itself. One of the lepers, when he saw
          that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God.'
          Luke 17: 15. The leper's thankful heart was a greater blessing than to
          be healed of his leprosy. Have any of you been brought out of the
          house of bondage -- out of prison, sickness, or any death-threatening
          danger? Do not forget to be thankful. Be not graves, but temples. That
          you may be the more thankful, observe every emphasis and circumstance
          in your deliverance; such as to be brought out of trouble when you
          were in articulo mortis [at the brink of death], when there was but a
          hair's breadth between you and death; or, to be brought out of
          affliction, without sin, you did not purchase your deliverance by the
          ensnaring of your consciences; or, to be brought out of trouble upon
          the wings of prayer; or, that those who were the occasions of bringing
          you into trouble, should be the instruments of bringing you out. These
          circumstances, being well weighed, heighten a deliverance, and should
          heighten our thankfulness. The cutting of a stone may be of more value
          than the stone itself; and the circumstancing of a deliverance may be
          greater than the deliverance itself.
        </p>
        <p>But how shall we praise God in a right manner for deliverance?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Be holy persons. In the sacrifice of thanksgiving, whosoever did
          eat thereof with his uncleanness upon him, was to be cut off (Lev 7:
          20), to typify how unpleasing their praises and thank-offerings are
          who live in sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Praise God with humble hearts, acknowledge how unworthy you were
          of deliverance. God's mercies are not debts, but legacies; and that
          you should have them by legacy should make you humble. The elders fell
          upon their faces (an expression of humility) and worshipped God. Rev
          11: 16.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Praise God for deliverances cordially. I will praise the Lord with
          my whole heart.' Psa 111: 1. In religion there is no music but in
          concert, when heart and tongue join.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Praise God for deliverances constantly. While I live will I praise
          the Lord.' Psa 146: 2. Some will be thankful while the memory of a
          deliverance is fresh, and then leave off. The Carthaginians used, at
          first, to send the tenth of their yearly revenue to Hercules; but by
          degrees they grew weary, and left off sending; but we must be constant
          in our Eucharistic sacrifice, or thank-offering. The motion of our
          praise must be like the motion of our pulse, which beats as long as
          life lasts. I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.'
          Psa 146: 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE words are to be understood mystically and spiritually. By
          Israel's deliverance from the house of bondage, is typified their
          spiritual deliverance from sin, Satan, and hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) From sin. The house of bondage was a type of Israel's deliverance
          from sin. Sin is the true bondage, it enslaves the soul. Nihil durius
          servitute. Cicero. Of all conditions, servitude is the worst.' I was
          held before conversion,' says Augustine, not with an iron chain, but
          with the obstinacy of mine own will.' Sin is the enslaver; it is
          called a law, because it has a binding power over a man (Rom 7: 23);
          it is said to reign, because it exercises a tyrannical power (Rom 6:
          12); and men are said to be the servants of sin, because they are so
          enslaved by it. Rom 6: 17. Thus sin is the house of bondage. Israel
          was not so enslaved in the iron furnace as the sinner is by sin. They
          are worse slaves and vassals who are under the power of sin, than they
          are who are under the power of earthly tyrants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other slaves have tyrants ruling over their bodies only; but the
          sinner has his soul tyrannised over. That princely thing, the soul,
          which sways the sceptre of reason, and was once crowned with perfect
          knowledge and holiness, now goes on foot; it is enslaved, and made a
          lackey to every base lust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other slaves have some pity shown them: the tyrant gives them meat,
          and lets them have hours for their rest; but sin is a merciless
          tyrant, it will let men have no rest. Judas had no rest until he had
          betrayed Christ, and after that he had less rest than before. How does
          a man wear himself out in the service of sin, waste his body, break
          his sleep, distract his mind! A wicked man is every day doing sin's
          drudgery-work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other slaves have servile work; but it is lawful. It is lawful to work
          in the galley, and tug at the oar; but all the laws and commands of
          sin are unlawful. Sin says to one man, defraud; to another, be
          unchaste; to another take revenge; to another, take a false oath. Thus
          all sin's commands are unlawful; we cannot obey sin's law, but by
          breaking God's law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other slaves are forced against their will. Israel groaned under
          slavery (Exod 2: 23); but sinners are content to be under the command
          of sin; they are willing to be slaves; they love their chains; they
          will not take their freedom; they glory in their shame.' Phil 3: 19.
          They wear their sins, not as their fetters, but their ornaments; they
          rejoice in iniquity. Jer 11: 15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other slaves are brought to correction, but sin's slaves are without
          repentance, and are brought to condemnation. Other slaves lie in the
          iron furnace: sin's slaves lie in the fiery furnace. What freedom of
          will has a sinner to his own confusion, when he can do nothing but
          what sin will have him? He is enslaved. Thus sinners are in the house
          of bondage; but God takes his elect out of the house of bondage, he
          beats off the chains and fetters of sin; he rescues them from their
          slavery; he makes them free, by bringing them into the glorious
          liberty of the children of God.' Rom 8: 21. The law of love now rules,
          not the law of sin. Though the life of sin be prolonged, yet not the
          dominion; as those beasts in Daniel had their lives prolonged for a
          season, but their dominion was taken away. Dan 7: 12. The saints are
          made spiritual kings, to rule and conquer their corruptions, to bind
          these kings in chains.' It is matter of the highest praise and
          thanksgiving, to be taken out of the house of bondage, to be freed
          from enslaving hosts, and made kings to reign in glory for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The bringing Israel out of the house of bondage, was a type of the
          deliverance from Satan. Men naturally are in the house of bondage,
          they are enslaved to Satan. Satan is called the prince of this world
          (John 14: 30); and the god of this world (2 Cor 4: 4); because he has
          power to command and enslave them. Though he shall one day be a close
          prisoner in chains, yet now he insults and tyrannises over the souls
          of men. Sinners are under his rule, he exercises over them a
          jurisdiction such as Caesar did over the senate. He fills men's heads
          with error, and their hearts with malice. Why has Satan filled thine
          heart?' Act 5: 3. A sinner's heart is the devil's mansion house. I
          will return into mine house.' Matt.12: 44. And sure that must needs be
          a house of bondage, which is the devil's mansion-house. Satan is a
          complete tyrant. He rules men's minds, he blinds them with ignorance.
          The god of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not.'
          2 Cor 4: 4. He rules their memories. They remember that which is evil,
          and forget that which is good. Their memories are like a strainer,
          that lets go all the pure liquor, and retains only the dregs. He rules
          their wills. Though he cannot force the will, he draws it. The lusts
          of your father you will do.' John 8: 44. He has got your hearts, and
          him you will obey. His strong temptations draw men to evil more than
          all the promises of God can draw them to good. This is the state of
          every man by nature; he is in the house of bondage; the devil has him
          in his power. A sinner grinds in the devil's mill; he is at the
          command of Satan, as the ass is at the command of the driver. No
          wonder to see men oppress and persecute; as slaves they must do what
          the god of this world will have them. How could those swine but run,
          when the devil entered into them? Matt 8: 32. When the devil tempted
          Ananias to tell a lie, he could not but speak what Satan had put in
          his heart. Acts 5: 3. When the devil entered into Judas, and bade him
          betray Christ, he would do it, though he hanged himself. It is a sad
          and dismal case, to be in the house of bondage, under the power and
          tyranny of Satan. When David would curse the enemies of God, how did
          he pray against them? That Satan might be at their right hand. Psa
          109: 6. He knew he could then lead them into any snare. If the sinner
          has Satan at his right hand, let him take heed that he be not at God's
          left hand. Is it not a case to be bewailed, to see men taken captive
          by Satan at his will? 2 Tim 2: 26. He leads sinners as slaves before
          him in triumph; he wholly possesses them. If people should see their
          beasts bewitched and possessed of the devil, they would be much
          troubled; and yet, though their souls are possessed by Satan, they are
          not sensible of it. What can be worse than for men to be in the house
          of bondage, and to have the devil hurry them on in their lusts to
          perdition? Sinners are willingly enslaved to Satan; they love their
          gaoler; are content to sit quietly under Satan's jurisdiction; they
          choose this bramble to rule over them, though after a while, fire will
          come out of the bramble to devour them. Judges 9: 15. What an infinite
          mercy is it when God brings poor souls out of this house of bondage,
          when he gives them a gaol-delivery from the prince of darkness! JESUS
          CHRIST redeems captives, he ransoms sinners by price, and rescues them
          by force. As David took a lamb out of the lion's mouth (1 Sam 17: 35),
          so Christ rescues souls out of the mouth of the roaring lion. Oh, what
          a mercy is it to be brought out of the house of bondage, from captives
          to the prince of the power of the air, to be made subjects of the
          Prince of Peace! This is done by the preaching of the Word. To turn
          them from the power of Satan unto God.' Acts 26: 18.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The bringing of Israel out of the house of bondage was a type of
          their being delivered from hell. Hell is domus servitutis, a house of
          bondage; a house built on purpose for sinners to lie in.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is such a house of bondage where the damned lie. The wicked
          shall be turned into hell.' Psa 9: 17. How can ye escape the damnation
          of hell?' Matt 23: 33. If any one should ask where this house of
          bondage is, where is the place of hell? I wish he may never know
          experimentally. Let us not so much,' says Chrysostom, labour to know
          where hell is, as how to escape it.' Yet to satisfy curiosity, it may
          be observed that hell is locus subterraneus, some place beneath. Hell
          beneath.' Prov 15: 24. Hesiod says, Hell is as far under the earth, as
          heaven is above it.' The devils besought Christ that he would not
          command them to go out into the deep.' Luke 8: 31. Hell is in the
          deep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why must there be this house of bondage? Why a hell? Because there
          must be a place for the execution of divine justice. Earthly monarchs
          have their prison for malefactors, and shall not God have his? Sinners
          are criminals, they have offended God; and it would not consist with
          his holiness and justice, to have his laws infringed, and not inflict
          penalties.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dreadfulness of the place. Could you but hear the groans and
          shrieks of the damned for one hour, it would confirm you in the truth,
          that hell is a house of bondage. Hell is the emphasis of misery.
          Besides the poena damni, the punishment of loss,' which is the
          exclusion of the soul from the gloried sight of God, which divines
          think the worst part of hell, there will be poena sensus,' the
          punishment of sense.' If, when God's wrath is kindled but a little,
          and a spark of it flies into a man's conscience in this life, it is so
          terrible (as in the case of Spira), what will hell itself be?
        </p>
        <p>
          In hell there will be a plurality of torments, Bonds and chains.' 2
          Pet 2: 4. There will be the worm. Mark 9: 48; This is the worm of
          conscience. There will be the lake of fire. Rev 20: 15. Other fire is
          but painted to this.
        </p>
        <p>
          This house of hell is haunted with devils. Matt 25: 41. Anselm says, I
          had rather endure all torments, than see the devil with bodily eyes.'
          Such as go to hell must not only be forced to behold the devil, but
          must be shut up with this lion in his den; they must keep the devil
          company. He is full of spite against mankind; a red dragon that will
          spit fire in men's faces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The torments of hell abide for ever. The smoke of their torment
          ascendeth up for ever and ever.' Rev 14: 2: Time cannot finish it,
          tears cannot quench it. Mark 9: 44. The wicked are salamanders, who
          live always in the fire of hell, and are not consumed. After they have
          lain millions of years in hell, their punishment is as far from
          ending, as it was at the beginning. If all the earth and sea were
          sand, and every thousandth year a bird should come, and take away one
          grain, it would be a long time before that vast heap would be removed;
          yet, if after all that time the damned might come out of hell, there
          would be some hope; but this word EVER breaks the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          How does it seem to comport with God's justice to punish a sin
          committed in a moment, with eternal torment?
        </p>
        <p>
          Because there is an eternity of sin in man's nature. Because sin is
          crimen laesae majestatis, committed against an infinite majesty,' and
          therefore the sin itself is infinite, and proportionally the
          punishment must be infinite. Because a finite creature cannot bear
          infinite wrath, he must be eternally satisfying what he can never
          satisfy. If hell be such a house of bondage, what infinite cause have
          they to bless God who are delivered from it! Jesus delivered us from
          the wrath to come.' 1 Thess 1: 10. Jesus Christ suffered the torments
          of hell in his soul, that believers should not suffer them. If we are
          thankful, when we are ransomed out of prison, or delivered from fire,
          oh, how should we bless God to be preserved from the wrath to come! It
          may cause more thankfulness in us, seeing the most part go into the
          house of bondage, even to hell. To be of the number of those few that
          are delivered from it, is matter of infinite thankfulness. Most, I
          say, go to that house of bondage when they die; most go to hell. Broad
          is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in
          thereat.' Matt 7: 13. The greatest part of the world lies in
          wickedness.1 John 5: 19. Divide the world, says Brerewood, into
          thirty-one parts, nineteen parts of it are possessed by Jews and
          Turks, and seven parts by heathens; so that there are but five parts
          of Christians, and among these Christians so many seduced Papists on
          the one hand, and so many formal Protestants on the other, that we may
          conclude the major part of the world goes to hell. Scripture compares
          the wicked to briers. Isa 10: 17. There are but few lilies in your
          fields, but in every hedge thorns and briers. It compares them to the
          mire in the streets.' Isa 10: 6. Few jewels or precious stones are in
          the street, but you cannot go a step without meeting with mire. The
          wicked are as common as the dirt in the street. Look at the generality
          of people. How many drunkards are there for one that is sober! How
          many adulterers for one that is chaste! How many hypocrites for one
          that is sincere! The devil has the harvest, and God a few gleanings
          only. Oh, then, such as are delivered from the house of bondage, in
          hell, have infinite cause to admire and bless God. How should the
          vessels of mercy run over with thankfulness! When most others are
          carried prisoners to hell, they are delivered from the wrath to come.
        </p>
        <p>How shall I know I am delivered from hell?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Those whom Christ saves from hell he saves from sin. He shall save
          his people from their sins.' Matt 1: 21. Has God delivered you from
          the power of corruption, from pride, malice, and lust? If he has
          delivered you from the hell of sin, he has delivered you from the hell
          of torment.

          (2) If you have got an interest in Christ, and are prizing, trusting,
          and loving him, you are delivered from hell and damnation. No
          condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.' Rom 8:1. If you are in
          Christ, he has put the garment of his righteousness over you, and
          hell-fire can never singe it. Pliny observes, nothing will so soon
          quench fire as salt and blood: the salt tears of repentance and the
          blood of Christ will quench the fire of hell, so that it shall never
          kindle upon you.<br />
