    Delight</font></b></p>
<p align="center">Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="center">"But his delight is in the Law of the Lord." <br/>
    Psalm 1:2</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    1. Showing that <i>negative goodness </i>is but a broken title to heaven.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">As the book of the <i>Canticles </i>is called <i>"the 
    Song of Songs"</i>—it being the most excellent song; so <i>Psalm one </i>may 
    fitly be entitled, <i>"the Psalm of Psalms</i>", for it contains in it the 
    very pith and quintessence of Christianity. What Hierom says of Paul's 
    epistles, the same may I of this Psalm; it is short for the composure—but 
    full of length and strength for the matter. This Psalm carries blessedness 
    in the frontispiece; it begins where we all hope to end. It may well be 
    called <i>A Christian's Guide</i>, for it discovers the quicksands where the 
    wicked sink down in perdition, verse 1; and the firm ground on which the 
    saints tread to glory, verse 2. The text is an <i>epitome </i>and <i>
    breviary </i>of true religion, "But his delight is in the law of the Lord, 
    and in his law does he meditate day and night." Every word has its emphasis; 
    I begin with the first word—<font color="#008000"><b>But</b></font>.</p>
<p align="justify">This But is full of spiritual wine, we will open it and 
    taste a little, then proceed.</p>
<p align="justify">"But" This is a term of opposition. <font color="#b07050">
<b>The godly man is described:</b></font></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I. By way of negation, in three particulars.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">(1.) "He walks not in the counsel of the ungodly;" he is 
    none of their council; he neither gives bad counsel, nor takes it. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) "He stands not in the way of sinners." He will not 
    stand among those who shall not be able to "stand in the judgment," verse 5.
    </p>
<p align="justify">(3.) "He sits not in the seat of the scornful." Let it be 
    a chair of state, he will not sit in it, he knows it will prove very uneasy 
    at last. The word <b>sitting </b>implies,</p>
<p align="justify">1. An habit in sin, Psalm 50:20. "You sit and speak 
    against your brother."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Sitting implies familiarity with sinners, Psalm 26.4. 
    "I have not sat with vain people;" that is, I do not visit their haunts. The 
    godly man shakes off all intimacy with the wicked. He may <i>traffic </i>
    with them—but not <i>associate</i> with them. He may be <i>civil </i>to 
    them, as neighbors—but not twist into a cord of <i>friendship</i>. Diamonds 
    and stones may lie together—but they will not solder and cement.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">II. The godly man is described by way of position or 
    rather opposition</p></b>, "But his delight is in the law of the Lord." From 
    this word "But" observe,
<p align="justify">That negative goodness is not sufficient to entitle us to 
    heaven. To be no scorner, is good—but it is not enough. There are some in 
    the world whose religion runs all upon negatives; they are not drunkards, 
    they are not swearers—and for this they do bless themselves. See how that 
    pharisee vapors, Luke 18:11. "God, I thank you that I am not as other men 
    are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers," etc. Alas, the not being scandalous 
    will no more make a good Christian, than a cipher will make a sum. The godly 
    man goes further, "he sits not in the seat of the scorner—<b>but</b> his 
    delight is in the law of the Lord. We are bid, not only to "cease from 
    evil—but to do good," Psalm 34:14. It will be a poor plea at last, "Lord, I 
    kept myself from being spotted with gross sin. I did no hurt!" But what good 
    is there in you? It is not enough for the servant of the vineyard that he 
    does no hurt there—he does not break the trees, or destroy the hedges. If he 
    does not work in the vineyard, he loses his pay; it is not enough for us to 
    say at the last day, "We have done no hurt, we have lived in no gross sin!" 
    But what good have we done in the vineyard? Where is the grace we have 
    gotten? if we cannot show this, we shall lose our pay—and miss of salvation!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use.</p></b></font> Do not content yourselves with the 
    negative part of religion; many build their hopes for heaven upon this <i>
    cracked foundation</i>; they are given to no vice, none can charge them with 
    any foul sins. To such people I say three things.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. You may not be outwardly bad—and yet not inwardly 
    good.</p></b></font> You may be as far from grace as from vice! Though none can 
    say, "black is your <i>eye</i>"—yet your <i>soul </i>may be dyed black. 
    Though your <i>hands </i>are not working iniquity, your <i>heads </i>may be 
    plotting it. A tree may be full of vermin—yet the pretty leaves may cover 
    them—that they are not seen. Just so, the pretty leaves of <i>civility </i>
    may hide you from the eye of man—but God sees the vermin of pride, unbelief, 
    and covetousness in your heart! "You are they," says Christ, "who justify 
    yourselves before men—but God knows your hearts!" Luke 16:15. A man may not 
    be morally evil—yet not spiritually good. He may be free from gross 
    enormity—yet full of secret enmity against God. He may be like the snake, 
    which though it be of a fine color—yet has its sting!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. If you are only negatively good, God makes no 
    reckoning of you.</p></b></font> You are as so many ciphers in God's 
    Arithmetic—and he writes down no ciphers in the book of life! Take a piece 
    of brass, though it is not so bad a metal as lead or iron—yet not being so 
    good as silver, there is little reckoning made of it, it will not pass for 
    current coin. Just so, though you are not profane—yet not being of the right 
    metal, lacking the stamp of holiness upon you—you will never pass current. 
    God slights you, you are but a <i>brass </i>Christian.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A man may as well go to hell for not doing good—as for 
    doing evil.</p></b></font> He who bears no good fruit—is just as much fuel for 
    hell—as he who bears bad fruit! Matt. 3:10, "Every tree which that does not 
    produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire." One may as 
    well die with not eating food, as with poison! A ground may as well be 
    spoiled for lack of good seed, as with having tares sown in it. Those who 
    were not active in works of Christian charity, were sadly sentenced: "Depart 
    from me you cursed, etc. for I was hungy—and you gave me no food," Matt. 25. 
    41,42. It is <i>not </i>said "that you took my food away from me"—but "you 
    gave me no food." Why were the foolish virgins shut out? They had done no 
    hurt, they had not broken their lamps. Yes—but they "took <i>no oil</i> in 
    their lamps," Matthew. 25.3. Their lacking oil was the indictment! Therefore 
    let not any man build his hope for heaven upon <i>negative goodness</i>. 
    This is building upon the sand—and the sand is bad to build on; it will not 
    cement. But suppose a man should finish an house upon the sand—what is the 
    outcome? The <i>flood </i>comes, namely, persecution—and the force of this 
    flood will wash away the sand and make the house fall. And the <i>wind </i>
    blows—the breath of the Lord as a mighty wind will blow such a sandy 
    building into hell! Be afraid then to rest in the negative part of religion, 
    launch forth further—be eminently holy. So I come to the next words—but "his 
    delight is in the law of the Lord—and in his law does he meditate day and 
    night."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    2. What is meant by <i>delighting in the Law of God?</i></p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The words give a twofold description of a godly man.</p>
<p align="justify">First, He delights in God's law.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, He meditates in God's law.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. "His DELIGHT is in the law of the Lord." </p></b></font>
    The great God has grafted the <i>affection of delight </i>in every creature. 
    Every being has, by the instinct of nature, something to delight itself in. 
    Now the true saint, not by <i>intuition</i>—but divine <i>inspiration, </i>
    makes the law of God his delight. This is the badge of a Christian, "His 
    delight is in the law of the Lord." A man may work in his trade—and not 
    delight in it, either in regard of the difficulty of the work, or the 
    smallness of the income. But a godly man serves God with delight; it is his 
    food and drink to do his will.
<p align="justify">For the explanation of the words, it will be inquired,</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. What is meant by "the law of the Lord." </p></b>This word, 
    Law, may be taken either more strictly or more largely. 
<p align="justify">(1.) More strictly—for the Decalogue or ten commandments.
    </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) More largely—</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] For the whole written word of God. </p>
<p align="justify">[2.] For those truths which are deducted from the 
    word—and center in it. </p>
<p align="justify">[3.] For the whole business of piety, which is the 
    counterpart of God's law—and agrees with it as the transcript with the 
    original. The Scripture is a <i>setting </i>forth of God's law—and piety is 
    a <i>showing </i>forth of God's law. I shall take this word in its full 
    latitude and extent.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. What is meant by DELIGHT in God's law.</p></b> The Hebrew 
    and Septuagint both render it, "His <i>will </i>is in the law of the Lord." 
    That which is <i>voluntary</i>, is <i>delightful</i>. A gracious heart 
    serves God from a principle of sincerity; he makes God's law not only his 
    task—but his recreation; upon this scripture-stock I shall graft this 
    proposition.
<p align="justify">Doctrine. That a child of God, though he cannot serve the 
    Lord <i>perfectly</i>—yet he serves him <i>willingly</i>. His <i>will </i>is 
    in the law of the Lord; he is not a pressed soldier—but a volunteer. By the 
    beating of this pulse, we may judge whether there is spiritual life in us, 
    or not. David professes God's law was his delight, Psalm 119:77. He had his
    <i>crown </i>to delight in, he had his <i>music </i>to cheer him—but the 
    love he had to God's law—drowned all other delights; just as the joy of 
    harvest and vintage, exceeds the joy of gleaning. "I delight in the law of 
    God," says Paul, "in the inner man." Romans 7:22, the Greek word is, "I take 
    pleasure in the law of God." That is—"the law of God is my recreation!" It 
    was a <i>heart </i>delight—it was in the <i>inner </i>man. A wicked man may 
    have joy in the face, 2 Cor. 5:12, like the dew which wets the leaf; but the 
    wine of God's Spirit cheers the heart. Paul delighted in the law in the 
    inner man.<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Whence the saint's spiritual delight springs.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The saint's delight in the law of God proceeds,</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. From soundness of judgment. </p></b></font>The mind 
    apprehends a beauty in God's law. Like a magnet—the <i>judgment </i>draws 
    the <i>affections</i>. "The law of God is perfect," Psalm 19.7. The Hebrew 
    word for perfect, seems to allude to a perfect, whole body, which has 
    perfect lineaments. God's law must be perfect, for it is able to make us 
    wise to salvation, 2 Tim. 3.15. The Septuagint renders it, the law of the 
    Lord is <i>pure</i>—like beauty which has no stain—or wine which is purified 
    and refined. The soul that looks into this law, seeing so much luster and 
    perfection, cannot but delight in it. The middle lamp of the sanctuary being 
    lighted from the fire of the altar, gave light to all the other lamps. Just 
    so—the <i>judgment </i>being lighted from the Scripture, it sets on fire the 
    lamps of the <i>affections</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. This holy delight arises from the predominancy of 
    grace.</p></b></font> When grace comes with authority and majesty upon the 
    heart, it fills it with delight. Naturally we have no delight in God; 
    "Therefore they say unto God—depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge 
    of your ways!" Nay, there is not only a dislike of God—but antipathy to God! 
    Sinners are called <i>haters of God</i>, Romans 1.30. but when grace comes 
    into the heart, O what a change is there! Grace preponderates, it files off 
    the rebellion of the will—it makes a man of another spirit! It turns the 
    lion-like fierceness, into a dove-like sweetness! It changes hatred into 
    delight! It puts a new bias into the will! It works a spontaneity and 
    cheerfulness in God's service. "Your people shall be a willing people in the 
    day of your power," Psalm 110.8.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. This holy delight in true piety is from the sweetness 
    of the end.</p></b></font> Well may we with cheerfulness let down the net of our 
    endeavor, when we have so excellent a draught. Heaven at the end of duty, 
    causes delight in the way of duty.
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Use 1. Showing a characteristic difference between a child of God and a 
    hypocrite.</p></b></font> It shows us a discriminating difference between a 
    child of God and an hypocrite—the Christian serves God from a principle of 
    delight, the hypocrite does not. "The law of your mouth is better unto me 
    than thousands of gold and silver," Psalm 119.72. With what delight does a 
    covetous man count over his thousands? Yes—but God's law was better to David 
    than thousands! A child of God looks upon the service of God, not only as 
    his <i>duty</i>—but his <i>privilege</i>. 
<p align="justify">A gracious heart loves everything that has the stamp of 
    God upon it. <b>Scripture </b>is his delight. "Your words were found and I 
    ate them—and your word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart," Jer. 
    15.16. <b>Prayer </b>is his delight, Isaiah 56.7. "I will make them joyful 
    in my house of prayer." <b>Hearing </b>is his delight, Isaiah 60.8. "Who are 
    these who fly like doves to their windows?" The gracious soul flies as a 
    dove to an ordinance, upon the wings of delight! The <b>sacrament </b>is his 
    delight: On this day the Lord makes "a feast of fat things, a feast of wines 
    on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well 
    refined," Isaiah 25.6. A sacrament day is a soul-festival day; here Christ 
    takes the soul into his banqueting-house—and displays "the banner of love 
    over it," Cant. 2.4. Here are heavenly delicacies set before us. Christ 
    gives us his body and blood. This is angels' food, this is the heavenly 
    nectar, here is a cup perfumed with the divine nature; here is wine spiced 
    with the love of God. The Jews at their feasts poured ointment upon their 
    guests—and kissed them; here Christ pours the oil of gladness into the 
    heart—and kisses us with the kisses of his lips. This is the king's bath 
    where we wash and are cleansed of our leprosy! The withered soul, after the 
    receiving this <i>blessed supper</i>, has been like a watered garden—or like 
    those Egyptian fields, after the overflowing of the Nile—fruitful and 
    flourishing. Do you wonder that a child of God delights in holy things? He 
    must needs be a <i>volunteer </i>in piety.</p>
<p align="justify">But it is not thus with an hypocrite; he may be <i>forced
    </i>to do that which is good—but not to <i>will </i>that which is good; he 
    does not serve God with delight. Job 27.10. "Will he delight himself in the 
    Almighty?" That he has none of this delight, appears thus—because he serves 
    God grudgingly; he brings his sacrifice with a wicked mind, Proverbs 21.27. 
    Such an one was Cain. It was long before he brought his offering, it was not 
    the first-fruits; and when he did bring it, it was grudgingly; it was not a 
    free-will offering, Deut. 16. 10. It is probable it was the <i>custom </i>of 
    his father's family to sacrifice; and perhaps conscience might check him for 
    forbearing so long; at last the offering is brought—but how? as a <i>task
    </i>rather than a pleasure; as a <i>fine </i>rather than a <i>sacrifice</i>. 
    Cain brought his offering—but not himself. What Seneca says of a gift, I may 
    say of a sacrifice; it is not gold and silver makes a gift—but a willing 
    mind, if this is lacking, the gold is only <i>parted </i>with, not <i>given</i>. 
    Just so, it is not prayer and hearing which makes a sacrifice—but it is a 
    willing mind. Cain's was not an offering—but a tax; not worship—but penance.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Two cases of conscience resolved</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">But here are two cases to be put.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Case 1. Can a regenerate person become spiritually weary</p>
<p align="justify">--and not delight in God?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. I answer, Yes--but this delight in God is not wholly 
    extinct. </p></b></font>This lassitude and weariness in a child of God may arise 
    from the in-dwelling of corruption, Romans 7.24. It is not from the grace 
    which is in him--but the sin which dwells in him--just as Peter's sinking on 
    the water was not from his faith--but his fear. Yet I still say--that a 
    regenerate person's will is for God, Romans 7:15. Paul found sometimes an 
    indisposition to good, Romans 7.23--yet at the same time he professes a 
    delight in God, verse 22. "I delight in the law of God, in the inner man." 
    One may delight in music, or any recreation--yet through weariness of body, 
    be for the present dulled and indisposed. Just so--a Christian may love 
    God's law, though sometimes the clog of the flesh weighing him down, he 
    finds his former vigor and agility abated.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. I answer, That this spiritual faintness and weariness 
    in a regenerate person is not habitual</p></b></font>; it is not his constant 
    temper. The water may ebb for a while it is low-tide; but there is soon a 
    high-tide again. Just so, it is sometimes low-tide in a Christian's soul. At 
    this time, he finds an indisposition and irksomeness to that which is 
    holy--but within a short time, there is a high-tide of affection--and the 
    soul is carried full sail in holy duties! It is with a Christian, as with a 
    man who is very ill; when he is sick he does not take that delight in his 
    food as formerly; nay, sometimes the very sight of it nauseates him. But 
    when he is well--he goes to his food again with delight and appetite. Just 
    so, when the soul is distempered through sadness and melancholy, it finds 
    not that delight in Scripture and prayer as formerly; but when it returns to 
    its healthful temper again, now it has the same delectability and 
    cheerfulness in God's service as before!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. I answer, That this spiritual weariness in a 
    regenerate person is involuntary.</p></b></font> He is troubled at it; he does 
    not hug his disease—but mourns under it. He is weary of his weariness! When 
    he finds a heaviness in duty, he goes heavily under that heaviness; he 
    prays, weeps, wrestles, uses all means to regain that alacrity in God's 
    service, as he was accustomed to have. David, when his chariot wheels were 
    pulled off, and he drove on heavily in piety--how often does he pray for 
    quickening grace! When the saints have found their hearts fainting, their 
    affections flagging, and a strange kind of lethargy seizing on them--they 
    are never at rest until they have recovered themselves--and are arrived at 
    that freedom and delight in God, as they were once sensible of.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Case 2. The second case is—Whether a hypocrite may not 
    serve God with delight?</p></b></font> I answer—he may. Herod heard John the 
    Baptist gladly, Matt. 6.20. and those who fasted for strife and debate, "did 
    delight to know God's way," Isa, 58.2. An hypocrite may, out of some flashy 
    hopes of heaven, show a delight in goodness; but yet it is not such a 
    delight as is found in the regenerate, for his delight is carnal. A man may 
    be carnal while he is doing spiritual things: It is not the holiness and 
    strictness in piety, which the hypocrite delights in—but something else. He 
    delights in <b>prayer</b>—but it is rather the showing of gifts he looks at, 
    than the exercise of grace. He delights in <b>hearing</b>—but it is not the 
    spirituality of the Scripture he delights in; not the savor of knowledge—but 
    the luster. When he goes to the <b>word preached</b>, it is that he may 
    rather feast his mind, than better his heart; as if a man should go to an 
    apothecary's shop for a pill, only to see the gilding of it, not for the 
    operative virtue. The hypocrite goes to the word to see what gilding is in a 
    sermon, and what may delight the intellect. Hypocrites come to <b>Scripture
    </b>as one comes into a garden to pluck some fine flower to smell—not as a 
    child comes to the breast for nutriment. This is rather <i>curiosity </i>
    than <i>piety</i>. 
<p align="justify">Such were those in Ezek. 33.32, You "are to them as a 
    very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an 
    instrument." The prophet being eloquent, and having a pleasing delivery, 
    they were much taken with it, and it was as sweet to them as fine music—but 
    it was not the spirituality of the matter they so well liked, as the 
    tuneableness of the voice. It was a sharp—yet seasonable reproof of 
    Chrysostom to his hearers, "This is that," says he, "which is likely to undo 
    your souls—you hear your ministers as so many minstrels, to please the ear, 
    not to pierce the conscience." You see, a hypocrite's delight in piety is 
    carnal; it is not the being nourished up in the words of faith, which he 
    minds—but the eloquence of speech, the rareness of notion, the quickness of 
    imagination, the smoothness of style: he strives only to pluck from the tree 
    of <i>knowledge</i>. Alas, poor man, you may have the <i>star-light of 
    knowledge</i>, and yet it may be night in your soul.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Use 2. Trial of a Christian's delight in God. </p></b></font>Let this put us 
    upon a holy scrutiny and trial, whether we have this delight in piety? It is 
    life or death as we answer this.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question. How may this spiritual delight be known?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 1. </p></b></font>He who delights in God's law, is 
    often <b>thinking </b>of it; what a man delights in, his thoughts are still 
    running upon; he who delights in money, his mind is taken up with it; 
    therefore the covetous man is said to <i>mind </i>earthly things, Phil. 
    3.19. Thus if there is a delight in the things of God, the mind will be 
    still musing upon them. O what a rare treasure is the word of God! It is the 
    field where the pearl of great price is hidden! How precious are the 
    promises! They are the conduit which holds the water of life; they are like 
    those two olive branches, "which pour out golden oil," Zech. 4.12. These 
    seal up pardon, adoption, and glory! "O Lord, by these things men live," 
    Isaiah 38.16. Where there is a delight in the law of God, the mind is wholly 
    busied about it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 2. </p></b></font>If we delight in piety, there is 
    nothing can keep us from it—but we will be conversant in Scripture, prayer, 
    sacraments. He who loves gold will trade for it. The merchant will compass 
    sea and land to make money his proselyte. Men will not be kept from their 
    sales. If there is a delight in holy things, we will not be detained from an 
    ordinance, for there we are trafficking for salvation. If a man were hungry, 
    he would not stay away from the market, because of the aching of his finger. 
    The ordinances are a gospel market, and those who hunger and thirst after 
    righteousness, will not for every slight occasion stay away. "I was glad 
    when they said, come let us go up to the house of the Lord," Psalm 122.1. 
    You who are glad when the devil helps you with an excuse to absent yourself 
    from the house of the Lord, are far from this holy delight.

<p align="justify">Answer 3. </p></b></font>Those who delight in piety are often
    <b>speaking </b>of it; "Then those who feared the Lord spoke often one to 
    another," Mal. 3.16. Where there is grace <i>infused</i>, it will be <i>
    effusive</i>. "The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious," Eccl. 12.10. 
    David delighting in God's testimonies, "would speak of them before kings," 
    Psalm 119.46. The spouse delighting in her beloved, could not conceal her 
    love—but breaks forth into most moving, and no less elegant expressions: "My 
    beloved is white and ruddy, the chief among ten thousand, his head is as the 
    most fine gold," etc. The disciples whose hearts were upon Christ, make him 
    the whole subject of their discourse as they were going to Emmaus, Luke 
    24.19. The primitive Christians who were fired with love to God, did speak 
    so much of heaven, and the kingdom prepared, that the emperor suspected they 
    meant to take his kingdom from him! <i>Words are the looking-glass of the 
    mind—they show what is in the heart! </i>Where there is spiritual delight, 
    like new wine, it will have vent. A man who is of the earth speaks of the 
    earth, John 3.31. He can hardly speak three words—but two of them are about 
    earth. His mouth, like the fish in the gospel, is full of gold, Matt. 17.27. 
    Just so—where there is a delight in God, "our tongues will be as the pen of 
    a ready writer." Psalm 45. This is a scripture touchstone to try men's 
    hearts by. Alas, it shows how little they delight in God, because they are 
    possessed with a dumb devil; they speak not the language of Canaan.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 4. </p></b></font>He who delights in God, will give 
    him the best in every service. Him whom we love best, shall have of the 
    best. The spouse delighting in Christ, will give him of her pleasant fruits, 
    Cant. 7.13. And if she has a cup of spiced wine, and full of the juice of 
    the pomegranate—he must drink of it, Cant. 8.2. He who delights in God gives 
    him the strength of his affections, the cream of his duties. Says he, "God 
    shall have the best!" Hypocrites care not what they put God off with; they 
    offer that to the Lord which costs them nothing; a prayer that costs them no 
    wrestling, no pouring out of the soul. 1 Sam. 1. They put no cost in their 
    services. Cain brought of the fruit of the ground, Gen. 4.8. It is 
    observable, the Holy Spirit does not mention anything that might commend, or 
    set off Cain's sacrifice. When he comes to speak of Abel's, he sets an 
    emphasis upon it, "Abel brought several <i>choice </i>lambs from the <i>best
    </i>of his flock," verse 4—but when he speaks of Cain, he only says, "he 
    brought of the fruit of the ground." Some sorry thing, perhaps pulled out of 
    a ditch! God who is best, will be served with the best. Domitian would not 
    have his statute carved in wood or iron—but in gold. God will have the best 
    of our best things—he will have our golden services. He who delights in God, 
    gives him the the <i>choice </i>sacrifices—the purest of his love, the 
    hottest of his zeal! And when he has done all, he grieves he can do no more, 
    he blushes to see such an infinite disproportion between <i>Deity </i>and 
    his poor <i>duty</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 5. </p></b></font>He who delights in God, does not 
    much delight in anything else. The world appears in an eclipse; Paul 
    delighted in the law of God, in the inner man—and how was he crucified to 
    the world! Gal. 6.14. It is not absolutely unlawful to delight in the things 
    of the world, Deut. 26.11. "You shall rejoice in every good thing which the 
    Lord your God has given you." None may better take the comfort of these 
    things than believers; for they have the best right to them; and they have 
    the dew of a blessing distilled, "Take two talents, said Naaman to Gehazi," 
    2 Kings 5.23. So says God to a believer, take two talents, take your outward 
    comforts, and take my love with them. But the children of God, though they 
    are thankful for outward mercies—yet they are not enthralled with these 
    things; they use them only as a convenience for their passage; they know 
    they need them as a staff to walk with—but when they shall sit down in the 
    kingdom of heaven, and rest themselves, they shall have no use of this 
    Jacob's staff. Believers do not much pray for these fleeting earthly things. 
    Their delight is chiefly in God and his law.
<p align="justify">Is it thus with us? Have we this low opinion of all 
    sublunary comforts? The astronomer says, that if it were possible for a man 
    to be lifted up as high as the moon, the earth would seem to him but as a 
    little point. If we could be lifted up to heaven in our affections, all 
    earthly delights would seem as nothing. When the woman of Samaria had met 
    with Christ, down goes the pitcher, she leaves that behind! Just so, he who 
    delights in God, as having tasted the sweetness in him, does not much mind 
    the pitcher—he leaves the world behind.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 6. </p></b></font>True delight is constant. Hypocrites 
    have their pangs of desire, and flashes of joy, which are soon over. The 
    Jews did rejoice in John's light for a season, John 5.35. Unsound hearts may 
    delight in the law of the Lord for a season; but, they will quickly change 
    their note, "What a weariness is it to serve the Lord!" The Chrysolite, 
    which is of a golden color, in the morning is very bright to look on—but 
    towards noon it grows dull, and has lost its splendor; such are the 
    glistening shows of hypocrites. True delight, like the fire of the altar, 
    never goes out; affliction cannot extirpate it, Psalm 119.145. "Trouble and 
    anguish have taken hold on me—yet your commandments are my delight."
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Use 3. Exhortation. A persuasive to this holy delight in piety. </p></b></font>
    Let me persuade Christians to labor for this holy delight. "Let your delight 
    be in the law of the Lord." And that I may the better enforce the 
    exhortation, I shall lay before you several weighty considerations.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. There is that in the law of God which may cause 
    delight</p></b></font>; as will appear in two things. There is in it,
<p align="justify">1. Truth.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Goodness.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Truth.</p></b> </font>The law of God is a book of truth, 
    Psalm 119.160. "Your word is true from the beginning." The two Testaments 
    are the two lips by which the God of truth has spoken to us. Here is a firm 
    basis for faith.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Goodness. </p></b></font>Nehem. 9.13. "You gave them true 
    laws, good statutes." Here is Truth and Goodness; the one adequate to the 
    understanding, the other to the desires. Now this goodness and excellency of 
    the law of God shines forth in nine particulars.
<p align="justify">1. This blessed law of God, is a love letter sent to us 
    from heaven, written by the Holy Spirit, and sealed with the blood of 
    Christ! Isaiah 62.5. "As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall 
    your God rejoice over you;" and Hosea 2.19. "I will betroth you unto me 
    forever in righteousness and in loving kindness, and in mercies." Is it not 
    delightful reading over this love-letter!</p>
<p align="justify">2. The law of God is a light "which shines in a dark 
    place," 2 Pet. 1.19. It is our pole-star to guide us to heaven; it was 
    David's candle and lantern to walk with, Psalm 119.105. Now light is sweet, 
    Ec. 11.7. it is sad to lack this light. <i>Those heathen who have not the 
    knowledge of God's law—must needs stumble into hell in the dark! </i>Hierom 
    brings in Tully with his oratory, and Aristotle with his syllogisms, crying 
    out in hell. Those who leave the light of the word, following <i>the light 
    within them</i>, as some speak, prefer the shining of the glow-worm before 
    the radiance of sun.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The law of God is a spiritual looking-glass to dress 
    our souls by. David oft dressed himself in this glass, and got much wisdom, 
    Psalm 119.104. "Through your precepts I get understanding." This 
    looking-glass both shows us our blemishes—and takes them away. The law of 
    God is a <i>looking-glass </i>to show us our faces—and a <i>laver </i>to 
    wash away our blemishes.</p>
<p align="justify">4. This law of God contains in it our evidences for 
    heaven; would we know whether we are heirs of the promise, whether our names 
    are written in heaven? we must find it in this law book, 2 Thess. 2.13. "He 
    has chosen us to salvation through sanctification." 1 John 2.14. "We know 
    that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren;" and 
    is it not comfortable reading over our evidences?</p>
<p align="justify">5. The law of God is an armory, out of which we must 
    fetch our spiritual artillery to fight against Satan. It may be compared to 
    the "Tower which David built for an armory, whereon there hang a thousand 
    shields of mighty men," Cant. 4.4. It is called the "sword of the Spirit," 
    Eph. 6.16. It is observable, when the devil tempted our Savior, he runs to 
    scripture for armor, "it is written!" Three times Christ wounds the serpent 
    with this sword! Mat. 4.4, etc. It is good having our armor about us, when 
    the enemy is in the field.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The law of God is our spiritual remedy-book. When 
    there is any disease growing in the soul, here is a remedy to take. If we 
    find ourselves dead in duty, here is a remedy, Psalm 119.50. "Your word has 
    quickened me!" If our hearts are hard, here is a remedy, "Is not my word as 
    fire!" Jer. 23.29. This is able to melt the rock into tenderness. If we grow 
    proud, here is a remedy, 1. Pet. 5.5. "God resists the proud." If there is 
    any fresh guilt contracted, here we have a sovereign medicine to take, John 
    17.17. "Sanctify them through your truth." The law of God is like a garden 
    of spiritual medicines, where we may walk and gather any herb to expel the 
    poison of sin.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The law of God is a divine treasury to enrich us! Here 
    are the riches of knowledge, and the riches of assurance to be found, Col. 
    2.2. In this law of God are scattered many truths as precious diamonds to 
    adorn the hidden man of the heart. David took the law of God as his 
    heritage, Psalm 119.111. In this blessed mine is hidden the true pearl of 
    great price! Here we dig until we find heaven!</p>
<p align="justify">8. The law of God is our cordial in fainting times; and 
    it is a strong cordial, Heb. 6.18. "That we might have <i>strong consolation</i>." 
    They are strong consolations indeed, which can sweeten affliction, which can 
    turn water into wine, that can stand against the fiery trial. "This is my 
    comfort in affliction, for your word has quickened me," Psalm 119.50. The 
    comforts of the world are weak consolations; a man has comfort in health—but 
    let sickness come, where is his comfort then? He has comfort in an 
    estate—but let poverty come, where is his comfort then? These are weak 
    consolations, they cannot bear up against trouble; but the comforts of 
    Scripture are strong consolations, they can sweeten the waters of Marah. Let 
    sickness come, the comforts of Scripture can allay and stupify it, "the 
    inhabitant of the land shall not say—I am sick," Isaiah 33.24. Let death 
    come, a Christian can outbrave it: "O death, where is your sting?" 1 Cor. 
    15.55. Is it not comfortable to have such a cordial lying by, as can expel 
    the venom of death?</p>
<p align="justify">9. The law of God is manna. This heavenly manna suits 
    itself to every Christian's palate. What does the soul desire? quickening? 
    strengthening? He may find all in this manna!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Delight in piety crowns all our services.</p></b></font> 
    Therefore David counsels his son Solomon, not only to serve God—but to serve 
    him "with a willing mind," 1 Chron. 28.9. Delight in duty is better than 
    duty itself; as it is worse for a man to <i>delight </i>in sin, than to <i>
    commit </i>it. So delight in duty is to be preferred before duty: "O how 
    love I your law," Psalm 119.97. It is not how much we <i>do</i>—but how much 
    we <i>love</i>; hypocrites may obey God's law—but the saints love his law. 
    Love carries away the garland.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Delight in spiritual things evidences grace</p></b></font>; 
    it is a sign we have received the spirit of adoption. A sincere child 
    delights to obey his father. He who is born of God, is enobled by grace, and 
    acts from a principle of sincerity; grace alters the bias of the heart, and 
    makes the stubborn rebellious heart, into a willing heart. The Spirit of 
    grace is called a free Spirit, Psalm 51. not only because he works 
    freely—but because he makes the heart free and cheerful in obedience; a 
    gracious heart does not act by <i>constraint</i>—but by free <i>consent</i>.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Delight in piety will make the business of piety more 
    easy to us.</p></b></font> Delight makes everything easy; there is nothing hard 
    to a willing mind; delight turns piety into recreation; it is like fire to 
    the sacrifice, like oil to the wheels. Like wind to the sails—it carries us 
    full sail in duty! He who delights in God's way, will never complain of the 
    ruggedness of the way; a child that is going to his father's house, does not 
    complain of the difficulty of the way. A Christian is going to heaven in the 
    way of duty; every prayer, every sacrament, he is a step nearer his Father's 
    house! Surely he is so full of joy he is going home, that he will not 
    complain of bad way. Get then this holy delight. Beloved, we have not many 
    miles to <i>go</i>—death will shorten our way, let <i>delight </i>sweeten 
    it!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">5. All the duties in piety are for our good. </p></b></font>
    We shall have the benefit; "If you are wise, you shall be wise for 
    yourself," Proverbs 9.12. God has twisted <i>his glory</i> and <i>our good
    </i>together. "I gave them my laws so they could live by keeping them. Yes, 
    all those who keep them will live!" Ezek. 20.11. There is nothing the Lord 
    requires—but it tends to self-preservation. God bids us read his word, and 
    why? this word is his will and testament wherein he makes over a great 
    estate to be settled upon us, Col. 1.12; 1 John 2.25. "And this is the 
    promise that he has promised us, even eternal life." 
<p align="justify">He bids us pray, and this duty carries food in the mouth 
    of it, 1 John 5.14. "This is the confidence we have in him, that if we ask 
    anything according to his will, he hears us." Ask what you will, he will 
    sign your petitions. If you had a friend who should say, "Come to me 
    whenever you desire, and I will furnish you with money," would you not 
    delight to visit that friend! God will give to more than half the kingdom, 
    and shall we not delight in prayer? God bids us believe, and there is a 
    honey-comb to be found in this precept, "Believe and you shall be saved." 
    Salvation is the crown that is set upon the head of faith! Well may the 
    apostle say, "his commandments are not grievous." O then, if piety be so 
    beneficial, if there is such gold to be dug out of this mine, it may make us 
    delight in the ways of God. What will entice us—if not self-interest?</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">6. How did Christ delight in the work of our redemption!
    </p></b></font>"Lo, I come, I delight to do your will, O my God," Psalm 40.7,8. 
    It is by expositors agreed that it is spoken mystically of Christ; when he 
    came into the world to sacrifice his life for us, it was a free-will 
    offering. "I have a baptism to be baptized with," Luke 12.50. Christ was to 
    be, as it were, baptized in his own blood, and how did he thirst for that 
    time? "How am I straitened until it be accomplished!" Did Christ so delight 
    in the work of our redemption—and shall not we delight in his service? Did 
    he suffer willingly—and do we pray unwillingly? Did he so cheerfully lay 
    down his life for us—and shall not we give up our lives to him? Certainly if 
    anything could make Christ repent of shedding his blood, it would be this—to 
    see Christians so reluctant in duty, bringing it rather as a <i>penance </i>
    than a <i>sacrifice</i>.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Delight in God's service makes us resemble the angels 
    in heaven.</p></b></font> They serve God with cheerfulness; as soon as God 
    speaks the word, they are ambitious to obey. How are they ravished with 
    delight while they are praising God! In heaven we shall be as the angels; 
    spiritual delight would make us like them here! To serve God by constraint, 
    is to be like the devil; all the devils in hell obey God—but it is against 
    their will, they yield a grudging obedience; but service which comes off 
    with delight—is angelic! This is what we pray for, that "God's will may be 
    done on <i>earth</i>—as it is in <i>heaven</i>;" is it not done with delight 
    there?
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">8. His delight in God's law will not breed surfeit. </p></b>
</font>Carnal objects often cause a loathing and nauseating; we soon grow 
    weary of our delights; hence it is we change from one earthly vanity to 
    another. Too much pleasure is a pain! But spiritual objects do not cloy or 
    tire the soul; the more we study in the law of God, the more delight we 
    find. And in this regard David might say, the words of God's mouth were 
    "sweeter to his taste than honey," Psalm 119.103. because one may soon 
    surfeit upon honey—but he can never surfeit with the word of God. He who has 
    once, with Jeremiah, "found the word and ate it," Jer. 15.16. will not be 
    cloyed with it! There is that savouriness in the word, that a Christian 
    cries out, "Lord, evermore give me this bread!" There is that sweetness in 
    communion with God, that the soul says, "O that I might be always thus!" He 
    who delights in God, does not complain he has too much of God—but rather too 
    little: he opens and spreads the sails of his soul to take in more of those 
    heavenly gales, he longs for that time when he shall be ever delighting 
    himself in the sweet and blessed vision of God!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">9. Without this holy delight we weary both ourselves, and 
    God. </p></b></font>Isaiah 7.13. "Will you weary my God also?" Our delighting in 
    God would make him delight in us. But when we begin to say "what a weariness 
    is it to serve the Lord," God is as weary as we are; he is even sick of such 
    services. When duties are a burden to us, they are a burden to God! When a 
    man is weary of a burden, he will cast it off. Let all this quicken delight 
    in God's service.
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Use 4. Showing how a Christian may arrive at this delight in God's Law. </p></b>
</font>For the attaining this blessed delight in the law of God, three 
    things are requisite.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Direction 1.</p></b></font> Set an high estimate upon 
    Scripture; what the judgment prizes—the affections embrace. He who values 
    gold, will delight in it. We are apt, through unbelief, to entertain slight 
    thoughts of piety, therefore our affections are so slight. David prized 
    God's statutes at a high rate; "More to be desired are they than gold, yes, 
    than much fine gold," Psalm 19.10. and hence grew that inflamed love to 
    them; "I will delight myself in your statutes," Psalm 119.16.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Direction 2.</p></b></font> Pray for a spiritual heart. An 
    earthly heart will not delight in spiritual mysteries; the earth puts out 
    the fire. Earthliness destroys holy delight; get a spiritual palate, that 
    you may relish the sweetness of the Scripture. He who tastes the sweetness 
    of honey, will delight in it. "If so be you have tasted that the Lord is 
    gracious," 1 Pet. 2.3. It is not enough to <i>hear </i>a sermon—but you must
    <i>taste </i>a sermon; it is not enough to <i>read </i>a promise—but you 
    must <i>taste </i>a promise. When you have gotten this spiritual palate, 
    then God's word will be to you "the joy and rejoicing of your heart," Jer. 
    15.16.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Direction 3.</p></b></font> If you would delight in the law 
    of God, purge out the delight of sin; sin will poison this spiritual 
    delight. If you would have God's law sweet, let not "wickedness be sweet in 
    your mouth," Job 20.12. <b>When sin is your burden—Christ will be your 
    delight!</b>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Use 5. Thankfulness. Holy delight should cause thankfulness.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">What cause have they to be thankful, who can find this 
    spiritual delight in God! How did David bless God that he gave the people 
    hearts to offer so cheerfully to the building of the temple; "Who am I, and 
    what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this 
    sort?" Their willingness was more than their offering; so should a Christian 
    say, "Lord, who am I, that I should offer so willingly? Who am I that I 
    should have your free Spirit, and should serve you rather out of choice than 
    constraint!"</p>
<p align="justify">It is a great blessing to have this promptitude and 
    alacrity in God's service. Delight animates and enlivens duty; now we act to 
    purpose in piety. Christians are never drawn so powerfully and sweetly, as 
    when the <i>chain of delight</i> is fastened to their heart. Without this 
    all is lost; our praying and hearing is like water spilt upon the ground. It 
    loses both its beauty and reward. Then bless God, Christian, who has oiled 
    the wheels of your soul with delight, and now you can "run and not be 
    weary." For your comfort, be assured you shall not lack anything your heart 
    can desire, Psalm 37.4. "Delight yourself in the Lord, and he shall give you 
    the desires of your heart."</p>
