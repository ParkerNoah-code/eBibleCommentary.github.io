<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Duty of Self-Denial</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson, 1675<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">Christian Reader,<br/>
    The weightiness of the argument here discoursed on justly merits a larger 
    volume. But I have contracted it, so that it may possibly come into more 
    hands. I must profess I do not know a more necessary point in divinity. <i>
    Self-denial is the first principle of Christianity! </i>It is the life-blood 
    which must run through the whole body of piety. Self-denial is not learned 
    at an academy, but from the oracles of Scripture.</p>
<p align="justify">It is my request to the reader to pursue this manual with 
    seriousness, knowing that the practice of self-denial is that wherein his 
    salvation is nearly concerned. "May the Lord work with His Word and cause 
    the dew of His blessing to fall with this manna," is the prayer of,<br/>
    Your Friend and Servant in the Gospel,<br/>
    Thomas Watson, 1675<br/>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">1. Exposition of the verse.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"And He said to them all—If any man will come after Me, 
    let him deny himself." Luke 9:23</p>
<p align="justify">"All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for 
    teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so 
    that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work." 2 
    Timothy 3:16. The Word is compared to a lamp for its <i>illuminating </i>
    quality, Psalm 119:105, and to refined silver for its <i>enriching </i>
    quality, Psalm 12:6. Among other parts of sacred writ, this is not the 
    least, "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."</p>
<p align="justify">These words are dropped from the lips of Christ, the 
    oracle of truth. In the preceding verse, our blessed Savior foretold His 
    suffering, "The Son of Man must suffer many things." And His suffering is 
    set down in two expressions:</p>
<p align="justify">1. He must be rejected. Thus He was the "stone which the 
    builders rejected," Psalm 118:22.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He must be slain. This diamond must be <i>cut!</i> He 
    who gave life to others, must Himself die. And as Christ thus abased Himself 
    for us—so we must deny ourselves for Him. "And He said to them all, If any 
    man will come after Me, let him deny himself."</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Self-denial is the foundation of godliness, and if this 
    is not well laid, all the building will fall</i>. Let me explain the words:</p>
<p align="justify">1. "And He said to them <b>all</b>." Self-denial is of 
    universal extent. It concerns all; it respects both ministers and people. 
    Christ spoke it as well to His apostles as to the rest of His hearers.</p>
<p align="justify">2. "If any man will come after Me." That is--if he will 
    arrive at that place of glory where I am going--"let him deny himself."</p>
<p align="justify">3. "Let him deny himself." Beza and Erasmus render it, 
    "Let him lay aside or reject himself." Self-denial is a kind of 
    self-annihilation. The words have two parts:</p>
<p align="justify">First, a <i>supposal</i>: "If any man will come after 
    Me."</p>
<p align="justify">Second, an <i>imposal</i>: "Let him deny himself." These 
    words are not only a permission—but an injunction. It carries in it the 
    force of the command. It is as if a king should say, "Let it be enacted."</p>
<p align="justify">The PROPOSITION I shall insist on, is that <b>a true 
    Christian must be a self-denier. </b>"Let him deny himself."</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center"><br/>
    2. Explanation of the Proposition</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">In what sense must a Christian NOT deny himself?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">1. He must not deny his <i>promise</i>. A man's promise should 
    be sacred. He is to keep it though it is to his loss, Psalm 15:1,4. He who 
    makes no reckoning of his <i>promise</i>—God makes no reckoning of his <i>
    profession</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A Christian must not deny his <i>grace</i>. He must not 
    disown any good work wrought in him. He ought not to say that he is a dry tree—when the dew of heaven lies upon his branches. As it is a sin for a man 
    to make himself better than he is—so it is to make himself worse. To say he 
    has grace when he has none—is <i>presumption</i>. To say he has no grace 
    when he has—is <i>ingratitude</i>. It is bearing false witness against the 
    Spirit of God.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">In what sense MUST a Christian deny himself?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">In general, he must deny that carnal part which is as 
    near to him as himself, that which is as the apple of his eye. But more 
    particularly:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. A Christian must deny his REASON. </p></b></font>I do not 
    say renounce it—but deny it. Some cry up <i>the Diana of reason</i>, making 
    it the rule and standard of faith. Indeed, that there is a God and that this 
    God is to be worshiped, is a law written in the heart of man and is 
    consonant to reason. But <i>who </i>God is, and the right mode of worship, 
    is such a sublime matter, that <i>reason </i>can no more find out—than the 
    Philistines could Sampson's riddle. Job 11:7, "Can you by searching find out 
    God?"
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Reason must be denied in DOCTRINES proposed to be 
    believed:</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The doctrine of the <b>Trinity</b>. The well is deep, and 
    who can<i> </i>fathom it with the <i>plumbline of reason</i>! The three 
    persons in the Trinity are <i>distinguished </i>but not divided. They are 
    three <i>subsistences </i>but one <i>essence</i>. The Trinity is purely an 
    object of faith. There are some truths in true religion which are 
    demonstrable by reason, such as that we should flee vice and do to others as 
    we would have them do to us. But the Trinity of persons, in the unity of 
    essence—is of divine revelation, and must be assented to by faith. Those 
    illuminated philosophers who could wisely discourse of the magnitude and 
    influence of the stars, the nature of plants and minerals—could not by their 
    deepest investigation, find out the mystery of the Trinity. This is wholly 
    supernatural and must be adored with humble believing!</p>
<p align="justify">The doctrine of the <b>Incarnation</b>. This doctrine 
    teaches: that eternity—should be born, that He who rules the stars—should 
    suck the breasts, that a virgin—should conceive, that the branch—should bear 
    the root, that in Christ—there should be two natures, yet but one person, 
    that the divine nature—should not be translated into the human, yet the human 
    nature should be assumed into the person of the Son of God, the human nature 
    is not God—yet one with God. Here frail human <i>reason </i>must be denied.</p>
<p align="justify">The doctrine of the <b>Resurrection</b>. That the body 
    interred, nay, crumbled into a thousand pieces—and the ashes scattered over 
    the earth—should rise again, is above frail human <i>reason </i>to imagine. 
    The Epicureans and Stoics derided Paul, when he preached to them of the 
    resurrection, Acts 17:22. Here reason must be taken captive, John 5:28, "Do 
    not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves 
    will hear his voice and come out!" 1 Corinthians 15:42-43. The chemist can, 
    out of several metals mingled together, extract the one from the other, the 
    silver from the gold, the tin from the silver, and can reduce every metal to 
    its own species. Just so, when the bodies of men are mixed with other 
    substances, the wise God can make a sudden extraction and clothe every soul 
    with its own body. Did not the same particular body rise, it would be rather 
    a <i>creation, </i>than a <i>resurrection</i>. Acts 26:8, "Why should it be 
    thought incredible, that God should raise the dead?" God <i>can </i>do it, 
    because of His power, Matthew 22:29. And he <i>must </i>do it, because of 
    His truth.</p>
<p align="justify">The doctrines of faith do not <i>oppose </i>reason—but <i>
    transcend </i>it!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Reason must be denied in in DUTIES enjoined to be 
    practiced. </p></b></font>There are many duties in piety, which carnal reason 
    quarrels at. 
<p align="justify">God says, "It is the glory of a man to pass by an 
    offense," Proverbs 19:11.</p>
<p align="justify">"No!" says carnal reason, "it is cowardice!" The heathens 
    thought it gallantry of spirit, to avenge injuries.</p>
<p align="justify">God says that the paths of holiness are strewn with 
    roses. Proverbs 3:17, "Her ways are ways of pleasantness."</p>
<p align="justify">"No!" says carnal reason, "they are severe and cynical. I 
    must crucify my delights and drown my mirth in tears!"</p>
<p align="justify">God says that piety is gainful. 1 Timothy 6:8, "Godliness 
    is great gain." It brings contentment arising from the favor of God. It 
    brings temporal riches. Proverbs 3:16, "In her left hand riches and honor." 
    The way to be prosperous is to be pious.</p>
<p align="justify">"No!" says carnal reason, If I follow the trade of piety 
    I shall go bankrupt!" In this case, carnal reason must be denied and fought 
    against. </p>
<p align="justify">He who will go no farther than <i>erring human reason</i> 
    will come many leagues short of heaven.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A Christian must deny his WILL. </p></b></font>Brugensis 
    said, "The will is the great wheel in the soul—which moves all the 
    affections." The will in the state of <i>innocence </i>was regular. It 
    echoed God's will. But since the fall, though it retains its freedom in 
    moral actions—yet spiritually it is depraved. "If the will could cease from 
    sinning," says Bernard, "there would be no hell." The greatest wound is 
    fallen upon the <i>will</i>. The mariners compass, being stricken with 
    thunder, causes the point of the needle to be wrong. Man's nature being 
    corrupted, causes the will to point wrong; it points to evil. There is in 
    the will, not only <i>impotence </i>but <i>obstinacy</i>. Acts 7:51, "You 
    have always resisted the Holy Spirit."
<p align="justify">Here we must deny our will, and subject it to God's will. 
    If a crooked stick is laid upon a level ground—we do not try to bring the 
    ground even with the stick—but to make the stick even to the ground. So 
    God's will is not to be brought to ours—but <i>our crooked will </i>must be 
    brought to God's will. We pray, "Your will be done." The way to have our 
    will, is to deny it.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A Christian must deny his own RIGHTEOUSNESS</p></b></font>, 
    his moralities, duties, and good works. Philippians 3:9, "That I may be 
    found in Him not having my own righteousness." The <i>spider </i>weaves a 
    web out of her own body. A hypocrite would spin a web of salvation out of 
    his own righteousness. But Paul, like the <i>bee</i>, sucked salvation from 
    the flower of Christ's righteousness. Isaiah 64:6, "All our righteousness are as 
    filthy rags." Our best duties are filled with sin. Put gold in the fire— and 
    out comes the dross. Our most golden services are mixed with unbelief. The 
    angel pouring sweet fragrances into the prayers of the saints, Revelation 
    8:3, shows that they are in themselves unsavory—and need Christ's sweet 
    fragrances to perfume them.
<p align="justify">We must never trust in our duties—but only in Christ's 
    righteousness for salvation. Noah's dove made use of her wings to fly—but 
    trusted the ark for safety.</p>
<p align="justify">And, if we must deny our <i>holy things </i>in point of 
    justification, then much more our civilities and moralities. A stake may be 
    finely painted—but it has no root. A man may be painted with morality—and 
    yet have no root of grace. A moral person is only externally washed—not 
    internally changed. The life may be civil to men—when the heart is wicked 
    against God; just as the sea may be calm—when the water is salty. The 
    Pharisee could say he was no adulterer, Luke 18:11—but he could not say he 
    was not proud.</p>
<p align="justify">The moral person may have a secret antipathy against 
    godliness. He may hate grace—as much as vice. Morality is but a cracked 
    title to heaven. A piece of brass may shine—but, lacking the King's image, 
    it will not pass as currency. A man may shine with moral virtues—but lacking 
    the image of God consisting in holiness—he will not pass as currency at the 
    day of judgment. Morality is good—but God will say, "You still lack one 
    thing!" Luke 18:22. Morality is a good <i>Jacob's staff </i>to walk with 
    among men—but it is a bad <i>Jacob's ladder </i>to climb up to heaven!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A Christian must deny all SELF-CONFIDENCE.</p></b></font> 
    How confident was Pendleton of himself, "This <i>fat</i> of mine shall melt in the 
    fire, for Christ!" But instead of that his <i>courage</i> melted. 
<p align="justify">The same Hebrew word signifies both <i>confidence </i>and
    <i>folly</i>. Self-confidence betrays folly. Peter presumed too much on his 
    own strength, "Peter replied—Even if all fall away on account of you, I 
    never will." Matthew 26:33. But how soon was his confidence shaken and blown 
    down with a breath of a young girl! Matthew 26:71-72, "He denied it with an 
    oath, saying, I don't know the man!" Peter's denying of Christ, was the 
    result of not denying his self-confidence. Self <i>jealousy </i>is good. 
    Romans 11:20, "Be not high-minded—but fear." The <i>trembling reed</i> often 
    stands when the <i>confident cedar </i>falls. Who that knows the fierceness 
    of a <i>trial</i>, or the falseness of his <i>heart</i>—will not fear? How 
    have some professors shined like stars in the church's hemisphere, yet have 
    been <i>falling </i>stars? Porphyry, Julian, Cardinal Pool, Gardener, Judas. 
    The Apostles have been called by some of the ancients, by such terms as "the 
    eyes of the world," "Christ's feet," "the church's breasts." Judas was one 
    of these—yet a traitor.</p>
<p align="justify">Nay, some of the saints, through God's withdrawing the 
    influence of His Spirit, have <i>relapsed </i>for a time, such as Cranmer 
    and Origen, whose heart fainted under persecution, and he offered incense to 
    the idol.</p>
<p align="justify">Deny self-confidence. 1 Corinthians 10:12, "Let him who 
    thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall." It is just with God, that he who
    <i>trusts </i>himself—should be <i>left </i>to himself! The vine being weak, 
    twists around the oak to support it. A good Christian, being conscious of 
    his own imbecility, twists by faith around Christ. Philippians 4:13, "I can 
    do all things through Christ's strengthening me." Sampson's strength lay in 
    his hair. Ours lies in our head, Christ.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A Christian must deny pride and SELF-CONCEIT.</p></b></font> 
    Job 11:12, "<i>Vain man</i> would be wise." In the Hebrew it is <i>"Empty 
    man!" </i>Man is a proud piece of flesh! He is apt to have a high opinion of 
    himself. Acts 8:9, "Simon had been a sorcerer there for many years, claiming 
    to be <i>someone great." </i>Sapor calls himself <i>"Brother of the Sun and 
    Moon." </i>Commodus the Emperor called himself <i>"The Golden Hercules." </i>
    The Persian kings made others worship their images. Such as view themselves 
    in the <i>flattering looking-glass of self-love, </i>appear bigger in their 
    own eyes than they are. They think their <i>spark </i>is a<i> sun! </i>They 
    think their <i>drop is </i>a <i>sea! </i>They are highly conceited of their 
    acumen, their wit and abilities, and are ready to despise others. The 
    Chinese think so highly of themselves, that they say that Europe has one eye 
    and they have two, and the rest of the world is blind.
<p align="justify">Deny self-conceit. Romans 12:3, "I say to every man who 
    is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think." 
    Proverbs 23:4, "Cease from your own wisdom." It does not say cease from 
    being wise—but from thinking yourself wise, Proverbs 3:7 and Philippians 
    2:3.</p>
<p align="justify">That you may deny all high, supercilious thoughts of 
    yourselves, consider:</p>
<p align="justify">Self-conceit is a great sin. Chrysostom calls it "the 
    mother of hell." It is a kind of idolatry, a self-worshiping.</p>
<p align="justify">Whatever noble endowments you have, are <i>borrowed</i>. 
    As the man said of the axe which fell in the water, 2 Kings 6:5, "Oh, my 
    master—it was <i>borrowed!" </i>And what wise man would be proud of a jewel 
    that was <i>lent </i>to him? "What makes you better than anyone else? What 
    do you have that God hasn't given you? And if all you have is from God, why
    <i>boast </i>as though you have accomplished something on your own?" 1 
    Corinthians 4:7. The moon has no cause to be proud of her light—for which 
    she is indebted to the sun.</p>
<p align="justify">Whatever acuteness of wit, or sageness of judgment you 
    have—think how far short you come. How far short do you come of that 
    knowledge which Adam had in innocence? He was the oracle of wisdom. He could 
    unlock nature's dark cabinet and find out those secrets which bewilder us. 
    Adam had a full inspection into the cause of things. He was a kind of 
    earthly angel.</p>
<p align="justify">But how far short do you come of him! Your knowledge is 
    checkered with ignorance. There are many hard knots in nature which cannot 
    be easily untied—like why the loadstone should draw <i>iron </i>and leave <i>
    gold </i>and <i>pearl</i>; or why the Nile should overflow in the summer 
    when waters are usually lowest. Job 38:24-25, "Where is the path to the 
    origin of light? Where is the home of the east wind? Who created a channel 
    for the torrents of rain? Who laid out the path for the lightning?" Why is 
    the sea higher than the earth, and yet does not drown it? How do the <i>
    bones </i>grow in the womb? Ecclesiastes 11:5. Who can explain exactly how 
    the <i>body </i>functions? He who sees <i>clearest</i>, has a <i>mist</i> before his eyes. 
    By eating of the <i>tree </i>of knowledge, we lost the <i>key </i>of 
    knowledge!</p>
<p align="justify">How far short do you come of that knowledge Satan has? He 
    is called "demon" from his knowledge. We read of the "depths of Satan," 
    Revelation 2:24, and his stratagems, 2 Corinthians 2:11. Satan is an 
    intelligent spirit. Though he has lost his <i>sanctity</i>—yet not his <i>
    knowledge</i>. Though he has lost his <i>breastplate</i>—yet not his <i>
    headpiece</i>. He has wit enough to deceive the <i>nations</i>, Revelation 
    20:3. His understanding is nimble, and, being compared with ours, is like 
    the swift flight of an eagle, compared with the slow motion of a snail. Why, 
    then, should any be puffed up with deceit of their knowledge, wherein the 
    devil far outstrips them!</p>
<p align="justify">How far short do you come of the knowledge they have who 
    are perfected in glory? He who is higher than a dwarf—may be lower than a 
    giant. Such as excel others in natural abilities—are of a lower stature than 
    the glorified saints. 1 Corinthians 13:12, "We see through a glass darkly." 
    But the saints in bliss have a full-eyed vision of God. Their light which 
    burned here like a <i>smothered fire</i>—is now blown up into a <i>pure 
    flame</i>. An glorified young Christian, knows more than the most profound 
    theologians on earth. In heaven, all <i>shadows </i>fly away—the sun of 
    righteousness having risen there with his illustrious beams! This may pull 
    down the <i>plumes of pride </i>and self-conceit.</p>
<p align="justify">Your dark side is broader than your light side. Your 
    ignorance is more than your knowledge. Your <i>knowledge </i>is but 
    candle-light; your <i>ignorance </i>as the Cimmerian darkness. Job 26:14 
    "How little a portion is known of God?" The Septuagint renders it, "How 
    little a drop!" To imagine that we can <i>comprehend the Deity</i>, is as if 
    we should think that we can <i>measure the skies</i>. Christians, the 
    greatest part of your knowledge is not as much, as the least part of your 
    ignorance. This may demolish all proud imaginations. You have no cause to be 
    conceited of the knowledge you <i>have</i>—but rather to be humbled for what 
    you <i>lack!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Think of what a hell of sin you carry about you. Sin is 
    the accursed thing, Joshua 5:13. It is the quintessence of evil. It is like 
    a stain to beauty. It was typified by the menstrual cloth, which was the 
    most unclean thing under the Law. Though you have knowledge, sin eclipses 
    it. It is as if a woman should have a fair face—but a cancer in her breast! 
    Your knowledge does not so much adorn you, as sin debases you.</p>
<p align="justify">Grace can never thrive where pride and self-conceit grow. 
    As a body with cancer cannot thrive—so neither can the soul thrive which is 
    cancered with pride and self-conceit. A proud <i>head</i>—makes a barren <i>
    heart!</i></p>

<p align="justify">A supercilious conceitedness is odious, and much lessens 
    any worth in a person. It is like a great flaw in a diamond. The more one 
    values himself, the less God and angels value him. Let a person be 
    eminent—yet, if he is self-conceited, he is loved by none. He is like a 
    physician who has the plague. Though he may be admired for his skill—yet 
    none care to come near him.</p>
<p align="justify">Such as have a high opinion of their own excellencies are 
    on the fast track to eternal ruin! Either God infatuates them, Isaiah 29:14, 
    or denies a blessing to their labors, or allows them to fall into some great 
    sin. Peter, who was so well-conceited of himself, as if he had more grace 
    than all the Apostles, the Lord let him fall very low! He denied Christ with 
    an oath, nay, an imprecation, Matthew 26:74. Peter wished a curse on himself 
    if he knew Christ; nay, some think he cursed Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">The Lord sometimes lets vain, conceited people fall—not 
    only foully, but finally. "The doves," says Pliny, "take pride in their 
    feathers, and in their flying high at last, they soar so high that they are 
    prey to the hawk!" So, when men fly high in self-conceitedness, they become 
    prey to the prince of the air!</p>
<p align="justify">Let all this, make us deny our pride; let it kill the 
    worm of self-conceit. If we are proud of our knowledge—the devil does not 
    care how much we know. Let Paul be our pattern. Though he was the chief of 
    the Apostles, he says, <i>"I am less than the least of all God's people."</i> 
    Ephesians 3:8.<i> "I am nothing." </i>2 Corinthians 12:11. This illustrious 
    Apostle, a star of the first magnitude, shrank into nothing in his own eyes. 
    It is excellent to be like Moses, whose face had a luster on it—but "he was 
    not aware that his face was radiant." Exodus 34:29.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. A Christian must deny his APPETITE.</p></b></font> The 
    gluttonous appetite cries, "Give, give!" Proverbs 30:15. Paul beat down his 
    body, 1 Corinthians 9:27. Such a proportion only is to be taken for the 
    recruiting of nature, as may help forward God's service. More are hurt by <i>
    excess in lawful things</i>--than by meddling with <i>sinful </i>things. 
    More are killed by <i>wine</i>--than by <i>poison</i>. Many make their belly 
    their god, Philippians 3:19. And to this god, they pour their <i>drink 
    offerings!</i> And to 
    this god, they pour their <i>drink offerings</i>. Clemens Alexandrinus 
    writes of a fish whose heart is in his belly. This is an emblem of epicures, 
    whose heart is in their belly; they are devoted to their appetite! Excess in 
    food or drink clouds the mind, chokes holy affections, and provokes lust. 
    The <i>foulest weeds</i> grow out of the <i>fattest soil</i>. Intemperance 
    shortens life—as too much oil extinguishes the lamp. <i>Many dig their 
    graves, with their teeth! </i>Christ cautioned His Apostles, Luke 21:34, "Be 
    careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with <i>dissipation</i>." 
    Seneca could say he was born to higher things, than to be a <i>slave to his 
    body</i>. What a shame is it—that the soul, that <i>princely </i>part, which 
    sways the scepter of reason, and is akin to the angels, should be enslaved 
    to the <i>brutish </i>part! Deny the sinful cravings of the flesh. What has 
    God given conscience for, but to be a golden bridle to check the inordinacy 
    of the appetite!

<p align="justify">7. A Christian must deny his EASE.</p></b></font> Proverbs 
    1:32, "Ease slays the simple." The flesh is prone to sloth and softness. It 
    is loath to take pains for heaven. Proverbs 19:24, "A slothful man hides his 
    hand in his bosom." He is loath to pluck it out—though it is to lay hold on 
    a crown! Weeds and vermin grow in untilled ground, and all vices grow in an 
    idle, untilled heart. How can they expect to reap <i>a harvest of glory—</i>who 
    never sowed any seed? Is Satan so busy in his diocese, 1 Peter 5:8, and are 
    Christians idle? Are they like the lilies—which neither toil, nor spin? O 
    deny your ease! Seneca, a heather, devoted himself to labor and spent part 
    of the night in study. Hannibal forced his way over the Alps and craggy 
    rocks. We must force our way to paradise. Let us shake off sloth—as Paul did 
    the viper!
<p align="justify">Never think to be brought to heaven as the passengers in 
    a ship are brought to their ports—while <i>sleeping!</i> 1 Chronicles 22:16, "Arise 
    and be doing." God puts no difference between the <i>slothful</i> servant and the 
    <i>wicked</i> servant, "You <i>wicked</i> and <i>lazy</i> servant!" Matthew 25:26. Those slothful 
    people in Eturia, who like drones enter into the hive and consumed the 
    honey, were expelled from others and condemned to exile. Such as idle away 
    the day of grace and fold their hands to sleep when they should be working 
    out salvation, God will condemn to a perpetual exile in hell.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. A Christian must deny CARNAL POLICY.</p></b></font> This 
    is <i>the wisdom of the flesh</i>, 2 Corinthians 1:12. Carnal policy is 
    craft. The politician does not consult what is best for the country—but what 
    is the safest policy for himself. The politician is made of willow; he can 
    side with all parties; his religion is cut according to the fashion of the 
    times; he can bow either to the east or to the west. Zeal for <i>truth, </i>
    is blotted out of the politician's creed. Sir Thomas More said that he would 
    not follow truth too near the heels—lest it should dash out his brains. It 
    is judged by some a piece of wise policy, not to declare against error for 
    fear of losing a party.
<p align="justify">The <i>Politician </i>is a <i>latitudinarian</i>. He can 
    go all ways. The ostrich's wings help her to outrun other creatures. Sinful 
    policy makes men run further than they can, who are of purer consciences. In 
    short, the politician is like a chameleon, who can change into all 
    colors—and be of the same mind as his company is. He can be either <i>
    serious </i>or <i>feathery</i>. I grant that <i>Christian prudence </i>is 
    commendable—but <i>the serpent </i>(shrewdness) must not devour <i>the dove</i> 
    (inoffensiveness). That policy is unjustifiable, which teaches people to 
    avoid duty. Deny carnal policy; dare to be honest. The best policy is to 
    hold fast to honesty and integrity.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. A Christian must deny his inordinate ANGER.</p></b></font> 
    James 1:26, "If any man among you seems to be religious, and bridles not his 
    tongue, this man's religion is vain." Every member of the body is infected 
    with sin, as every branch of wormwood is bitter; but the tongue is <i>full
    </i>of deadly poison, James 3:8. Augustine compares the tongue to a furnace, 
    and too often sparks of anger fly out of it! The Holy Spirit once descended 
    in cloven tongues of fire, Acts 2:3. But the Apostle James speaks of a 
    tongue that is set on fire of hell, James 3:6. Some cannot rule their own 
    spirit—but are carried away with their passions as a chariot with wild 
    horses. "Many," said Jerome, "who will not be drunk with wine—will be drunk 
    with rash anger." Ecclesiastes 7:9, "Anger rests in the bosom of fools!" 
    Anger may <i>be </i>in a wise man—but it <i>rests </i>in a fool. There is, I 
    know, a holy anger against sin—but the <i>fury of anger </i>is the scum 
    which boils off from an unsavory heart! Anger disturbs reason, and makes a 
    person unfit for holy duties.
<p align="justify">O Christians, deny yourselves! Pray that God will set a 
    watch before your lips, Psalm 141:4. Labor to quench the fire of wrath—with 
    a flood of tears! It is recorded of Mr. John Bruen, in the county of 
    Chester, that though he was naturally of a hasty, angry spirit—yet at length 
    he got the victory over his passions, and grew so meek and calm that his 
    very nature seemed to be quite altered. Grace does to the passions what 
    Christ did to the sea when it was stormy. He said, "Peace, be still." And 
    there was a great calm. Grace turns the fierceness of the lion—into the 
    meekness of the dove!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">10. A Christian must deny SINFUL FASHIONS.</p></b></font> 
    Romans 12:2, "Be not conformed to this world." That is—do not be conformed 
    to the fashions and mode of it. If the old Christians were to rise out of 
    their graves—our new fashions might frighten them into their graves again! 
    Was there ever such excess in hair? 1 Corinthians 11:14, "Does not even 
    nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to 
    him." More money is sometimes laid out for a wig to cover one head—than 
    would clothe twenty poor people. One asked Pastor Dod why he did not preach 
    against <i>those ruffians who wore long hair. </i>He replied, "If grace 
    comes into their heart—it will make them cut off their hair."
<p align="justify">Nor can the female gender be excused for their excess in 
    apparel. "The Lord will strip away their artful beauty—their ornaments, 
    headbands, and crescent necklaces; their earrings, bracelets, and veils of 
    shimmering gauze. Gone will be their scarves, ankle chains, sashes, 
    perfumes, and charms; their rings, jewels, party clothes, gowns, capes, and 
    purses; their mirrors, linen garments, head ornaments, and shawls." Isaiah 
    3:18-23. Seneca complained of those in his time who hung two or three <i>
    houses </i>on their ears! Some wear half their <i>incomes </i>upon their 
    backs! Lysander would not allow his daughters to be too gorgeously attired, 
    saying "it would make them more <i>common</i>—than <i>lovely</i>." What 
    painted faces and bare shoulders appear in the congregations! That 
    professors should conform and comply with others in their antic dresses, is 
    a reproach of piety! A tear in the eye—would more adorn than a tower on the 
    head. O deny yourselves! Pull down these <i>flags of vanity</i>. Have not 
    God's judgments humbled you? 1 Timothy 2:9, "I want women to be modest in 
    their appearance. They should wear decent and appropriate clothing and not 
    draw attention to themselves by the way they fix their hair or by wearing 
    gold or pearls or expensive clothes." Let the hidden man of the heart, be 
    beautified and bespangled with grace. Psalm 45:13, "The king's daughter is 
    all glorious <i>within</i>."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">11. A Christian must deny his own AIMS. </p></b></font>He 
    must not look with one eye at piety—and aim at himself with the other eye. 
    He must not aim at self-enriching and self-applause.
<p align="justify">He must not aim at <b>self-enriching</b>. Some espouse 
    the gospel only for gain. They court this queen, not for her <i>beauty </i>
    but for her <i>jewels!</i> It is not the <i>fire </i>of the altar they 
    regard—but the <i>gold </i>of the altar! 1 Timothy 6:5, "They think that 
    godliness is a means to financial gain." Camero, a French divine of 
    Bordeaux, relates a story of one Santangel, a lawyer, who turned Protestant 
    only out of worldly respects—that he might grow rich. </p>
<p align="justify">Judas preached and wrought miracles—but his eye was 
    chiefly on the money bag. How do many ministers heap benefice upon benefice, 
    minding the <i>fleece </i>more than the <i>flock</i>! <i><b>Dumb dogs </b>
</i>(that is, those who are afraid to speak the truth for fear that it will 
    offend the rich) <i><b>are greedy dogs</b></i>. "For the leaders of my 
    people—the Lord's watchmen, his shepherds—are blind to every danger. They 
    are like <i>silent watchdogs </i>that give no warning when danger comes. 
    They love to lie around, sleeping and dreaming. And they are as greedy as 
    dogs, never satisfied. They are stupid shepherds, all following their own 
    path, all of them intent on personal gain." Isaiah 56:10-11. These make use 
    of the ministerial function, only as a net to catch filthy lucre. This is to 
    be profane in sacred things. It is sordid and unworthy of a Christian, to 
    make piety bow to secular interest.</p>
<p align="justify">A Christian must not aim at <b>self-applause</b>. "Be 
    careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen by 
    them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven." 
    Matthew 6:1. They prayed and gave alms—that they might be seen by men. The
    <i>oil of vain-glory </i>fed their lamp! Verse 5, "Truly they have their 
    reward." They might write "Received in full payment." It is a saying of 
    Spanhemius, that there is in every man by nature<i>—a measure of Pharisaism</i>—a 
    seeking after the glory and applause of the world. "Everything they do is 
    done for men to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on 
    their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most 
    important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted in the 
    marketplaces and to have men call them <i>Rabbi</i>." Matthew 23:5-7 </p>
<p align="justify">Luther confessed that, although he was never tempted with 
    covetousness—yet he was sometimes with vain-glory! The moth breeds in the 
    finest cloth; and self-seeking is apt to breed in the best duties. Sinister 
    aims corrupt piety. A good aim will not make a bad action good—but <i>a bad 
    aim </i>will make a good action bad.</p>
<p align="justify">To blame are they who, when they have done any glorious 
    service in the church, take the praise themselves, like those heathens who 
    sacrificed the <i>wax </i>to their gods, but kept the <i>honey </i>to 
    themselves. Matthew Paris speaks of one who, having in several lectures 
    proved strenuously that Christ was God, and being highly applauded for it, 
    cried out saying, "O Jesus, You are indebted to me for Your divinity this 
    day." Whereupon this doctor was stricken suddenly with a stupidness and 
    forgetfulness.</p>
<p align="justify">Let this cause trembling and humility in Christians. Some 
    ships which have escaped the <i>rocks, </i>have been wrecked upon the <i>
    sands</i>. Many who have escaped the <i>rocks of gross scandals </i>have 
    been wrecked upon the <i>sands of self-seeking</i>. Tacitus said he would 
    not have Erasmus's fame and applause, for all the world. No—but to have 
    esteem in God's church is a blessing. Hebrews 11:2 "By faith the elders 
    obtained a good report." Much of the honor of piety depends upon the credit 
    of those who profess it. But the sin is when self-applause is the only thing 
    hunted after. Popular applause is the golden arrow which glitters in the 
    eye—but wounds the heart. How many have been blown to hell with the breath 
    of popular applause.</p>
<p align="justify">O let us deny, yes, abhor this vain-glorious temper. We 
    have a holy example in John the Baptist, who sought to lift up Christ and 
    beat down himself. John 1:15, "Someone is coming who is far greater than I 
    am." It is as if he had said "I am but the herald, the voice of one crying. 
    Christ, who comes after me, is the Prince. I am but the morning star; He is 
    the sun. I baptize only with water, He with the Holy Spirit." Thus he sets 
    the crown of honor upon Christ's head. </p>
<p align="justify">When Joab had taken Rabbah, he did not usurp the praise 
    to himself—but sent for King David that he might carry away the glory of the 
    victory, 2 Samuel 12:27. So, when any eminent service in church has been 
    done—the glory of all should be given to Christ and free grace! It is better 
    that God should approve—than that the world should applaud! If we are 
    faithful, we shall have honor enough in heaven. </p>
<p align="justify">Let this be our chief aim in duty that we may grow more 
    in love with God and be made more like Him, have more communion with Him, 
    and bring more revenues of honor to Him. 1 Peter 4:11, "That in all things, 
    God may be glorified." We should not only <i>advance</i> God's glory, but <i>
    design </i>God's glory. It was a worthy speech of Philip de Mornay upon his 
    deathbed, that he had, through the course of his life, made God's glory his 
    end and aim. <i>As all the rivers run into the sea, so all our actions must 
    run into God, the infinite Ocean!</i></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">12. A Christian must deny all UNGODLINESS. </p></b></font>
    Titus 2:11-12, "The grace of God has appeared to all men, teaching us that
    <i>denying ungodliness </i>and worldly lusts, we should live soberly." The 
    Turks say in their Koran—that God did not give men lustful desires to be 
    frustrated. The scripture gives no license for sin. It bids us to <i>deny 
    ungodly lusts</i>. It is not likely he will sacrifice his <i>Isaac</i>—his 
    worldly profits—who will not sacrifice the <i>ram</i>—his vile lusts! A 
    Christian must deny his malice, revenge, covetousness, uncleanness, 
    superstition, and heterodoxy. A man may as well go to hell for a drunken 
    opinion—as a drunken life. And let me especially instance two sins a 
    Christian must deny:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">A Christian must deny the sin of rash censuring.</p></b>
</font>James 4:11, "Don't speak evil against each other." Some make it a 
    part of their religion—to criticize others, and clip their credit to make it 
    weigh lighter. You shall hear them say, "Such a one is proud, factious, and 
    hypocritical." James 4:12, "Who are you to judge another?" Augustine could 
    not endure that any should detract from the good name of others.
<p align="justify">The <i>root </i>of censoriousness is <i>pride</i>. A 
    person thinks that by taking away from another's reputation—he shall add 
    something to his own. But let him who shall raise himself upon the ruin of 
    another's fame, be warned. Do you think it is no sin to murder a man in his 
    name? You who are such a critic, it is to be feared you can spy all faults 
    but your own! O Christian, look inward. If you viewed your own spots more in 
    the looking-glass of the Word, you would not be as ready to throw the <i>
    stone of censure </i>at others. Deny this sin of <i>rash censuring </i>and<i> 
    smiting with the tongue</i>, Jeremiah 18:18. You who speak reproachfully of 
    your brother without a cause, the time may come that he may be accepted—and 
    you rejected! He may be found gold—and you reprobate silver!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">A Christian must deny his besetting complexion sin. </p></b>
</font>Psalm 12:23, "I have kept myself from <i>my </i>iniquity." As there 
    is one master bee in the hive, so there is naturally one master sin in the 
    heart. This must be denied. The devil can hold a man fast by one sin. A 
    jailer can hold the prisoner fast by one fetter. One sin is enough to stop 
    the current of mercy. One sin may damn as well as more, just as one 
    millstone is enough to sink a man into the sea. If there is any lust which 
    we cannot deny, it will be a bitter root either of scandal or apostasy.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">13. A Christian must deny his RELATIONS.</p></b></font> Luke 
    14:26, "If any man comes to me and hates not father and mother and wife and 
    children, he cannot be My disciple." The meaning is, when carnal relations 
    come in <i>competition </i>with Christ, or stand in <i>opposition </i>to 
    Christ—we must hate them. <i>When our friends would prove snares, and hinder 
    us from our duty, we must either leap over them or tread upon them! </i>Here 
    is faith in God. "If my wife," said Jerome, "should hang about my neck, and 
    persuade me to deny Christ, I would break from her and fly to the cross!" 
    When <i>Peter </i>would be a tempter, Christ said, "Get behind Me, <i>Satan</i>."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">14. A Christian must deny his ESTATE for Christ.</p></b></font> 
    A carnal heart will commend and profess Christ—but will part with nothing for 
    Him. The young man in the gospel was Christ's <i>hearer</i>—but not His <i>
    follower</i>. "He had heavenly desires—but an earthly appetite," as one has 
    said. When Christ said to him, "Sell all and give to the poor," he went away 
    sorrowful, Matthew 19:22. When riches are joined with a bad heart, they do 
    much hurt. The world lay nearer the young man's heart than Christ. 
<p align="justify">Have some of the heathens denied the world? Epaminondes, 
    a Grecian captain who obtained many glorious victories, was a great despiser 
    of the world. He refused vast sums of money sent him from the King of 
    Persia, so that when he died he left scarcely enough to defray the charges 
    of his funeral. Did a heathen go thus far in denying the world, and shall 
    not Christians do much more? Let the<i> wedge of gold </i>be denied for the
    <i>pearl of great price</i>. Matthew 19:27, "We have forsaken all and 
    followed You." A true saint esteems the <i>gleanings of Christ </i>better 
    than the <i>world's vintage</i>. Philippians 3:8, "For whom I have suffered 
    the loss of all things."</p>
<p align="justify">Galeacius, marquess of Vico, parted with a fair estate to 
    enjoy the pure ordinances of Christ at Geneva. When a Jesuit persuaded him 
    to return to his popish religion in Italy, promising him a huge sum of 
    money, he said, "Let their money perish with them, who esteem all the gold 
    in the world worth one hour's communion with Jesus Christ and His Holy 
    Spirit."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">15. A Christian must deny his LIFE for Christ. </p></b>
</font>This is in the text, "Let him take up his <b>cross</b>." Suffering 
    for Christ must be voluntary and spontaneous. He who suffers against his 
    will—<i>bears </i>the cross; he who suffers willingly—<i>takes up </i>the 
    cross. A fair virgin fell in love with Crates for his learning. He showed 
    her his staff and his scrip. "This," he said, "is your i." Christ shows 
    us His <i>cross</i>. If we will not have Him upon these terms, the match is 
    not likely to go on. Sufferings are waiting for us, Acts 20:23. "Everyone 
    who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution." 2 
    Timothy 3:12. <b>The devil has not grown kinder. </b>"Your enemy the devil 
    prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour!" 1 Peter 
    5:8.
<p align="justify">Some think of <i>reigning </i>with Christ—but not of <i>
    suffering </i>with Christ. Joseph dreamed of his <i>advancement, </i>but not 
    of his <i>imprisonment</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The flesh cries out, That <i>cross</i> is painful! There are
    <i>nails</i> in that cross which tear me!"</p>
<p align="justify">But life must be <i>denied</i>, yes, <i>hated </i>for 
    Christ. Luke 14:26, "If any man comes to Me and hates not father and mother 
    and his own life, he cannot be My disciple." Love for Christ must outweigh 
    life. Revelation 12:11, "They loved not their lives to the death." Paul 
    carried the image of Christ in his heart as a saint, and the message of 
    Christ in his body as a martyr, Galatians 6:17. The primitive worthies 
    snatched up torments as so many crowns, and were content to shed their blood 
    for Christ, knowing they would exchange their bloody robes-for white ones. 
    The prophet Isaiah was sawn in half. Jeremiah was killed by stoning. Amos was 
    killed with an iron bar. Luke was hanged on an olive tree.</p>
<p align="justify">I read that Irenaeus was carried to a place where a cross 
    was set on one side and an idol on the other. He was given a choice either 
    to bow to the idol—or suffer on the cross. He chose the latter.</p>
<p align="justify">Basil speaks of a virgin condemned to the fire. She was 
    offered her life and estate if she would bow down to an image. She answered, 
    "Let life and money go; welcome Christ!"</p>
<p align="justify">Though every Christian is not actually a martyr—yet he 
    has a preparation of mind, and is ready to suffer—if God calls. Luther said 
    he would rather be a <i>martyr </i>than a <i>monarch</i>. Let us then, take 
    up the cross.</p>
<p align="justify">Can wicked men be content to suffer for their lusts, and 
    shall we not suffer for Christ? We are to look upon our sufferings as a 
    badge of honor. If we receive honor when we are <i>reproached </i>for 
    Christ, much more shall we receive it when we <i>die </i>for Him. 1 Peter 
    4:14, "If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, 
    for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you." Our sufferings for Christ 
    propagate piety. Paul's being imprisoned made the gospel to be more 
    enlarged, Philippians 1:12. Justin Martyr was converted to the faith by 
    beholding the heroic patience and courage of the Christians in their 
    sufferings.</p>
<p align="justify">The <b>cross</b> leads to the <b>crown</b>. 2 Timothy 2:12, "If we 
    suffer, we shall also reign with Him." Who would not be willing to venture 
    on the seas, though rough and tempestuous, if he were sure to be crowned as 
    soon as he came ashore? Persecutors may take away from us our <i>goods</i>—but 
    not our <i>God</i>. They may take away our <i>liberty—</i>but not our 
    freedom of conscience. They may take off our <i>head</i>—but not our crown! 
    Revelation 2:10.</p>
<p align="justify">He who cannot deny his life for Christ, will deny Christ. 
    And he who is ashamed of Christ, Christ will be ashamed of him. Mark 8:38, 
    "Whoever shall be ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful 
    generation, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in the 
    glory of His Father with His holy angels."</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center"><br/>
    3. The GROUND of the Proposition</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The grand reason why we must deny ourselves, is because 
    we can be saved no other way. A town or castle may have several ways leading 
    to it. But there is only one way leading to the celestial paradise, and that 
    is self-denial. Without self-denial, we can never come up to Christ's terms. 
    If the world cannot be denied—Christ cannot be trusted. If the will is not 
    denied—Christ cannot be obeyed. Therefore, self-denial is absolute 
    necessity to enter heaven.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">4. An INFERENCE Drawn from the Proposition</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">From all that has been said, see how <b>hard</b> a thing it is 
    to be a Christian. Were it only to put on the <i>mantle of profession</i>, 
    it would be easy. Even Satan can transform himself into an angel of light, 2 
    Corinthians 11:14. But a man <i>must </i>deny himself. This self-emptying or 
    self-annihilation is the strait gate through which a Christian must enter 
    into the kingdom of God. He is not to deny only those things which are <i>
    outside </i>of him—his worldly profits; but those which are <i>within </i>
    him—his sins, nay, his righteousness. <b>Self is an idol, and it is hard to 
    sacrifice this idol</b>; but this must be done. Either carnal self must be 
    denied, or we cannot truly follow Christ.<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">5. A Check to Epicures and Sensualists</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">This justly indicts those who live in a contradiction to 
    the text, who instead of denying themselves—they let loose the reins and 
    give themselves up to all manner of pleasure and licentiousness. 
    Ecclesiastes 7:4, "The heart of fools is in the house of mirth." The prophet 
    calls them fools—who do not <i>mortify</i> the flesh—but <i>gratify </i>the 
    flesh. "You push away every thought of coming disaster, but your actions 
    only bring the day of judgment closer. How terrible it will be for you who 
    sprawl on ivory beds surrounded with luxury, eating the meat of tender lambs 
    and choice calves. You sing idle songs to the sound of the harp." Amos 
    6:3-5. <b>Pleasure enchants men's minds, and transforms them into beasts!</b></p>

<p align="justify">There is a place in Africa called Tombutium where the 
    inhabitants spend all their time in singing and dancing. And have we not 
    many who consume their hours in plays and brothels? As if God has made them 
    like the leviathan—to play in the sea (Psalm 104:26). How will their 
    countenances be changed when God shall say, "Give an account of your 
    stewardship!" These frolicking sensualists live as if there were no world to 
    come. <i>They pamper their bodies—but starve their souls! </i>As if one 
    should feed his <i>dog</i>—but starve his <i>wife!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Do epicures deny themselves? Indeed, in one sense they 
    do. Enjoying their lusts—<i>they deny themselves a part in heaven! </i>In 
    the country of Sardinia there is an herb-like balm, that if a man eats of 
    it, he shall die laughing. Such an herb is 'pleasure'. If one feeds 
    immoderately on it, he will go laughing to hell.</p>
<p align="justify">Esau lost the blessing while he was hunting. O! How many, 
    while they are hunting after worldly pleasures, lose eternal blessedness? 
    There is a <i>'sin cup' </i>brewing which will spoil the sinner's mirth. 
    Psalm 75:8, "For the Lord holds a cup in his hand; it is full of foaming 
    wine mixed with spices. He pours the wine out in judgment, and all the 
    wicked must drink it, draining it to the dregs." This wine is the wrath of 
    God, and it is mixed; the <i>never-dying worm </i>and the <i>eternal fire</i> 
    are mixed the cup! The Lord will proportion a sinner's torment to his 
    pleasure. Revelation 18:7, "She has lived in luxury and pleasure, so match 
    it now with torments and sorrows!"<br/>

<p align="center">6. The Lack of Self-Denial Lamented</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">In the next place, we may sadly lay to heart the lack of 
    self-denial. O self-denial, where have you gone? We live in a knowing 
    age—yet few know how to deny themselves! <b>Selfishness is the reigning sin 
    of the world. </b>This makes the times have a bad aspect. 2 Timothy 3:1-2, 
    "Perilous times shall come—for men shall be lovers of themselves."</p>
<p align="justify">SELF may have divers actions brought against it. It is an 
    enemy to the public. James 4:1, "Whence come wars?" Whence is robbery and 
    bribery? Whence is oppression and drunkenness, but from those selfish lusts 
    which men cannot conquer? When Lentulus had declared Tiberius Caesar to be 
    his heir in his will, so brutally selfish was Caesar, that he sent and 
    killed Lentulus that he might have immediate possession of his goods.</p>
<p align="justify">Self-denial lodges but in a few hearts. It is a sacred, 
    exotic herb which has grown very scarce. Luke 18:8, "When the Son of Man 
    comes, shall He find faith on the earth?" May it not be said, "Shall He find 
    self-denial on the earth?" Self-denial has gone on a long pilgrimage, and 
    who can tell when it will return?<br/>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">7. PERSUASIVES to Self-Denial</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">My next work is to persuade Christians to the practice of 
    this momentous duty of self-denial. Man <i>lost </i>himself at first by 
    self-exaltation, and he must <i>recover </i>himself by self-denial.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Self-denial is just and equal.</p></b></font> How much has 
    Christ denied Himself for us? He eclipsed His glory, Philippians 2:7, "He 
    denied Himself." What a wonderful self-denial was it for Christ to leave His 
    Father's bosom and be <i>incarnate!</i> <b>For Christ to be made flesh, was 
    more than for all the angels to be made worms! </b>Christ denied His <i>name
    </i>and <i>reputation</i>, Hebrews 12:2, "He endured the shame." He denied
    <i>worldly grandeurs </i>and <i>riches</i>. 1 Corinthians 8:9, "For our 
    sakes He became poor." A feeding trough was His cradle, the cobwebs His 
    curtains. He denied His <i>life</i>, Philippians 2:8, "He became obedient to 
    death." It is but equity—that we should deny ourselves for Christ.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Self-denial is the sign of a sincere Christian.</p></b></font> 
    Hypocrites may have great knowledge and make fair pretenses—but it is only 
    the sincere saint who can deny himself and lay his life at Christ's feet. 
    This was a touchstone of Moses' sincerity. He denied the pleasures of the 
    court—and chose affliction rather than iniquity, Hebrews 11:25.
<p align="justify">I have read of a holy man who was once tempted by Satan. 
    Satan said to him, "Why do you take all these pains? What do you do, more 
    than I? Are you no drunkard, no adulterer? Neither am I. Do you watch? I 
    never sleep. Do you fast? I never eat. What do you do, more than I?"</p>
<p align="justify">"Why," said the good man, "I tell you, Satan, I give 
    myself to prayer, nay, more, I <i>deny </i>myself."</p>
<p align="justify">"Nay," said the devil, "you go beyond me, for I <i>exalt
    </i>myself." And so he vanished.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Self-denial is a rational thing.</p></b></font> For if <i>
    self </i>is an enemy—then it is wisdom to discard it. There is a rationality 
    in all God's commands. Why would He have us deny fleshly lusts—but because 
    they wage war against our souls! 1 Peter 2:11. Why would He have us deny 
    pride—but because of its harmful quality! Proverbs 16:18 "Pride goes before 
    destruction." Where pride leads the van, destruction brings up the rear! <b>
    God would have us deny nothing for him—but that which will damn us if we 
    keep it!
<font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">4. There is nothing lost by self-denial. </p></font></b>We 
    shall be abundantly compensated. Matthew 19:29, "Everyone who has given up 
    houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property, 
    for my sake, will receive a hundred times as much in return and will have 
    eternal life." If we deny our name and reputation for Christ, God will give 
    us inward peace. There is "a hundredfold" in this life, and He will honor us 
    before the angels. How many hundredfolds that amounts to, I am not able to 
    tell. If we deny our estate to keep our conscience, God will give us a 
    kingdom, Luke 12:32. What does he lose, who parts with a <i>flower</i>—and 
    gets a<i> precious jewel! </i>We may lose all we have for Christ—yet lose 
    nothing by Him.<br/>
 
<p align="justify"></p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">8. HELPS to Self-Denial</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">For the attaining of self-denial, let these rules be 
    observed:</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Be convinced of the incomparable excellency of Christ.</p></b></font> 
    He is the quintessence of goodness. He is compared to a <i>head of gold—</i>for 
    riches, Song of Solomon 5:10; to the <i>Rose of Sharon</i>—for perfume, Song 
    of Solomon 2:1; to a <i>bright morning star</i>—for beauty, Revelation 
    22:16. Jesus Christ is all that is good and lovely. He is all we can require 
    for satisfaction, or that we can desire for salvation. He is fully 
    commensurate to our needs. He has <i>eye salve </i>to anoint us, <i>white 
    raiment </i>to cover us, and His <i>blood </i>to heal us. We shall never 
    deny ourselves for Christ—until we see glory and a beauty in Him. Christ is 
    all marrow and sweetness. He is better than life, estate, or heaven!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Endeavor after a vital principle of grace.</p></b></font> 
    Grace will do that which flesh and blood cannot do. A man may do that by <i>
    skill</i>—which he cannot do by <i>strength</i>. A burden of great weight 
    may be lifted up by pulleys, which cannot be lifted up by strength of arm. 
    Grace will teach one the art of self-denial, which cannot be done by 
    strength of nature. In particular, labor for three graces.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Humility.</p></b></font> A proud man <i>admires </i>himself; 
    therefore he cannot <i>deny </i>himself. A humble man lays his mouth in the 
    dust. He has lower thoughts of himself, than others can have of him. He 
    renounces himself. He opens to God as the flower opens to the sun. He will
    <i>have</i>—what God will have for him. He will <i>be</i>—what God will have 
    him be. He is like melting wax. God may set whatever stamp and impression He 
    will, upon him. The humble man is the self-denier.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Love. </p></b></font>Who will not deny himself for a friend 
    whom he loves? He will part with anything he has. He will gratify him who he 
    loves, though it is to his own loss. He whose heart is fired with love for 
    Christ—will stop at nothing for His sake. Gregory Nazianzen said of his 
    Athenian learning, that he was glad he had anything of worth, to esteem as 
    nothing, for Christ. <b>Love for God will devour self-love.
<font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">Faith.</p></font></b> Abraham was a great self-denier. He 
    left his kindred and country and was willing to travel to any place where 
    God would have him. Whence was this? It was from his faith. Hebrews 11:8, 
    "By faith Abraham obeyed and went out, not knowing where he went." He who 
    believes that Christ and heaven are his—what will he not relinquish for 
    Christ's sake? The stronger a Christian's faith is, the more eminent will 
    his self-denial be.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Pray much for self-denial.</p></b></font> Prayer sets God 
    to work, Psalm 10:17. Let this be your grand request—a self-denying frame of 
    heart. Self-denial does not grow in nature's soil. It is a fruit of the 
    Spirit. Beg God that He will plant this heavenly flower in your soul. Say, 
    "Lord, whatever You deny me, do not deny me <i>self-denial. </i>Let me 
    rather lack great abilities, nay, let me lack the comforts of the 
    Spirit—rather than self-denial."
<b>
<p align="justify">There may be going to heaven without comfort—but there is 
    no going there without self-denial.</p>
