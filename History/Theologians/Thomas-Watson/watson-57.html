<p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>How to read Scripture with most spiritual 
  profit</b></font></p>
<p>by Thomas Watson<font color="#ff0000"><b> </b></font></p>
<p><br/>
<font color="#008000"><b>1. Remove those things that will PREVENT you 
  profiting: </b></font></p>

<p>(1) remove the love of every sin; </p>
<p>(2) take heed of the <i>thorns </i>which will choke the Word. These 
  ‘thorns’ are those covetous cares that keep our minds on material matters when 
  they should be concentrating on spiritual things; </p>
<p>(3) take heed of joking with, or making light of Scripture.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>2. Prepare your HEARTS before the reading of the Word </p></b></font>(1 Sam 
  7.3). 
<p>(1) Summon your thoughts to attend to this serious work; </p>
<p>(2) cleanse yourself of the unclean affections which take away the desire 
  to read.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>3. Read the Scriptures with REVERENCE</p></b></font>. Think about every line 
  you read. Realize that <i>God is speaking to you!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p>4. Read the Bible with a METHOD, perhaps in order.</p></b></font> Order and 
  method are a help to memory.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>5. Get a right UNDERSTANDING of Scripture </p></b></font>(Ps 119.73). Compare 
  texts with each other, talk to others, use other books and helps.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>6. Read the Word with SERIOUSNESS.</p></b></font> It is the savor of life to 
  those who read it with seriousness, for it deals with everything that is most 
  dear to us. Consider its subject matter--eternal life and death, heaven and 
  hell, the labor of faith. Who can read these things and not be serious? Read, 
  therefore, with a solemn and composed spirit.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>7. Labor to REMEMBER what you read.</p></b></font> Satan will try to steal the 
  Word from our minds; we should guard it jealously. If we cannot remember what 
  we read--our reading will be of no use to us.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>8. MEDITATE upon what you read</p></b></font> (Ps 119.15). This means to fix 
  your thoughts upon what you are reading. Meditation without reading is 
  foolish; reading without meditation is empty.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>9. Come to read with HUMBLE hearts</p></b></font>, acknowledging your 
  unworthiness to have God reveal Himself to you in His Word. An arrogant man 
  who feels he has nothing to learn, is unlikely to gain any profit.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>10. BELIEVE that what you read is the very Word of God</p></b></font>, that it 
  is all divinely inspired (2 Tim 3.16). All the countless excellencies of 
  Scripture testify that it is of God. Note the effect that the Bible has upon 
  the hearts of men, now and throughout history. You will not obey something 
  that you do not believe.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>11. Highly PRIZE the Scriptures </p></b></font>(Ps 119.72). Treasure it above 
  all other books. It contains the things we must believe and do. It is the 
  breeder and feeder of grace. A believer is born and fed by the Word of truth.
  
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>12. Get a fervent LOVE for the Word.</p></b></font> <i>Prizing </i>refers to 
  the judgment of a man, but <i>love </i>means also the affections. We should 
  delight to be in the pages of God’s Word; we must learn to delight in its 
  comforts and in its reproofs and corrections.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>13. Come to read the Word with HONEST hearts: </p>
</b></font>
<p>(1) read with hearts willing to know the whole counsel of God, and not 
  willing to have any truth concealed. You cannot pick and choose Scriptures;
  </p>
<p>(2) read in order that you might be made better. The Word is the means of 
  our sanctification. Go to God’s Word to find the truths that will make you 
  more like Christ.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>14. Learn to APPLY Scripture</p></b></font>; take every word as if it were 
  spoken personally to yourselves. When the Word talks of the punishment of sin, 
  it means my sin; when it tells me of duty, it means my duty.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>15. Observe the COMMANDS of the Word</p></b></font>, as well as its promises. 
  Use the commands to direct you, and the promises to comfort you. Do not look 
  more to comfort than to duty, or you might find your comforts false.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>16. Let your thoughts dwell most upon the most USEFUL parts of Scripture.</p></b></font> 
  Although all parts are excellent, some are more emphatic or vital than others. 
  Spend more time reading of faith and the new man in Christ--than in the 
  genealogies of dead kings!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>17. COMPARE yourselves with the Word; see how Scripture and your hearts 
  agree.</p></b></font> Is your heart a mirror of the Word? Is the Word written upon 
  your heart? By comparing ourselves with the Word, we get to know the true 
  state of our souls, and see what evidences we have for heaven.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>18. Take special notice of those Scriptures that speak to your particular 
  CASE.</p></b></font> Pay careful attention to those paragraphs of Scripture that 
  are most appropriate to your particular situation, such as affliction, 
  desertion, and sin. In reading, read all the Bible, but mark those verses 
  which apply most to your own self.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>19. Take special notice of the EXAMPLES in Scripture</p></b></font>, and make 
  the examples living sermons to yourself. 
<p>(1) Observe the examples of God’s <i>judgment </i>upon sinners: they are 
  warnings, lamps to keep us from the rocks; </p>
<p>(2) observe the examples of God’s <i>mercy </i>to saints: they are props to 
  our faith and spurs to holiness.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>20. Do not stop reading the Bible until you find your heart WARMED.</p></b></font> 
  Read the Word not only as a history, but strive to be heartily affected by it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>21. Determine to PRACTICE whatever you read. </p></b></font>"Give me 
  understanding, and I will keep your law and obey it with all my heart." Psalms 
  119:34. Christians should be walking Bibles, living the truths written. The 
  Word is not only a guide to knowledge, but a guide to obedience. A holy 
  reading of God’s Word results in our fleeing from sins and practicing the 
  duties commanded.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>22. Make right use of CHRIST in His prophetic office. </p></b></font>It is one 
  thing to read a promise, another really to know it to be true. If we would 
  read with profit, we must have Christ as our teacher: when Christ taught, He 
  opened not only men’s eyes, but their understandings (Lk 24.45).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>23. Be at all the appointed SERVICES of the church, and spend much time in 
  hearing the Word preached.</p></b></font> Be diligent in attending upon a 
  Biblical, faithful ministry. Ministers are God’s interpreters; it is their 
  work to open up and expound dark places of Scripture.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>24. PRAY that God would make you profit </p></b></font>(Is 48.17). It is when 
  God’s Spirit joins Himself to the Word that it takes effect in our hearts and 
  minds.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>In CONCLUSION:</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>(1) Do not be content with simply reading the Scriptures, but labor to find 
  some spiritual benefit and profit. </p></b></font>Get the Word inscribed upon your 
  heart.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>(2) If you do profit from your reading, be sure to adore the grace of God.</p></b></font> 
  Bless God that He has not only given you His Word, but some ability to 
  understand it.
<p>If you struggle to profit from your reading, then take note of the 
  following encouragements:</p>
<p>(1) You can profit from reading the Scriptures even if you do not attain to 
  the level of others. Do not judge yourself according to the standard of 
  others. The Lord called it all good ground--whether it brought forth thirty, 
  sixty or a hundred-fold (Mt 13.8); so you may not get as much profit as 
  others, but the profit you do get is still most worthwhile.</p>
<p>(2) You can still profit from reading the Word, even if you are slow to 
  understand. You may even have a weak mind--but strong affections. A weak 
  understanding can keep you from sin, as weak sight can keep a man from falling 
  into deep water. If you have some vision, you cannot be all blind.</p>
<p>(3) You can profit from reading the Scriptures although you may not have an 
  excellent memory. You can have a good heart, without having a good memory. 
  Also, even if you don’t remember all that you read, you can remember the most 
  important part. The lamp burns even when it is not full of oil; our hearts can 
  burn with love when our memories are not full of Scripture.</p>
