<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">His Heart Is Fixed</font></b></p>
<p align="center">By Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">"He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; <b>his heart is 
    fixed</b>, trusting in the Lord." Psalm 112:7</p>
<p align="justify">"A word fitly spoken," said Solomon, "is like apples of 
    gold in pictures of silver." In this respect I have chosen this Scripture to 
    treat at this time. When the winds begin to rise, and a storm threatens—it 
    is time to get our spiritual tackling ready and to cast anchor. The mariner 
    casts his anchor downward; the Christian casts his anchor upward within the 
    veil. In the deepest danger, he casts out the sweet anchor of faith and is 
    not afraid. So says the text, "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his 
    heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">In this Psalm you have described the character of a 
    righteous man, verse 1, "he delights greatly in God's commands." He not only 
    keeps God's commands—but he loves them. They are the joy of his heart. He 
    delights greatly in God's commands.</p>
<p align="justify">In this Psalm is set down the righteous man's happiness 
    several ways:</p>
<p align="justify">First, his <b>children </b>shall be blessed. Verse 2, 
    "His seed shall be mighty upon earth." Righteousness entails mercy upon 
    posterity.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, his <b>estate </b>shall be blessed. Verse 3, 
    "Wealth and riches shall be in his house." A man is no loser by being 
    righteous; it makes his estate flourish.</p>
<p align="justify">Third, his <b>soul </b>shall be blessed, verse 3. It is 
    righteousness that shall endure forever; that is, the joy and comfort of it 
    endures forever. His <i>grace </i>shall be crowned with <i>glory</i>. This 
    flower of paradise does not wither.</p>
<p align="justify">Fourth, the righteous man's <b>name </b>shall be blessed. 
    Verse 6, "The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance." That is, 
    his name shall be honored; it shall live when he is dead. The righteous man 
    carries a good conscience with him when he dies and leaves a good name 
    behind him. He shall be in everlasting remembrance. And so I come to the 
    text. This righteous man shall not be afraid of evil tidings, for "his heart 
    is fixed, trusting in the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">The text consists of these two general parts:</p>
<p align="justify">First, the righteous man's privilege, "He shall not be 
    afraid of evil tidings."</p>
<p align="justify">Second, the ground or reason for it, "His heart is fixed, 
    trusting in the Lord."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. </p></b></font>I begin with the first of these briefly<font color="#0000ff">,<b> 
    the righteous man's privilege.</b> </font>"He shall not be afraid of evil 
    tidings." When there are rumors of evil approaching, the godly man shall not 
    be discomposed in his mind. He shall not be in a panic or fear. Yet let me 
    insert this for the right understanding of it.
<p align="justify">First, not that the righteous man is insensible of 
    danger, or how else could he humble himself under God's mighty hand?</p>
<p align="justify">Second, not but that some clouds of fear may arise in his 
    mind. Though grace <i>subdues </i>nature, it does not <i>expel </i>nature. 
    But the meaning of the text is this, "He shall not be afraid of evil 
    tidings." That is, a righteous man shall not be afraid with a <b>distracting
    </b>fear. Such a fear takes him off from duty and quite untunes him for 
    God's service.</p>
<p align="justify">"He shall not be afraid of evil tidings" with a fainting 
    fear so as to have his heart die within him. Thus it was with Saul, 1 Samuel 
    28:20. "Saul fell full length on the ground, paralyzed with fright." He 
    fainted away in his fear.</p>
<p align="justify">A righteous man shall not be afraid of evil tidings with 
    a <b>despairing </b>fear. He shall not so fear but that the heart still 
    sweetly rests upon God's promises. It is with a godly man in time of danger 
    as it is with a ship that lies at anchor. A ship at anchor shakes a little 
    on the water—but it is fixed, being at anchor. So, though there may be some 
    shakings and tremblings in the flesh—yet a Christian is not so tossed with 
    fear—but he is like a ship at anchor. "His heart is fixed, trusting in the 
    Lord."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE. </p></b></font>See the difference between the godly and 
    the wicked. The godly man is not afraid of evil rumors. He does not fear 
    with a distracting or desponding fear; hope is still preserved and kept 
    alive in the soul. But when the wicked see danger approaching, they are 
    surprised with heart-killing fears. Isaiah 33:14, "The sinners in Zion are 
    afraid, fearfulness has surprised hypocrites." Guilt is the basis of fear. 
    When Adam had stolen the fruit, then he began to tremble. "I was afraid," he 
    said to God, "and hid myself." Sinners fall into convulsions of conscience. 
    Cain's mark was a shaking in the flesh. And a wicked man has a trembling in 
    his heart. Isaiah 13:8, "They shall be afraid." The Hebrew word for <i>fear
    </i>signifies such a fright as casts women into travail and makes them 
    miscarry. So sinners shall be cast, as it were, into such a fright as their 
    faces shall be ashamed. That is, when troubles arise their faces wax pale. 
    So much for the first thing in the text, the righteous man's privilege, "He 
    shall not be afraid of evil tidings" with a distracting or desponding fear.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Second, here in these words is the ground or reason 
    why a godly person shall not be afraid or amazed at evil tidings.</p></b></font> 
    "His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." There is the ground. This makes 
    him as the leviathan, without fear, "His heart is fixed, trusting in the 
    Lord."
<p align="justify">So the observation is this:</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. It is the genius and temperament of a true 
    saint, in times of imminent danger, to have his heart fixed by trusting in 
    the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p align="justify">His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. For the 
    illustration of this proposition I shall answer these three Questions:</p>
<p align="justify">1. <b>What </b>is it to trust in God in times of danger?</p>
<p align="justify">2. <b>Why </b>ought we to trust in God?</p>
<p align="justify">3. <b>How </b>does trusting in God fix the heart?</p>
<p align="justify">I begin with the first of these.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 1. WHAT is it to trust in God in times of 
    danger?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Answer. It is called in Scripture a <i>"casting our 
    burden upon God," </i>the burden of our <i>care</i>, the burden of our <i>
    fear</i>, the burden of our <i>needs</i>, the burden of our <i>sins</i>. 
    Psalm 55:22, "Cast your burden upon the Lord, and He shall sustain you."</p>
<p align="justify">Trusting in God in Scripture is called a <i>"staying 
    ourselves upon God," </i>as a man who is ready to fall stays himself upon 
    some prop or pillow. Thus a Christian stays himself upon God, Isaiah 5:10. I 
    shall describe trusting in God thus—<i>It is a heroic act of faith whereby 
    we roll all our care and lay the stress of our salvation only upon God.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Now there is required in this trusting in God an 
    absolutely necessary <i>knowledge</i>, and an absolutely necessary 
    acquaintance with Him.</p>
<p align="justify">First, <b>knowledge </b>of God. Psalm 9:10, "Those who 
    know Your name will put their trust in You."</p>
<p align="justify">Second, in this trusting in God is required <b>
    acquaintance </b>with Him through Christ. Without acquaintance there can be 
    no trust; one cannot well trust a stranger. There must be some acquaintance 
    with God. Job 22:21, "Acquaint yourself now with Him and be at peace." 
    That's the first point, what this trusting in God is.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 2. WHY ought we to trust in God?</p></b></font> I 
    will give you but these two reasons.
<p align="justify">Answer 1. Because God calls for this trust. Isaiah 26:4, 
    "Trust in the Lord forever." Psalm 62:8, "Trust in Him at all times." Though 
    you are in ever such straits and fears—yet remember to cast anchor upwards. 
    Trust in God at all times. The Lord would take off our confidence and 
    trusting in other things besides Him. Jeremiah 17:5, "Cursed is the one who 
    trusts in man, who depends on flesh for his strength and whose heart turns 
    away from the Lord." We break our <i>crutches </i>because we lean too hard 
    on them. God would have us make Him our trust. And the truth is, trust and 
    reliance is the chief part of the worship we ascribe to God.</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 2. We must trust in God in all our straits and 
    dangers. He is the proper object of our trust. My brethren, the <i>creature
    </i>is not a fit object of our trust as appears thus—it has two ill 
    qualities that we cannot repose our trust in—the creature <i>deceives </i>
    and it <i>fails</i>. I shall deal only with the first.</p>
<p align="justify">The creature <b>deceives</b>. It is but a sugared lie. 
    Where we think to suck honey, we taste only wormwood. And as it deceives, so 
    it fades and withers. Like a rose, the fuller it is blown the sooner it 
    sheds. So we cannot make the creature the object of our trust—but God 
    deserves our trust. He is called in Scripture a <i>strong tower </i>where 
    you may have safety. Proverbs 18:10, "The name of the Lord is a strong 
    tower." He is <i>El-Shaddai</i>, God Almighty, Genesis 17:1. There is no 
    condition we can be in, no exigency—but He can relieve. He is God Almighty.</p>
<p align="justify">In particular, there are two glorious attributes in God 
    in which we may safely repose our trust. The one is His <i>mercy</i>, the 
    other is His <i>truth</i>. They are both joined in one verse, "You will 
    perform Your <i>truth </i>to Jacob and Your <i>mercy </i>to Abraham," Micah 
    7:20.</p>
<p align="justify">First, we may rest and stay our souls upon God's <b>mercy</b>. 
    Psalm 13:5, "I have trusted in Your mercy." Though I have sinned, mercy can 
    pardon me. Though I am in need, mercy can relieve me. God's mercy is 
    infinite; it is a <i>honeycomb </i>for sweetness, and a <i>rock </i>for 
    safety.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, we may safely rely on God's <b>truth </b>or <b>
    faithfulness</b>. Remember this—truth is the object of trust. Heaven and 
    earth may sooner fail than God's veracity. Psalm 89:33, "I will not allow My 
    faithfulness to fail." Good reason, then, why we should trust in God. Where 
    can we pitch our faith, but upon God's faithfulness?</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 3. HOW does trusting in God fix the heart? </p></b>
</font>That is the third thing I wish to show you, that trusting in God is 
    the way to have the heart fixed. "His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord."
<p align="justify">Answer. Note two things. First, it is an excellent thing 
    to have the heart fixed. Second, it is only faith, which fixes the heart.</p>
<p align="justify">First, it is a <i>rare </i>thing. It is <b>excellent </b>
    to have the heart fixed. This appears two ways:</p>
<p align="justify">1. Fixing the heart shows stability and stableness of 
    spirit. A heart unfixed is just like a ship without ballast, blown up and 
    down in the water. "The one who believes will be unshakable!" Isaiah 28:16
    </p>
<p align="justify">2. Fixing the heart is for holy duties. He whose heart is 
    fixed upon God serves God with delight, with cheerfulness. Indeed, a heart 
    unfixed—is a heart unfit for duty. A <i>shaking </i>hand is not fit to 
    write. An <i>unfixed </i>heart is unfit to pray or meditate; it runs after 
    other vanities. Surely, then, a fixed frame of heart is an excellent frame 
    of heart. You know that when the milk is settled, it turns to <i>cream</i>. 
    So, when the heart is settled and fixed on God, it is ever in the best 
    frame. That's the first thing.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, trusting in God fixes the heart. The heart is 
    fixed, trusting in the Lord; that is—it is fixed by trusting. Faith frees 
    the heart from those commotions which cause trembling and quivering. It 
    fixes the heart upon God. As a star is fixed in its orb, so a believer's 
    soul is fixed on God. Faith makes the heart cleave to God as a needle 
    cleaves to the magnet. Faith fixes the heart. Such a fixed star was 
    Athanasius. Tertullian called him an invincible adamant. He could not be 
    stirred away from the truth. Faith had fixed his heart on God. Now I will 
    make some use of this point.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use of Information. </p></b></font>Here you see the misery of 
    wicked men. They are unfixed; they do not know where to rest when troubles 
    come; they have no God to trust. Sinners are like a ship without anchor, 
    tossed with the storms—which has nowhere to put in for harbor. They are like 
    the old world—when the flood came they had no ark to trust. The wicked are 
    like King Saul in an hour of danger. 1 Samuel 28:15, "I am sorely 
    distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed 
    from me." A flagitious sinner is like a soldier in battle where the bullets 
    are flying about and he is without armor and has no garrison to trust. 
    Beloved, it is faith which makes the heart fixed in troublesome times. Faith 
    engarrisons the soul in God's attributes, and makes it like an impregnable 
    tower walled in with rocks.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use of Exhortation.</p></b></font> Oh! Let us above all 
    things labor for this heart-fixing grace of faith. Trusting in God 
    corroborates and animates and bears the heart up in death-threatening 
    dangers. Oh, get this heart-fixing grace of faith!
<p align="justify">But alas! Who will not say that he is resolved and fixed? 
    If a storm arises, he, for his part, trusts in God. Who will not say he 
    trusts in God? Therefore, we must bring our heart to a Scriptural 
    touchstone. It is worthwhile. Let us try whether our trusting in God is 
    right or not. You shall know it thus:</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">First, if our trust is right, then we commit our chief 
    treasure to God.</p></b> Our soul is the jewel, the chief treasure, and we 
    commit this to God's care and custody. Psalm 31:5, "Into your hand I commit 
    my spirit." We lay up all our hope in God. Psalm 39:7, "What do I wait for? 
    Lord, my hope is in You." As in time of war a man puts all his money in a 
    safe, strong place—so must we lay up all our hopes in God as a strong tower.
<b>
<p align="justify">Second, if we trust in God aright, why then, in all our 
    danger we fly to God.</p></b> There are some who, when trouble arises, fly to 
    their own wisdom and ability. Oh! But do we fly to God? Psalm 143:9, 
    "Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies. I will fly to You to hide me." When 
    Satan shoots his fiery darts of temptation, then we fly under Christ's wing 
    to shelter us. When a hawk pursues the dove, it casts itself into the clefts 
    of the rock, and there it hides. So, when Satan pursues us with temptation, 
    we get into the bleeding wounds of Christ, these clefts of the Rock, and 
    there we rest and are safe. Augustine said, "I lay myself softly, and rest 
    upon my Savior's bleeding wounds."
<b>
<p align="justify">Third, if we trust in God aright, then we can repose our 
    trust in God when all creature refuges fail us. </p></b>"Even though the fig 
    trees have no blossoms, and there are no grapes on the vine; even though the 
    olive crop fails, and the fields lie empty and barren; even though the 
    flocks die in the fields, and the cattle barns are empty, yet I will rejoice 
    in the Lord! I will be joyful in the God of my salvation. The Sovereign Lord 
    is my strength! He will make me as surefooted as a deer and bring me safely 
    over the mountains!" Habakkuk 3:17-19. We can rely upon God, upon His 
    promises, upon His attributes. Can we trust in God in the deficiency of 
    second causes? Can we trust God without <i>crutches</i>? Then our trust is 
    genuine, a true trust. When the pipes are cut that used to bring us comfort, 
    can we still say, "Yet all our fresh springs are in God!" Psalm 87:7.
<b>
<p align="justify">Fourth, we may know if our trust in God is right by 
    having a spirit of courage infused into us.</p></b> Unbelief breeds fear; faith 
    breeds courage, Proverbs 28:1. The righteous man is as bold as a lion. Faith 
    enables a man to appear in a good cause and to withstand all opposition. 
    Daniel 3:18, "We want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods 
    or worship the image of gold you have set up!" See Hebrews 10:34. Such an 
    invincible Christian was Basil the Great, who did not fear the threats of 
    the emperor. He was like a rock which no water could shake.
<b>
<p align="justify">Fifth, we may know our trust is right when we obey God in 
    all things He calls for.</p></b> There are two things in holy trust, there is <i>
    reliance </i>and <i>obedience</i>, Romans 16:26. Observe, they who expect 
    what God promises—will perform what God commands, Psalm 26:1. They have 
    trusted in the Lord. Where was the trial of this trust? Psalm 119:66, "I 
    have kept Your commandments." They deceive themselves who say that they 
    trust in God and yet will not serve Him. They deny to give God the <i>kiss 
    of obedience</i>.
<b>
<p align="justify">Sixth, true trusting in God is purifying.</p></b> "Having 
    purified their hearts by faith." Faith purges out the love of sin—as 
    medicine purges out a noxious disease. 1 Timothy 3:9, "Holding the mystery 
    of faith in a pure conscience." Faith is the <i>wedding grace </i>which 
    marries Christ, and holiness is the <i>child </i>which faith brings forth. 
    The woman in the gospel who touched Christ by faith felt a healing virtue 
    coming from Him. Let not that man say his heart is fixed, trusting in God, 
    who allows himself in any sin. What! trust in God—and yet you swear and are 
    drunk and unclean! This is not trust; it is carnal presumption! Just like 
    those Jews in Jeremiah 3:4-5, who called God their Father. But what follows? 
    "This is how you <i>talk</i>, but you do all the <i>evil </i>you can!" Those 
    hypocrites would call God <i>Father</i>—yet they sinned as fast as they 
    could!
<b>
<p align="justify">Seventh, true trusting in God is a patient waiting, a 
    waiting trust.</p></b> Psalm 37:7, "Rest in the Lord—and wait patiently for 
    Him." Though a believer does not have what he desires immediately upon the 
    return of a prayer, those smiles and love tokens from God as he desires—yet 
    he is resolved that he will be in a waiting posture. He will wait until 
    mercy comes. That's a fine Scripture, Psalm 123:2, "Our eyes wait upon the 
    Lord our God, until He has mercy upon us." That man who has no patience to 
    wait, has not faith to trust. Remember Isaiah 28:16, "He who believes, shall 
    not make haste." A believer knows full well that the longer he waits for a 
    mercy—the richer it will be when it comes. The longest voyages have the 
    greatest returns. Thus you see what this trusting in God is—which fixes the 
    heart in evil times.
<p align="justify">Now let me, in a few words, resume the exhortation.<font color="#b07050"><b> 
    Oh! Let us labor for this true faith and trust, to have our hearts fixed on 
    God in evil times. </b></font><i>Faith is the heart-establishing, and 
    heart-strengthening grace. </i>Psalm 112:8, "His heart is established." The 
    Hebrew word for establish signifies this, "the heart is shored up." It is a 
    metaphor which alludes to a house that is shored up by pieces of timber. 
    Thus faith shores up the heart when it is likely to sink. Oh! Get this 
    heart-fixing grace of faith. Thus you come to be resolved and undaunted even 
    in the worst of times and dangers.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, that we may labor thus, consider but these three 
    things:</p>
<p align="justify">First, there is nothing but God, which we can fix our 
    trust in. Alas! Whatever else we trust besides God, will never shelter us in 
    an hour of danger. There is no trusting in <i><b>riches</b></i>. Proverbs 
    23:5, "Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely 
    sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle."</p>
<p align="justify">There is no trusting in <i><b>friends</b></i>; they may 
    die, or, which is worse, they may deceive, Micah 7:5. Our Lord Jesus was 
    betrayed by a friend.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no trusting in <i><b>great men</b></i>; who can 
    trust those who are not true to God? Psalm 118:9, "It is better to trust in 
    the Lord than to put confidence in princes."</p>
<p align="justify">There is no trusting in your <i><b>own hearts</b></i>. 
    Why, alas! The heart is full of lust, full of deceit. It is a bosom traitor. 
    Proverbs 28:26, "He who trusts in his own heart is a fool." Oh! But my 
    brethren, trust in God; He is a never-failing refuge. A little boat, while 
    it is tied fast to a rock, is very safe. So, when the soul is tied by faith 
    to Christ Jesus, the Rock of Ages, then it is safe. Psalm 46:11, "My God is 
    the Rock of my refuge."</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, fixing our trust in God brings sweet peace with 
    it. </p></b></font>Peace is the olive branch, which faith brings in its mouth. 
    Turn to that excellent Scripture, Isaiah 26:3, "You will keep him in perfect 
    peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You." Observe, 
    perfect <i>trust </i>is blessed with perfect <i>peace</i>. The word "trust 
    in God" comes from the Hebrew word, which signifies to <i>nourish</i>. Why 
    so? Because our trusting in God nourishes, it nourishes peace in the soul. 
    Faith represents God as reconciled, and this gives peace. He who trusts in 
    God has peace in the midst of storms and tempests. He is like Noah in the 
    ark; when the deluge came he could sit and sing in the ark.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Third, and last, fixing our trust on God is that which 
    brings in mercy, comfort, and deliverance to us. </p></b></font>Psalm 32:2, "He 
    who trusts in God, mercy shall compass him about." Would it not be a fine 
    thing, in the midst of a fight, to be compassed about with a golden shield 
    which no arrow or bullet could pierce? It is true! God's mercy, like a 
    golden shield, shall compass him about! Oh, therefore, get this heart-fixing 
    grace of faith!
<p align="justify">To encourage your faith, remember these two things, you 
    who travail for the church's deliverance, faith and prayer are the two 
    midwives, which deliver God's Church when she is in travail. I will give you 
    a clear Scripture, 2 Chronicles 14:11, "Help us, O Lord our God"—there was 
    prayer; "for we trust in you alone"—there was faith. When we build our 
    reliance and confidence on God, He is obliged in point of honor—to defend 
    and save us. Isaiah 28:7, "My heart trusted in You, and I am helped."</p>
<p align="justify">To sum up all, let us above all things, labor to have our 
    hearts fixed on God by holy trust<i>. Trust His heart—where you cannot trace 
    His hand! </i>Trust God for <i>protection </i>in this life, and <i>salvation
    </i>in the next life.</p>
<p align="justify">Beloved, trusting in God is a prescription for all 
    diseases. Faith is the universal cure! Does the <i>orphan </i>trust himself 
    in the hands of his guardian? Does the <i>patient </i>trust his life in the 
    hands of the physician? And shall we not trust our souls in God's hand? 2 
    Samuel 22:31, "He is a <i>shield </i>to all who take refuge in Him." If ever 
    we would get mastery of our fears and disquiets, let us be done with <i>
    carnal reason </i>and nourish faith. So, then, you shall not be afraid of 
    evil tidings, for the heart will be fixed, trusting in the Lord.</p>
