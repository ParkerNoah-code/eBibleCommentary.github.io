    with Christ</b></font></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be 
    with Christ, which is better by far."</p></i> Philippians 1:23
<p align="justify">We are met to solemnize the funeral of our deceased 
    friend, and to perform the last office of love. A looking-glass of mortality 
    is here set before us, wherein we may see our own fragile condition. There 
    is a sentence passed upon us all: "It is appointed unto men once to die" 
    (Hebrews 9:27); so that <i>our life is but a short reprieve from death</i>, 
    which is granted to a condemned man.</p>
<p align="justify">A wise man's life, said Plato, is nothing else but a 
    contemplation of death. The Lord would have us accustom ourselves to dying 
    thoughts (Deuteronomy 32:20); and, as it were, by meditation, often to 
    stretch ourselves upon our deathbed. God clothed our first parents with <i>
    skins </i>of dead beasts, and feeds us with dead <i>flesh</i>—that as often 
    as we see the death of other creatures we might not forget our own.</p>
<p align="justify">The text presents to us Paul in a holy pathos, or fit of 
    longing to be with Christ. His heart was with Christ, and he wanted only the<i> 
    swift wing of death </i>to carry him there. <i>"I am torn between the two: I 
    desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far."</i> I shall 
    briefly explain the terms as they lie in order.</p>
<p align="justify">"I am torn between the two," or, "I am hemmed in." This 
    may allude to a castle which is so straitly besieged and hemmed in that it 
    has no way out. It fared now with Paul as with a woman who has her children 
    at home with her and her husband beyond the seas; she would gladly be with 
    her husband—yet is loath to leave her children. So Paul would gladly have 
    been with Christ—but was loath to leave the Philippians, his spiritual 
    children.</p>
<p align="justify">The apostle does not say, "I <i>must </i>depart," but "I
    <i>desire </i>to depart." All men <i>must </i>depart. There is a dying 
    principle in all; the frame and composition of their body is earthly, and 
    tends to a dissolution. Nebuchadnezzar's image, though it had a head of 
    gold—yet had feet of clay (Daniel 2:33). Take the strongest man, let him be 
    Samson or Hercules, of him we may yet say that <i>he stands upon feet of 
    clay! </i>He is but <i>animated dust</i>, and must molder away in time. 
    Death will come with its summons at last.</p>
<p align="justify">"Is my strength," said Job, "the strength of stones," 
    (Job 6:12). Suppose it were—yet the continual <i>dropping of sickness </i>
    would in time wear away this stone. There is no such thing as an earthly 
    eternity; death is called "the house appointed for <i>all </i>living" (Job 
    30:23).</p>
<p align="justify">But though death is in itself <i>necessary</i>—to Paul it 
    was <i>voluntary</i>. It was not so much a debt as a vote; not so much 
    Paul's task as his choice. He did not say, "I <i>must </i>depart," but "I <i>
    desire </i>to depart."</p>
<p align="justify">The apostle does not say, "having a desire to <i>die</i>," 
    but "to <i>depart</i>," a softer word which takes off the sharp edge of 
    death and make it less formidable.</p>
<p align="justify">This phrase "to depart" may refer to soldiers who pitch 
    their tents in the field, and upon the least word of command from their 
    general loosen the cords of their tents, pluck up the stakes, and march 
    forward. So death loosens the silver cord which fastened the soul in its 
    earthly tent, and a Christian marches forward to the heavenly Canaan.</p>
<p align="justify">Or "to depart" may be a metaphor taken from mariners, who 
    loosen anchor so that they may sail from one port to another. So Paul 
    desired to <i>loosen anchor</i>. Death to a believer is but loosening the 
    anchor and sailing from one port to another—from earth to heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">The world is an inn; we are travelers who take up our 
    lodging here for a night, and Paul longed to be <i>out </i>of his <i>inn</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">"And to be with Christ." The apostle had three great 
    desires, and they were all centered upon Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">One was to be found in Christ (Philippians 3:9); </p>
<p align="justify">another was to magnify Christ (Philippians 1:20); </p>
<p align="justify">the third was to be with Christ (Philippians 1:23).</p>
<p align="justify">Observe that Paul does not say, "I desire to depart and 
    be in <i>heaven</i>," but "to be with <i>Christ</i>." It is Christ's 
    presence which makes heaven, as the king's presence makes the court. It is 
    not the cherubim or seraphim which make paradise; "the Lamb is the light 
    thereof" (Revelation 21:23).</p>
<p align="justify">From the connection of the words, "having a desire to 
    depart and to be with Christ," we clearly see that the soul of a believer 
    does not sleep in the body after death (a drowsy opinion)—but goes 
    immediately to Christ.<i> Upon the divorce of the soul from the body—there 
    follows an espousal of the soul to Christ. </i>In 2 Corinthians 5:8, "absent 
    from the body" means to be "present with the Lord." It would be better for 
    believers to stay here if they did not immediately go to Christ after death. 
    For here the saints are daily improving their graces; here they have many 
    sweet tastes of God's love—so that it would be better to stay here. And Paul 
    wished that which would be to his loss<i>—if</i> the soul should sleep in 
    the body and not go immediately after death to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">"Which is far better." A believer is no loser by death. 
    His change is for the better; a scion that is grafted into a stock and 
    planted in a better soil in no way is hindered. A believer after death is 
    set into a better stock, Christ, and is planted in a better soil, heaven. 
    This can be no loss—but an advantage. Well therefore may the apostle say 
    that to be with Christ is <i>far better!</i></p>

<p align="justify">In the words there are these three parts: </p>
<p align="justify">Paul's choice: "to be with Christ"; </p>
<p align="justify">the excellency of his choice: "it is far better"; </p>
<p align="justify">and the dilemma he was in: "I am torn between the two."
    </p>
<p align="justify">This holy man was in a great dilemma; he was torn between
    <i>service </i>and <i>reward</i>. He was desirous of glory—yet willing to 
    adjourn his own happiness and stay out of heaven a while—so that he might be 
    a means to bring others there.</p>
<p align="justify">From the words thus opened, there are three observations.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is the desire of a true saint to leave this present 
    world, and be with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To be with Christ is far better. How much better it 
    is, we shall better understand when we are in heaven. Some angel is best 
    able to speak to this point.</p>
<p align="justify">3. That which keeps a saint here in the world, is a 
    desire of doing service. This cast the balance with the apostle, and was the 
    only enticing motive to keep him here a while. He looked upon his <i>abode 
    in the flesh </i>as an opportunity of service. Paul was willing to die—yet 
    content to live, so that he might be a factor for Christ upon earth.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall at this time insist upon the first proposition, 
    that it is the desire of a true saint to leave this present world, and be 
    with Christ.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. It is the desire of a true saint to be gone from this 
    present world</p></b></font>, "having a desire to depart." What a wicked man 
    fears, that a godly man hopes for. "I desire," said Paul, "to depart." A 
    sinner is reluctant to depart; he does not say, "<i>Come</i>, Lord Jesus," 
    but "<i>Stay</i>, Lord Jesus." He desires to live in this present world 
    forever; he knows no other heaven but earth—and it is death to him to be 
    turned out of his heaven. It was the speech of Axiochus the philosopher, 
    when he was to die, "Shall I be deprived of this life? Shall I leave all my 
    sweet delights?" 
<p align="justify">David calls death a going out of the world (Psalm 39:13). 
    A wicked man does not <i>go </i>out—but is <i>dragged </i>out; he is like a 
    tenant who has gotten possession, and will not <i>go </i>out of the house 
    until the police <i>pull </i>him out. If a wicked man were put to his 
    choice, he would never come where God is; he would choose the serpent's 
    curse—to <i>eat </i>dust (Genesis 3:14)—but not <i>return </i>to dust. If a 
    wicked man might have his wish, he would serve no other God but his belly, 
    and to this he would ever liberally pour drink offerings.</p>
<p align="justify">But a soul enlivened and ennobled with a principle of 
    grace, looks upon the world as a <i>wilderness </i>wherein are fiery 
    serpents, and he desires to get out of this wilderness. Simeon, having taken 
    Christ in his arms, cried out, "Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace" 
    (Luke 2:29). He who has taken Christ in the arms of his faith, will sing 
    Simeon's song, "Lord, now let Your servant depart!" David prayed to know the 
    measure of his days (Psalm 39:4), because, said one, he desired to hear the 
    good news of death's approach. </p>
<p align="justify">The saints of God have looked upon themselves as 
    imprisoned in the body, and have longed for a jail-delivery. The <i>bird </i>
    desires to get out of the cage, though it is made of gold. Hilarion chided 
    himself for not being more willing to die: "Go forth my soul, what do you 
    fear?" Ignatius was desirous of martyrdom, that he might gain the presence 
    of Christ in glory.</p>
<p align="justify">A Christian of the right temper, is ambitiously desirous 
    to put off the earthly clothes of his body and make his bed in the grave. 
    How this bed is perfumed with Christ's lying in it! A pillow of <i>down </i>
    is not so sweet as a pillow of <i>dust</i>. A regenerate person, looking 
    upon himself as held with the earthen fetters of the flesh, and his soul put 
    into a moveable sepulcher, cries out with David, "Oh, that I had wings like 
    a dove, that I might fly away and be at rest!" (Psalm 55:6).</p>
<p align="justify">And, indeed, it is no wonder that a true saint desires a 
    dismissal, and is so earnest to be gone from this present world, if we 
    consider how beneficial death is to a child of God. <i>Death puts an end to 
    all his evils! </i>In particular, there are <font color="#008000"><b>ten 
    evils which death will put an end to</b></font>:</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Death will put an end to a believer's SINS.</p></b></font> 
    Sin is the great incendiary; it does us all the mischief. Sin has a 
    malignant influence. <i>It is the womb of our sorrows—and the grave of our 
    comforts!
</i>
<p align="justify">Sin is the sinner's bondage (Acts 8:23) and the saint's 
    burden (Psalm 83:3). How a believer is worn out with his corruptions? "I am 
    weary of my life!" said Rebecca, "because of the daughters of Heth" (Genesis 
    27:46). That which makes a child of God weary of his life is his proud, 
    unbelieving heart. Paul could better carry his iron chains—than his sins. "O 
    wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" 
    (Romans 7:24). When grace spurs the soul forward, the curbing bit of sin 
    checks it and pulls it back again. There is much of the <i>old man </i>in 
    the <i>new man</i>; there is a part in every regenerate heart, which is true 
    to the devil—a part which will not pray, which will not believe. A Christian 
    has a <i>double bias</i>; he has an earthly bias upon his will as well a 
    spiritual bias, and these draw him several ways; "For I do not do the good 
    that I want to do, but I practice the evil that I do not want to do" (Romans 
    7:19). </p>
<p align="justify">Sin mingles itself with our holy things; we cannot do 
    either our <i>duties </i>or our <i>graces </i>without sin; we are like 
    children who cannot write without blotting! The sweet rose of grace does not 
    grow without its <i>prickles</i>. No wonder then that a believer desires to 
    depart; death will free him from his spiritual distempers! When we are done
    <i>breathing</i>—we will be done <i>sinning!</i></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Death will put an end to a believer's TEMPTATIONS.</p></b></font> 
    "Our whole life," said Augustine, "is nothing but a temptation; we tread 
    upon snares." Satan is ever casting in the hook of a temptation to see 
    whether we will bite. He knows how to suit his temptations: he tempted <i>
    Achan </i>with a wedge of gold; he tempted <i>David </i>with beauty. We 
    cannot lock the door of our heart so fast by prayer—but a temptation will 
    enter. Sometimes Satan comes more <i>furiously</i>, as a red dragon; 
    sometimes more <i>slyly</i>, as a serpent. Sometimes he baits his hook with 
    Scripture, and tempts us to sin under a mask of religion, as when he tempts 
    to evil that good may come of it. Thus he can transform himself into an <i>
    angel of light </i>(2 Corinthians 11:14).
<p align="justify">Is it not a grievous thing for a virgin to have her 
    chastity assaulted? Is it not sad to have the devil's bullets continually 
    flying about our ears? No wonder then that a believer is willing to depart; 
    death will put him out of gunshot range! He shall never be troubled with 
    Satan's fiery darts any more! Though <i>grace </i>puts a child of God out of 
    the devil's possession; it is <i>death </i>only that frees him from the 
    devil's temptation!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Death will put an end to a believer's FEARS.</p></b></font> 
    Fear is the soul's palsy; there is torment in fear. Cicero calls fear one of 
    the three plagues of mankind; and the best of the saints are haunted with 
    this evil spirit. They cannot rejoice without trembling. The believer fears 
    that his heart would cheat him; he fears that God does not love him; he 
    fears that he should tire in his march to heaven. The best faith may 
    sometimes have its fears, as the best stars have their twinklings. "These 
    fears," as Socrates said, "arm a man against himself." They are very 
    afflictive, leaving sad impressions of melancholy behind. No wonder, then, 
    that a believer longs to depart out of this life. Why should he fear that 
    which frees him from fear? The <i>king of terrors </i>makes all fear vanish!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Death will dry up a believer's TEARS.</p></b></font> 
    Revelation 7:17: "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes!" 
    Weeping is nothing but a cloud of sorrow gathered in the heart, dropping 
    into water. A Christian often has no one to keep him company but his own 
    griefs and sorrows; he sits as Israel by the rivers weeping. As soon as the 
    child is <i>born</i>, it weeps. When Moses was born, he was laid in an ark 
    of bulrushes, where he baptized himself, as it were, with his own tears. 
    Exodus 2:6: "And behold the babe wept." Ever since we <i>looked </i>upon the 
    tree of knowledge, our <i>eyes have watered</i>.
<p align="justify">There are many things to occasion weeping: our sins (who 
    can look into his own heart with dry eyes?) and a loss of relations, which 
    is like pulling a limb from the body. Joseph wept over his dead father 
    (Genesis 50:1). Well, then, we should not be astonished that a believer 
    desires to depart from hence. He shall leave the <i>valley of tears!</i> The 
    bottle of tears shall be stopped; his weeping water shall be turned into 
    wine, his mourning shall be turned into music, and his lamentations shall be 
    turned into hallelujahs. <i>Death is the handkerchief to wipe away all 
    tears!</i></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Death will put an end to a believer's TROUBLES. </p></b>
</font>"Man is born to trouble" (job 5:7). He is the natural heir to it. 
    This life is subject to injury; we never <i>finish </i>our troubles while we 
    live here—but only <i>change </i>them for others. Everyone has his cross to 
    carry; sometimes <i>poverty </i>pinches, sometimes <i>sickness </i>tortures, 
    sometimes <i>lawsuits </i>vex. Man is like a <i>tennis ball</i>, bandied up 
    and down by providence. While wicked men are in the world, never look for 
    rest. These troubled seas, as the prophet calls them, will be casting forth 
    their foam and mire upon the godly. Well then may a believer say, "Lord, now 
    let You Your servant depart!" Death gives a child of God his quiet rest 
    (Isaiah 57:20); it sends him a writ of ease. Job 3:17: "There (that is, in 
    the grave) the wicked cease from troubling—and there the weary are at rest."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Death puts an end to a believer's CARES.</p></b></font> 
    Care is vexatious and anxious; it eats out the comfort of life. The Greek 
    word for "care" signifies to cut the heart in pieces. Care frets as a 
    canker; it excruciates the mind; it breaks the sleep, it ravages the 
    energies. This is the rack which the soul is stretched upon. It is hard (I 
    almost said "impossible") to shake off this <i>viper of care </i>while we 
    live. All our comforts are <i>care-full </i>comforts. Care is to the mind as 
    a burden to the back: it loads the spirits and, with overloading, sinks 
    them. 
<p align="justify">Care is a fruit of the curse. Adam's lack of care—has 
    brought us to care. Have you not sometimes seen the briar growing by the 
    honeysuckle, so that you cannot easily gather the honeysuckle without being 
    scratched by the briar? Thus in gathering riches, how the head and heart are 
    pricked with care! And is there not great reason why a child of God should 
    desire to depart? Is it good being among the briars? </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Death is the cure of care!</p></i> We are thoughtful and 
    solicitous how to get such an estate, how to provide for such a child; now 
    death comes to a believer as a friend, and says, "Never perplex and distract 
    your mind thus. I will free you from all these heart-killing cares! I will 
    strike but once, and that stroke shall relieve you of all your cares!"
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Death will put an end to the night of spiritual 
    DESERTION.</p></b></font> "You hid Your face—and I was troubled" (Psalm 30:7). 
    The soul in desertion is within an inch of despair. In <i>affliction </i>the 
    world is against a man; in <i>temptation </i>Satan is against a man; in <i>
    desertion </i>God is against a man. Alstead calls desertion "an agony of 
    conscience." This made the prophet Jonah call the whale's belly "the belly 
    of hell," because he was <i>deserted </i>there. Jonah 2: 2, 4, "Out of the 
    belly of hell I cried! I am cast out of Your sight!"
<p align="justify">The Psalmist despaired, upon the suspension of God's 
    favor. Psalm 88:15: "I have suffered your terrors and am in <i>despair</i>." 
    But death will free from desertion; a believer after death shall never see 
    any more <i>eclipses</i>. God will draw aside the curtain and pull off His 
    veil, and the soul shall be forever sunning itself in the light of God's 
    countenance!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Death will put an end to all our NATURAL 
    imperfections. </p></b></font>Our natural <i>knowledge </i>is very imperfect; 
    the most perceptive, intelligent person may say as did Agur in Proverbs 
    30:3, "1 have not the understanding of a man!" Since the fall, the lamp of 
    reason burns dim; there are knots in nature that we cannot untie. Why should 
    the Nile overflow in summer when, by the course of nature, waters are 
    lowest? Why should a magnet incline to the polar star? Why should the sea be 
    higher than the earth—yet not drown it? How do bones grow in the womb 
    (Ecclesiastes 11:5)? Many of these things are riddles and paradoxes. By 
    eating of the <i>tree of knowledge</i>, we have lost the <i>key of knowledge</i>, 
    and now we are <i>maimed in our minds! </i>By the fall we have lost our 
    headpiece!
<p align="justify">Socrates said on his deathbed that there were many things 
    which he had yet to learn. Our knowledge is like the twilight—dim and dusky. 
    The greatest part of our knowledge is not so much as the least part of our 
    ignorance; all which considered, no wonder to hear this language from a 
    saint, "I have a desire to depart." Death crowns a Christian with fullness 
    of knowledge. When he is <i>snuffed out </i>by death, the <i>candle </i>of 
    his understanding will burn brighter. At death, a child of God perfectly 
    recovers the use of his reason.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">9. Death will put an end to the imperfections of GRACE.</p></b></font> 
    Our graces are our best jewels—but here they are in their <i>infancy </i>and
    <i>immaturity</i>. Therefore the saints are said to receive but the <i>
    first-fruits </i>of the Spirit (Romans 8:23). The best Christian is like a 
    child—he is very weak in grace. <i>Faith </i>is feeble, and love is 
    lukewarm; though grace is not dead, it is <i>sick</i>. Revelation 3:2: 
    "Strengthen the things which are ready to die." Grace is like gold in the 
    ore—drossy and impure; the most refined soul has some <i>dregs</i>. This 
    motto may be written upon a Christian's graces: <i>He who shoots farthest in 
    holiness comes short of the mark of perfection. </i>Well then may a believer 
    desire to depart! Death will free him from all the imperfections of his 
    holiness. It will make him as pure as the angels—having neither spot nor 
    wrinkle (Ephesians 5:27).
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">10. Death will put an end to a weary PILGRIMAGE. </p></b>
</font>We are here in this world, in a <i>pilgrim </i>condition (1 Peter 
    2:11). A Christian walks with his pilgrim's staff in his hand, the <i>staff 
    of the promise </i>in the <i>hand of faith. </i>Now death will put an end to 
    this pilgrimage. Death takes away the <i>pilgrim's staff</i>—and sets a <i>
    crown </i>upon his head. No wonder that the gracious soul cries out with 
    Paul, "I have a desire to depart."
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. But some of the saints have prayed against 
    death. Hezekiah, when the message of death was brought, prayed against it 
    and wept sorely (Isaiah 38:2-3). So Hezekiah had no desire to depart.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. Hezekiah desired to live a while longer that he 
    might do more work for God. Verse 18: "The dead cannot praise You," 
    intimating that if he had been then taken off by death, he was capable of 
    doing God no more service. He was loath to be cut down, until he had borne 
    more fruit. Besides, had he then died in the infancy of reformation, the 
    adversaries of God would have exulted and made songs of triumph at his 
    funeral.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. Hezekiah was unwilling to die at that time 
    because he had no son to succeed him on the throne. God had promised to 
    David in 1 Kings 8:25, that those of his line who were godly, would not lack 
    offspring to succeed them in the throne. Now in this respect it was a great 
    discomfort to Hezekiah to die childless; for he might have thought himself 
    no better than a hypocrite, inasmuch as God had promised offspring to the 
    kings of David's line who feared him. Upon these and other considerations, 
    Hezekiah might pray against death at that juncture of time.</p>
<p align="justify">And whereas it may be said that many of God's children 
    are unwilling to die, I answer, a Christian is a compound creature, flesh 
    and spirit; and from this composition there may be a conflict between the <i>
    fear </i>of death and the <i>desire </i>of death. But at last the spiritual 
    part prevails; and, as <i>faith </i>grows stronger, <i>fear </i>grows 
    weaker. Thus it was with Paul, who had "a desire to depart." I proceed now 
    to the second branch of the doctrine,</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. It is a saint's desire to be with Christ. </p></b></font>
    Paul longed to lie on that soft pillow where John the beloved disciple 
    did—the bosom of Jesus. There would have been little comfort in departing, 
    if the apostle had not put in these words, "to be with Christ." Death will 
    make a glorious change for a believer; it is but crossing the <i>dead </i>
    sea, and he shall be with Christ. Death to a child of God is like the 
    whirlwind to Elijah—it blew off his mantle—but carried the prophet up to 
    heaven! So death is a boisterous wind which blows off the mantle of the 
    flesh (for the body is but the mantle the soul is wrapped in)—but it carries 
    the soul up to Christ! The day of a believer's <i>dissolution </i>is the day 
    of his <i>coronation!</i> <i>Though death is a bitter cup, there is sugar at 
    the bottom</i>; it translates the soul of a believer to Christ. Though the
    <i>flesh </i>calls death the <i>last enemy </i>(1 Corinthians 15:26)—yet <i>
    faith </i>calls it the <i>best friend</i>; it brings a man to Christ, which 
    is far better.
<p align="justify">These words "to be with Christ" imply intuition, 
    enjoyment, and duration.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. To be with Christ implies INTUITION. </p></b></font>1 John 
    3:2: "We shall <i>see </i>Him as He is." Here we see Him as He is not. He is 
    not mutable and He is not mortal; but in heaven we shall see Him as He is. 
    When Socrates was to die, he comforted himself with this—that he would go to 
    the place where he should see Homer and Museus, and other worthies who lived 
    in the ages before him. A believer may comfort himself with this—that he 
    shall see Christ! Here we see him but through a dark glass; but what will it 
    be when He shall be bespangled in all His embroidery, and shall show Himself 
    forth in His full glory to His saints! 
<p align="justify">Lucian said to his friend, "I will show you all the glory 
    of Greece; when you have seen Solon, you have seen all." So he who sees 
    Jesus Christ sees all the glory of paradise, Christ being the mirror of 
    beauty and the quintessence of happiness!</p>
<p align="justify">Some ask the question, "How and in what manner shall we 
    see Christ? Shall we see His <i>godhead </i>with bodily eyes?" It is not 
    good to be wise above what is written—but I think we may with modesty assert 
    that we shall, with our bodily eyes, behold Christ's human nature. His glory 
    as a Mediator shall be visible to the saints, and shall be beheld by 
    glorified eyes; in this sense Job 19:25 is to be understood: "With these 
    eyes shall I see God!" Great and amazing will that glory be, which shall 
    sparkle from the human nature of Christ; if His <i>transfiguration </i>was 
    so glorious—what will His <i>coronation </i>be! Augustine wished that he 
    might have seen three things before he died: Paul in the pulpit, Rome in its 
    glory, and Christ in the flesh. But what would those things be, compared to 
    this sight of Christ in heaven? We shall behold not a <i>crucified </i>
    Christ—but a <i>glorified </i>Christ!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. To be with Christ implies ENJOYMENT. </p></b></font>We 
    shall not only <i>see </i>Him—but <i>enjoy </i>Him. Therefore in Scripture 
    the saints are said not only to <i>behold </i>Him—but to be <i>glorified </i>
    with Him (Romans 8:17). And glory is said not only to be revealed <i>to </i>
    us—but <i>in </i>us (Romans 8:18). "Enter into the joy of your Lord" 
    (Matthew 25:21); we shall not only <i>see </i>it—but <i>enter </i>into it! A 
    man may see a fair arbor drawn upon the wall—but he cannot enter into it. 
    This glory of heaven may be entered into. As the sponge sucks in the wine, 
    so there shall be sucking in of glory. From this enjoyment of Christ—a 
    torrent of divine joy will flow into the soul!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. To be with Christ implies DURATION.</p></b></font> 1 
    Thessalonians 4:17: "So shall we be <i>forever </i>with the Lord!" "This 
    world and all it contains will pass away" (1 Corinthians 7:31). Earthly 
    comforts, though they may be <i>sweet</i>, are <i>swift</i>. Plutarch 
    reports that Alexander caused a sword within a wheel to be painted on a 
    table, implying that what he had gotten by his sword was subject to be 
    turned about with the wheel of providence. If we had the longest lease of 
    these things, it would soon be run out. But this privilege of being with 
    Christ runs parallel with eternity, "So shall we be <i>forever </i>with the 
    Lord!"
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">Application</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Information.</p></b></font> See from all this, the difference 
    between a believer's departing, and a wicked man's departing. To a believer 
    it is a <i>happy </i>departing; to a wicked man it is a <i>sad </i>
    departing. To the wicked man there is nothing but departing; he departs out 
    of this life and he departs from Christ. "Depart from Me, you who are 
    cursed." A wicked man departs from beams of glory—into flames of fire! He 
    departs from the society of angels—into the fellowship of devils! (Matthew 
    25:41). He is never done departing; the wicked shall be ever consuming—yet 
    never consumed. They may well tremble—to think of departing. Well may the 
    mourners go about the street when a wicked man dies! Hell may rightly be 
    called the place of weepers.
<p align="justify">And see how little cause a child of God has to fear 
    death—when it only carries him to Christ! This is a deathbed cordial; we are 
    naturally possessed with a strange kind of palpitation and trembling at the 
    thoughts of death, as if we were in a shaking palsy, whereas <i>there is 
    nothing more really advantageous to a Christian, than death! </i>Death is a 
    bridge which leads to the paradise of God; all the hurt that death does to a 
    believer—is to carry him to Christ, and is not that far better? Death pulls 
    off the rags of the <i>body</i>—and puts Christ's robes upon the <i>soul</i>. 
    The serious consideration of this, would raise a believer above the <i>
    desire of life</i>, and the <i>fear of death.</i></p>

<p align="justify">OBJECTION. But a child of God may say, "I could rejoice 
    at the <i>gain </i>of death—but I fear the <i>pain </i>of death. I desire 
    the haven—but I tremble at the voyage."</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. In other cases we do not refuse pain; there is 
    pain in the setting of a bone, in the lancing of an abscess; yet we endure 
    the pain contentedly, because it is in order to a cure. Death is a healing 
    thing; it will cure a Christian of all his wounds! <i>By making one pain, it 
    cures all the rest.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Do we endure no pain at all in our life? Job felt so many 
    miseries that he chose to die rather than to live. Job 7:5: "My flesh is 
    clothed with worms, my skin is broken and become loathsome, so that my soul 
    chooses strangling, and death rather than life." The life of man is a 
    continual misery, and is interwoven with miseries. Some have felt more pain 
    in their life—than others have at their death.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 3. What are a few pangs of death—<i>compared</i> 
    with the pangs of a guilty conscience, or with the flames of hell, from 
    which God has freed a believer! How light is death—compared with the weight 
    of glory! (2 Corinthians 4:17) How short is it—in respect of eternity! The 
    present suffering, is not worthy of comparison, to the glory which shall be 
    revealed in the children of God (Romans 8:18).</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 4. We make death more than it is. As the Moabites 
    thought the waters had been blood, when they received only a color and 
    tincture from the sunbeams (2 Kings 3:22), we imagine death to be worse than 
    it is. We look upon it through a magnifying glass. Fear makes a Christian 
    see double; if we would shut the eye of <i>sense </i>and open the eye of <i>
    faith</i>—death would appear less formidable.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Examination.</p></b></font> Let us then put ourselves upon a 
    scrutiny and trial whether we are people who shall go to Christ when we die. 
    It is certain that we shall depart—but the question is whether we shall go 
    to Christ or not?
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How may that be known?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. By faith. Faith is the uniting grace; it is the 
    vital, radical, cardinal grace which gives us a saving interest in Christ. 
    Faith is the <i>queen </i>of the graces; by faith we <i>take </i>Christ as a 
    Husband—and <i>give </i>ourselves up to Him as a Lord. Faith is a 
    Christ-appropriating grace; it has both a <i>relying </i>and an <i>applying
    </i>faculty. Christ is the ring; faith is the finger which puts on this 
    ring. Faith opens the orifice in Christ's sides—and drinks His blood. Faith 
    is both <i>justifying </i>and <i>sanctifying</i>: it fetches <i>blood </i>
    out of Christ's sides to pardon, and <i>water </i>out of His sides to purge! 
    (1 John 5:6). Oh, with all gettings, get faith!</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But there is much deceit about this grace. The 
    Cyprian diamond, said Pliny, looks like the true diamond—but it is not of 
    the right kind; it will break with the hammer. The devil has his bad wares 
    and counterfeit graces to put off; how therefore shall we know a true faith 
    from a false and spurious one?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. I shall give you two different evidences.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. True faith is ever found in a heart deeply humbled for 
    sin.</p></b> Acts 2:37: "They were pricked at their hearts." Here was the first 
    budding of faith; you never saw a <i>flower </i>grow out of a stone—nor <i>
    faith </i>out of a heart of stone. Faith is an herb which always grows in a
    <i>moist </i>soil—in a weeping eye and a broken heart. Mark 9:24: "The 
    father of the child cried out with <i>tears</i>, Lord I believe." This 
    flower of faith, grows in the water.
<b>
<p align="justify">2. True faith is operative. </p></b>The jewelers say there is 
    no precious stone but has some latent virtue in it. Just so, we may say of 
    precious faith—it has hidden virtue in it. It is very operative, for it 
    works out sin (Acts 15:9); it works by love (Galatians 5:6); it is full of 
    good works (James 2:17). It makes the <i>tongue </i>speak for Christ, the <i>
    head </i>study for Christ, the <i>hands </i>work for Christ, and the <i>feet
    </i>run in the ways of His commandments. Faith comes with <i>power </i>upon 
    the heart. 2 Thessalonians 1:11 speaks of the <i>work of faith with power</i>. 
    It has a <i>restraining </i>and <i>constraining </i>power; by this we may 
    know whether ours is a true faith or not.
<p align="justify">I have read of a father who had three sons and, being 
    about to die, he left in his will all his estate to that son who could find 
    his ring with the jewel which had a healing virtue. The case was brought 
    before the judges; the two elder sons counterfeited a ring—but the younger 
    son brought the true ring, which was proven by the virtue of it, whereupon 
    his father's estate went to him. To this ring I may compare faith: there is 
    a counterfeit faith in the world—but if we can find this <i>ring of faith
    </i>which has the <i>virtue </i>in it—both purgative and operative, this is 
    the true faith which interests us in, and entitles us to—Jesus Christ. And 
    if we are <i>in </i>Christ while we live, we shall be <i>with </i>Christ 
    when we die. Where faith gives a <i>propriety</i>, death gives a <i>
    possession</i>.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Comfort. </p></b></font>Here then is comfort in the death of 
    our pious friends. Though they depart from us—yet they go to Christ, which 
    is far better. We should <i>mourn </i>for those who are living—yet dead in 
    sin; and <i>rejoice </i>for those who are dead—yet live with Christ. Our 
    dear departed brother had holy pangs of desire which seemed no less strong 
    than the pangs of death. He panted after God as his ultimate and supreme 
    desire. He did often with joy repeat the words of the text, and seemed to 
    roll them as honey under his tongue. We may therefore entertain good hopes 
    of him who is placed in that paradise of God, which he thirsted after. I 
    wished him to look up to the merits of Christ. "I must," said he, "rest 
    there or nowhere."
<p align="justify">Oh, what a comfort is this, to think that our friends are 
    not only taken away from the evil to come (Isaiah 57:1)—but that they are 
    with Christ! Why should we be sad at their advancement? They have their <i>
    crown </i>(2 Timothy 4:8), their <i>throne </i>(Revelation 3:21), and their
    <i>white robes </i>(Revelation 7:9). Why should we weep immoderately for 
    those who have all tears wiped from their eyes? They enter into the joy of 
    their Lord! Why should we be swallowed up by grief for those who are 
    swallowed up by joy! They who die in the Lord are not lost—but sent to 
    heaven a little before us; we shall shortly join them. It is but a short 
    while—and godly friends shall meet in heaven and feast together at the 
    supper of the Lamb! (Revelation 19:9). It is but a short while—and the 
    saints shall lie together in Christ's bosom, that hive of sweetness, that 
    bed of perfume! "<i>Blessed </i>are the dead who die in the Lord" 
    (Revelation 14:13). Why should we mourn excessively for those who are <i>
    blessed</i>? Oh, let us not weep at the happiness of our friends—but rather 
    long to depart and be with Christ, when we shall drink of these rivers of 
    pleasures which run at His right hand forevermore!</p>
