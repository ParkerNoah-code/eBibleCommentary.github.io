<i>
<p align="justify">"God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved."</p></i> 
    Psalm 46:5
<p align="justify">Solomon said,<i> "A word fitly spoken is like apples of 
    gold in pictures of silver," </i>Proverbs 25:11. In which regard I have made 
    choice of this Scripture, which may be a word in season to revive the 
    desponding hearts of God's people. <i>"God is in the midst of her, she shall 
    not be moved."</i></p>

<p align="justify">This psalm is a triumphant exaltation wherein the church, 
    with joy, commemorates former deliverances and, by faith, depends on God for 
    future mercies.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"God is our refuge and strength,"</p></i> verse 1. The 
    saints, in all their dangers, have an asylum or garrison to retreat to; they 
    know where to put into for harbor. The name of the Lord is a strong tower, 
    and this is their refuge and royal fortress.
<p align="justify"><i>"A very present help." </i>God is a help in a pinch. 
    An army may be beaten before their auxiliary forces come—but God never comes 
    too late. His help is at hand; His forces are in the field; He is a present 
    help—a help in trouble. One renders it, <i>"in vehement trouble."</i></p>

<p align="justify">"God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved." 
    What is meant by "in the midst of her?" This looks back to the former verse 
    where there is mention made of the city of God. "There is a river, the 
    streams whereof shall make glad the city of God," verse 4. By this <i>city 
    of God </i>is meant Jerusalem, which is called the city of Jehovah, Isaiah 
    52:1. This city of Jerusalem is a figure for the church of God here upon 
    earth; and of this the text speaks, "God is in the midst of her."</p>
<p align="justify">The words consist of two parts:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The church's <i>privilege</i>—"God is in the midst of 
    her."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The church's <i>safety</i>—"she shall not be moved;" 
    that is, so as to be removed.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. When the church of God is beleaguered and 
    environed with enemies, "God is in the midst of her." </p></b>"For the Lord your 
    God walks in the midst of your camp to deliver you," Deuteronomy 23:14. "You 
    O Lord, are in the midst of us," Jeremiah 14:9. The church of God has not 
    only enemies <i>without </i>her to conflict with, but <i>within </i>
    her—hypocrites and apostates. She complains that "her own sons vex her," 
    Song of Solomon 1:6. That is, those who had been bred up in her bosom and 
    pretended religion, these false friends, vexed her. The church's enemies are 
    of her own house; but be they what they will, foreign or internal, the 
    church has One who will take her part. When she is most assaulted, she is 
    most assisted, God is in the midst of her.
<b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION</p></b>. But what privilege is this, to have God in 
    the midst of His church? Where is He not? He is an immense, infinite 
    Being—and His circumference is everywhere. "Where shall I fly from Your 
    presence? If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost 
    parts of the sea—even there shall Your hand lead me," Psalm 139:7-9. What 
    privilege is it to have God in the midst of His church, seeing He is in the 
    midst of His enemies too?
<b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER</p></b>. There is a two-fold presence of God:
<p align="justify">1. There is His <i><b>universal </b></i>presence, whereby 
    He is in all places. "Do not I fill heaven and earth, says the Lord," 
    Jeremiah 23:24. This is no privilege at all, for this universal presence is 
    with the damned. They have the presence of His <i>power </i>and <i>justice</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is a <i><b>peculiar </b></i>presence of God, and 
    that is confined to His people. The presence of God is either in heaven, 
    which is nothing else but His glorious presence. "The Lord's throne is in 
    heaven," Psalm 11:4); or on earth, and that is either:</p>
<p align="justify">(1) His <i>favorable </i>presence, whereby He manifests 
    the pledges of His grace and goodness towards His people. He is present in 
    the assemblies of His saints, breathing forth the sweet perfume of His 
    Spirit. "In all places where I record My name, I will come unto you, and I 
    will bless you," Exodus 20:24. This is that presence the saints desire in 
    the ordinances—God's quickening, sanctifying, comforting presence—the smiles 
    of His face, the kisses of His lips. Nothing is so delightful, as to behold 
    the king in the galleries, Song of Solomon 7:5, and have the banners of His 
    love sweetly displayed, Song of Solomon 2:4.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) His <i>providential </i>presence, wherein the Lord 
    appears admirably for His people in His providential actings, showing 
    Himself to be a wonder-working God. This is chiefly meant in the text, "God 
    is in the midst of her"—to defend, to deliver, to bless. Thus He was with 
    His people of Israel by the pillar of fire and a cloud, and thus will He be 
    present with His church to the end of the world.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The reasons why God is in the midst of His church to 
    defend and bless it are three:</p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">1. The dear interest He has in it.</p></i> The people of God 
    are called "peculiar people," 1 Peter 2:9. The world lies in <i>common </i>
    and is as so much waste ground—but the church is God's <i>vineyard </i>and
    <i>enclosure</i>. Therefore, He will hedge it with protection. "My vineyard 
    which is Mine, is before Me," Song of Solomon 8:1. The saints are called 
    God's <i>jewels</i>, Malachi 3:17. Therefore, He will not let them be lost. 
    For their sins, He may sometimes lay these jewels to pawn. The church is 
    Christ's <i>mystical body</i>, the least bone whereof He will as surely 
    preserve as He did every bone of His natural body. "A bone of it shall not 
    be broken," John 19:36.
<i>
<p align="justify">2. God is in the midst of His church because of the 
    entire love which He bears to it. </p></i>"The Lord has chosen Zion, He has 
    desired it for His habitation, this is My rest forever, here will I dwell, 
    for I have desired it," Psalm 132:13-15. God loves His people with the 
    choicest of His love; they have the quintessence of His love, and, to show 
    this, He calls them by those titles which denote love: "The apple of His 
    eye," Deuteronomy 32:10; "The dearly beloved of His soul," Jeremiah 12:7; 
    "His treasure," Psalm 135:4; "His dove," Psalm 74:19; "His spouse," Song of 
    Solomon 4:13; and "His glory," Isaiah 46:13.
<p align="justify">God loves the world with a more <i>common </i>love. His 
    church, however, has the <i>cream </i>of His love. It is one love with which 
    a man loves his <i>bird—</i>and another with which he loves his <i>child</i>. 
    And God cannot but love His people, because He sees His own image shining in 
    them. They are adorned with the graces of His Spirit like a chain of pearls; 
    and they have the beauty of the unspotted holiness of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">God's love to His church is vehement, like coals of 
    juniper, or the sunbeams contracted in a magnifying glass, which are more 
    intense and ardent. And, because He loves Zion, therefore He is in the midst 
    of it to defend and bless it. "The Lord your God in the midst of you is 
    mighty, He will save, He will rejoice over you, He will rest in His love," 
    Zephaniah 3:17.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">3. God will be in the midst of His people because they 
    are engaged in His cause.</p></i> "Know that for Your sake, I have suffered 
    rebuke," Jeremiah 15:15. All the oppositions the godly meet with, are for 
    standing up in the defense of truth. If they would desist from religion and 
    throw off Christ's colors, they would have none to oppose them. But, because 
    they espouse Christ's cause, and fight under the banner of His gospel, 
    therefore and all the powers of hell unite and muster their forces against 
    them. The princes of Persia had no other accusation against Daniel, but the 
    law of His God, Daniel 6:5. Now, because the church of God appears in His 
    cause, and loses blood in His quarrel, therefore God is in the midst of her. 
    He counts Himself concerned in point of honor, to stand by His people.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But wherein does it appear that God is in the 
    midst of His church?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">It appears by His preserving and delivering His church.</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. By UNTHOUGHT-OF means.</p></b></font> When <i>Israel </i>
    was hemmed in, the Red Sea before them, and Pharaoh and his host pursuing 
    behind them—God preserved them by unthought-of means. They never thought of 
    the parting of the waters. Who would have imagined that God would have made 
    a causeway in the sea? Likewise, when food failed in the wilderness, the 
    people of Israel could not devise how God would spread them a table there. 
    There was no plowing or sowing, nothing to he seen but wild beasts and 
    serpents. The Lord made the heavens a granary, and rained down bread upon 
    them; here He was in the midst of His people.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. By CONTEMPTIBLE means.</p></b></font> The blowing of 
    trumpets and the blazing of lamps made the walls of <i>Jericho </i>fall 
    down, Judges 7:20. <i>Jeremiah </i>was drawn out of the dungeon by rotten 
    rags, Jeremiah 38:12. God often saves His church by despicable instruments. 
    He makes use of rotten rags. God raised up <i>Luther </i>in Germany against 
    the Pope. The enemy looked upon him with a contemptible eye and one of them 
    said, "He was more fit to pray in a cloister than to do any great exploits 
    abroad." But God made him a rare instrument in his church. He so shook the 
    Pope's chair that never, to this day, has he sat safely in it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. By CONTRARY means.</p></b></font> That <i>Jonah </i>should 
    be saved by being swallowed up—God made the fish a ship in which he sailed 
    safe to shore. That the raven, who is so unnatural that she will hardly feed 
    her young, should bring meat to the prophet <i>Elijah</i>—this shows God is 
    in the midst of His people. How often is it seen that God makes use of a 
    contrary wind? The enemies of His church shall do His work; He will play His 
    game by their hand.
<p align="justify">Either He will make His enemies friendly to His people, 
    "The Israelites asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for 
    clothing. The Lord had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the 
    people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the 
    Egyptians." Exodus 12:35 (God makes <i>wolves </i>to suckle His <i>lambs!</i>) 
    Or He will work divisions among His enemies and turn their own weapons 
    against themselves. "The men of Ammon and Moab rose up against the men from 
    Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering 
    the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another." 2 Chronicles 20:23. 
    Thus God makes the <i>seed of the serpent </i>a means to break the <i>
    serpent's head</i>. We read in ecclesiastical history that, in the time of 
    the good emperor Theodosius, when the Persians shot their arrows against the 
    Christians, by a sudden and violent wind, their arrows were driven back and 
    flew in their own faces.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. It is evident that God is in the midst of His 
    church, by His seasonable appearing for His people.</p></b></font> When the 
    Church of God has been brought very low, nothing in view but desperation, 
    their power and their hopes gone—then God has stepped in for their relief 
    and gave the victory on the church's side. "The Lord will indeed vindicate 
    His people and have compassion on His servants when He sees that their 
    strength is gone," Deuteronomy 32:36. When Peter was sinking, then Christ 
    put forth His hand and took him into the ship. When the Church of God has 
    been in trouble, like Isaac on the altar, going to be sacrificed to the rage 
    and fury of men, then has the providence of God stepped in as the angel and 
    said, "Lay not your hand upon the child." God may let the enemy nibble at 
    the <i>heel </i>of His church—but still He defends the <i>head</i>. When 
    malice is boiled up to revenge, and the design of men is to destroy the 
    church—then the church's morning star of deliverance appears. This shows God 
    is in the midst of Zion, because, when things have seemed to be in the 
    forlorn hope and all given for lost—then God has come riding in the chariots 
    of salvation!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Here is good news for the church of God.</p></b></font> 
    God's people are apt to despond when they see things move strangely, and go 
    cross to their expectation. "God is in the midst of Zion." He has a special 
    superintendence over the affairs of His church. God has more care of His 
    church, than we can have. We read in Ezekiel's vision of a wheel within a 
    wheel, Ezekiel 1:16. God's decree is the inner wheel, which turns all the 
    outward wheels of providence. The church never lacks enemies to assault and 
    make inroads upon her—but "God is in the midst of her."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Here is a river of consolation, whose crystal 
    streams may refresh the city of God. </p></b></font>God's eye is upon His people 
    for good. "The eye of the Lord is upon those who fear Him;" and it is a 
    watchful eye, for He neither slumbers nor sleeps, Psalm 121:4.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But what privilege is this that God's eye is 
    upon His people? His eye is upon the wicked too?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. I answer, God's eye, which is upon Zion, is not 
    only an eye of <i>inspection</i>—but an eye of <i>benediction</i>. Zion has 
    not only His <i>eye</i>—but His <i>heart</i>, "For surely, O Lord, you bless 
    the <i>righteous</i>; you surround them with your favor as with a shield." 
    Psalm 5:12.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 3. If God is in the midst of Zion—then see the 
    church's beauty and strength.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The church's BEAUTY</p></b></font>—"God is in the midst of 
    her." This is her glory and beauty. "I will be the glory in the midst of 
    her," Zechariah 2:5. This is the best jewel in the church's crown. As the 
    diamond to the ring, as the sun to the world, which bespangles it with its 
    beams, so is God's presence to His church. The ark, which was the emblem and 
    sign of God's presence, was called "the glory of Israel." Why is the church 
    called a royal diadem and a crown of beauty, Isaiah 62:3? Because God casts 
    His resplendent luster upon her. "I will be the glory in the midst of her."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. See here the church's STRENGTH</p></b></font>—God is in 
    the midst of her. He is with His church not only to <i>behold </i>her—but <i>
    uphold </i>her. The church of God is like a castle walled in with rocks. 
    "His place of defense shall be the munition of rocks," Isaiah 33:16. But a 
    man may starve upon a rock. Therefore it follows, "bread shall be given him, 
    his waters shall be sure." If God is in the midst of Zion, He will be both 
    defensive and offensive. He is both a <i>shield </i>and a <i>sword</i>. 
    "Happy are you O Israel; who is like unto you, O people saved by the Lord, 
    the <i>shield </i>of your help, and who is the <i>sword </i>of your 
    excellency!" Deuteronomy 33:29. 
<p align="justify">God is a <i>golden shield </i>to His people and a <i>
    flaming sword </i>to His enemies. "For I, says the Lord, will be unto her a 
    wall of fire round about," Zechariah 2:5. A wall, that is defensive; a wall 
    of fire, that is offensive. "In that day we will sing of the pleasant 
    vineyard. I, the Lord, will watch over it and tend its fruitful vines. Each 
    day I will water them; day and night I will watch to keep enemies away." 
    Isaiah 27:2-3. They who go to overthrow the church must do it in such a time 
    when it is neither night nor day, for God has promised to keep it night and 
    day.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 4. See, then, how vain are all the attempts and plots 
    of wicked men, against the church of God.</p></b></font> God is in the midst of 
    her. When we look upon things with a human eye, we may wonder that the 
    church of God is not overrun. That the sea should be higher than the earth 
    yet not drown it, is a wonder. In like manner, that the power and force 
    which seems to be so much above the church should not overflow it, is to be 
    wondered at. But God is in the midst of her; therefore she is impregnable.
    <i>Men must first overcome God, before they can overcome the church!
</i>
<p align="justify">How simple is the wisdom of man when it sets it self 
    against God! What do men do, when they engage war against the church? They 
    attempt the impossible, since God is in the midst of her. What an infinite 
    disproportion is there between the church's enemies—and the church's God? As 
    much as between finite and infinite. Will weak man go to measure arms with 
    God? How easily can God check the pride, break the power, and confound the 
    councils of the wicked! He can destroy His enemies with the turning of an 
    hand, Psalm 82:14; with a word, Psalm 2:5; with a breath, Isaiah 30:28; with 
    a look, Exodus 14:24. It costs God no more to destroy all His adversaries, 
    than a cast of the eye. For men to contend with the great God, is as if a 
    child should go to fight with a giant or archangel; or as if the thorns 
    should set themselves in battle against the fire! Oh, how vain and silly are 
    all attempts against the church! God is in the midst of her. "On that day I 
    will make Jerusalem a heavy stone, a burden for the world." Zechariah 12:3. 
    The enemies are heaving at the church to remove it—but it is a heavy stone 
    which will fall upon them and grind them in pieces. "I will make the 
    governors of Judah like a torch of fire in a sheaf," Zechariah 12:6. The 
    grand opposers of Zion shall be as combustible matter, and the church as a 
    torch of fire to burn them up.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 5. If God is in the midst of Zion—then it follows 
    that all providences towards the church shall be for the best.</p></b></font> 
    There is nothing which stirs in the world, but shall carry on God's designs, 
    like the <i>cross wheels </i>in a watch carry on the motion of it and serve 
    to make the alarm strike. That which the wicked intend for <i>destruction</i>, 
    shall turn to the <i>deliverance </i>of the church. As Luther wrote to the 
    Elector of Saxony, "Let your Highness know, that the affairs of the church 
    are ordered in heaven—and not by the Emperor." While the adversaries go 
    about to <i>ruin </i>the church, they shall only <i>repair </i>it. God is in 
    the midst of His people; therefore, the most violent storms of persecution 
    are but as the beating of the wind against the sails, which make the ship go 
    faster and bring it sooner to its desired haven!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 6. Let us labor that—as God is in the midst of His 
    church, so He may be in the midst of our hearts.</p></b></font> It is little 
    comfort to hear that God is in the midst of his church unless we find Him in 
    the midst of our hearts. A drowning man seeing a rainbow said, "What am I 
    the better, that the <i>world </i>shall not be drowned—if <i>I</i> drown?" 
    So how are we the better that God is in the midst of His church by His 
    providential presence—if He is not in the midst of our hearts by His 
    sanctifying presence? It should be our care not only to have Christ <i>with
    </i>us—but <i>in </i>us. "Christ in you, the hope of glory," Colossians 
    1:27. This will be a cordial when we are dying. It doesn't matter if death 
    is in our body—if Christ is in our heart! This should be our wisdom and 
    ambition, not only to have the presence of God with within the church—but 
    the Spirit of God in us. "God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your 
    hearts," Galatians 4:6.
<p align="justify">If God is in the midst of His church to uphold and 
    preserve it, then let not God's people give way to distrust and despondency. 
    Let them not fear the enemies of the church. "God is our refuge and 
    strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, 
    though the earth gives way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 
    though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging." 
    Psalms 46:1-3. If we should be in new straits and difficulties, let us not 
    say that we shall be undone. <i>God will set all His attributes to work for 
    His people! </i>His <i>wisdom </i>shall be theirs—to guide them, His <i>
    power </i>shall be theirs—to defend them, His <i>holiness </i>shall be 
    theirs—to sanctify them, His <i>mercy </i>shall be theirs—to save them. To 
    fear the creature is to undervalue God.</p>
<p align="justify">When Antigonus overheard his soldiers saying how 
    formidable their enemies were, he stepped in suddenly with these words, "And 
    how many do you reckon for me?" This word, God is in the midst of her, 
    should beat down unbelief and put to flight a whole army of fears that are 
    apt to arise in the heart! It is high ingratitude either to murmur or 
    distrust, after so many signal mercies and preservations as we have 
    received.</p>
<p align="justify">But because the hearts of God's own people are ready to 
    be overpowered with a spirit of fear, I shall, therefore, prescribe these<font color="#ff0000"><b> 
    five antidotes against fear</b></font>:</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. God will have a church upon earth.</p></b></font> "I will 
    build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it," 
    Matthew 16:18. Neither the serpent's subtlety, nor the dragon's fierceness, 
    shall overturn the church! The ship in the gospel was tossed because sin was 
    in it—but not overwhelmed because Christ was in it. Be of good 
    comfort—Christ is in the ship! "The angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of 
    fire out of the midst of the bush, and the bush burned and was not 
    consumed," Exodus 3:2. This is an emblem of the church on earth—this bush 
    burns, but is not consumed—for God is in the midst of her. The church of God 
    may be <i>oppressed </i>but not totally <i>suppressed</i>. Cain put the 
    knife to Abel's throat, and ever since the church's veins have bled—but she 
    is not so weak that she cannot stand upon her legs. The church cannot be 
    extinguished!
<p align="justify">Nevertheless, the church of God may suffer in several 
    parts of it. For as by virtue of the covenant made with Noah, the whole 
    earth shall never be drowned with a deluge; yet there may, and have been 
    such inundations since, that several parts of the earth have been swallowed 
    up with water. So the church universal cannot be extinct—yet it may suffer 
    in some parts and branches of it, as the seven Asian churches had their 
    golden candlesticks removed.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The suffering of any particular church is for their 
    good.</p></b></font> "I have sent them into captivity for their own good. I will 
    see that they are well treated, and I will bring them back here again. I 
    will build them up and not tear them down. I will plant them and not uproot 
    them." Jeremiah 24:6. God makes use of the wicked for the good of His 
    church. He sometimes allows His people to be cast out into the open field 
    and lets the wicked pour the <i>water of affliction </i>upon them—but He is 
    all this while purifying his people. "Many shall be tried and made white," 
    Daniel 12:10. The wicked are <i>flails </i>to thrash off the husks of His 
    people. They are <i>files </i>to brighten their graces. They are <i>leeches
    </i>to suck out their bad blood. Cicero makes mention of Phereus, whom his 
    enemy, piercing him with a sword, accidentally opened his abscess and so 
    cured him! The enemies of the church only cure the abscess of pride!
<p align="justify">God's <i>fire </i>is in Zion, Isaiah 31:9. This fire is 
    not <i>consuming—</i>but <i>refining</i>. The church is God's house; the 
    enemies try to break down the walls of this house—but they shall only purge 
    the floor. They try to <i>crucify</i>—but they shall only <i>clarify </i>
    God's church and remove her rough edges. Thus God turns all the <i>
    sufferings </i>of His people to their good. He <i>stretches </i>the strings 
    of His violin to make the music better.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The more God's church is opposed—the more it 
    increases.</p></b></font> It revives by opposition. "The more they afflicted 
    them—the more they multiplied," Exodus 1:12. Witness the effect of the 
    persecutions in the time of Nero, Diocletian, and Trajan.
<i>
<p align="justify">Showers </p></i>have always made the church grow more. The 
    more the torch is beaten, the more it flames. Julian the Apostate, 
    therefore, forbid to persecute the Christians, not out of pity—but envy, 
    because they grew so fast under persecution. Religion has always revived and 
    flourished in the <i>ashes </i>of holy men. The church of God is a palm-tree 
    with this motto, "The more weight is laid upon it, the higher it rises."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. When the church of God is lowest, mercy is nearest.</p></b></font> 
    The sorer the pangs, the nearer the deliverance. "The earth mourns, Lebanon 
    is ashamed, Sharon is like a wilderness. Now will I rise, says the Lord, now 
    will I lift up myself," Isaiah 33:9-10. If you go to the ocean, you will 
    observe that when the ebb is at the lowest—that high tide is ready to come 
    in. Just so, when the church of God seems to be at a dead, low water—the 
    tide of deliverance is nearest. When Diocletian raged and things seemed 
    desperate for the church, soon after was the golden time of Constantine. It 
    is usually <i>darkest—</i>a little before <i>morning</i>.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Though the church of God may seem sometimes to be in 
    the wain—yet, when she loses ground in one place, she gains in another. </p></b>
</font>When the fire is quenched at one end of the house, it breaks out at 
    the other. At Rome, there were two laurel trees; when one withered, the 
    other flourished. This is an emblem of the church—when it seems to wither in 
    one place, it shall revive and flourish in another. All this may comfort us 
    concerning the church of God, and may be as medicine to kill the <i>worm of 
    unbelief and fear </i>in our hearts. God is in the midst of her; therefore, 
    will we not fear though the earth be moved. If God is in the midst of His 
    church, let us do two things:
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">First, If God is in the midst of His church—let us take 
    heed of driving God from us.</p></b></font> There are ways whereby we may drive 
    God from the nation. When bees are in the hive and bring their honey, you 
    may drive them out with smoke. So sin is a smoke which will drive God out 
    from a people. "A people which provokes Me to anger, these are a smoke in My 
    nose," Isaiah 65:3, 5. In particular, there are<b> nine sins which drive God 
    out of a land</b>—when He marches out, judgment marches in.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Idolatry. </p></b></font>"For they served idols, whereof 
    the Lord had said unto them, you shall not do this thing, therefore the Lord 
    was angry with Israel, and removed them out of His sight!" 2 Kings 17:12, 
    18. Idolatry is a sin which breaks the marriage knot—and makes the Lord 
    disclaim His interest in a people. "<i>Your </i>people have corrupted 
    themselves," Exodus 32:7. Before God called Israel His people—but once they 
    had defiled themselves with idolatry, then God disclaimed them. He does not 
    say to Moses, "<i>My </i>people"—but "<i>your </i>people", as if He had 
    quite discarded them and cut off His mercy. Take heed of idolatry, yes, and 
    of <i>superstition </i>too, which is a bridge leading over to it. 
    Superstition is an intermixing of our thoughts and inventions with divine 
    institutions; it is an affront offered to God, as if He were not wise enough 
    to appoint the manner of His own worship.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Cruelty and oppression. </p></b></font>"I have forsaken my 
    house, my heritage is to me as a speckled bird," Jeremiah 12:7-8, or as a 
    bird of prey. When God's <i>dove </i>becomes a <i>vulture</i>, and is given 
    to oppression and cruelty, staining her feathers with blood—God will then 
    break up house and be gone.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Immorality. </p></b></font>"They are all adulterers, 
    burning like an oven," Hosea 7:4. They who should have been temples of the 
    Holy Spirit—are hot ovens burning in lust! "I will spread my net upon them," 
    verse 12. That is, I will spread the net of My judgments over them, and they 
    shall be taken in the net!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Covetousness. </p></b></font>"I will stretch out My hand 
    upon the inhabitants of the land, for from the least of them, even to the 
    greatest, everyone of them is given to covetousness," Jeremiah 6:12. When 
    men shall<i> reek of the earth—</i>when they love the <i>theater </i>better 
    than the <i>Temple</i>, and are more for the earthly mammon than the 
    heavenly manna—then God will take His leave and be gone! God is a Spirit, 
    and He can no more converse with an earthly people, than a prince can 
    converse with a swine!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Apostasy.</p></b></font> "They are all hardened rebels. 
    They are called <i>rejected silver</i>, for the Lord has rejected them." 
    Jeremiah 6:28. This made God remove His golden candlestick from the church 
    of Ephesus—because she had left her first love, Revelation 2:4. And if 
    apostasy will make God depart from a people, then how can we expect He 
    should stay long with us? Where is that zeal for God and love to the truth 
    as before? We live in the <i>fall </i>of the leaf. There are many who 
    courted the Queen of Religion when she had a jewel hung on her ear—but when 
    she is in her night dress and her jewels are pulled off, now they desert 
    her. Lot's wife was turned into a <i>pillar of salt </i>for looking back. If 
    all who look back should have this judgment inflicted upon them, we would 
    see <i>pillars of salt </i>filling our streets!
<p align="justify">Merchants tell us of shipwrecks at sea. I believe there 
    have been of late more shipwrecks at land—than at sea. I mean, such as have 
    made shipwreck of faith and a good conscience. The <i>golden head </i>is 
    degenerated into <i>iron</i>—a more filthy and impure metal.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Weariness of God's ordinances. </p></b></font>"When will 
    the New Moon be over so we may sell grain, and the Sabbath, so we may market 
    wheat?" Amos 8:5. Verse 11, "<i>The time is surely coming</i>, says the 
    Sovereign Lord; <i>when I will send a famine on the land—not a famine of 
    bread or water but of hearing the words of the Lord</i>." 
<p align="justify">God has fed this nation with the finest of the wheat, 
    even the bread of life. We have had the cream of ordinances. God has come 
    down to us in a golden shower of blessings. The vintage of other nations has 
    not been as good as the gleanings of England—but have not we said, "what a 
    weariness it is!" Malachi 1:13. Is not our sin, sermon excess? Though we 
    have liked the <i>dressing</i>, we have loathed the <i>food</i>. We have 
    said, "Who is this Moses? And what is this manna?" And may not we fear that 
    God is now coming to punish us for this sin? When we have lost our appetite 
    for God's Word—God may cause the Word to be taken away; and would not that 
    be dismal? How sad is it for any nation when their seers are blind! In what 
    a condition is that people who have <i>husks </i>given to them, instead of 
    manna, and <i>music </i>instead of food! Weariness of the gospel, forfeits 
    the gospel. If God sees that <i>sanctuary blessings </i>are not prized, He 
    will remove them.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Perjury. </p></b></font>"They have broken the covenant I 
    made with their ancestors. Therefore, says the Lord, I am going to bring 
    calamity upon them, and they will not escape. Though they beg for mercy, I 
    will not listen to their cries!" Jeremiah 11:10. When a people play fast and 
    loose with God, breaking their solemn vows and covenants, this is a 
    God-provoking sin. It will make the Lord go away from a nation and, though 
    they cry after Him, He will turn a deaf ear. God will pass by <i>infirmity</i>—but 
    He will punish <i>treachery</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Hatred of reformation. </p></b></font>When God calls to a 
    people by His Word, Spirit, and judgments—but they regard Him not, He will 
    pack up and be gone. "While you were doing these wicked things, says the 
    Lord, I spoke to you about it repeatedly, but you would not listen. I called 
    out to you, but you refused to answer. So just as I destroyed <i>Shiloh</i>, 
    I will now destroy this Temple that was built to honor my name, this Temple 
    that you trust for help, this place that I gave to you and your ancestors. 
    And I will send you into exile." Jeremiah 7:13-15. Why, what did God to 
    Shiloh? There the priests were slain, the ark was carried away captive, all 
    the signs of God's presence were removed, the vision ceased—and we never 
    read that the ark returned to Shiloh anymore. Has not God called us to be a 
    holy people? But are there not many found among us, who hate holiness and 
    cry down reformation? Oh, take heed that God does not do to us as He did to 
    Shiloh—unpeople us, unchurch us, and send a flying scroll of curses against 
    us!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. Unkindness to those who labor in the Word and 
    doctrine. </p></b></font>God will avenge the wrongs done to His ambassadors. 
    "The Lord repeatedly sent his prophets to warn them, for he had compassion 
    on his people and his Temple. But the people mocked these messengers of God 
    and despised their words. They scoffed at the prophets until the Lord's 
    anger could no longer be restrained and there was no remedy!" 2 Chronicles 
    36:16-17.
<p align="justify">Let us take heed of these sins which will cause God to 
    depart from the nation.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, if God is in the midst of His church—let us do 
    what we can to KEEP God among us.</p></b></font> Israel endeavored to keep the 
    ark among them, which was the sign of God's presence. "Woe to them—when I 
    depart from them!" Hosea 9:12. If God is gone—then all other blessings go 
    too; peace and prosperity will be gone. Oh, let us strive to keep God among 
    us! What is the glory of a nation—but the presence of God in His Word and 
    ordinances? I will be the glory in the midst of her, Zechariah 2:5. If God 
    is gone, England will be like a house that has its furniture removed, and is 
    falling to ruin. "Hyenas will howl in its fortresses, and jackals will make 
    their dens in its palaces!" Isaiah 13:31.<i> If God is gone—Satan will be 
    the next tenant!
</i><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What shall we do to keep God among us?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. By prayer. </p></b></font>"We are called by Your 
    name, leave us not," Jeremiah 24:9. Exercise <i>eyes of faith </i>and <i>
    knees of prayer!</i> Let us hang upon God by holy importunity, and not let 
    Him go. "They constrained Him, saying, abide with us for it is towards 
    evening," Luke 24:29. Is not God upon the <i>threshold </i>of His temple—and 
    ready to flee? Are not the <i>shadows of the evening </i>stretched out? And 
    may we not fear the sun-setting of the gospel? Oh, let us, by humble prayer, 
    lie at Christ's feet and constrain Him to stay with us! Prayer makes a sweet 
    sound in God's ears, and He will not go away where there is that music.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. By setting upon the work of reformation.</p></b></font> 
    "Amend your ways and your doings!" Jeremiah 7:3. There is a profane people 
    in the land who drink, roar, and declare their sin as Sodom. These <i>
    Samsons </i>are likely to pull down the house upon our heads. Instead of 
    bringing the <i>water of tears </i>to quench God's anger—they add fuel to 
    the fire! The men of Lystra, seeing the miracle wrought by Paul and 
    Barnabas, cried out, "The <i>god's </i>have come down to us in the likeness 
    of men," Acts 14:11. But we may now say that the <i>devils </i>are have come 
    up to us in the likeness of men! Never was there such a spirit of wickedness 
    in the land; never were there such heaven-daring abominations committed!
<p align="justify">But, "though <i>Israel </i>plays the harlot—yet let not
    <i>Judah </i>offend," Hosea 4:15. Though others are licentious and worldly 
    (being carried to hell with wind and tide), yet let us keep our garments 
    pure and preserve the virginity of our consciences. Let us labor to reform 
    ourselves, and mourn for what we cannot reform in others. Let us walk holily 
    and uprightly, Ephesians 5:15. Let us shine forth in a kind of angelic 
    brightness, that we may not only <i>profess </i>the gospel—but <i>beautify
    </i>it. Were we such a holy people, we might keep God still in the midst of 
    us; and, as a pledge of His favorable presence, He would bestow His Gospel, 
    that crowning blessing, both upon us and our posterity.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But is not the decree past? Are there any hopes 
    that God will be still in the midst of England?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. There is hope in Israel concerning this. I would 
    encourage God's people, and speak something that might be as the cork to the 
    net—to keep their hearts from sinking. I confess that, when I look upon the
    <i>dark </i>side of the cloud, it fills me with trembling and astonishment. 
    The sins and divisions of the nation are grey hairs upon us; it is ominous 
    when the joints of the same body begin to smite one another.</p>
<p align="justify">But though we have many symptoms of a dying patient—yet 
    there are <font color="#0000ff"><b>six seeds of hope left, that God will 
    still abide in the midst of England</b></font>.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. One seed of hope, is that there is a generation of 
    righteous people in the nation.</p></b></font> God would have spared Sodom if 
    there had been <i>ten </i>righteous people in it. It is to be hoped there 
    are many tens in England. "But I will not destroy them all," says the Lord. 
    For just as good grapes are found among a cluster of bad ones (and someone 
    will say, 'Don't throw them all away—there are some good grapes there!'), so 
    I will not destroy all Israel. For I still have true servants there." Isaiah 
    65:8. Though the vine in England is so blasted that the Lord might cut it 
    down—yet there are some good clusters, and for these, God may spare the vine 
    and say, "so I will not destroy all Israel. For I still have true servants 
    there." 
<p align="justify">Were the godly gone, the Lord would make quick work of 
    the nation. He would destroy the <i>weeds, </i>were it not for the <i>corn</i>. 
    The ship of would soon be drowned—if the elect were not in it. The saints <i>
    halt </i>God's hand, when He is going to strike. "Hurry up! Run there, for I 
    cannot do anything until you get there" Genesis 19:22. The saints are the 
    excellent of the earth, Psalm 16:3; precious and honorable, Isaiah 43:4. 
    And, for their sakes, God may yet he entreated to be propitious to us.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Another seed of hope, is that the Lord keeps up a 
    spirit of prayer among His people. </p></b></font>The Spartans' wall of defense 
    was their <i>spears</i>. The wall and bulwark of a nation is <i>prayer</i>. 
    As there are crying sins in the land—so there are crying prayers. Whole 
    volleys of sighs and groans are daily sent up to heaven. When the Lord 
    intends to pour out the vial of His indignation, He stops all the sluices of 
    prayer. "Pray <i>not </i>for this people!" Jeremiah 7:16. God has not said 
    this yet. Prayer is a powerful orator for mercy—it comes as with orders to 
    heaven. "You give me orders about the work of my hands," Isaiah 45:11.
<p align="justify">Prayer staves off wrath from a land. "Leave me alone so 
    that My anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them!" Exodus 
    32:10. Why, what did Moses do? He only prayed.<i> Prayer overcomes the 
    Almighty! </i>It finds God free—but leaves Him bound. This gives some 
    crevice of hope that God will not wholly leave us. There are those who cry 
    day and night, "Spare Your people, O Lord, and give not Your heritage to 
    reproach," Joel 2:17. When prayer leads the van, deliverance brings up the 
    rear! "You will prepare their heart, You will cause Your ear to hear," Psalm 
    10:17.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Another seed of hope, is the tender respect God has to 
    His</p>
<p align="justify">own glory.</p></b></font> This was Joshua's argument. "What 
    then will you do for your own great name?" Joshua 7:9. If the people of God 
    would be extinct and the cause of true religion trampled under foot—this 
    would reflect upon the glory of God, and His name would suffer. The wicked 
    seldom prevail—but they blaspheme. They say, "Where is your God?" Now God's 
    glory is dear to Him—it is the most orient pearl of His crown. He will stand 
    upon His honor. While He consults His people's safety—He promotes His own 
    glory. "Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake," Psalm 106:8.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Another seed of hope, is the blessed intercession of 
    Christ.</p></b></font> The Lord Jesus bears the names of His people upon His 
    breast and sets them as a golden signet upon His heart. His prayers go up to 
    heaven as sweet odors. "The smoke of incense ascended up before God, out of 
    the angel's hand," Revelation 8:4. Though our sins go up to heaven as the 
    smoke of a <i>furnace</i>—yet Christ's prayers go up as <i>incense</i>. 
    Christ's intercession is meritorious. His blood will never stop crying 
    out—until the blood of His enemies is shed.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A fifth seed of hope, is the mercy of God.</p></b></font> 
    "In His love and in His pity He redeemed them," Isaiah 63:9. "God is the 
    Father of mercies," 2 Corinthians 1:3. Mercy naturally issues from Him. He 
    is <i>rich </i>in mercy, Ephesians 2:4. He <i>delights </i>in mercy, Micah 
    7:18. God's justice is <i>strange </i>work, Isaiah 28:21. Mercy is His <i>
    proper </i>work. Why may not mercy give the casting vote? And that which may 
    make us hope in this mercy is:
<p align="justify">The mercy of God is <b>free</b>. "I will love them 
    freely," Hosea 14:4. Mercy lends out its pardons to whom it will. Mercy does 
    not go by <i>desert—</i>but by grace. "I will love them freely."</p>
<p align="justify">The mercy of God is <b>healing</b>. "I will heal their 
    backslidings," Hosea 14:4. Mercy can heal the impurity and stubbornness of a 
    people; mercy can as well give repentance as deliverance. Mercy can destroy 
    the sins of a nation, and save the nation. It can burn up the chaff and save 
    the corn. "I will heal their backslidings." Mercy can stop the bloody issue 
    of sin. Psalm 48:20. The Roman historian Pliny said, "The aqueducts of Rome 
    are the world's wonder"—but, behold, here is a sacred aqueduct of God's 
    mercy. This is a sweet wonder! Mercy can overcome a sinful people; it can 
    save a nation in its critical year. We read that the fire of the Lord fell 
    and licked up the water, I Kings 18:38. Thus, the fire of God's mercy can 
    lick up and devour the water of our sins.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. The last seed of hope for England, is that there have 
    been many sins committed in the nation, which are not the sins of the nation 
    itself.</p></b></font> Some have perjured themselves—but all have not. A sober 
    and considerable party in the land (however slandered) have entered their 
    dissent and openly protested against the scandalous actings of others. So 
    that it is to be hoped the Lord will not impute the sin of some—to the 
    whole. 
<p align="justify">Thus I have showed you a <i>rainbow in the cloud</i>, and 
    given you some probable grounds of hope, that the Lord will still be in the 
    midst of England. I intend this as a preservative against despondency, not 
    as fuel for security.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But how is it <i>possible </i>there should be 
    any good towards us—that the sins in which the nation have been so steeped 
    and boiled, should be forgiven? That our divisions and animosities should be 
    healed, God's ordinances refined, and the Lord continue His gracious 
    presence in the midst of us?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. I say with our blessed Savior, "The things which 
    are impossible with men are possible with God," Luke 18:27. God can 
    create—what can He not do? God can bring about those things which, in the 
    eye of sense, are not feasible. That iron should swim, and that a rock 
    should be a spring—is in nature impossible. But God <i>has </i>brought these 
    things to pass. Cannot God untie those knots which confound and puzzle us? 
    "All this may seem impossible to you now, a small and discouraged remnant of 
    God's people. But do you think this is impossible for me, the Lord 
    Almighty?" Zechariah 8:6.</p>
<p align="justify">Can difficulties oppose the Almighty? "Is anything too 
    hard for Me?" Jeremiah 32:27. Did not He make the dry bones live? Ezekiel 
    37:7-8. God can bring light out of darkness, and harmony out of confusion. 
    He can do more than we <i>think—</i>or else He would not be God.</p>
<p align="justify">How apt are God's own people to be discouraged with 
    seeming impossibilities? Moses, who was one of the brightest stars that ever 
    shined in the churches' orb—yet was ready to hesitate and sink at apparent 
    impossibilities. "But Moses said, "There are 600,000 foot soldiers here with 
    me, and yet you promise them meat for a whole month! Even if we butchered 
    all our flocks and herds, would that satisfy them? Even if we caught all the 
    fish in the sea, would that be enough?" Numbers 11:21-22. As Moses had said 
    in plain English, he did not see how such a numerous people could be fed for 
    a month. God gave him a kind of check for his infidelity. "Is the Lord's arm 
    too short?" verse 23. "Is there any limit to my power? Do I make mouths and 
    not meat? Cannot I make provision for My household? Is the Lord's arm too 
    short? That God who brought Isaac out of a dead womb, and the Messiah out of 
    a virgin's womb—what can He not do?"</p>
<p align="justify">When things act ever so irregularly, God can put them in 
    joint again. When His church is so low that she seems to be in the grave and 
    have a tomb-stone laid upon her, He can, in an instant, cause a glorious 
    resurrection! Therefore, let us not lose heart—but still rest on the arm of 
    God's power and sovereignty, remembering there are no desperate cases with 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">To conclude all, the Lord may let His church be awhile 
    under trials to punish her carnal security and awaken her slumbering fits; 
    yet, surely the storm will not continue long. The church shall not die in 
    travail—but God will manifest that He is in the midst of Zion, and after the 
    church has suffered awhile (as her head Christ has done) He will cause the 
    morning star of her salvation to appear, and she shall come out of all her 
    troubles, as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with 
    gold.</p>
