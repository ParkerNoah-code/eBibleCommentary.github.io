<p align="center"><font size="4">1. The Death of the Righteous</font></p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain!" 
    Philippians 1:21</p>
<p align="justify">Paul was a great admirer of Christ. He desired to know 
    nothing but Christ, and him crucified. 1 Cor 2:2. There is no medicine like 
    the blood of Christ!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. "For to me, to live is Christ."</p></b></font> That is, 
    "Christ is my life!" Or thus, "My life is made up of Christ." As a wicked 
    man's life is made up of sin, so Paul's life was made up of Christ—he was 
    full of Christ. That I may give you the sense of the text more fully, take 
    it in these three particulars:
<p align="justify">[1] "For to me, to live is Christ," that is—<font color="#008000"><b>Christ 
    is the PRINCIPLE of my life. </b></font>I fetch my spiritual life from 
    Christ, as the branch fetches its sap from the root. "Christ lives in me." 
    Gal 2:20. Jesus Christ sends forth life and spirits into me, to quicken me 
    to every holy action. Thus, for to me to live is Christ: Christ is the 
    principle of my life; from his fullness I live—as the branch lives from the 
    root.</p>
<p align="justify">[2] "For to me, to live is Christ," that is—<font color="#008000"><b>Christ 
    is the END of my life.</b></font> I live not for myself—but for Christ. All 
    my living, is to do service to Christ. "Whether we live, we live unto the 
    Lord." Rom 14:8. We lay out ourselves wholly for Christ. We propagate his 
    gospel; the design of our life is to exalt Christ, and to make the crown 
    upon his head flourish. It may then be said, for to us to live is 
    Christ—when our whole life is a living for Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">[3] "For to me, to live is Christ," that is—<font color="#008000"><b>Christ 
    is the JOY of my life. </b></font>Psalm 43:4, "God my exceeding joy," or the 
    cream of my joy. A Christian rejoices in Christ's righteousness. He can 
    rejoice in Christ when worldly joys are gone. When the <i>tulip </i>in a 
    garden withers--a man still rejoices in his <i>jewels </i>which are locked 
    up in the house. Just so--when <i>worldly joys </i>are gone--a saint can 
    rejoice in Christ, the pearl of great price. In this sense, Christ is the 
    joy of my life. If Christ were gone--my life would be a death to me.</p>
<p align="justify">It should exhort us all to labor to say as the apostle, 
    "For to me, to live is Christ!" Christ is the <i>principle </i>of my life, 
    the <i>end </i>of my life, the <i>joy </i>of my life. If we can say, "For to 
    me, to live is Christ," we may comfortably conclude, "and to die is gain!"
    </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. "And to die is gain!"</p></b></font> To a believer death 
    is great gain. A saint can count what his losses for Christ are here—but he 
    cannot count how great his gains are at death. "To me to die is gain." Death 
    to a believer is the daybreak of eternal brightness. To show fully what a 
    believer's gains are at death, would be a task too great for an angel; all 
    hyperboles fall short of it; the reward of glory exceeds our imagination. 
    Let me give you some dark views and imperfect lineaments only, of that 
    infinite glory the saints shall gain at the hour of death. "To me to die is 
    gain."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Believers at death, shall bid an eternal farewell to 
    all sins and troubles.</p></b></font> They shall be in a state of impeccability. 
    Sin expires with their life. I think sometimes what a happy state that will 
    be, never to have another sinful thought, and to have a quietus from all 
    troubles. Here David cried out, "My life is spent with griefs, and my years 
    with sighing." "Long life is merely long torment," Augustine. Life begins 
    with a cry, and ends with a groan; but at death all troubles die.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Believers at death, shall gain the glorious sight of 
    God.</p></b></font> They shall see him:
<p align="justify">(1.) Intellectually with the eyes of their mind, which 
    divines call the beatific vision. If there were not such an intellectual 
    sight of God, how do the spirits of just men, made perfect, see him?</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They shall behold the glorified body of Jesus 
    Christ; and if it be pleasant to behold the sun, how blessed a sight will it 
    be to see Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, clothed with our human nature, 
    shining in glory above the angels! Through Christ's flesh, as through a 
    transparent glass, some bright rays and beams of the Godhead shall display 
    themselves to glorified eyes. The sight of God through Christ will be very 
    delightful; for the terror of God's essence will be taken away; his majesty 
    will be mixed with beauty, and sweetened with mercy. It will be infinitely 
    delightful to the saints to see the amiable aspects and smiles of God's 
    face.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] The saints at death shall not only have a sight of 
    God—but shall enjoy his love. </p></b></font>There shall be no more a veil on 
    God's face, nor shall his smiles be chequered with frowns—but his love shall 
    discover itself in all its orient beauty and fragrant sweetness. Here on 
    earth, the saints pray for his love, and they have a few drops; but there 
    they shall have as much as their vessels can receive. To know the love that 
    passes knowledge, will cause a jubilation of spirit, and create such holy 
    raptures of joy in the saints, as are superlative, and would soon overwhelm 
    them, if God did not make them able to bear it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Believers at death shall gain a celestial palace, a 
    house not made with hands.</p></b></font> 2 Cor 5:5: Here on earth, the saints 
    are straitened for room; they have but poor cottages to live in; but they 
    shall have a royal palace to live in hereafter. Here is their <i>sojourning
    </i>house; there in heaven is their mansion-house, a house built high above 
    all the visible orbs, bespangled with light, and enriched with pearls and 
    precious stones. Col 1:12, and Rev 21:19. It is not their <i>landlord's </i>
    house—but their <i>Father's </i>house, and stands upon consecrated ground. 
    John 14:2. It is represented by transparent glass, to show its holiness. Rev 
    21:21.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] Believers at death shall gain the sweet society of 
    glorified saints and angels</p></b></font>; which will add to the felicity of 
    heaven, as every star adds some luster to the sky. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) The society of the glorified saints. </p></b></font>We 
    shall see them in their souls, as well as in their bodies. Their bodies will 
    be so clear and bright, that we shall see their souls shining through them, 
    as wine through the glass. Believers at death will have close converse with 
    glorified saints. How delightful will it be, to be freed from all the sinful 
    corruptions, pride, envy, passion and censoriousness, which as scars 
    disfigured them here! In heaven there will be perfect love among the saints; 
    as the olive and myrtle, they will sweetly embrace each other. If in the 
    transfiguration Peter knew Moses and Elijah, whom he never saw before, Matt 
    17:3, much more, in the glorified state, will saints perfectly know one 
    another, though they never saw each other before. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The saints at death will behold the angels</p></b></font> 
    with the glorified eye of their understandings. The wings of the cherubim 
    (representing the angels) were made of fine gold, to denote both their 
    sanctity and splendor. Angels are compared to lightning, Matt 28:3, because 
    of those sparkling beams of majesty, which as lightning shoot from them. 
    When saints and angels meet and sing together in concert in the heavenly 
    choir, what divine harmony, what joyful triumphs will there be!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] Believers at death shall gain perfection of holiness.</p></b></font> 
    Here on earth, grace is but "in its cradle," very imperfect; so that we 
    cannot write a copy of holiness without blotting. Here on earth, believers 
    receive but "the first fruits of the Spirit." At death the saints will 
    arrive at perfection; their knowledge will be clear; their sanctity perfect; 
    their sun will be in its full meridian splendor. They need not then pray for 
    increase of grace; for they shall love God as much as they would love him, 
    and as much as he desires to have them love him. They shall be in respect of 
    holiness as the angels of God.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[7] At death, the saints will gain a royal magnificent 
    feast.</p></b></font> I told you before what a glorious palace they shall have; 
    but a man may starve in a house, if there is no cheer. The royal banquet 
    which saints have at death is shadowed out in Scripture by a 
    marriage-supper. Rev 19:9. Bullinger and Gregory the Great understand by the 
    marriage-supper of the Lamb, the stately, magnificent festival the saints 
    will have in heaven, when they shall feed on the tree of life. Rev 22:2. 
    They shall have the heavenly nectar and ambrosia, "the spiced wine, and the 
    juice of the pomegranate." Cant 8:2. This royal supper of the Lamb will not 
    only satisfy hunger—but prevent it. "They shall hunger no more." Rev 7:16. 
    Nor can there be any surfeit at this feast, because a fresh course will be 
    continually served. New and fresh delights will spring from God; therefore 
    the tree of life in paradise is said to bear twelve sorts of fruit. Rev 
    22:2.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[8] Believers at death shall gain honor and dignity; they 
    shall reign as kings. </p></b></font>We read therefore of the ensigns of their 
    royalty, their white robes and celestial crowns. Rev 4:4. We read that the 
    doors of the holy of holies were made of palm-trees and open flowers, 
    covered with gold. This is an emblem of the victory and triumph, and the golden 
    garland of honor with which God invests the glorified saints. When all 
    worldly honor shall lie in the dust—then shall the saints' honor remains; 
    not one jewel shall be plucked out of their crown. At death they shall gain 
    a blessed eternity. If the saints could have the least suspicion or fear of 
    losing their glory, it would much cool and embitter their joy; but their 
    crown fades not away. I Pet 5:4. As the wicked have a worm which never dies, 
    so the elect have an unfading crown of glory. 'Forever' is a short word—but 
    it has no end. "At the last our joy shall be never-ending," Bernard. "The 
    things which are not seen are eternal." 2 Cor 4:18. "At your right hand are 
    pleasures for evermore." Psalm 16:2. Who can span eternity? Millions of ages 
    stand but for ciphers in eternity. <i>Forever in Christ's bosom is the 
    highest strain of the saint's glory!
</i>
<p align="justify">How do the saints come to have all this gain?</p>
<p align="justify">They have a right to all this gain at death upon several 
    accounts, as by virtue of the <i>Father's </i>donation, the <i>Son's </i>
    purchase, the <i>Holy Spirit's </i>pledge, and <i>faith's </i>acceptance. 
    Therefore the state of future glory is called the saint's proper 
    inheritance. They are heirs of God and have a right to inherit. "Always 
    thanking the Father, who has enabled you to share the inheritance that 
    belongs to God's holy people, who live in the light. For he has rescued us 
    from the one who rules in the kingdom of darkness, and he has brought us 
    into the Kingdom of his dear Son." Colossians 1:12-13 </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: See the great difference between the death of 
    the godly and the wicked. </p></b></font>The godly are great gainers at 
    death—but the <b>wicked </b>are great losers at death. They lose four 
    things:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) They lose the WORLD</p></b></font>; and that is a great 
    loss to the wicked. They laid up their treasure upon earth, and to be turned 
    out of it all at once is a great loss.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) They lose their SOULS.</p></b></font> Matt 16:26, 27. 
    The soul was at first a noble piece of coin, upon which God stamped his own 
    image. This celestial spark is more precious than the whole globe of the 
    world; but the sinner's soul is lost: not that the souls of the wicked are
    <i>annihilated </i>at death—but tormented.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) They lose HEAVEN.</p></b></font> Heaven is the royal 
    seat of the blessed; it is the region of happiness, the map of perfection. 
    There is the manna which is angels' food; there is the garden of spices, the 
    bed of perfumes, the river of pleasure. Sinners at death, lose all these.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) They lose all HOPE.</p></b></font> Though they lived 
    wickedly, they hoped God would be merciful, and they hoped they would go to 
    heaven. Their hope was not an anchor—but a spider's web. At death they lose 
    their hopes, and see they did but flatter themselves into hell. "Such is the 
    destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless. What he 
    trusts in is fragile; what he relies on is a spider's web." Job 8:13-14. It 
    is dreadful to have life and hope cut off together! "The hopes of the godly 
    result in happiness, but the expectations of the wicked are all in vain." 
    Proverbs 10:28. "When a wicked man dies, his hope perishes." Proverbs 11:7. 
    "The desire of the righteous ends only in good, but the hope of the wicked 
    only in wrath." Proverbs 11:23. 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: If saints gain such glorious things at death, 
    well may they desire it.</p></b></font> Does not everyone desire happiness? No 
    one is content before his death. <i>Faith </i>gives a <b>title </b>to 
    heaven; <b>death </b>gives the <b>possession</b> of heaven. Though we should 
    be desirous of doing service here—yet we should be ambitious of being with 
    Christ. "I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far!" 
    Phil 1:23. We should be <i>content to live</i>—but <i>willing to die</i>. Is 
    it not a blessed thing to be freed from sin, and to lie forever in the bosom 
    of divine love? Is it not a blessed thing to meet our godly relations in 
    heaven, and to be singing divine anthems of praise among the angels? Does 
    not the bride desire the marriage day, especially if she has the prospect of 
    a crown? What is the place we now live in—but a place of <i>banishment </i>
    from God? We are in a <i>wilderness!</i> Here on earth, we are <i>combating
    </i>with Satan—should we not desire to be out of the bloody field, where the 
    bullets of temptation fly fast—and receive a victorious crown? Think what it 
    will be, to have always a smiling look from Christ's face! to be brought 
    into the banqueting-house, and have the banner of his love displayed over 
    us! O you saints, desire death; it is your ascension-day to heaven. 
<p align="justify">Said Hilarion on his death-bed, "Go forth, my soul, Go 
    forth!" Another holy man said, "Lord, lead me to that glory which I have 
    seen as through a dark glass; hasten, Lord, and do not tarry!" Some plants 
    thrive best when they are transplanted. Just so, believers, when 
    transplanted by death, cannot but thrive, because they have Christ's 
    sunbeams shining upon them. What though the passage through the valley of 
    the shadow of death is troublesome! who would not be willing to pass a 
    tempestuous sea, if he were sure to be <i>crowned </i>as soon as he came to 
    shore?</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: We may here find comfort in the loss of dear 
    and pious relations.</p></b></font> They are not only taken away from the evil 
    to come—but are great gainers by death. They leave a wilderness, and go to a 
    paradise! They change their complaints into thanksgivings! They leave their 
    sorrows behind, and enter into the joy of their Lord! Why should we weep for 
    their happiness? Believers have not their portion paid to them, until the 
    day of their death. God's promise is his bond to give heaven to them; but 
    though they have his bond, they do not receive their portion until the day 
    of death. Oh! rejoice to think of the happiness of those who die in the 
    Lord. To them "to die is gain."<i> They are as rich as heaven can make them!<br/>
 
</i><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">2. A Believer's Privilege at Death</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain!" 
    Philippians 1:21</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Hope </p></i>is a Christian's anchor, which he casts within 
    the veil. "Rejoicing in hope." A Christian's hope is not in this life—but he 
    "has hope in his death." The best of a saint's comfort, begins when his life 
    ends; but the wicked have all their heaven here. "What sorrows await you who 
    are rich, for you have your only happiness <i>now</i>!" Luke 6:24. You may 
    make your acquittance, and write "Received in full payment." "Son, remember 
    that you in <i>your lifetime </i>received your good things." But a saint's 
    happiness is in the anticipation of heavenly glory. "The righteous has hope 
    in his death." God keeps the best wine until last. If Cato, the heathen, 
    said, "To me to die is gain," as he saw death to be a mercy; what, then, may 
    a believer say! "The day of <i>death </i>is better than the day of one's <i>
    birth</i>." A queen of England said she preferred her <i>coffin </i>before 
    her <i>cradle</i>.<br/>
 
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">What benefits do believers receive at death?</p>
</b></font><b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">I. The saints, at death, have great immunities and 
    freedoms.</p></font> </b>An apprentice, when he has served his time, is made 
    free. Just so, when the saints have finished their time of living, they are 
    made free! They are not made free until death. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] At death they are freed from a body of SIN.</p></b>
</font>There are in the best believers, the remnants of sin—some remainders 
    and relics of corruption. "O wretched man who I am! who shall deliver me 
    from this body of death?" By the body of death is meant the mass and lump of 
    sin. It may well be called a body—for its <i>weightiness</i>; and a body of 
    death for its harmfulness. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Sin weighs us down. </p></b></font>Sin hinders us from 
    doing good. Like a bird that would be flying up—but has a chain tied to its 
    legs to hinder it—a Christian would be flying up to heaven with the wings of 
    desire—but sin hinders him! He is like a ship under <i>sail</i>, and at <i>
    anchor!</i> Grace would sail forward—but sin is the anchor that holds it 
    back!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Sin is more active in its sphere, than grace.</p></b></font> 
    How stirring was lust in David, when his grace lay dormant! 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3). Sin sometimes gets the mastery, and leads a saint 
    captive.</p></b></font> "For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the 
    evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing." Rom 7:19. Paul was like a 
    man carried down the stream, and could not bear up against it. How often is 
    a child of God overpowered with pride and passion! Therefore Paul calls sin, 
    "a <i>law </i>at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law 
    of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my 
    members." Rom 7: 23. Sin binds as a law; it has a kind of jurisdiction over 
    the soul, as Caesar had over the senate. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Sin defiles the soul.</p></b></font> Like a stain to 
    beauty—sin turns the soul's azure brightness into darkness. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Sin debilitates us, disarms us of our strength. </p></b>
</font>"I am this day weak, though anointed king." Though a saint is crowned 
    with grace, and anointed a spiritual king—he is weak. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) Sin is ever restless.</p></b></font> "The flesh lusts 
    against the spirit." Gal 5:17. Sin is an inmate that is always quarreling—it 
    will never be quiet. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(7.) Sin adheres to us, we cannot get rid of it. </p></b>
</font>It may be compared to a wild fig-tree growing on a wall, the roots of 
    which are pulled up—but some fibers of it are left in the joints of the 
    stone-work, which cannot be gotten out. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(8.) Sin mingles with our duties and graces.</p></b></font> 
    It makes a child of God weary of his life, and makes him water his couch 
    with his tears—to think that sin is so strong an inhabitant, and that he 
    often offends the God he loves. This made Paul cry out, <i>Miser ego homo!
    </i>"Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that 
    is dominated by sin?" Romans 7:24. He did not cry out because of his 
    affliction, or his prison-chains—but for the body of sin. 
<p align="justify">Now a believer at death is freed from sin, he is not 
    taken away <i>in </i>his sins—but <i>from </i>his sins. He shall never again 
    have a vain, proud thought! He shall never again grieve the Spirit of God! 
    Sin brought death into the world—and death shall carry sin out of the world. 
    The Persians had a certain day in the year in which they killed all serpents 
    and venomous creatures; such a day will the day of death be to a believer. 
    Death will destroy all his sins, which, like so many serpents, have stung 
    him. Death smites a believer as the angel did Peter—and made his chains fall 
    off. Acts 12:7. Believers at death are made perfect in holiness. "The 
    spirits of just men <i>made perfect</i>." At death the souls of believers 
    recover their virgin purity. Oh! what a blessed privilege is this, to be 
    without spot or wrinkle; to be purer than the sunbeams; to be as free from 
    sin as the angels! This makes a believer desirous to have his passport, and 
    to be gone from his sin! He would gladly live in that pure air, where no 
    black vapors of sin arise!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] At death the saints shall be freed from all the 
    troubles and incumbrances to which this life is subject.</p></b> </font>"<i>Sin
    </i>is the seed sown—and <i>trouble </i>is the harvest reaped!" Euripides.
    <i>Life </i>and <i>trouble </i>are married together. There is more in life 
    to trouble us, than to tempt us. Parents divide a portion of <i>sorrow </i>
    to their children, and yet leave enough for themselves. "Man is born to 
    trouble." Job 5:7. He is heir to it, it is his birth-right. You may as well 
    separate weight from lead, as trouble from the life of man. King Henry's 
    emblem was a crown hung in a bush of thorns. There is a far greater 
    proportion of <i>bitterness, </i>than <i>pleasure </i>in this life. "I have 
    perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon." Prov 7:17. For one sweet 
    ingredient there were two bitter; for the sweet cinnamon, there were bitter 
    myrrh and aloes. A man's <i>grace </i>will not exempt him from <i>troubles</i>. 
    "My years have been few and <i>difficult</i>." Gen 47:9. Thus said a godly 
    patriarch, though he had met with God. "I have seen God face to face!" and 
    yet he had his troubles. There are many things to embitter life and cause 
    trouble—but death frees us from them all! 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Death frees a believer from CARE. </p></b></font>The 
    mind is full of perplexed thoughts—how to bring about such a design; or how 
    to prevent such an evil. The Greek word for care comes from a primitive in 
    the Greek, which signifies, <i>to cut the heart in pieces. </i>Care torments 
    the mind; wastes the spirits. No such bitter bread, as the <i>bread of 
    carefulness</i>. Ezek 12:19. Care is a spiritual canker, which eats out the 
    comfort of life. Death is its only cure! 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Death frees a believer from FEAR.</p></b></font> Fear is 
    the epilepsy of the soul, which sets it shaking. "There is torment in fear." 
    Fear is like Prometheus' vulture gnawing the heart. There is a <i>
    mistrustful </i>fear—a fear of <i>lack</i>; and a <i>distracting </i>fear—a 
    fear of <i>danger</i>; and a <i>discouraging </i>fear—a fear that God does 
    not love us. These fears leave dreadful impressions upon the mind. But at 
    death, a believer is freed from these torturing fears! He is as far from 
    fear—as the damned are from hope. The grave buries a Christian's fear! 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Death frees a believer from LABOR. </p></b></font>"All 
    things are <i>wearisome</i>, more than one can say." Eccl 1:8. Some labor 
    with their bodies—others with their minds. God has made a law, "In the sweat 
    of your face, you shall eat bread." But death gives a believer a quietus—it 
    takes him off from his hard labor. "Blessed are the dead that die in the 
    Lord: they rest from their labors." They no longer need to <i>work</i>—for 
    they have entered upon their reward! They no longer need to <i>fight</i>—for 
    they have the crown set on their head! "They rest from their labors." 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Death frees a believer from SUFFERING. </p></b></font>
    Believers are as a <i>lily </i>among <i>thorns</i>; or as the <i>dove </i>
    among <i>vultures</i>. The wicked have an antipathy against them; and secret 
    hatred will often break forth into open violence. "He who was born after the 
    flesh, persecuted him who was born after the Spirit." The dragon is 
    described with <i>seven heads</i> and <i>ten horns</i>. Rev 12:3. He <i>
    plots </i>with the seven heads, and <i>pushes </i>with the ten horns. But at 
    death, the godly shall be freed from the molestations of the wicked! They 
    shall never more be pestered with these vermin! "There the wicked cease from 
    troubling." Job 3:17. Death does to a believer, as Joseph of Arimathea did 
    to Christ—it takes him down from the <i>cross</i>. The <i>eagle </i>which 
    flies high, cannot be stung with the <i>serpent</i>. Death gives the soul 
    the wings of an eagle, to fly above all the venomous serpents here below!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Death frees a believer from TEMPTATION. </p></b></font>
    Though Satan is a conquered enemy—yet he is a <i>restless </i>enemy. "Be 
    careful! Watch out for attacks from the Devil, your great enemy. He <i>
    prowls</i> around like a roaring lion, looking for some victim to devour." 1 
    Peter 5:8. He <i>prowls</i> about; he is always going about his diocese. He 
    has his <i>snares </i>and his <i>darts!</i> One he tempts with <i>riches</i>, 
    another with <i>beauty</i>. It is a great trouble to be continually followed 
    with temptations; it is as bad as for a virgin to have her chastity daily 
    assaulted. But death will free a child of God from temptation, so that he 
    shall never again be vexed with the old serpent! After death has shot its 
    dart--the devil will be done shooting his! <i>Grace </i>puts a believer out 
    of the devil's <i>possession</i>—but only <i>death </i>frees him from the 
    devil's <i>temptation!</i> 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) Death frees a believer from SORROW.</p></b></font> A <i>
    cloud </i>of sorrow often gathers in the heart—and <i>drops </i>into tears. 
    "My life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing." It was part of the 
    curse, "In sorrow you shall bring forth." Gen 3:16. Many things occasion 
    sorrow: sickness, law-suits, treachery of friends, disappointment of hopes, 
    and loss of estate. "Don't call me <i>Naomi </i>(that is, <i>pleasant</i>). 
    Instead, call me <i>Mara </i>(that is, <i>bitter</i>), for the Almighty has 
    made life very bitter for me." Ruth 1:20.
<p align="justify">Sorrow is the evil spirit which haunts us. "The people <i>
    wept </i>loudly. So they named that place <i>Bochim </i>(that is, <i>weeping</i>)<i>."
    </i>Judges 2:4-5.<i> The world is a Bochim! </i>Rachel wept for her 
    children; some grieve that they have no children, and others grieve that 
    their children are unkind. Thus we spend our years with sighing. The world 
    is a valley of tears! But <b>death is the funeral of all our sorrows! </b>
    "God will wipe away every tear from their eyes!" Rev 7:17. Then Christ's 
    spouse puts off her mourning garments; for "how can the guests of the 
    bridegroom mourn while he is with them?" Matt 9:15. Thus death gives a 
    believer his quietus; it frees him from sin and trouble. "The last enemy to 
    be destroyed is death." 1 Corinthians 15:26. Though the apostle calls death 
    the last enemy—yet it is <b>the best friend! </b>"To me to die is gain!"</p>
<p align="justify">See here that which may make a true saint willing to die. 
    Death will set him out of gunshot, and free him from sin and trouble. There 
    is no cause for weeping—to leave a <i>valley of tears</i>—to leave the stage 
    on which <i>sin </i>and <i>misery </i>are acted. Believers are here in a 
    strange country, why then should they not be willing to leave it? Death 
    beats off their fetters of sin, and sets them free! Who goes weeping, when 
    released from a jail?</p>
<p align="justify">Besides our own sins, there are the sins of <i>others</i>. 
    The world is a place where Satan's throne is; a place where we see God daily 
    dishonored. Lot, who was a bright star in a dark night, felt his righteous 
    soul tormented with the filthy lives of the wicked. 2 Pet 2:7. To see God's 
    truths adulterated, and his glory eclipsed—wounds a godly heart. It made 
    David cry out, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the 
    tents of Kedar." Kedar was Arabia, where <i>Ishmael's </i>posterity lived. 
    It was a cut to David's heart to dwell there. O then, be willing to depart 
    out of the tents of Kedar!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. The BODIES of believers are united to Christ in the 
    grave, and shall rest there until the resurrection.</p></b></font> They are said 
    to <i>sleep in Jesus. </i>1 Thess 4:14. The dust of believers is part of 
    Christ's mystic body. The grave is a dormitory, or place of rest to the 
    saints, where their bodies quietly sleep in Christ, until they are awakened 
    out of their sleep by the trumpet of the archangel.
<p align="justify">How shall we know that at death we shall be freed from 
    sin and trouble, and have our bodies united to Christ in the grave?</p>
<p align="justify">"To me," says Paul, "to die is gain;" to me, insofar as I 
    am a true believer. Are we such? Have we this blessed faith? <b>Faith</b>, 
    wherever it is, is <i>operative</i>. Jewelers say there is no precious 
    stone, but has some hidden virtue in it. Just so I may say of faith—it has 
    some secret virtue in it; it anchors the soul on Christ; it has both a <i>
    justifying </i>and <i>sanctifying </i>virtue. It fetches <i>blood </i>out of 
    Christ's side to <i>pardon</i>; and <i>water </i>out of his side to purify. 
    Faith works by love. Faith constrains to duty. Faith makes the <i>head </i>
    study for Christ, the <i>tongue </i>confess him, and the <i>hands </i>work 
    for him. </p>
<p align="justify">I have read of a father who had three sons, and in his 
    will, he left all his estate to that son who could find his ring with the 
    jewel—which had a <i>healing virtue</i>. The case was brought before the 
    judges; the two elder sons counterfeited a ring—but the younger son brought 
    the true ring, which was proved by the <i>virtue </i>of it; whereupon his 
    father's estate went to him. To this ring I may compare faith. There is a 
    counterfeit faith in the world: but if we can find this <i>ring of faith </i>
    which has <i>the healing virtue </i>in it to purify the heart—it is the true 
    faith which gives us a saving interest in Christ, and entitles us to all 
    these privileges at death—to be freed from sin and sorrow—and to have our 
    bodies united to Christ, while they are in the grave.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. At death, the SOULS of believers pass into glory.</p></b></font> Death brings the removal of all evils, and the attainment of 
    all blissful things! Death is the daybreak of eternal brightness. Here I 
    shall lead you to the <i>top of Mount Pisgah</i> and give you a <i>glimpse
    </i>of <i>the Holy Land.
</i><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What is comprehended, in heavenly glory?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"Glory is a state of being made perfect, by the gathering 
    together of every precious thing," Boethius. It is a perfect state of bliss, 
    which consists in the accumulation and heaping together all the precious 
    things of which immortal souls are capable. And truly here I am at a loss; 
    for all I can say falls short of the reality of celestial glory. Appelles' 
    pencil cannot delineate it! Angels' tongues cannot express it! We shall 
    never understand glory fully—until we are in heaven! Let me give you some <i>
    dark </i>views only, and some <i>imperfect </i>lineaments of that state of 
    glory at which saints shall arrive after death.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The first and most sublime part of the glory of 
    heaven—is the full and sweet fruition of God.</p></b></font> We are apt to think 
    the happiness of heaven, is in being free from pain and misery; but the very 
    essence of happiness is the enjoyment and fruition of God. God is an 
    infinite inexhaustible fountain of joy; and to have him, is to have all. The 
    enjoyment of God implies three things.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The enjoyment of God implies our SEEING him. </p></b>
</font>"We shall see him <b>as he is</b>." How shall we see God?
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) We shall see him INTELLECTUALLY, with the eyes of 
    the mind.</p></b> This divines call <i>the beatific vision</i>. We shall have a 
    full knowledge of God—though not know him fully. This sight of God will be 
    very glorious—as when a king, on his coronation-day, shows himself in all 
    his royalty and magnificence.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) We shall PHYSICALLY behold the glorified body of 
    Jesus Christ.</p></b> And if it is a pleasant thing to behold the <i>sun</i>, 
    how blessed a sight will it be to behold the <i>Sun of Righteousness! </i>to 
    see Christ clothed in our human nature, sitting in glory above the angels! 
    Solomon says that, "the eye is never satisfied with seeing." But surely the 
    eyes of saints will be satisfied, with seeing that orient brightness which 
    shall shine from the beautiful body of Christ! It must needs be satisfying, 
    because through Christ's flesh, some rays and beams of the Godhead will 
    gloriously display themselves! God's excellent majesty would overwhelm us; 
    but through the veil of Christ's flesh we shall behold the divine glory!
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Our seeing God will be TRANSFORMING.</p></b> We shall so 
    see him, as to be in some measure <i>assimilated </i>and <i>changed </i>into 
    his image! "We shall be like him." If, Moses' face shined, when was with God 
    on the Mount, and had but some imperfect sight of his glory—how shall the 
    saints glorified faces shine, being <i>always </i>in God's full presence, and 
    having some beams of his glory put upon them! "We shall be like him!" One 
    who is deformed may look on beauty—and not be <i>made </i>beautiful. But the 
    saints shall <i>so </i>see God—as that sight shall transform them into his 
    likeness. "When I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness." Not that 
    the saints shall partake of God's essence; for as the iron in the fire is 
    made fiery—yet remains iron still, so the saints, by beholding God's 
    majesty, shall be made <i>glorious </i>creatures—but are <i>creatures </i>
    still.
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Our seeing God in heaven will be without weariness.</p></b> 
    Let a man see the rarest sight that is, he will soon be glutted; as when he 
    comes into a garden, and sees delicious walks, fair arbors, pleasant 
    flowers—within a little while he grows weary. But it is not so in heaven; 
    there is no surfeit there. The saints will never be weary of seeing God; 
    for, God being <i>infinite</i>—there shall every moment be new and fresh 
    delight springing from him into their souls!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The second thing implied in enjoying God—is LOVING 
    him.</p></b></font> It is a saint's grief—that his heart is now like the frozen 
    ocean, and he can melt no more in love to God. But in heaven—he shall be 
    like the seraphim, burning with divine love! Love is a pleasant affection; 
    "fear has torment." Love has joy in it. To love <i>beauty </i>is delightful. 
    God's amazing beauty will attract the saints' love—it will be their heaven 
    to love him!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The third thing implied in enjoying God—is God's 
    loving us.</p></b></font> Were there glory in God—yet, if there were not love, 
    it would much eclipse the joys of heaven; but "God is love." The glorified 
    saints cannot love God so much—as they are loved by God. What is their 
    love—compared to God's love? What is their <i>candle</i>—compared to this <i>
    Sun</i>? God loves his people on earth, when they are <i>black</i> with sin 
    and imperfections. But oh! how entirely will he love them when they are 
    "without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish—when they will be holy and 
    without fault!"
<p align="justify">"You will be called <i>Hephzibah</i>, (that is, <i>God's 
    delight</i>)" Isaiah 62:4. This is the felicity of heaven, to be in the 
    sweet embraces of God's love—the delight of the King of Glory—to be sunning 
    ourselves in the light of God's countenance. Then the saints shall know that
    <i>love of Christ </i>which passes knowledge. Eph 3:19. From this glorious 
    manifestation of God's love—will flow infinite joy into the souls of the 
    blessed; therefore heaven is called "entering into the joy of our Lord." </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>seeing </i>God, <i>loving </i>God, and <i>being 
    loved by God—</i>will cause a jubilation of spirit, and create such holy 
    raptures of joy in the saints, which are unspeakable and full of glory! 
    "There is a certain sweetness about God, which delights—nay, rather, 
    ravishes the soul!" Augustine. </p>
<p align="justify">On earth, the saints spend their years with sighing; they 
    weep over their sins and afflictions. In heavenly glory, their <i>water </i>
    shall be turned into <i>wine;</i> their <i>sorrow </i>will be turned into <i>
    joy</i>; the vessels of mercy shall be filled and run over with joy. They 
    shall have their palm branches and harps in their hand, in token of their 
    triumphs and rejoicing. Rev 14:2.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The second thing comprehended in glory—is the good 
    SOCIETY there.</p></b></font> There are the <b>angels</b>. Every <i>star </i>
    adds to the light. Those blessed cherubim will welcome us to paradise. If 
    the angels rejoiced at the <i>conversion </i>of the elect, how will they 
    rejoice at their <i>coronation!</i> There is the company of the <b>
    saints</b>. "The spirits of just men made perfect."
<p align="justify">Will the saints in glory know each other?</p>
<p align="justify">Certainly they shall; for our <i>knowledge </i>in heaven 
    shall not be diminished—but increased. We shall not only know our godly 
    friends and relations—but we shall also know those glorified saints whom we 
    never saw before! It must be so; for <i>society </i>without <i>acquaintance
    </i>is not comfortable. Indeed, the Scripture seems to hint as much to us; 
    for, if Peter in the transfiguration knew Moses and Elijah, whom he never 
    saw before—then surely in heaven the saints shall know one another, and be 
    infinitely delighted in each other's company!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] The third thing comprehended in glory—is perfection 
    in HOLINESS.</p></b></font> Holiness is the beauty of God and angels—it makes 
    heaven. What is <i>happiness—</i>but the essence of <i>holiness?</i> Here on 
    earth, a Christian's grace is <i>imperfect</i>. At death believers shall 
    arrive at <i>perfection </i>of grace. Then this sun shall be in its meridian 
    splendor! Then shall they not need to pray for increase of grace, for they 
    shall be as the angels—their <i>light </i>shall be clear, and their <i>joy
    </i>shall be full.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] The fourth thing in glory—is DIGNITY and HONOR. </p></b>
</font>They shall reign as kings! Therefore glorified saints are said to 
    have their<i> royal insignia—</i>their white robes and their crown. Rev 7:9. 
    Caesar, after his victories, in token of honor, had a chair of ivory set for 
    him in the senate, and a throne in the theater. Just so, the saints, having 
    obtained their victories over sin and Satan, will be enthroned with Christ 
    in the empyreal heaven. To sit with Christ denotes <i>safety</i>; to sit on 
    the throne denotes <i>dignity</i>. "This honor have <i>all </i>the saints."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] The fifth thing in glory is—the HARMONY and union 
    among the heavenly inhabitants. </p></b></font>The devil cannot get his <i>
    cloven foot </i>into heaven! He cannot conjure up any <i>storms of 
    contention </i>there. There shall be perfect union. There is no <i>jarring 
    string </i>in the heavenly music! There is nothing to make any trouble—there 
    is no pride or envy there. Though one star may differ from another, one may 
    have a greater degree of glory—yet every vessel shall be <i>full</i>. There 
    shall the saints and angels sit as olive-plants around about their Father's 
    table—in love and unity. Then shall they join together in concert, then 
    shall the loud anthems of praise be sung in <i>the heavenly choir!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] The sixth thing in glory is a blessed REST. </p></b>
</font>"There remains a rest for the people of God." It is a happy 
    transition—from <i>toil </i>to <i>rest</i>. Here on earth, we can have no 
    rest, tossed and turned as a ball on the ocean. "We are troubled on every 
    side." How can a ship <i>rest</i>—in a <i>storm</i>? But after death the 
    saints get into their haven. Everything is quiet in the center. God is "the 
    center where the soul does sweetly acquiesce." A Christian, after his weary 
    marches and battles, shall take off his bloody armor, and rest himself upon 
    the bosom of Jesus—that bed of perfume! When death has given the saints the 
    wings of a dove, then they shall fly away to <i>paradise </i>and be at <i>
    rest!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[7] The seventh thing in glory is its ETERNITY.</p></b></font> 
    "An eternal weight of glory." Glory is a weight. The Hebrew word for glory 
    is a weight. God must make us <i>able </i>to bear it. An eternal weight. 
    Glory is such an eternal manna—as does not breed worms. If the saints' glory 
    in heaven were but <i>for a time</i>—and they were in fear of losing it—it 
    would eclipse and embitter the joys of heaven. But <i>eternity </i>is 
    written upon their joys. The garland made of the <i>flowers of paradise </i>
    will never wither.
<p align="justify">I have read of a river called the Day-river, which runs 
    with a full torrent during the day—but at night is dried up. Such are <i>all 
    earthly comforts</i>—they run with a full stream all the <i>daytime of life</i>—but 
    at the <i>night of death—</i>they are dried up! The glorified saints shall 
    drink of the <i>rivers of pleasure </i>for evermore. <i>Eternity </i>is the 
    heaven of heavens! "At the last, our joy shall be never-ending," Bernard. 
    The joys of heaven are <i>overflowing </i>and <i>everlasting!</i> "You have 
    made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your 
    presence, with <b>eternal pleasures </b>at your right hand." Psalm 16:11.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">WHEN do believers enter upon possession of glory?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They pass immediately after death, into glory. The 
    Romans, when their great men died, caused an eagle to be let loose, and fly 
    about in the air—signifying hereby that the soul was immortal, and did not 
    die with the body. Christ tells us, the soul is not capable of being killed, 
    therefore not of dying. Matt 10:28. And as the soul does not die, so neither 
    does it sleep in the body for a time. If the soul at death is <i>absent </i>
    from the body—it cannot <i>sleep </i>in the body. 2 Cor 5:8. There is an 
    immediate passage from death to glory; it is but the twinkling of an eye—and 
    we shall see God" "<i>This day </i>shall you be with me in paradise." Luke 
    23:43. By paradise is meant heaven: the third heaven, into which Paul was 
    taken. 2 Cor 12:4. Christ said to the thief on the cross, "<i>This day </i>
    shall you be with me in paradise." His <i>body </i>could not be there, for 
    it was laid in the grave; but it was spoken of his <i>soul</i>—that it 
    should be, immediately after death, in heaven. Let none be so vain as to 
    talk of <i>purgatory</i>. A soul purged by Christ's blood, needs no <i>fire 
    of purgatory</i>—but goes immediately from a deathbed, into a glorified 
    state!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: See what little cause believers have to fear 
    death—as it brings such glorious benefits.</p></b></font> Why should the saints 
    fear their happiness? Is it not a blessed thing to <i>see </i>God, to <i>
    love </i>God, and to lie forever in the bosom of divine love? Is it not a 
    blessed thing to meet our godly relations in heaven? Why should the saints 
    be afraid of their blessings? Is a virgin afraid to be matched unto the 
    crown? 
<p align="justify">Now we have but the <i>engagement contract</i>; at death 
    is the marriage-supper of the Lamb! Rev 19:9. Death does not do us any 
    hurt—it only takes us from among fiery serpents—and places us among angels! 
    It only clothes us with a robe of immortality! Has he any wrong done to 
    him—who has his <i>sackcloth </i>pulled off, and has <i>royal attire</i> put 
    upon him? Do not fear dying—you  cannot really <i>live—</i>but by <i>
    dying</i>.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: You who are real saints, whose hearts are 
    purified by faith, spend much time in musing upon those glorious benefits 
    which you shall have by Christ at death. </p></b></font>Thus might you, by a 
    contemplative life, begin the <i>life of angels </i>while here on earth, and 
    be in heaven before you arrive there. Eudoxius was so affected with the 
    glory of the sun, that he thought he was born only to behold it. What should
    <i>we </i>contemplate—but celestial glory, when we shall see God face to 
    face! David had gotten above the ordinary sort of men; he was in the <i>
    altitudes </i>when he said, "I am ever with you." "Whom have I in heaven but 
    you? I desire you more than anything on earth. My health may fail, and my 
    spirit may grow weak, but God remains the strength of my heart; he is mine 
    forever!" Psalm 73:25-26. 
<p align="justify">A true saint every day takes a turn in heaven; his 
    thoughts and desires are, like cherubim, flying up to paradise. Can men of 
    the world delight in looking upon their bags of gold, and fields of grain? 
    And shall not the <i>heirs of heaven</i> take more delight in contemplating 
    the glory of heaven? Could we send forth <i>faith as a spy</i>, and every 
    day view the glory of the Jerusalem above—how would it rejoice us—as it does 
    the <i>heir—</i>to think of the wealthy inheritance which is to come into 
    his hand shortly!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: This may comfort the saints in two cases.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Under their needs.</p></b></font> They abound only in

    of a wealthy estate after a few short years have expired, though at present 
    he has nothing to help himself—he comforts himself with this—that shortly he 
    shall have a rich estate come into his hand. "It does not yet appear what we 
    shall be." We shall be emparadised with glory—and be as rich as the angels!

<p align="justify">(2.) Under their sufferings.</p></b></font> A true saint is, 
    as Luther says, "an heir of the Cross." It may make us go cheerfully through 
    our sufferings, to know that there are great things laid up in store for us; 
    that there is glory coming, which eye has not seen; we shall drink of the 
    fruit of the vine in the kingdom of heaven. Though now we drink in a <i>
    wormwood </i>cup—yet there is <i>sugar </i>to sweeten it. We shall soon <i>
    taste </i>of those <i>joys of paradise</i>, which exceed our faith; and 
    which will be better <i>felt—</i>than they can be <i>expressed!
