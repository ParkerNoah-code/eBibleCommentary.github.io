<p align="center"><i>"Keep yourselves from idols!" </i>1 John 5:21</p>
<p align="justify"><b>IDOLATRY </b>is a soul-damning error! In the law, God 
    laid claim to the <i>fat</i> of the sacrifice, Leviticus 3:3. Just so, all 
    divine worship, which is the fat of the sacrifice, the Lord will have 
    peculiarly reserved for Himself; whereas the idolater gives that to the idol 
    which is due to God. Idolatry is <i>spiritual adultery</i>. Ezekiel 23:37, 
    "With their idols have they committed adultery!" Idolatry opens the sluice 
    to all God's judgments; therefore, the Jews used to say in all the 
    punishments which befell them—there was <i>an ounce of the golden calf </i>
    in them.</p>
<p align="justify">Our nature is as prone to idolatry—as dry wood is to take 
    fire. This <i>plague</i> is catching. The Jews "made cakes to offer to the 
    Queen of Heaven. And they gave drink offerings to their other idol gods!" 
    Jeremiah 7:18. Rather than not worship something, men will worship the 
    devil! Leviticus 17:7, "They must no longer offer their sacrifices to the 
    goat-demons that they have prostituted themselves with." In the Hebrew, it 
    is "to the <i>hairy</i> <i>ones</i>," because the devils appeared to them in 
    the form of satyrs or goats. </p>
<p align="justify">Let all God's people, as they prize their salvation, 
    beware of idolatry. It is remarkable when the Apostle has said, "You are the 
    temple of the living God," he adds presently, "What agreement has the temple 
    of God with idols?" and verse 17, "Come out from among them, and be 
    separate, says the Lord." </p>
<p align="justify">And what is <font color="#0000ff"><b>POPERY, </b></font>
    but Romish idolatry? That God's living temples may not be defiled with 
    idolatry of the church of Rome, I shall show some of the chief teachings in 
    Popery, and anatomize that religion a little. And, when I am done, I think 
    everyone should abhor that <i>cheat of Rome</i>, and say of the papists, as 
    once Jacob did of Simeon and Levi, brethren in evil, Genesis 49:6, "May I 
    never enter their council; may I never join their assembly!"</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The first popish doctrine is, that the pope is 
    appointed by Christ to be the head of the church, and that he is the <i>
    Vicar of Christ </i>upon earth. </p></b></font>This contradicts  Scripture, 
    which call Christ expressly the head of the Church, Colossians 2:19, 
    Ephesians 5:23. For the pope to be head would be to make the church 
    monstrous—to have two heads. I read of a beast rising up out of the sea, and 
    the dragon gave him his power and his authority. Revelation 13:1. By the 
    beast I understand Antichrist; and the dragon giving him power, that is, 
    Satan giving power to the pope to exercise his papal greatness. If, then, 
    the pope is the beast, he is very unfit to be the head of the church.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The second popish doctrine is the <i>Mass</i>, which 
    is gross idolatry.</p></b></font> Herein there are two errors:
<p align="justify">The first error of the mass is <font color="#b07050"><b>
    transubstantiation</b></font>. The papist's hold that the <i>host </i>or <i>
    bread </i>in the sacrament, after the words of consecration, is turned into 
    the very body of Christ! This is against reason. A body, having its 
    dimensions, cannot be in several places at once. If Christ's body is locally 
    and physically in heaven, then it cannot be in the bread—but it is in 
    heaven. Acts 3:21, "Whom the heavens must receive until the time of 
    restitution of all things." That the bread is not turned into the body of 
    Christ, I prove thus. If the bread is the very body of Christ—then all who 
    eat the bread in the sacrament receive Christ; but that is not so, for the 
    Apostle said of some, they did "eat and drink their own damnation," 1 
    Corinthians 11:27. The fathers were against this opinion of the corporal 
    presence of Christ in the host. We eat Christ's body, said Cyprian, 
    sacramentally by faith. "This is My body," that is, a <i>sign </i>and <i>
    figure </i>of my body, said Tertullian.</p>
<p align="justify">The second error of the mass is the papist's
    <font color="#b07050"><b>daily offer up Christ by way of sacrifice in the 
    mass</b></font>. This reflects dishonor upon Christ's priestly office—as if 
    His sacrifice on the cross was imperfect. Hebrews 10:12, "This man after He 
    had offered <i>one </i>sacrifice for sins <i>forever</i>, sat down at the 
    right hand of God;" verse 14, "For by one offering He has perfected forever 
    those who are sanctified." Behold the completeness of Christ's sacrifice. He 
    has finished His work, and there remains nothing for us now, but to believe 
    in Him.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The third popish error, is that they hold the 
    Scriptures are not for the common people. </p></b></font>They lock them up in 
    Latin—an unknown language. They make the Scripture a book sealed. Faith 
    comes by knowledge—but they, as Christ said, "take away the key of 
    knowledge," Luke 11:52. If the Bible is searched into by the common people, 
    it is a <i>crime </i>and is brought into the inquisition. God would have the 
    Law read before all Israel in their hearing, Deuteronomy 31:11. Therefore, 
    surely it was not to be in an unknown language. The prince of Rome does as 
    the prince of the air—he <i>blinds </i>men's eyes—and then leads them to 
    execution! 2 Corinthians 4:4.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The fourth error in the church of Rome, is their 
    doctrine of <i>satisfaction for sin.</i></p></b></font> They exalt human nature 
    and make it copartner with Christ in Justification. They hold that we, in 
    our own persons, satisfy God's justice by penance, fasting, and good deeds. 
    So said the council of Trent and the Rhemists. But where does the Scripture 
    mention any such thing? Our <i>confession </i>of sin is no satisfaction for 
    sin. If a traitor confesses his guilt, his confession does not satisfy 
    justice for his treason. Our <i>contrition </i>is not satisfaction for sin. 
    If a man is sorry that he owes such a debt, this does not at all satisfy for 
    the debt. God's justice receives no satisfaction, except through Christ. The 
    publican "smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner!" 
    Luke 18:13. Here was a confession, a sinner; and contrition, he smote upon 
    his breast—but it was far from satisfaction for his sin; therefore, he cries 
    out for mercy, "God be merciful to me."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A fifth soul-poisoning doctrine in popery, is their 
    distinction of <i>mortal </i>and <i>venial </i>sins. </p></b></font><i>Mortal
    </i>sins, they say, such as perjury, adultery, murder—cast us out of God's 
    favor and deserve damnation. But <i>venial </i>sins are such as somewhat 
    displease God—yet do not deserve death—but are of their own nature 
    pardonable. For instance, lust, rash anger, vain thoughts are venial sins. 
    But we affirm, according to Scripture, that there are no venial sins, none 
    of which we can say they do not deserve damnation. Lust is a violation of 
    God's law, therefore, not in its own nature venial. Matthew 5:28, "Whoever 
    looks on a woman to <i>lust </i>after her, has already committed adultery 
    with her in his heart." Christ makes an impure glance of the eye, to be 
    adultery. The least tincture of sin exposes to God's curse, Galatians 3:10. 
    It is true, the greatest sins, through Christ's blood, are pardonable—but 
    none are pardonable in their own nature.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. The sixth error in the Romish religion, is the 
    doctrine of free-will.</p></b></font> Bellarmine holds that the <i>will</i> is 
    piously inclined, and that a man has an innate power to do good. But 
    Augustine denies this, and I think our own experience may confute it. It is 
    a saying of Chrysostom, "As a ship, when the rudder is broken, is carried up 
    and down in the sea wherever the tempest will, so man, having lost the 
    rudder of free-will, is carried up and down to sin where the devil will." 
    The papists affirm that a man has some seeds and relics of spiritual life, 
    and has power to convert himself. But the Apostle tells us that we are, by 
    nature, without spiritual strength, Romans 5:6. Sin has cut the <i>lock of 
    righteousness </i>where our strength lay. A man cannot of himself know the 
    things of God, 1 Corinthians 2:14. He cannot think a good thought, 2 
    Corinthians 3:5. Nay, there is in the will of man not only <i>impotency </i>
    but <i>obstinacy</i>; our will is in rebellion against God! Acts 7:51. It is 
    crooked, like a piece of iron that is bent awry. It is only the sweet 
    efficacy of omnipotent grace, which can overcome us. We yield not to God by 
    surrender, but storm. We do not <i>lay down </i>our weapons—but they are <i>
    beaten </i>out of our hands. Whenever God converts, He creates, which is a 
    sufficient confutation of the proud doctrine of freewill. "Man," said 
    Ambrose, "has free-will to <i>sin</i>—but none to <i>conversion</i>."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. The seventh popish error, is their <i>indulgences</i>.</p></b></font> 
    They affirm that the pope, as Peter's successor, has power to grant an 
    indulgence to men, by virtue whereof they are set free in the sight of God 
    from the guilt and punishment of sin. This brings <i>grist </i>to the pope's 
    mill. To give a pardon or indulgence is a flower of the crown of heaven 
    alone! Mark 7:2, "Who can forgive sin but God alone?" The indulgence which 
    the <i>pontiff of Rome </i>grants, is a key that opens the door to all vice. 
    For what do the papists care what sins they commit—when they have a license 
    from the pope! Roger Holland, the martyr, who was at first a Catholic and 
    later converted, made this confession before Bonner, "At first," said he, "I 
    was of your popish religion and I made no reckoning of any sin, trusting the 
    priest's absolution; swearing and immorality were no sins with me, because I 
    could have them absolved for money."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. The eighth popish error, is their doctrine of <i>
    salvation by personal merit.</i> </p></b></font>They hold that their good works 
    expiate sin and merit mercy. Bellarmine said that a man has right to heaven 
    upon a double title: the one is Christ's merit, and the other his own merit. 
    And he brings that Scripture, 2 Timothy 4:8, "Henceforth is laid up for me a 
    crown of righteousness, which the Lord the just judge shall give me, at that 
    day." His argument is this: If God crowns our good works—then they have 
    merit. I answer, this does not follow. A king may confer a large gratuity 
    not because it is deserved—but because he has a mind to set forth his 
    bounty. God crowns us not for our works sake—but for His name's sake, 
    Ezekiel 20:9.
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. But if God, in justice, bestows the crown—then 
    do not our works merit?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. God gives a reward as a just judge; not to the 
    worthiness of our works, but to the worthiness of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. God, in justice, gives a reward not because we 
    have deserved it but because He has promised it. The truth is that God, in 
    free grace, crowns those works in the court of <i>mercy</i>, which He 
    condemns in the court of <i>justice</i>. That good works cannot merit 
    appears thus:</p>
<p align="justify">1. That which merits at God's hands must be a gift, not a 
    debt. If a debtor pays his creditor what he borrowed, he does not merit 
    anything from the creditor. Whatever service we do for God is a due debt; 
    nay, it is but <i>part </i>of the debt. How then can we merit?</p>
<p align="justify">2. He who will merit must give God that which is perfect. 
    But our good works are but <i>shining sins</i>, they are showered with <i>
    pride</i>, tainted with <i>hypocrisy</i>, so that we are far from meriting. 
    I conclude this from Bernard, "Good works are the <i>way </i>to the kingdom, 
    not the <i>cause </i>of it."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. The ninth popish error, is their <i>purgatory</i> 
    fire.</p></b></font> There is, said Bellarmine, an infernal place in the earth 
    called <i>purgatory </i>in which the souls which were not fully cleansed in 
    this life, are purged there by fire, before they can be received into 
    heaven. <i>Purgatory fire </i>the papists make satisfactory for sin; which 
    much derogates from the virtue and benefit of Christ's sufferings, "who 
    Himself has purged our sins," Hebrews 1:3.
<p align="justify">The Scripture nowhere asserts this doctrine of purgatory. 
    It mentions no <i>middle </i>place. The wicked, at death, go immediately to 
    hell. Luke 16:23, "The rich man was buried—and in hell he lift up his eyes 
    in torment." Believers, at death, go immediately to heaven. Luke 23:43, "<i>This 
    day </i>you shall be with Me in paradise." Christ was to be instantly in 
    heaven, and the penitent thief was to be with Christ that very day. So that 
    he was in no such place as purgatory—but went immediately from the cross to 
    paradise. Christ's blood is purgatory in this life, 1 John 1:7. If men are 
    not purged by Christ's blood, there is no purging by fire. Not only the 
    Scripture but the Fathers were against purgatory. We do not read of <i>two 
    fires</i>, said Augustine, only of hell-fire, not purgatory-fire. But this 
    imaginary fire of purgatory, makes for something to sell in the pope's 
    kitchen. For when men are about to make their will, if they leave good sums 
    of money to the pope and his priests—they tell them that they will pray for 
    them that they may be speedily released out of the pains of purgatory!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">10. The next popish error, is their <i>praying to saints 
    and angels</i>.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Their praying to <font color="#b07050"><b>saints</b></font>: 
    The papists pray to several saints for the removal of temporal evils. They 
    pray to St. Apolline to ease their toothache, and to St. Petronelle to cure 
    their fevers. They pray to other saints for the removal of spiritual evils. 
    One said, if we pray to the departed saints, they, being stricken with 
    compassion, pray to God for us. But how absurd is this! The saints in heaven 
    do not know our grievances. "Abraham is ignorant of us," Isaiah 63:16. When 
    Elijah was to be taken up to heaven, he said to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do 
    for you <i>before </i>I am taken from you," 2 Kings 2:9, clearly implying 
    that there was no place to ask him, after he was gone.</p>
<p align="justify">Their praying to <font color="#b07050"><b>angels</b></font>: 
    They bring that Scripture, Revelation 8:3, "Then another angel with a gold 
    incense burner came and stood at the altar. And a great quantity of incense 
    was given to him to mix with the prayers of God's people, to be offered on 
    the gold altar before the throne." They say, that if the angels pray for 
    us—may we pray to them. I answer, the angel there is to be understood of 
    Christ, the Angel of the covenant, who offers up our prayers and puts His 
    incense on them to perfume them. Just so, Augustine expounds it. Angel 
    worship is prohibited, Colossians 2:9, "Let no man beguile you of your 
    reward in worshiping of angels." And what is praying to them but a part of 
    divine worship?</p>
<p align="justify">They distinguish between mediators of <i>redemption, </i>
    and <i>intercession</i>. They say they pray to Christ only as a mediator of 
    redemption—but to angels as mediators of intercession. To this I answer, 
    Christ is not only a Redeemer but an Advocate 1 John 2:1. He pleads our 
    cause like the advocate for the client. Now, as it is a sin to make any our 
    redeemer, but Christ—so it is a sin to make any our advocate but Christ. 
    Those who pray to angels make them their advocates. That we may not pray to 
    angels, I prove by two Scriptures. The first is Romans 10:14, "How then 
    shall they <i>call </i>on Him in whom they have not <i>believed</i>?" We may 
    not <i>pray </i>to any but whom we <i>believe </i>in. But we may not believe 
    in an angel; therefore, we may not pray to him. The second Scripture is 
    Hebrews 10:19, "Having boldness therefore to enter into the holiest by the 
    blood of Jesus." The argument is this: he only is to be prayed to, by whom 
    we have admission into heaven. By the blood of Jesus alone, we have 
    admission into heaven; therefore, He alone is to be prayed to. When the 
    angels can purchase for me an entrance into glory—then I will pray to 
    them—and not before!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">11. The next popish error, is their<i> image-worship.</i></p></b></font> 
    Pope Stephen the Third, maintaining images in temples, proclaimed their 
    veneration, and caused the people to burn incense to them. This is contrary 
    to the letter of the commandment, "Do not <i>make </i>idols of any kind. You 
    must never <i>worship </i>or bow down to them." Images are teachers of lies; 
    they represent God in a bodily shape. God said, "Let us make man in Our 
    image," Genesis 1:16. But the papists say, "Let us make God in our image!" 
    When the Lord delivered the Law, the people "heard His words but didn't see 
    His form; there was only a voice," Deuteronomy 4:12. God cannot be pictured 
    by any image. You cannot picture the <i>soul</i>—much less God, Isaiah 
    40:18, "To whom then will you liken God?" The papists tell us they worship 
    God by the image. I answer, if it is absurd to bow down to the picture of a 
    king—when the king himself is present—then much more to bow down to the 
    image when God Himself is present! Jeremiah 23:24, "<i>Do not I fill heaven 
    and earth, </i>says the Lord?"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">12. The next popish error, is that they deny that Christ 
    endured the pains of hell in His soul.</p></b></font> They are very rhetorical 
    in setting forth the torments of His body—but they deny the sufferings of 
    His soul. This opinion much derogates from Christ's sufferings, Isaiah 
    53:10, "You shall make His soul an offering for sin." Whatever would lessen 
    Christ's sufferings, would lessen Christ's love to us. Jesus Christ 
    underwent those pains which were equivalent to the pains of hell. He felt 
    the displeasure of the Almighty; He was in a soul-agony when He was 
    deserted. All which aggravates Christ's passion all the more—and declares 
    His compassion to us.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">13. The next popish error, is their assuming power to 
    themselves to absolve men of their oaths.</p></b></font> Ecclesiastes 5:4, "When 
    you make a vow to God, don’t delay fulfilling it, because He does not 
    delight in fools. Fulfill what you vow." But the papists make nothing of 
    absolving and freeing men from their oaths. They hold that the pope has 
    power to dispense with all vows made to God, and oaths of fidelity to 
    princes. The pope, having <i>Peter's key </i>in his hand, undertakes to 
    unlock men's consciences and loose them from all their obligations. How can 
    that be good doctrine, which teaches men how they may be perjured, yet 
    innocent? You who are the temples of the living God, take heed of defiling 
    yourselves with these popish doctrines. Do not pollute and adulterate your 
    souls by joining the temple of God to the house of demons. 2 Kings 5:18.<br/>
 
<p align="justify">Besides, these soul-poisoning doctrines in popery, I 
    shall show <font color="#0000ff"><b>what a detestable religion it is—where 
    you may see the wrinkled face of the whore of Rome!</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The Romish religion is an UNSCRIPTURAL religion.</p></b></font> 
    The papists cannot say as much, as once the devil said, "<i>It is written</i>." 
    They have not God's Word to show, for what they do. What Scripture have they 
    to show, for their <i>seven sacraments</i>? What Scripture have they to 
    show, for keeping the <i>cup </i>from the people? What Scripture have they 
    to show, for their dirges and pilgrimages, going many miles to visit the <i>
    shrines of saints</i>? The Lord will say to them at last, "Who has required 
    these things at your hand!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The Romish religion is a CARNAL religion.</p></b></font> 
    It consists only of worshipings, cringings, and penance. 1 Corinthians 3:3, 
    "Are you not carnal?" Whereas God will be worshiped in spirit, John 4:24. 
    Living by faith, examining the heart, mortifying sin—these things Catholics 
    are wholly strangers to. Popery is a mere <i>external shell</i>. It is a <i>
    carcass, </i>which has no soul in it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The Romish religion is an UNEDIFYING religion.</p></b></font> 
    1 Corinthians 14:12, "Let all things be done to edifying." But what edifying 
    is done in their ceremonies? Their candles, flowers; their 'Hail Marys'; 
    their incense, their beads, rings, medals, altar-clothes—what intrinsic 
    goodness can there be in these? They draw the heart <i>from </i>the serious 
    worship of God, causing it to mind <i>superstitious vanities!</i> What are 
    the baptizing of bells, adoring of crucifixes, and sprinkling with ashes—but 
    the deliriums of sick brains? Can these things purify the conscience? What 
    is there in <i>holy water </i>to wash a defiled soul? Will the papist's balm 
    and incense make them a sweet odor to God? Will their lighted candles show 
    them the way to heaven?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The Romish religion is a PROUD religion.</p></b></font> 
    The pope calls himself Peter's successor—but he more truly exceeds him in 
    pomp—than succeeds him in humility. The pope of Rome sets his mitre above 
    all temporal crowns. He calls himself "servant of the servants of God," but 
    he insults princes. He makes them stand barefoot at <i>his holiness' </i>
    gate and hold his stirrup. Pope Alexander the Third trod upon the neck of 
    Frederick the Emperor. The pope causes the monarchs of the earth to become 
    his tributaries.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The Romish religion is an IMMORAL religion.</p></b></font> 
    The papists are not the <i>holy </i>catholic church. At Rome, fornication 
    keeps open shop and is, in some cases, preferred before honorable matrimony. 
    The pope is called <i>his holiness</i>—but his chair is fouled. Pope Plus 
    the Second and Julius the Third were stained with vice. Some of their popes 
    have been guilty of sodomy, as Dr. Rivet relates out of their own writers. 
    Pope John was guilty of selling sacred things and murder.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. The Romish religion is a TOOTHLESS religion.</p></b></font> 
    It never hurts Satan. Popery is like a sword with a fine hilt—but has no 
    edge; or like weak medicine which will not work. Some of the popish writers 
    say that the <i>cross </i>is a holy charm or spell against the devil. But I 
    think that it rather <i>invites </i>the devil—than <i>frightens </i>him! 
    Their singing, and their prayers in Latin, is the devil's music. Their <i>
    whipping </i>themselves, will not let out the blood of one sin. There 
    lent-fasts will no more starve the devil, than it does their fat monks.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. The Romish religion is a BLOODY religion. </p></b></font>
    The pope does not content himself to have <i>Peter's key </i>in his hand, 
    the power of excommunication—but he gets the <i>civil sword </i>too. That 
    what he cannot defend by strength of argument, he may maintain by force of 
    violence. Popery is propagated by violence. Witness the persecution under 
    Pope <i>Pius </i>the Fourth, where multitudes of Christians were put to 
    death. Witness the many thousands of the Albigenses and Waldenses who were 
    cruelly murdered. Witness the Spanish inquisition, the massacre at Paris. 
    Our own nation has felt the weight of antichrist; they who would not drink 
    in the <i>golden cup of Rome's fornication </i>were forced to drink in the 
    bloody cup of martyrdom! We know the papists are good at <i>fireworks</i>. 
    It is an observation of a learned man that the persecutions under the bishop 
    of Rome have been far greater then those under the emperors of Rome. God 
    forbid we should ever nourish that <i>Italian wolf </i>which has sucked so 
    much blood!

    The papists hold:
<p align="justify">- That the pope is above Scripture; that he may dispense 
    with it, and that his <i>canons </i>bind more than the Word of God.</p>
<p align="justify">- That infallibility is a jewel of his mitre; in his 
    pontifical chair he cannot error.</p>
<p align="justify">- They hold that the virgin Mary is to be worshiped; they 
    give her veneration. They call her "the queen of the world", "the ladder of 
    heaven", "the gate of paradise". They say we may appeal from God's court—to 
    the Virgin Mary's court. They affirm that she is at the golden altar in 
    heaven—not only requesting mercy but commanding it. "God has decreed to give 
    nothing without her," said Ozorius the Jesuit. The papists honor the Virgin 
    Mary above Christ, ascribing more to her <i>milk</i>—than His <i>blood!</i> 
    In their doxologies they say, "Praise be to God and the Virgin Mary, and 
    also to Jesus Christ." What Christian ear can endure to hear these 
    blasphemies!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. The Romish religion is a RIDICULOUS religion</p></b></font>, 
    more fit to move to laughter, than devotion. What are their adoring of 
    relics—but a Romish toy! The papists pretend to show <i>Paul's chain </i>
    with which he was bound, and the tail of the donkey which Christ rode on. 
    They show John the Baptist's ear for a relic in Floride, his forehead in 
    Spain—yet his whole head they affirm is to be seen in Rome! Thus the Roman 
    faith is turned into a fable!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">10. The Romish religion is a GOD-PROVOKING religion.</p></b></font> 
    As if the Lord were not wise enough to appoint the manner of His own 
    worship—they will prescribe rules to Him. This sin has made God divorce a 
    people. Hosea 2:2, "She is no longer My wife, and I am no longer her 
    husband." It has made the fury to come up into His face. Ezekiel 6:4, "I 
    will cast down your slain men before your idols." Seeing you will be 
    kneeling to your idols—I will lay your dead men at the feet of your altars!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">11. The Romish religion is a SOUL-DESTROYING religion.
    </p></b></font>Worshiping the <i>beast, </i>and drinking the <i>cup of God's 
    wrath </i>are put together in Revelation 14:9. It is not clear to me how men 
    dying in the Roman religion, can be saved. For besides all that has been 
    said, the papists bring themselves directly under that curse, Revelation 
    22:18, "I solemnly declare to everyone who hears the prophetic words of this 
    book: If anyone adds anything to what is written here, God will add to that 
    person the plagues described in this book. And if anyone removes any of the 
    words of this prophetic book, God will remove that person's share in the 
    tree of life and in the holy city that are described in this book." The 
    papists are guilty of this: they take away from Scripture for they blot out 
    the second commandment; and they add to Scripture. They say that Scripture 
    is not perfect; therefore replace it with their traditions, which they hold 
    to be not only <i>equal </i>with Scripture, but <i>superior </i>to it.
<p align="justify">Oh, then, if we are the temples of God, let us not defile 
    ourselves with popery! Let us not receive the mark of the beast—either in 
    our right hand or forehead. For what agreement has the temple of God with 
    idols! It would be worse for us to embrace popery, than for our forefathers. 
    They lived in times of darkness and knew no better; but we, like Jonathan, 
    have tasted the <i>honey of the Gospel </i>and our eyes have been 
    enlightened. Therefore, if we should pollute ourselves with idols—what 
    judgment and fiery indignation might we expect! <i>"Keep yourselves from 
    idols!" </i>1 John 5:21</p>
