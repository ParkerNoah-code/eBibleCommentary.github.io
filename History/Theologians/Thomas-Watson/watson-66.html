<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Farewell Sermon</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify">(This sermon was given by Watson, on the eve of his ejection 
    from his church, because of his non-conformity to the <i>state </i>church.)</p>
<p align="justify">"Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, 
    or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you." 
    Philippians 4:9</p>
<p align="justify">The particular reason for my choice of this Scripture 
    this day, if you compare my present situation with the intent of the Apostle 
    in these words, you will easily understand. These words of the Apostle, 
    being part of the close of his epistle to the Philippians, are his <i>
    farewell </i>to them. It is known to you, that I must now be parted from 
    you; and I have pitched on this Scripture to be the close of my <i>twenty 
    years ministry </i>among you. </p>
<p align="justify">God has sent me among you to be a <b>builder</b>, and I 
    have chosen this text to be a <i>hammer </i>to fasten and drive home those 
    nails of <i>instruction </i>and <i>consolation, </i>which I have been so 
    long endeavoring to enter into you. God has sent me among you as a <b>
    fisherman</b>, and I have chosen these words to be the closing of the net. 
    Behold! Once more the net is spread, and I am now making my last cast. Oh, 
    that it might have the same good speed as Peter's had, Luke 5:6. It would 
    then pay the charges, though the net broke. God has sent me among you as a
    <b>farmer </b>to plow and to sow, and I am now come to cover what has been 
    sown. What my aim is in preaching, let it be yours in hearing. Oh, that both 
    preacher and hearers might heartily join in this desire! God speed the plow! 
    In this desire and hope, I drive on.</p>
<p align="justify">In the text observe a precept, a promise, and an entail 
    of the promise on the precept. In the precept we have, first, an act, "put 
    it into practice." Second, we have an object, "Whatever you have learned or 
    received or heard from me, or seen in me." The promise is in these words, 
    "the God of peace shall be with you." The entail of the promise on the 
    precept you have in the connective particle "and", which knits them 
    together. Do the work—and have the reward; obey the precept—and enjoy the 
    promise; "Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in 
    me--put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you." Be careful 
    of the former, and do not be anxious about the latter; if the precept is 
    performed, the promise shall be made good.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Doctrine 1. Christians must be <i>learners </i>before 
    they can be doers.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine 2. He has <i>learned </i>well who has learned to
    <i>do </i>well.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine 3. Christians' eyes, as well as their ears, may 
    help them on in piety. </p></b>The holy examples of ministers should be living 
    sermons to people. "Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, 
    or seen in me--put it into practice." Therefore, the Apostle exhorts, 
    Philippians 3:17, "Join with others in following my example, brothers, and 
    take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you." 1 
    Corinthians 11:1, "Be followers of me, as I am of Christ." That is, either, 
    "I have been a follower of Christ, be therefore followers of me"; or else, 
    "be followers of me as far as I have been a follower of Christ." 
<p align="justify">Those ministers may go off the stage with honor and 
    comfort, who have left behind them the good <i>seed </i>of sound doctrine, 
    and the good <i>savor </i>of a holy example. For my own part, what my 
    doctrine and manner of life has been among you—you are witnesses, and God 
    also. However, I have great reason to judge and condemn myself before the 
    Lord, and to bewail that my life has been less exemplary and useful than it 
    should have been! Yet I go off from you with this testimony upon my heart, 
    that I have not been of those who bind heavy burdens and lay them on other 
    men's shoulders—but will not touch them with one of their fingers. My 
    endeavor has been to press on my own soul, and hold out in my own practice, 
    that word of life which I have preached to you. Therefore, I am bold, in 
    this sense, to exhort you, in the words of the Apostle, "Be followers of me" 
    as far forth as you have seen me a follower of Christ."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 4. Godly ministers, when they are departing from 
    their people, would gladly leave God behind them. </p></b>Though it is not 
    unusual that, when the Lord sends them away, He goes with them. God and His 
    messengers often take their farewell of people together; yet their earnest 
    desire is that, though they must leave—yet the Lord would stay.
<b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 5. Faithful ministers would be messengers of 
    peace, going as well as coming.</p></b> As the Apostles' first words were to be, 
    "Peace be unto you", so some of this Apostles' last words were, "the God of 
    peace shall be with you."
<b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 6. Whenever ministers part with their people, if 
    they can but leave godliness in them, they shall certainly leave God with 
    them.</p></b> Those who obey the gospel, whatever or whomever they lack, shall 
    ever be in a peaceful and blessed condition.
<p align="justify">"Put it into practice", that is, live in the practice and 
    power of that doctrine of godliness "which you have received and heard", and 
    then fear not, "the God of peace shall be with you."</p>
<p align="justify">This doctrine I shall fully prove to you after I have 
    premised, first, the doctrine of godliness; the sum whereof take in these 
    four particulars.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">The Doctrine of Godliness</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">1. Jesus Christ, who came into the world to save 
    sinners—came also to sanctify and purge them from their sins.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Those who believe in Jesus must be careful to maintain 
    good works—and to live a godly life.</p>
<p align="justify">3. This godliness is not such a slight, easy, and empty 
    thing, as the mistaken world imagines. True godliness consists in an exact 
    conformity of the whole man, heart and life—to the whole will of God.</p>
<p align="justify">4. As whoever does not believe in Jesus cannot he 
    saved—so whoever is short of this true, sincere godliness cannot be saved.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the sum of that doctrine which I have preached 
    unto you, which, being the eternal truth of God, I herein embark my whole 
    soul and life, desiring to be found in that same Jesus, and to be found 
    walking in that same way of righteousness which I have declared unto you.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, my design and aim in preaching this doctrine to 
    you, has been to beget in you and, through the influence and assistance of 
    the eternal Spirit, to bring you to this true godliness</p></b>. </font>I have 
    travailed in birth with you that Christ might be formed in you; that I might 
    leave you possessors and partakers of that grace which accompanies 
    salvation; that your faith might stand not in the wisdom of men but in the 
    power of God; that your repentance might be repentance unto life not to be 
    repented of; that you might obey from the heart that form of doctrine which 
    has been delivered unto you; that you might stand complete in all the will 
    of God; that you might be holy and harmless, the children of God without 
    rebuke in the midst of a crooked generation, among whom you must shine as 
    lights in the world, holding forth the word of life; that, being rooted and 
    grounded in love, you might comprehend with all saints what is the height, 
    and depth, and length, and breadth, and might know the love of Christ which 
    passes knowledge, and be filled with all the fullness of God.To this end 
    have I taught everyone, and warned everyone, that I might present you 
    perfect in Christ Jesus.
<p align="justify">Third, that as far forth as the success has answered my 
    design and aim upon any of your souls, so far forth you stand entitled to 
    this glorious promise in the text, "the God of peace shall be with you." 
    Look how many souls there are among you—who live in the power and obedience 
    of those truths you have received. To so many I can, with confidence, give 
    this farewell of the Apostle without "ifs" or "ands" — "the God of peace 
    shall be with you." To whomever the Lord has been a God of <i>grace</i>, to 
    them will He be a God of <i>peace</i>. Whoever among you has this God of <i>
    grace </i>dwelling and ruling in you—shall certainly find this God of <i>
    peace </i>dwelling and abiding with you.</p>
<p align="justify">These things premised, <font color="#0000ff"><b>I shall 
    now give you the full proof of the doctrine, in the following reasons</b></font>. 
    The doctrine, you remember, is that those who obey the gospel, whatever or 
    whomever they lack, shall ever be in a peaceful and blessed condition. The 
    reasons are:</p>
<p align="justify">First, the God of peace shall be with them.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, if God is with them, all things whatever befall 
    them, shall make for their good.</p>
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">REASON 1. The God of peace shall be with them.</p></font> </b>
    Practice these things—live in the obedience of the holy Doctrine which you 
    have received—and the God of peace shall be with you. This glorious promise 
    is pregnant with all the blessings that heaven and earth can afford. If you 
    ask, "Why, what is there in it?" God is in the promise; all that is in God 
    is here assured to the godly. The philosophers of old attained to some 
    glimmerings of the excellencies which are in God, by these three ways:
<p align="justify">First, conceiving of Him as a Being removed from all 
    things signifying imperfection: as ignorance, impotence, iniquity, 
    corruptibility, alteration, or any limits or bounds of His essence, power 
    and glory.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, conceiving of Him as the Fountain of all other 
    beings; and thence concluding that, whatever excellencies or perfections are 
    scattered up and down in the whole creation—are all united in Him from whom 
    they had their original.</p>
<p align="justify">Third, by way of excellency; so that whatever perfection, 
    whatever goodness, is to be found in any creature, though it is not to be 
    found in God formally—yet there is that in Him, He being the first cause of 
    all, that infinitely, superabundantly, answers them all. Though there is not 
    the same specific excellencies in Him, nor those very pleasures and delights 
    issuing from Him which the creatures yield—yet there are such excellencies, 
    such perfections, as transcend and surpass them all. The Scriptures tell us 
    more positively and plainly that God is almighty, omniscient, omnipresent, 
    infinite, eternal, unchangeable, all-sufficient, holy, righteous, gracious, 
    the portion, the protection, the rewarder, yes, the exceeding great reward 
    of those who diligently seek Him. And this is He who is in the promise. God 
    is in the promise! I must not enlarge in this spacious field. I shall keep 
    nearer the text, and shall confine myself to these four particulars:</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. God is in the promise—as the God of PEACE, as the 
    Author</p>
<p align="justify">and bestower of peace.</p></b></font> The greatest of 
    blessings is the blessing of peace; peace has all blessings included in it. 
    It has possession, fruition, and security; it has plenty, pleasure, and 
    safety. Where there is no peace, there is no security for the holding, nor 
    opportunity of enjoying what we have. Whatever we have, we have it as if we 
    had it not. Peace is the greatest of blessings. 
<i>
<p align="justify">Peace with God </p></i>is the most glorious peace. What is 
    there that is excellent, what is there that is desirable— which is not 
    comprehended in this peace with God? Where there is peace, there is <i>
    pardon</i>. Guilt cannot consist with this peace; "being justified by faith, 
    we have peace with God." Where there is peace, there is <i>grace </i>and <i>
    holiness</i>; "There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked." Where there 
    is peace, there is <i>love </i>and <i>good will</i>. As love, so peace is 
    the union of hearts. "The God of peace is with you" signifies no less than 
    this: The Almighty God bears you good will. These two, peace and good will, 
    are twins: "on earth peace, and goodwill towards men." Where there is peace, 
    there is life, <i>everlasting life</i>; internal peace is the seed of 
    eternal peace. This peace is a portion; peace with God is our possession of 
    the God of peace. This peace is a sanctuary; if the God of peace is with us, 
    the peace of God will keep our hearts.
<p align="justify">Christians, in the world you must have trouble. Suppose 
    that you do have trouble—yet in Him you shall have peace, who has overcome 
    the world. Isaiah 26:3, "You will keep him in perfect peace (in<i> "peace, 
    peace," </i>as it is in the original) whose mind is stayed on You." Psalm 
    85:8, "I will hear what the Lord God will speak; He will speak peace to His 
    people and to His saints." What a clattering is there in the world! What 
    tumults and commotions are raised about the followers of Christ, as if the 
    world were falling about their ears! The devil speaks wrath; evil men speak 
    death and bonds to them, breathing out threatenings, reproaches, 
    persecutions against them. In the midst of all this fearful noise, whatever 
    men or devils speak—I will hearken, said the Psalmist, to what the Lord God 
    will speak. Oh, He will speak peace to His saints!</p>
<p align="justify">Let the sons of contention do what they can, the sons of 
    God shall be sons of peace. They shall live in peace; they shall die in 
    peace; they shall dwell in peace forever. Isaiah 32:17-18, "The work of 
    righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness shall be 
    quietness and assurance forever. And my people shall dwell in a peaceable 
    habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places." Oh, how 
    great is the peace they have, who love Your law! Christians, fear not to 
    follow God; let not that sad word, nor the fulfilling of it, scare you out 
    of your duty, "All who will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer 
    persecution." What if they do, while you are able to say, "I am 
    persecuted—but I have peace. I am poor—but I have peace; I am in a 
    prison—but I have peace; I am in a wilderness—but I have peace; though all 
    the world be against me, God is at peace; my soul is in peace." What 
    discouragement should all that be to you?"</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. He who is the God of peace—is the God of POWER. </p></b>
</font>He promises peace, and He promises no more than He can perform. He 
    can create peace. He can make their enemies to be at peace with them. He can 
    make a league for them with the beasts of the field, with the lions, with 
    the wolves, and with the most brutish among the people. He can say to the 
    proud winds and waves, "Peace, be still!" and they obey Him. He can give 
    them rest <i>from </i>the days of adversity; He can give them rest <i>in </i>
    the days of adversity; He can give his beloved sleep upon the points of 
    sword and spears.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. He who is the God of peace—is the God of PATIENCE.</p></b></font> 
    This is my great fear that, though God gives peace—yet I shall break my 
    peace. The God of peace is with me! Oh, this is He whom I trouble daily by 
    my distrusts, discontents, impatiences, murmurings. May such a heart have 
    the peace of God? What peace, so long as such unbelief, so much iniquity as 
    I find daily within me, remains upon me? Will He, with whom no iniquity can 
    dwell, dwell in that heart where there is so much iniquity, by which He is 
    provoked every day? But He who is the God of <i>peace</i>—is also the God of
    <i>patience</i>; who, though He will not bear the iniquities of His 
    adversaries—yet He will bear much with the <i>infirmities of His people</i>. 
    "But if his sons forsake my law and fail to walk in my ways, if they do not 
    obey my decrees and fail to keep my commands—then I will punish their sin 
    with the rod, and their disobedience with beating. But I will never stop 
    loving him, nor let my promise to him fail. No, I will not break my 
    covenant; I will not take back a single word I said." Psalm 89:30-34.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. He who is the God of peace—is the God of HOPE. </p></b>
</font>I have
<p align="justify">no peace in <i>possession</i>, whatever there is in the
    <i>promise</i>. I live in the fire; I am born a man of trouble. What 
    likelihood is there that I should ever live to see a good day? My comforts 
    are broken; my estate is lost; my liberty is gone; friends I have none; 
    enemies I have—many and mighty. I dwell in Mesech; I have my habitation in 
    the tents of Kedar; I am for peace—they are for war. Wherever I look, round 
    about me, before me, behind me, on the right hand or on the left—all speaks 
    trouble and terror to me. I have no peace.</p>
<p align="justify">What, do you have no <i>hope </i>of peace, either? Where 
    is your God, man? Have you a <i>God </i>in you—and yet no <i>hope </i>in 
    you? The God of peace-and yet no peace! The God of hope—and yet no hope! 
    "The God of hope will yet fill you with joy and peace in believing," Romans 
    15:13. "Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put 
    your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God." Psalm 
    43:5. The <i>God </i>of hope will open a <i>window </i>of hope in the 
    darkest times—and a <i>door </i>of hope in the most desperate cases. The God 
    of hope will bear up the spirits of His saints in hope, against hope; and 
    this hope will never disappoint them. It shall never be said, "there is no 
    peace, there is no hope," until it can be said "there is no God in Israel."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">But how, or in what sense, is it to be understood, that 
    this God of peace will be with us?</p></b></font> I answer in three particulars:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The HEART of God will be with you.</p></b></font> Joseph's 
    blessing, "the good will of Him who dwelt in the bush" will be your portion, 
    Deuteronomy 33:16. What was that bush? The church of God. What case was the 
    bush in? It was all on fire; it was all in a flame. Who was it who dwelt in 
    the bush? God was in the bush—and that kept it from <i>consuming</i>, though 
    not from <i>burning</i>. The good will of this God shall be with you—His 
    love, His favor, His care. "I love those who love Me," Proverbs 8:17. "The 
    Lord loves the righteous," Psalm 146:8. The love of God, is the womb of all 
    good. Hence sprang "the morning-star"; from the <i>love </i>of God, came the
    <i>Son </i>of God. Hence came that "womb of the morning", the blessed gospel 
    which is so big with glorious grace, with light, life, pardon, peace, glory, 
    immortality; from the love of God came the glorious gospel of God. "The <i>
    upper </i>springs"—all spiritual and heavenly blessings, "the <i>nether </i>
    springs"—all earthly and outward blessings—all rise and bubble up out of 
    this fountain, the love of God. 
<p align="justify">The precious things of heaven, the precious fruits 
    brought forth by the sun, the precious fruits put forth by the moon, the 
    chief things of the ancient mountains, the precious things of the lasting 
    hills, the precious things of the earth, and the fullness thereof, all these 
    flow in with "the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush."</p>
<p align="justify">Love is all. The Apostle tells us that <i>our </i>love to 
    God is the fulfilling of the <i>law</i>; that is, it will bring forth all 
    that to God, all that duty and obedience, which the law requires. I may tell 
    you that God's love to us is the fulfilling of the <i>gospel</i>; that is, 
    it will pour down all that upon us; it will do all that for us, which the 
    gospel promises. Look over the whole gospel; read and study every precious 
    leaf and line of</p>
<p align="justify">that blessed book and, if there is enough in all that to 
    make you blessed and to encourage you on in your holy course—all this is 
    yours! You have that love of God with you—which will fulfill the Gospel. 
    There shall not one jot or tittle fail you, of all that the Gospel promises. 
    "The zeal of the Lord Almighty will perform this," Isaiah 9:7.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The HELP of God will be with you</p></b></font>—the Lord 
    will be your Helper in the day of your distress. Hebrews 13:5-6, "He has 
    said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you." So that we may boldly say, 
    "The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto me." He has 
    said, "I will not leave you", and, therefore, we may say, "I will not fear." 
    He has said, "I will be your helper", and, therefore, we may boldly say, 
    "The Lord is my helper." He has said that He will not forsake you, He will 
    help you.
<p align="justify">Our case may be so desperate—as to be above all <i>human
    </i>help. If one should cry out, as the woman to the king of Israel, "Help, 
    O king!" the king must answer, "If the Lord does not help you, whence shall 
    I help you?" If he cries out, "Help! Oh, my friends!" all these must answer, 
    "If the Lord does not help you, how shall we help you?" But what case is 
    there in which a "Help Lord!" will not do? Foolish men count their case 
    desperate, when they come to their <i>"God help!"</i> That is a usual 
    expression to set forth the extremity and helplessness of any man's case. 
    When we see men lost in any misery, and their case utterly hopeless—then to 
    signify our sense of such men's lost condition, we cry out, "God help that 
    man! God help that woman! They are lost creatures!" Aye—but if men 
    understood and considered what the help of the Lord is, they would see there 
    could be no case so desperate but a <i>"Help, Lord!" </i>might recover all, 
    1 Samuel 30:6. When David was greatly distressed, and all was gone, "he 
    encouraged himself in the Lord His God." Consider here two things:</p>
<p align="justify">What his <i>case </i>was. He was in great distress; he 
    had lost all that he ever had. His spoils that he had taken were all gone; 
    his grain, his cattle, his wives and his city were all lost. He did not have 
    a habitation in all the world; he had nothing left him but a poor army, and 
    these were worse than lost. They were even ready to turn against him. "The 
    people spoke of stoning him—but he encouraged himself in the Lord his God."</p>
<p align="justify">What the <i>outcome </i>was. Why, God helped him to all 
    he had again; verse 19, "There was nothing lacking to them, neither small 
    nor great, neither sons nor daughters; neither spoil, nor anything they had 
    taken: David recovered all." Hence note that <i>a Christian, when he has 
    lost all, has yet a God to go to at last. </i>While a Christian has a God to 
    go to, his case is never desperate. Let him but encourage himself in his 
    God—and all will be recovered. </p>
<p align="justify">When Christians are at their worst, when they are brought 
    as low as the pride and malice of the ungodly can lay them, though they 
    should be stripped naked and left destitute of all their comforts, though 
    all the world should ride on their backs and tread on their necks—yet do not 
    rejoice against the poor people of God. Though they fall, they shall arise; 
    when they are at their worst, there is still help for them in their God.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The PRESENCE of the Lord shall be with them. </p></b>
</font>Wherever
<p align="justify">they may be scattered, they shall not be scattered from 
    their God. That promise made to Moses, Exodus 33:14, "My presence shall go 
    with you", belongs to all the Israel of God. "My presence"; in the original 
    it is, "My face"; in the Septuagint, "Myself shall go with you."</p>
<p align="justify">The presence of God is either <i>general</i>, or <i>
    special</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">By His <b>general </b>presence, He is everywhere. He 
    fills all things. He beholds all things. He upholds all things. He governs 
    all things. But I will let this pass, as it is not so proper to our purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">There is His <b>special </b>or <b>gracious </b>presence, 
    whereby He manifests Himself to be with His people. This He does three ways:</p>
<p align="justify">1. In some visible tokens of His presence; as in those <i>
    extraordinary </i>tokens—the pillars of the cloud and of the fire; and in 
    those <i>ordinary</i> tokens—the ark and the temple of old, and the 
    ordinances of the gospel now.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In some inward influences upon the heart of His 
    people.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In some visible and signal effects of His presence, 
    whereof there are very many. There are, among others, these two notable 
    effects of God's gracious presence, which His people, by virtue of this 
    promise, may with confidence expect: <i>guidance </i>and <i>protection</i>. 
    They shall be led in their way; and they shall be hidden in their way.</p>
<p align="justify">First, <b>guidance</b>. The Lord will be with them to <i>
    lead </i>them and <i>guide </i>them in the way that they should go. Psalm 
    25:9, "The meek will He guide in judgment, the meek will He teach His way." 
    Psalm 107:7, "He led them forth by the <i>right </i>way, that they might go 
    to a city of habitation." Psalm 5:8, "Lead me, O Lord, in Your 
    righteousness, because of my enemies; make Your way straight before my 
    face." The Lord leads His people in their way chiefly by His Word, which is 
    a light to their feet, and a lantern to their paths; and, sometimes, also by 
    His providences, hedging up all byways, and leaving but one way open to 
    them, which has the least appearance of the way of God; so ordering the 
    matter, that any other way that is before them looks with too foul a face, 
    to leave any doubt upon them whether it is the way of God or not. </p>
<p align="justify">It is never uncomfortable to the people of God, while 
    they see their way before them; <i>doubts </i>about their way are more 
    perplexing than <i>dangers </i>in their way. When they know what God would 
    have them do, they can cheerfully trust Him for anything they are likely to 
    suffer. Do you meet with wolves or lions in the way? You may bless God it is 
    there you meet them; it would be ill meeting them elsewhere.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, <i>protection </i>in their way. Psalm 31:20, "You 
    shall hide them in the secret of your presence, from the pride of man; you 
    shall keep them secretly in a pavilion, from the strife of tongues. You 
    shall hide them in Your presence, or face." Your light shall be their dark 
    place to cover them. "You are my hiding place," Psalm 32:7. "In the secret 
    of Your presence." The saint's hiding place is a secret: such where neither 
    the pride of man can find them, nor can they understand what it is. 
    Reproaches shall not find those whose souls are hidden in God; they are not 
    found when they are found. They are hidden when they seem to lie most open 
    and most exposed to men's will and lust.</p>
<p align="justify">Sinners do not understand what <i>refuge </i>the saints 
    have in God. It is a great secret, a mystery to them. As the joy of the 
    saints, the comforts of the saints, are a secret—a stranger cannot 
    understand his joy. They do not understand what kind, or how great security; 
    what <i>sure </i>nor <i>sweet </i>repose the saints find in God. The secret 
    of God's presence is a sure and a sweet resting place for all His saints; 
    but how sure and how sweet, no man knows but those who enjoy it. The secret 
    intimations of the <i>care </i>of God for them—-of His everlasting <i>
    kindness </i>to them, of His <i>governing hand </i>in all that befalls them, 
    working it to their greater good; the secret <i>supports </i>and <i>
    refreshings </i>darted in like the beams of His countenance; their secret 
    sense of their <i>safety—</i>will yield such rest in the day of greatest 
    adversity, as men can neither see—nor take from them. </p>
<p align="justify">The pillar of the cloud interposed—-both hindered the 
    Egyptians' pursuit—and hid from their eyes the comfort of that light which 
    shone upon the camp of Israel. Moses knew what the comfort of <i>God's 
    presence </i>meant when he said, Exodus 33:15, "If your Presence does not go 
    with us, do not send us up from here!" Israel was then in a wilderness, 
    among wild beasts, among briars and thorns, in a weary pilgrimage; but they 
    had God among them! The Lord was carrying them to Canaan, the land of their 
    rest, a land flowing with milk and honey; but Moses prayed, "If your 
    Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here!" We would rather 
    be where we are, in a wilderness with God, than go to Canaan and leave our 
    God behind us! If Your presence goes with us, we are willing to go when You 
    will; where You will, which way You will; though through the armies of 
    enemies. We will go anywhere as long as God goes with us. The absence of God 
    makes a <i>Canaan </i>worse than a <i>wilderness</i>; the presence of God 
    makes a <i>wilderness </i>better than a <i>Canaan</i>. And this presence of 
    God shall be the lot of all His saints.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">REASON 2. If God is with you, all shall work for your 
    eternal good.</p></b></font> All providential occurrences and events whatever, 
    all difficulties, straits, disasters, disappointments whatever that may come 
    upon you—shall work for your eternal good. Roman 8:31, "If God is with us, 
    who can be against us?" Who can be against us? That is, <i>none </i>can be 
    against us; or, if any is—yet those who are <i>against </i>you, shall be <i>
    for </i>you. Genesis 43:36, Said old Jacob, "all these things are <i>against
    </i>me!" But yet, as old as he was, he lived to see all these things working
    <i>for </i>him. Romans 8:28, "We know all things shall work together for 
    good, to those that love God." This is such a promise as, if it were 
    thoroughly believed, would set our feet on the necks of all our fears and 
    dangers, and will prove the truth of Samson's riddle, "From the one who eats 
    came something to eat; out of the strong came something sweet." 
<p align="justify">Now, because there is so great encouragement to godliness 
    in it, I shall spend the more time in enlarging upon it; and shall show:</p>
<p align="justify">First, what those things are which are especially 
    intended in that comprehensive term "all things."</p>
<p align="justify">Second, what that good is which these things shall work 
    to.</p>
<p align="justify">Third, to whom these things shall work for good.</p>
<p align="justify">Fourth, how these things shall work for good.</p>
<p align="justify">Fifth, that they shall undoubtedly work for good to them 
    that love God.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">First, what those things are which are especially 
    intended in that comprehensive term "all things."</p></b></font> There are some, 
    like Augustine and others, who understand it universally, of all things 
    whatever, whether good or evil. Even the <i><b>sins of the saints </b></i>
    work together for their good. God often brings good out of these evils, 
    making use of former sins, to be forces against future sins. There is 
    nothing which makes the sinner more weary and wary of sin--than sin itself. 
    The review of the evils we have done--often frightens us from doing any 
    more. When you look back on sin and see its horrid face--you will fear it 
    the more whenever you meet it again. There is no argument which more 
    effectually humbles and breaks the heart, and makes it more fearful and 
    watchful against sin--than the shame and the smart of those sins we have 
    fallen by! This is true—God often makes use of sin to be its own cure; and, 
    therefore, it is sometimes seen that the chief of <i>sinners </i>have come 
    to be the chief of <i>saints</i>. 
<p align="justify">Yet, besides that, this is not the subject matter that 
    the Apostle here treats. Let those who bring sin within the compass of this 
    promise—that even all the sins of the saints shall work for their good; let 
    such tell us, how or in what way it is imaginable that the sinful decays of 
    such who backslide from God and never recover to their former life and 
    vigor, but live and die in a languishing state of soul; let them tell us how 
    such sins can be imagined to work for their good. Until then we must enter 
    our dissent from this interpretation. This, then, is not the sense of the 
    promise—that all sins shall work together for good. And yet, if it were, it 
    would be but a poor argument to take the more liberty to sin—because God 
    will turn it to good. This would be as rational as for a man to tear his 
    flesh, break his bones, pluck out his eyes, and burn his house—because God 
    will turn all his suffering to good. He is little better than mad—who would 
    not conclude such a man out of his wits.</p>
<p align="justify">Others say that this promise pertains to the <b>evil 
    things </b>which befall the saints, their sufferings and afflictions; to 
    that vanity, and those vexations they are in bondage under, and under which, 
    with the whole creation, they groan and travail in pain, waiting for their 
    redemption, of which the Apostle had been treating in the former part of the 
    chapter. And yet, while they pitch the sense especially on such things as 
    these, they grant it may be extended to all other things, sin only excepted; 
    to all things and events, whether prosperous or afflicting.</p>
<p align="justify">These I take to have hit it right. All <i>troublesome </i>
    things, all the <i>sufferings </i>and <i>afflictions </i>of the saints, and 
    not only these—but all other things whatever, which in the whole course of 
    Providence are their lot or portion, all the dealings of God with them, all 
    the dispensations of Providence towards them—shall all work for their good.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, in what sense, all things may be said to work 
    good to them.</p></b></font> The sense in general is this: they shall all work 
    to their welfare. They shall all happen to them for the better; there shall 
    nothing befall them, but one time or other they shall have reason to say, 
    "It was well for me that it was thus with me. The wisdom and goodness of God 
    cut out such portions continually for me, led me through such a series and 
    succession of cases and events which, though I could not understand—yet now 
    I see that every <i>condition</i>, every <i>contingency </i>and <i>
    occurrence </i>of my life, through which Providence led me—was useful and 
    could not well have been omitted, but it would have been the worse for me." 
    Thus, the promise in the <i>general</i>.
<i>
<p align="justify">Particularly</p></i>, for the fuller understanding what good 
    it is that all things work to, consider that there is a <i>twofold good </i>
    of the saints: 
<p align="justify">1. such as they obtain and enjoy while they are in their 
    way or course;</p>
<p align="justify">2. such as they shall obtain when they have gotten to the
    <i>end </i>of their way, when they are come to their place. </p>
<p align="justify">Or thus: there is a <i>threefold good </i>of the saints:</p>

<p align="justify">1. <i>temporal </i>good</p>
<p align="justify">2. <i>spiritual </i>good</p>
<p align="justify">3. <i>eternal </i>good</p>

<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Temporal good</p></b></font>, or the outward good things 
    of this life, which may serve and please, and delight us in these days of 
    our pilgrimage; which may abide with us and attend us to our graves—but 
    there will take their leave of us.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Spiritual good</p></b></font>, which is either: 
<p align="justify">(1) <b>External </b>good, as the ordinances of God, the 
    light, liberties, and privileges of the gospel, the society, and communion 
    of saints, and our peaceful and plentiful enjoying of them; or </p>
<p align="justify">(2) <b>Internal </b>good, as spiritual grace, faith, 
    love, hope, and patience.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Eternal good</p></b></font>, or that glory and joy, that 
    everlasting rest and peace, the possession of that incorruptible, and 
    undefiled inheritance, which is reserved in heaven for us. Now here note 
    these things:
<b>
<p align="justify">First, our outward good things</p></b> are only good for 
    us—as they are conducive to the good of our souls. This world is but a 
    nursery for eternity. We are planted in this world—in order to our 
    transplanting into the eternal world; and whatever we have here is either 
    good or evil according to the respect that it bears to the eternal world. As 
    far forth as our <i>immortal </i>part is improved by these perishing 
    things—so far forth only, are they good for us. He who has this world's 
    goods—and is not hereby made more rich towards God; he who prospers in this 
    world—and yet his soul does not prosper; much more, he whose worldly 
    fullness becomes the emptiness and leanness of his soul—are these good 
    things good for him? Is he in prosperity upon a true account—whose soul does 
    not prosper? 
<p align="justify">It cannot be universally said, that it is good to be 
    rich; it is good to be in health; it is good to be in honor; it is good to 
    be at liberty. The <i>contrary </i>may sometimes be true. It is good to be 
    poor, to be sick, to be in disgrace, to be in bonds. The necessity of our 
    souls often requires it. Then alone, is it good to be full and to 
    abound—when our outward abundance furthers our spiritual welfare.</p>
<p align="justify">Christians, our outward good things are only good for 
    us—as far forth as they conduce to our spiritual good. Could we receive this 
    truth and live under the power of it—what a different judgment would we then 
    have of all these worldly matters from what we now have! And how strangely 
    would the course of the world he then changed! Would there then be such 
    violent and eager pursuing these carnal things? Would there then be such 
    whining, complaining, and murmuring at every <i>cross </i>providence? We 
    would then say, "This may be good for me; good for my soul—however sad it 
    looks!"</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Second, external spiritual good things</p></b>—the ministry 
    and ordinances of the gospel—are good to us as far as they conduce to our 
    eternal spiritual good; and they, being ordinarily so, it must be concluded 
    that, ordinarily, it is good for us that we enjoy them, and are not deprived 
    of them. God may see cutting Christians short of those privileges and 
    liberties to be sometimes needful for them; and then even this also makes 
    for their good.
<b>
<p align="justify">Third, our inward spiritual good</p></b> is good for us, so 
    far as it tends to our eternal good; and, therefore, grace is ever good for 
    us. It is always true that it is good to be holy, good to be humble, to live 
    in the fear of God, and to flourish in His grace. We may have too much money 
    or too much material things—but we can never have too much grace. Our 
    greatest flourishing and fruitfulness in grace, will certainly abound to our 
    more full reward.
<b>
<p align="justify">Fourth</p></b>, note that this is the plain sense and meaning 
    of the promise, "all things shall work for good." That is, <b>whatever 
    befalls us—shall certainly promote our internal and eternal welfare</b>. And 
    as far as the outward privileges of the gospel, yes, and the good things of 
    this life, conduce towards this—all shall work for good. If it is good for 
    us to be rich, if it is good for us to be in honor, good for us to be at 
    liberty—good for our souls, good in reference to our eternal state, if it is 
    good for us that we enjoy the ministry of the gospel—there shall nothing 
    befall us, which shall hinder us. There shall be nothing lacking to us, that 
    might further our good.
<p align="justify">The sum is that all providential dispensations shall he 
    so ordered that we shall lack nothing but what it is better to lack—than 
    have. We shall suffer nothing but what we cannot well be without—but what 
    the good of our souls requires. That which we possess, and that which we 
    suffer, shall not fail to bring about its end—the advancing of our eternal 
    good.</p>
<p align="justify">And if this is the meaning, what a glorious promise is 
    this! What more can any rational man desire! Nothing shall befall him—but 
    shall be for his good! He shall be deprived or kept short of nothing—but 
    what it is better to be without than have. He who is unsatisfied with this 
    promise, it is either from lust or unbelief. Either he does not believe that 
    God is true and will perform this word—or else it is because</p>
<p align="justify">his lust must be satisfied. He who desires a large 
    worldly estate, ease, pleasure, liberty, or anything else upon any other 
    terms but as they may be for his eternal and spiritual good—has as much lost 
    his wits as his faith. And he who will take upon him to know what is good 
    for him, better than God—may as well take upon him the government of the 
    world. You may, with as good reason, desire a fever or a cancer that you may 
    have the pleasure of your drink—as for the pleasures that carnal things 
    would bring you in to desire them, when they would be a snare to your souls.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, to WHOM these things shall work for good?</p></b></font> 
    To those who love God—to those who are called according to His purpose—to 
    the people of God who you see are here described by their election and 
    effectual calling—the called according to His purpose and their 
    sanctification; those who love God. Love God—and you will live in the 
    obedience of His whole will. These are the people to whom the promise is 
    made; prove your calling and election, prove your sanctification, and you 
    may write your names in this glorious promise:<i> all things shall work for 
    your good!</i> 
<p align="justify">To those who are rebels and reprobates from God, all 
    things shall work together for evil. While <i>hurtful </i>things work 
    together for <i>good </i>to the saints—all <i>good </i>things work together 
    for the <i>hurt </i>of sinners. Their <i>peace </i>hurts them; their <i>
    plenty </i>hurts them; their <i>pleasure </i>hurts them; yes, both their <i>
    prosperity </i>and <i>adversity</i>, their <i>plenty </i>and their <i>
    poverty</i>, their <i>pleasure </i>and their <i>trouble</i>, their <i>honor
    </i>and <i>disgrace</i>, everything which befalls them, turns to their harm. 
    Their <i>prosperity </i>destroys them; their <i>table </i>is their snare; 
    their <i>pleasures </i>are their plagues; and their very <i>punishments </i>
    are turned into sin! Everything which befalls them, heightens and hardens 
    them in their wickedness, and ripens them for God's vengeance. God is not <i>
    with </i>them and, therefore, nothing prospers with them. God is with His 
    saints and, therefore, nothing comes amiss to them—but all for their greater 
    advantage. Christians, this is your portion and your privilege, wherein the 
    men of this world shall neither partake with you, nor ever be able to 
    deprive you of it!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Fourthly, HOW all things work for their good</p></b></font>. 
    How shall the evil things, the sufferings of this life, be for their good? 
    How can this be? Must we disbelieve our senses, and forfeit our reason, 
    before we can believe the Scriptures? Must we call evil good—and good evil? 
    Must we count darkness light—and light darkness? Is pleasure pain—and pain 
    pleasure? Is loss gain—and gain loss? Is ease torment—and torment ease? Does 
    religion make things cease to be what they are—and to be what they are not? 
    Or at least, must we believe that darkness is the mother of light—that good 
    is the daughter of evil? Can we gather grapes from thorn bushes—or figs from 
    thistles? Can darkness gives light—or death itself brings forth life? <i>How 
    can these things be?
</i>
<p align="justify">But must God give a reason for His actions? Though <i>
    evil </i>cannot bring good; and <i>darkness </i>cannot bring forth light; 
    yet <i>God </i>can bring forth good out of evil—and light out of darkness! 
    Though darkness cannot bring forth light and evil cannot bring forth good by 
    a natural causation; yet <i>God </i>can make evil an occasion of good! 
    Though the torment the medicine puts men to, is not ease—yet may it not work 
    towards ease? The storm, though it does not help—yet it may hasten the 
    laborer on his work or the traveler on his way. May not the darkness of the 
    night, make us more diligent in the day? May not <i>sickness</i> teach men 
    more temperance; and <i>poverty </i>teach men more frugality?</p>
<p align="justify">But to proceed more distinctly, how can the saints' evil 
    things work to their good? That they do so cannot be denied—unless we will 
    deny Scripture and common sense and experience. But how does it come to 
    pass? I answer in four particulars:</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The afflictions and tribulations of the saints are the 
    way that leads them on to the possession of that good which God has intended 
    to them.</p></b></font> <i>Afflictions </i>are the way of the kingdom; the <i>
    cross </i>is the way to the <i>crown</i>. Acts 14:22, "Through many 
    tribulations we <i>must </i>enter into the kingdom of God." Psalm 66:11-12, 
    "You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs. You let men ride 
    over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a 
    place of abundance." Observe it, their <i>troubles </i>are their way to 
    their <i>triumph</i>; their very falling into the net is their way to 
    escape. Their enemies boast, "Escape! Arise! Yes, let them free themselves 
    with such hopes while they will; we have them sure enough. We have them 
    under foot; we have them in the net. If this is their way, we will keep them 
    in their way long enough! Now we have them down, they shall not be able to 
    rise." Aye—but yet it appears, through all this, that the Lord led them 
    forth into a place of abundance.
<p align="justify">When Israel was to go to Canaan, they had the 
    brick-kilns, the Red Sea, the wilderness, and the Jordan River in their way. 
    Could anyone have imagined that the bondage, the straits they were under, 
    the doubling of their tasks, the cruelty of their taskmasters, their 
    enclosure at the Red Sea—meant any good to them? Yet how did it fall out at 
    last? Their darkest dispensations had light in their latter end; their 
    greatest bondage led to their greatest liberty. Every cross providence is a 
    step to the accomplishment of the promise. The wheel is ever moving on to 
    its end. It moves forward even when it seems to go quite backward. The 
    river, by its many turnings and windings, forward and backwards, is still in 
    motion to the sea when it seems to be running quite contrary. </p>
<p align="justify">Christians, if ever the salvation of God seems to be 
    removed farther from you, if the work of God should at any time seem to go 
    backward, if cross-winds should turn the whole course so that you appear 
    rather to be marching <i>back </i>to Egypt than <i>on </i>to Canaan—yet be 
    not discouraged. Though your way is an <i>unlikely </i>and <i>unpromising
    </i>way, though you are led about forwards and backwards—yet still you are 
    moving on! Though the <i>lesser </i>wheels are never so cross and contrary 
    in their motions—yet the <i>great </i>wheel is still moving right on to your 
    blessed and hoped end. God intends your good—your spiritual good here, your 
    eternal good hereafter. And believe it now, for He will let you see it 
    hereafter—that those very things which most threaten your undoing, and a 
    total abortion of your hopes—are all made to concur to bringing them about, 
    and to your more full and speedy possession of them.</p>
<p align="justify">Note further here other things:</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(1) All things work for their good</p></b>. Not they <i>shall
    </i>work—but they <i>do </i>work. The work is already on the wheel, and 
    every wheel is in its motion, works for you; not only your brethren, the 
    saints and angels, who are all praying for your peace and seeking your good, 
    but your enemies also. The dragon, with all his armies, is at work for you; 
    all the councils of this world are already sitting upon the very matter. God 
    has called them together for this purpose; the pope, with all his conclave, 
    the Jesuits, priests, monks and friars, with all their conventicles; yes, 
    the devil, with all his conclave of hell—are all at work for the good of 
    saints!
<p align="justify">It is true, they do not mean nor intend any such thing; 
    their designs are <i>against </i>you. They reckon that they are working for 
    themselves; as it is said concerning the Assyrian, "Woe to the Assyrian, the 
    rod of my anger, in whose hand is the club of my wrath! I send him against a 
    godless nation, I dispatch him against a people who anger me, to seize loot 
    and snatch plunder, and to trample them down like mud in the streets. But 
    this is not what he intends, this is not what he has in mind; his purpose is 
    to destroy, to put an end to many nations." Isaiah 10:5-7. God sent him 
    forth upon a design of His own, to execute His counsel in the punishing of 
    hypocrites, to purge out the chaff from the wheat. Nevertheless, he does not 
    intend so, nor does his heart think so. The Assyrian minds not what God's 
    design is—but follows his own design, fights for himself and conquers for 
    himself; but God's design is still carried on by him—though he thinks not of 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">All the events in the world are driving the same way. 
    Every disease or infirmity which comes upon you, every loss that you 
    sustain, every scoff or reproach that you suffer, the shame in your faces, 
    the sorrow of your hearts, the torment in your affections, the aches in your 
    bones—are all working your good. All the changes of your conditions, your 
    fair weather and your foul weather, your sunshine and your clouds, your 
    plenty and your poverty, your health and your pains, your liberties and your 
    prisons—are all working for you. Your good is already working by all these 
    things. See, Christians, what a harvest of blessedness is growing up to 
    you—out of this promise! The seed is already sowing; your good is already 
    working; God is at work; the whole creation is at work; men and angels, good 
    men and evil men, friends and enemies, heaven, and earth, and hell—are 
    already engaged to work your good!</p>
<p align="justify">They <i>work together</i>; that is, as some understand 
    it, <i>they work together with God</i>. All these second causes work 
    together with the first cause. Or, as others understand it, <i>they work 
    together among themselves</i>. There is such a uniting and concentrating of 
    these second causes in the same design that, however they seem to thwart, 
    cross, and destroy—yet they are all united in their end. They jointly 
    contribute to the welfare of the saints. Though, if I mistake not, this 
    latter is the best sense of the two—yet I know no reason why both may not be 
    understood. </p>
<p align="justify">In the hand, and under the presence, of Providence—all 
    these lower things concur and co-operate in the good of the believer. By the 
    way, observe what a harmony there is in all the works of Providence. The 
    most cross and thwarting occurrences all conspire, and go hand in hand, to 
    bring about the same end. As the differing virtues of various drugs all 
    concur to make up the <i>medicine</i>; as the differing sounds of several 
    strings or instruments all together make up the <i>melody</i>; as the 
    differing colors in a picture, the dark as well as the bright, jointly 
    contribute to the beauty of the <i>painting</i>—no less do the most contrary 
    and contradictory actions and events both make up the beauty of Providence, 
    and jointly subserve that one end to which, by an unseen hand and an 
    all-seeing eye, they are directed and intended.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(2) The evil things which befall the saints, come upon 
    them to keep out <i>worse </i>things.</p></b> Wherever the cross comes, if it 
    had not come, something worse might. The <i>cross </i>may be a means to 
    secure from the <i>curse</i>; the curse was slain on the cross of Christ, 
    and our cross also has its use: to deliver us from it. 1 Corinthians 11:32, 
    "We are chastened by the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the 
    world." I would have died—if I had not suffered. It is no bad exchange to 
    have a <i>cross </i>instead of a <i>curse</i>.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3) The evil things of the saints, prepare them for <i>
    better </i>things;</p></b> that they may work good for them, they are working 
    them to good, working out their sin and iniquity, wearying them of sin. 
    Hosea 2:6, "I will hedge up her way with <i>thorns</i>—then shall she say, I 
    will return". <i>Sin brought afflictions into the world—and afflictions help 
    to carry sin out! </i>The cross to which sin was once nailed—is not nailed 
    to sin; the saints can seldom be meddling with sin but they find it too 
    heavy for them. Our Lord beats the devil with His own weapons, by those very 
    means purging His saints by which he endeavors to pollute them; making those 
    very persecutions by which he labors to force them from holiness—to fix them 
    in it.
<p align="justify">Christians, comfort your hearts. Those floods that are 
    cast against you shall but wash you the whiter, and make you more fit to be 
    partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. Your <i>purgatory </i>
    prepares you for your <i>paradise</i>. No unclean thing must enter in there, 
    and you are not likely to be made so clean as by falling into the hands of 
    the unclean. The saints never look so well, like sheep come from the 
    washing, as when they come up from the pots. Their very black makes them 
    lovely. Oh, Christians! What a comfort would it be if your experiences might 
    come in and seal to this truth; if you could say, "Thus it has been with me: 
    Before I was afflicted I went astray. I was proud, vain, wanton, slothful, 
    and carnal—but now have I kept Your Word!"</p>
<p align="justify">Sinners, whatever your mind is in persecuting the saints, 
    never think to debauch them by it. If that is your aim, you mistake your 
    course. The living spark which God has kindled in them will not be blown <i>
    out</i>—but will be blown <i>up </i>by your puffing at it. The dirt you cast 
    upon them only scours them the brighter. You take the best course you can to 
    keep them closer to the Lord and His way; the warm sun will more hazard the 
    casting off of their garments—than the blustering wind. Let them alone; the 
    Spirit of the Lord within them, will be too hard for hell with all its black 
    regiments, and will not only secure them but advance them yet higher by all 
    their assaults. These stars shine the brightest, when the night is darkest. 
    When you have done your worst, it will be the better with them; though they 
    will not thank you—yet they will thank God for what they have suffered by 
    you. If this is your aim, to make them like yourselves, you may give over 
    such a vain attempt. Your fury is likely to do as little to force them, as 
    your sins are to invite them to a compliance with you. Your faces are too 
    foul to draw them into your love, and yet not fierce enough to drive them 
    into your fear. Satan, try your utmost strength and skill, and if you lose 
    not by your own play at last, if you do not find the poor people of God 
    gotten nearer heaven by your attempts of plucking them down to hell—then let 
    your lies be believed before the everlasting gospel!</p>
<p align="justify">Christians, make me not ashamed in this same confident 
    boasting of you. Yes, do not deny your God by allowing yourselves to be 
    corrupted by evil men. The Lord's glory relies upon your integrity and 
    steadfastness. The honor of His truth and faithfulness, lies at stake. He 
    has said that "they shall not be afraid of any evil tidings, their heart is 
    fixed, trusting in the Lord," Psalm 112:7. He has said, "By this shall their 
    iniquity be purged, and this shall be all the fruit to take away their sin." 
    God has said, "All things shall work together for good to them." They shall 
    not be the worse—but the better for all that befalls them; they shall love 
    Me and My holy ways the more. They shall cleave unto Me the closer; they 
    shall be made more pure and more tender by all they suffer for 
    righteousness' sake.</p>
<p align="justify">God has ventured deep on you; do not make Him a liar. The 
    devil and his instruments will be ready to say concerning you, as once he 
    did to the Lord concerning His servant Job, "Put them into our power; let us 
    have the handling of them a while—and you shall quickly see what <i>truth
    </i>there is in them, or what <i>trust </i>there is to them. They will curse 
    You to Your face; they will deny You to Your face. They will eat their own 
    words. They will be ashamed of their God, their godliness and confidence."</p>
<p align="justify">Let God be true, Christians, and the devil a liar. Be 
    living commentaries on this blessed text; let the world and its black prince 
    see that they cannot make you miserable because they cannot make you sinners 
    like themselves; that you are still the more upright for falling into the 
    hands of a crooked generation. Let them see that you are contented to serve 
    God for nothing! Though His hedge is removed from you—yet your heart is not 
    removed from Him. Be able to say, "Though all this has come upon us, our 
    heart is not turned hack; neither have we declined the way." Be increasing 
    in the grace of God, and abounding in the works of righteousness. Be a 
    standing witness for God in the world, and a seal to His Scriptures, and 
    especially to the glorious truth of this text.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(4) The evil things of the saints, prepare <i>better </i>
    things for them. </p></b>Their sufferings go towards their reward. "As the 
    sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by 
    Christ." Every suffering comes with a comfort in its belly; and the <i>sweet
    </i>is so great it swallows up the <i>bitter</i>. It is a hundred-fold that 
    the saints gain by all their losses in this life—but how great shall their 
    reward be in heaven! 2 Corinthians 4:17, "Our light affliction, which is but 
    for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of 
    glory." They shall not only have weight for weight, measure for measure, 
    their load of glory for their load of sufferings—but they shall have 
    over-weight, over-measure; good measure, pressed down, heaped together, and 
    running over shall then be given unto them.
<p align="justify">According to their deep poverty, shall be the height of 
    their riches; according as their blackness has been in their houses of 
    bondage shall, be their brightness in the land of promise. "For all your 
    shame, you shall have double", the double of your <i>reproach </i>in <i>
    renown</i>, the double of your <i>tears </i>in <i>triumphs</i>. All your 
    bottled tears shall be returned in flagons of joy—yes, in rivers of eternal 
    pleasure!</p>
<p align="justify">By this time, Christians, you see what glory there is in 
    this good Word: "All things shall work together for good to those who love 
    God."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. All things do, and shall certainly work for good to 
    those who love God</p></b></font>. That none may have the face to say all this 
    is but a dream, I shall, in the next place, bring in clear and undeniable 
    evidence that it is certainly and unquestionably so, as has been said. And 
    therefore know that all things do and shall certainly work for good to those 
    who love God. This (besides the testimony of the Scripture) I shall make 
    evident from these three propositions:
<p align="justify">1. There is a Divine Providence which governs the world.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The design of Providence is the accomplishment of the 
    good purpose and promise of God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Providence of God shall never fail of 
    accomplishing its end.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. There is a Divine Providence which governs the world.
    </p></b></font>The Epicureans, who deny Providence and leave all to chance and 
    fortune, may as well deny that there is a God, which yet they are ashamed to 
    stand to. It can be no way reconcilable to the infinite wisdom of God, who 
    made this glorious fabric with the various creatures therein, either not to 
    determine them to their ends—or else to take no care for the accomplishing 
    of those ends which He has determined. The whole current of Scripture is so 
    plain in these matters, that he who runs may read. Let the following 
    Scriptures, among others, be considered.
<p align="justify">Psalm 97:1, "The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice, let 
    the isles be glad." Psalm 145:15-16, "The eyes of all wait upon You, and You 
    give them their food in due season; You open Your hand, and satisfy the 
    desires of every living thing." Psalm 36:6, "You preserve man and beast." 
    Psalm 75:6-7, "For no one on earth—from east or west, or even from the 
    wilderness— can raise another person up. It is God alone who judges; he 
    decides who will rise and who will fall." Amos 3:6, "Shall there be evil in 
    a city—and the Lord has not done it?" Psalm 17:13-14, "Deliver my soul from 
    the wicked, which is Your sword; from men which are Your hand." The 
    confessions of those infidels, Nebuchadnezzar and Darius, speak the same, 
    Daniel 4:35, "All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does 
    as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one 
    can hold back his hand or say to him: <i>What have you done?</i>" Daniel 
    6:26-27, "I decree that everyone throughout my kingdom should tremble with 
    fear before the God of Daniel. For he is the living God, and he will endure 
    forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed, and his rule will never end. 
    He rescues and saves his people; he performs miraculous signs and wonders in 
    the heavens and on earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the 
    lions!"</p>
<p align="justify">But, more distinctly, the Lord governs all <i>inanimate
    </i>and <i>animate </i>creatures in their actions. He orders the stars in 
    their courses. He governs the winds and the floods. He brings forth the 
    winds out of His treasuries, He rides upon the wings of the wind. He makes 
    the cloud His chariots. He sits on the floods. The thunder, and the hail, 
    and the rain, and the frosts are all at His command. He gives snow like 
    wool, and scatters the musty frost like ashes. He casts forth the ice like 
    morsels. He sets bounds to the sea which it shall not pass. The birds of the 
    air, the beasts of the field, the fish of the sea, yes, the stones and dust 
    of the earth—are all at His beck and call.</p>
<p align="justify">More especially, He rules and governs the <i>men </i>of 
    this world. He sits in all the councils of men, though they see Him not. He 
    orders all their decrees; there is no decree which can pass, unless God 
    gives His vote. He rules in all the actions of men. Even those things which 
    are acted through our shortsightedness, do not come to pass without the 
    Providence of God. He rules in all the changes that are in the world. He 
    changes the times and the seasons. He changes kingdoms and governments. He 
    removes kings and sets up kings. He makes war and creates peace. He bends 
    the bow, breaks the bow, cuts the spear in sunder, and burn the chariots in 
    the fire. Peace and war, health and sickness, plenty and famine, life and 
    death, are all the disposal of His hand. He orders all the events and 
    causalities of the world, even from the greatest to the smallest. Without 
    Him, not a sparrow shall fall to the ground—nor a hair of the head shall 
    perish. Though there are causalities or contingencies to men—yet to the Lord 
    there are none. All things come to pass according as His hand and counsel 
    had before determined.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The design of Providence, as it respects the elect, is 
    the accomplishment of God's good purpose and promise. </p></b></font>God's 
    Providence governs the world—and God's purpose and promise governs 
    Providence. All the works of Providence are according to God's purpose. God 
    does nothing in vain; it is not consistent with the wisdom of God, to do 
    anything for nothing. God would have His people look farther than to the 
    things which are before them, because all those things have a farther aspect 
    themselves. All the works of Providence have a double aspect: they look 
    backward to the <i>purpose </i>and promise—and look forward to the <i>end
    </i>for which they are. As they look backward, so they have truth in them, 
    exactly answering the purpose and promise from which they have their birth. 
    As they look forward to their end, so they have good in them, and that good, 
    their subservience to their end, is the reason of their being. Here note two 
    things:
<p align="justify">The subserviency of things to their end is the goodness 
    of them; if the <i>end </i>is good, the <i>means </i>must as such be good 
    also. If what God has purposed and promised is good—then all things which 
    fall in between, having the respect of means to their accomplishment, must 
    upon that account be good. If our crosses and afflictions subserve the 
    bringing about of God's good will and good Word, we must say concerning 
    them, "Good are the works of the Lord." It is not how anything looks or 
    feels at present—but what it means and to what it tends. If the potion is 
    bitter and yet tends to health, if the messenger looks harsh—and yet comes 
    upon a good errand, you may bid him welcome. And thus, all the providences 
    of God are good.</p>
<p align="justify">If you should ask of any providence, "Why have you come? 
    Do you come peaceably? Do you come for good?" They must all answer, "Yes, 
    peaceably; for good, and no hurt. It is but to help all that good into your 
    hand—which has been in the heart, and has proceeded out of the mouth of your 
    God who loves you." There is not a messenger of Satan which comes to buffet 
    you—but is also a messenger from God which comes to you for good. The very
    <i>thorns </i>in your flesh shall serve you for plasters; your eye-sores 
    shall be your eye-salve; and your very <i>maladies </i>shall be your <i>
    medicines</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">This relative goodness of all the works of providence is 
    the reason of their being. Therefore, God does what He does that, hereby, He 
    may do what He has said and intended. I do not say that the reason of God's 
    taking this or that means is always from anything in itself, or for its 
    natural tendency to such an end above anything else. God has His choice of 
    means. He can choose <i>this </i>or <i>that </i>at pleasure. He can make use 
    of what He will, to serve His design. But the reason why things are—is that 
    God, in His wisdom, saw their means to this good end, and thereupon, in His 
    providence, He orders and brings them to pass. So that, now, whatever 
    befalls a Christian, he has this to allay and take off the grievousness and 
    sharpness of it—"This would never have been, but for the good will and good 
    Word of the Lord to me. The Lord God has said He will bless me and do me 
    good. He will heal me, and sanctify and save me, and now He is about it. By 
    this, He is working that salvation for me."</p>
<p align="justify">Christians, you have no reason to say, "If the Lord is 
    with me, why am I thus? Why so poor, why so pained, why so persecuted, so 
    scorned and trampled upon? Surely, if the Lord had meant my good, it would 
    have been better than it is with me."</p>
<p align="justify">No, no, it is because the Lord is with you and means you 
    well—that He deals in this manner with you. The design of His providence 
    towards you—is the accomplishment of His promise.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The providence of God shall never fail of 
    accomplishing its end.</p></b></font> There is nothing lacking which might give 
    us the fullest assurance hereof. For:
<p align="justify">The providence of God has <b>power </b>with it. He who 
    has promised, is <i>the Almighty</i>. He who rules in the <i>earth</i>, 
    dwells in <i>heaven </i>and does whatever He will. "Our God is in heaven—and 
    does whatever He will." "From eternity to eternity I am God. No one can 
    oppose what I do. No one can reverse my actions!" Isaiah 43:13. Were it not 
    for our unbelief, our attitude would be still the same in greatest 
    difficulties as when the coasts are most clear. We might say of 
    difficulties, as the Psalmist of darkness, "There is no darkness with You, 
    to You the day and night are both alike." Difficulties are no difficulties 
    with Him, nor is there difference between <i>hard </i>and <i>easy</i>. He 
    can save with <i>many </i>or with <i>few</i>—and with <i>none </i>as well as 
    with <i>some</i>. We once read He had too many—but never that He had too 
    few, to bring about His work. Oh, how do we disparage the power of God when 
    our difficulties make us doubt! He is God and not man! Why, then, do you 
    doubt? Whatever God has said—He can do. Believe He is God, and you will 
    never say, "How can these things be?"</p>
<p align="justify">The providence of God has <b>wisdom </b>with it. He is 
    the <i>only </i>wise God—He is the all-wise God. "The Lord knows how to 
    deliver the godly out of temptations," 2 Peter 2:9. He knows what is good 
    for His saints—and when it will be in season. He understands what is proper 
    and pertinent to every <i>case</i>; what is proper to every <i>purpose</i>, 
    to every <i>person</i>, and for every <i>season</i>. He knows when it is a 
    season to <i>abate </i>and when to <i>exalt</i>; when to <i>afflict </i>and 
    when to <i>deliver</i>; when to put <i>on </i>the yoke and when to take <i>
    off </i>the yoke; when to pull <i>down </i>and when to <i>build </i>up. 
    Everything is beautiful in its season. If mercies came out of season, 
    mercies would not be mercies; and if troubles came in their season, troubles 
    would not be troubles. He knows the best method and means to His end, the 
    fittest means. He sees sometimes the unfit test to us—to be the fittest; the 
    most unlikely unpromising means to us—often best serve God's end. 
    Christians, if you would receive every dispensation as coming from the hand 
    of the wise God, you would never quarrel with your lot nor say of anything 
    which befalls, "I might be happy—but <i>this </i>stands in my way." If you 
    would give God permission to be wiser than you, you would say, wherever you 
    are, "It is <i>good </i>for me to he here, this is my way to my rest."</p>
<p align="justify">The providence of God has <b>faithfulness </b>with it, 
    Psalm 25:10. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth, to those who 
    keep His covenant and His testimonies, Psalm 111:8. His works are done in 
    truth. God's works may be said to be done in truth in a double sense. In <i>
    reality </i>and in <i>fidelity</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">In <b>reality</b>. Not in show only, for God's comforts 
    are comforts indeed. God's salvation is salvation indeed. The devil will 
    come with his gifts, comforts, and deliverances—but they are, for the most 
    part—but like himself—shows and apparitions, quite another thing than what 
    they seem to be. Sinners' comforts, deliverances, and enjoyments, with which 
    the devil feeds them—leave them in as poor a case, and worse, than they 
    found them. You will never thank the devil for his kindnesses when you have 
    seen them for what they are. If the glittering glories and pleasures he 
    entices you by and entertains you with, prove to be trash and dirt and mere 
    lies in the end—then say, "The devil's works will be even like himself — 
    false and deceitful." But God is true, and all His works are done in truth.</p>
<p align="justify">In <b>fidelity</b>. His works are according to His Word, 
    1 Kings 8:24. "In Your faithfulness You have <i>afflicted </i>me," Psalm 
    119:75. Not only in Your faithfulness You have <i>saved </i>me, in Your 
    faithfulness You have <i>comforted </i>me, in Your faithfulness You have <i>
    succored </i>me; but in Your faithfulness You have <i>afflicted </i>me. In 
    Your faithfulness, You have <i>humbled </i>me, <i>broken </i>me, and <i>cast 
    me down</i>. The promise of God is that we shall lack nothing; we shall 
    neither lack His <i>staff </i>nor His <i>rod</i>, neither <i>comforts </i>
    nor <i>crosses</i>, neither <i>joys </i>nor <i>sorrows</i>. We cannot well 
    lack either—and we shall lack neither because God is faithful. You may not 
    only write down with the Apostle, "God is faithful, and will not allow you 
    to be tempted above that which you are able to bear." But you may write 
    also, "God is faithful and will not allow you to <i>fall </i>in temptation."</p>
<p align="justify">When it is seasonable, your hearts shall be glad; and, if 
    need be for a season, you shall be in heaviness. God is faithful; He will 
    ever be true to Himself and, therefore, to you. 2 Timothy 2:13, "He abides 
    faithful, He cannot deny Himself." Should He be false to His people, He 
    cannot be true to Himself, to His purpose and promise. His Word is not yes 
    and nay. God is not as a man that He should repent, that He should say and 
    not do. You may write God's name upon every Word He has spoken; you may 
    write His name, I AM, upon all that He has said.</p>
<p align="justify">Now Christians, put these three particulars together and, 
    if you cannot spell out the conclusion out of them—that the providence of 
    God will certainly accomplish His good <i>purpose </i>and <i>promise </i>
    concerning you, you are of little <i>understanding </i>as well as of little
    <i>faith</i>. If God governs the world, and nothing comes to pass but by His 
    providence; if providence governs according to God's purpose and promise, 
    providence cannot fail of accomplishing both. If God is <b>almighty </b>and 
    can, if God is <b>wise </b>and knows how, if God is <b>faithful </b>and 
    true, let the devil, if he can, with all his sophistry, evade the 
    conclusion—that he will certainly do all that good for you which He has 
    purposed and promised. If God is not able to perform, He is not almighty; if 
    He mistakes His way, if He uses impertinent, improper means, He is not the 
    all-wise God. If He does not actually perform what He is able and knows how 
    to do when He has said it, He ceases to be the true God. So that the matter 
    is brought plainly to this issue: if God is God, if God is the all-wise God, 
    if God is the true and faithful God, this Word which He has spoken, "All 
    things shall work together for good to those that love God", shall not fail 
    of its accomplishment in its season.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">A few words of CAUTION</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Having thus proved the doctrine, I shall add a few words 
    by way of caution.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">CAUTION 1. </p></b></font>Do not limit the Lord to <i>your
    </i>time and way. God will make good His Word—but you must give Him 
    permission to take His own season. "He who believes shall not make haste." 
    Believe God—but do not pre-judge lest you fall into temptation. Put no more 
    into the promise, neither for matter nor circumstance, than God has put in 
    it. Put not that into the promise which God has not put in it lest you miss 
    and come short of that which God has put in it. Let others' mistakes and 
    miscarriages be warnings to you. Until God has manifestly said, "This is the 
    time", don't you say it. Build not your confidence on conjectures, your 
    faith on the strongest presumptions, lest your faith prove but a dream and 
    your confidence your confusion. Make not the promise of God of none effect 
    by looking for its effect out of season. Do not believe yourselves into 
    infidelity. Consider Acts 1:7, "It is not for you to know the times and the 
    seasons, which God has put in His own power." Study the Word and its 
    commentary, the works of God—but be sober in your conclusions.
<p align="justify">This you may safely depend upon, and this will be enough, 
    if you have no more. God will make good His Word to you sooner or later—in 
    one time or other, in one way or other, in the best time, in the best way, 
    in the appointed time. Habakkuk 2:3, "Though it tarries, wait for it; 
    because it will surely come, and will not tarry." At least, at the end of 
    the days when you shall arrive on the banks of Canaan and shall then look 
    back on the promises and providences of God, you shall see and say, "God is 
    faithful. There has not failed one word of all that He has promised. Now I 
    understand, though once I could not, how every <i>wheel </i>was turning, 
    every <i>instrument </i>was moving, every <i>event </i>was working towards 
    my good and everlasting welfare!"</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">CAUTION 2.</p></b></font> Let not your looking for mercy, 
    hinder the working of your affliction. It is not seldom, and the Lord grant 
    it is not too common a case—that our door of hope becomes a door of sin. We 
    do not set ourselves with that seriousness to humble, to purge ourselves 
    from our iniquities, as we would do if we apprehended our case more 
    desperate. Our fears and our sorrows have not their kindly work upon us; our 
    hope hinders it. We might have been more broken-hearted, had it not been for 
    our hopes of building up. When a person conceives himself to be dying, he 
    then falls to praying, repenting, and setting his heart in order because he 
    must die; but, upon a little hope of recovery, he lays by his dying thoughts 
    and preparations.
<p align="justify">Christians, whenever you are under afflictions, take heed 
    that your expectation of deliverance is near; put it not so much the farther 
    off. Watch narrowly over yourselves and look diligently to it that your hope 
    of redemption does not harden your hearts nor hinder your humiliation and 
    repentance. Hope in God and wait for the promise of His coming; but know 
    that, until the rod has done its work, it is not likely in mercy to be laid 
    by, and it is better to be continued in the furnace—than to he brought forth 
    with your dross unpurged away.</p>
<p align="justify">By the way, learn hence two things.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">First, rejoice in this promise of God.</p></b> </font>Has the 
    Lord put in your name here? Let your heart say, "It is enough." Be more 
    joyful in this, that God has thus undertaken the care of you, than if God 
    had wholly put you to your own keeping. In what will you rejoice, if not in 
    this—that the whole creation is engaged to do you a kindness, to help you 
    into the possession of your God? You may now not only submit to—but 
    thankfully embrace, every providence, knowing upon what errand it comes to 
    you—for good and not for hurt. You may now triumph not only in the 
    consternations, but in the triumphs of your enemies. Whether they ride over 
    your back or you tread upon their neck—it is all one—the outcome will be the 
    same. Your troubles and your consolations differ only in their countenance. 
    With whatever grim face your afflictions look, there are God's smiles 
    underneath. Learn to see through them, and you may see light on the other 
    side. Believe this promise—you may read it written upon everything that 
    befalls you. There's no messenger which comes, but brings this promise in 
    his hand, "Even <i>this </i>shall work for good." Read it, and rejoice.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, lay yourself down quietly under it.</p></b></font> No 
    more perplexing or distracting cares what shall become of you, no more 
    unwarrantable shifting for yourself. Shift not for yourself—lest God should 
    leave you to your own shifts. Let not the violence of evil men disturb your 
    peace or provoke you to unpeaceableness. Whatever provocations you may have, 
    avenge not yourself, neither give place unto wrath, murmuring, or fears. In 
    patience, possess your soul, your God, and His good Word. Your strength is 
    to sit still. Stand still and see the salvation of God; <i>you have nothing 
    to do—but to be holy. </i>Let that be your only care; your God will see to 
    it you shall be happy. He is faithful, who has promised. Love God, and leave 
    yourself and your whole interest in this blessed word, "All things shall 
    work to you for good."
<p align="justify">By this time you see something of the riches of this 
    promise. God is in the promise, the God of peace, the God of power, the God 
    of patience, the God of hope, the heart of God, the help of God, the 
    presence of God—by virtue whereof all that ever befalls you, shall work for 
    your good. I think the hearing of this promise opened should set your souls 
    and all that is within you to crying out, "Oh, that this were my portion! 
    Wherever my lot falls, as to outward things, though in a prison, though in a 
    desert, though on a dunghill, let the lot of my soul lie in this promise, <i>
    The God of peace shall be with you!"</i></p>

<p align="justify">Why, brethren, will you take up with godliness? You have 
    learned and received and heard the Word of the Lord—the word of faith, the 
    word of righteousness and holiness. Will you hearken to, will you obey these 
    words? "These things do—and the God of peace shall be with you." Oh, what 
    foolish creatures are we, that we should ever be afraid of true religion, 
    afraid of holiness, afraid to own, obey, and follow God and His holy ways! 
    What unreasonable fears are these to those who believe the Scriptures! If 
    the Scriptures are true, this is the only way, this following God in 
    holiness—to put yourselves out of all danger, to put yourselves into the 
    heart, arms, presence, and protection of the Almighty God of heaven and 
    earth! Oh, that I could persuade you in this—and there leave you! If you are 
    once in the Lord's <i>arms</i>, you are safe enough, into whatever <i>hands
    </i>you fall.</p>
<p align="justify">Christians, my business while I have been with you—has 
    been to bring you to God, to espouse you to Christ. I can give you assurance 
    that He will shortly come and make up the marriage. I must say to you, as 
    Naomi to Ruth, Ruth 3:12, "Sit still, my daughter, until you see how the 
    matter will fall; for the man will not he in rest, until he has finished the 
    thing this day." Sit still, Christians, until you see how matters will fall; 
    and, however they fall, know your Lord will not be at rest until He has 
    finished this thing and brought you home to be with Him where He is. I am 
    now parting from you in this confidence that, however, after a few days I 
    shall see your faces no more in this world; yet I shall shortly meet you in 
    the bride-chamber of glory where we shall forever be with the Lord!</p>
<p align="justify">Beloved in the Lord, I must now leave you—but give me 
    permission before I go to deal freely with you, and yet a little further, in 
    the close of my day, this once more to open my heart to you and to tell you:</p>
<p align="justify">I. What my parting <i>fears </i>are.</p>
<p align="justify">II. What my parting <i>wishes </i>for you are which I 
    carry upon my spirit.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. My parting fears</p></b></font> as I go off from you, are 
    especially these:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. 1 am afraid that there are many of you upon whom I 
    have bestowed my labor in vain.</p></b></font> I am afraid that I have 
    instructed you in vain, exhorted, persuaded, beseeched, and reproved you in 
    vain. It was the Apostle's case, and his fear, concerning the Galatians, 
    chapter 4:11. It is my grief that, when I would have no more to speak but a 
    healing word, a comforting word—I must yet drop down a bitter word on some 
    of you; that when I would speak only from Mount Gerazim, I must yet again 
    speak to some from Mount Ebal; that when I would leave a <i>blessing </i>
    behind me upon you all, I am likely to leave some bound under a <i>curse</i>. 
    It is grievous to me thus to speak—yet, for the discharge of my duty and for 
    your own necessity, bear with me. I am afraid that, while I have been 
    preaching to you of an incorruptible crown, of an everlasting rest, a 
    kingdom of joy and glory, I am afraid there are many of you that have no 
    part nor lot in this matter—but are still in the gall of bitterness and bond 
    of iniquity!
<p align="justify">"If the gospel is hidden, it is hidden to those who are 
    lost." And are there none among you from whom this gospel is hidden—as to 
    the light of it—hidden as to the saving power and efficacy of it? I am 
    afraid there is many a blind eye, many a hard heart, many a spirit still in 
    prison, under the power of their lusts and brutish sensuality! I am afraid 
    there are many such among you, and are not you afraid so too? Oh, that you 
    were!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. I have a greater fear than this. I am afraid of some 
    of you that not only all my past labors—but this last will be lost also. </p></b>
</font>Those who stand it out to their last day—usually stand it out in 
    their last day. Blessed be God that there are among you those over whom my 
    soul is comforted, to whom I can speak in the words of the Apostle, Romans 
    6:17, "God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin; but you have 
    obeyed from the heart, that form of doctrine that has been delivered unto 
    you; and being now made free from sin, you are become the servants of 
    righteousness." Oh, that I could thus speak! Oh, that I could thus rejoice 
    over you all! But, as the Apostle said to the Galatians, 2 Corinthians 
    12:20, "I fear lest when I come, I shall find you such as I would not." So 
    must I say with a grieved heart; I fear that now I am going I shall leave 
    you such as I would not. I would not leave one blind person, one vain 
    person, one loose liver, not one unbeliever or impenitent, among you all. 
    Oh, what a good day would this day of my departure be! What light would 
    there be in this dark evening were it thus with you! If I might see you all 
    recovered out of the snares of the devil, every man's eyes opened, every 
    man's fetters off, every man's prison broken and his soul escaped from that 
    deadly bondage; if every poor deadly creature among you, who yet lies bound 
    hand and foot in his grave-clothes might now at last stand up from the dead, 
    and live the life of God, this would be my, and your, great rejoicing! But, 
    oh, I fear with this Apostle, 2 Corinthians 12:21, that my God will humble 
    me and grieve me and afflict me to see in what a woeful plight I must leave 
    many of you!
<p align="justify">Oh, you sons of the night—you poor, ignorant, and dark 
    souls upon whom the light has shone—but your darkness comprehended it not! 
    Oh, you poor, obstinate, and hardened souls upon whom I have been plowing as 
    upon <i>rocks, </i>and hewing as upon <i>adamant</i>, who still remain under 
    as great hardness as if no dew nor rain had ever fallen on you! Oh, you 
    poor, half-baked, <i>almost Christians </i>who have taken up your stand in 
    your present attainments; my soul is under great fears and must weep in 
    secret for you while my tongue must henceforth be silent! Oh, every soul 
    that is without fear of himself, my soul is afraid for you! <i>The fearless 
    soul is in a fearful state!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Sinners, let my fears be your fears. What! is there such 
    astonishing guilt upon you—and are you yet not afraid? Such a dreadful 
    sentence written against you, and are you yet not afraid? So many Sabbaths, 
    sermons, warnings lost, never to be recalled; nor any assurance left of one 
    sermon or warning more—and yet not afraid? Such a subtle <i>devil</i>, such 
    a deceitful <i>heart</i>, such a tempting <i>world </i>that you have to deal 
    with. Such a black and bottomless pit into which you are falling—and yet not 
    afraid? Oh, what stocks and stones has the gospel to deal with!</p>
<p align="justify">Beloved, I have labored much with you, both publicly and 
    from house to house, to bring you under a due fear and jealousy of 
    yourselves; but hitherto your hearts have been too hard for me. Oh—yet for
    <i>trembling </i>hearts; tremble and sin not; fear and pray, fear and hope, 
    fear and repent. "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling." Oh, if 
    my fears ever became your fears—your fears would become my hopes! Oh, what a 
    day-spring of hopes would arise from the shaking of secure hearts! These 
    fears would be as the thicker darkness, forerunners of the break of day.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. My parting wishes and desires</p></b></font> for you are:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. That the good seed which has been sown among you is 
    well-rooted in every heart.</p></b></font> I wish that my twenty year ministry 
    among you may not be lost labor to any one of your souls.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. I wish that your next seedsman may he more skillful 
    and successful</p></b></font>; that the good Lord will provide you a man who may
    <i>teach </i>you in wisdom, <i>gain </i>you in love, <i>lead </i>you on to 
    life by a holy example; and, if the Lord grants you this mercy, I wish that 
    such a one may be dearly prized and cheerfully accepted by you. God keep 
    this flock from a <i>ravening wolf </i>and a <i>deceitful shepherd!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. I wish that there may be no root of bitterness 
    springing up among you</p></b></font>; that there he no divisions or 
    contentions—but that you may live in peace and love, that the God of peace 
    and love may be with you.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. I wish that this place, where so much good seed has 
    been, sown, may become a <i>fruitful </i>field</p></b></font>; that the fruits 
    of <i>faith </i>and <i>repentance</i>, the fruits of <i>righteousness </i>
    and <i>holiness</i>, may be in you and abound; that you may be neither 
    barren nor unfruitful; that true religion, in the power and practice of 
    it—may so visibly flourish in the several persons, in the several families 
    of this congregation, that those who go by may see and say, "This is the 
    field which the Lord has blessed!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. I wish that whatever clouds may at any time gather 
    over you may not fall down in a withering storm or a sweeping flood—but may 
    pass away in a mist, or dissolve into a fruitful dew</p></b></font>; that no 
    persecutions or temptations may ever carry you down the stream with evil 
    men, nor blight any hopeful beginnings that are budding forth in any of your 
    souls. If <i>tribulation </i>should be any of your lots, I wish it may not 
    be to you as the hail of Egypt—but as the dew of Hermon. I wish you a joyful 
    harvest that you may <i>reap </i>in eternity—what has been <i>sown </i>in 
    time. May you now <i>sow </i>in righteousness and hereafter <i>reap </i>in 
    mercy; may every one who is now sowing in tears—may forever reap in joy. May 
    you who go on your way weeping and bearing precious seed, return with joy 
    and bring your sheaves with you. May the showers of this day, be the 
    watering of your seed—that it may spring up to eternal life.
<p align="justify">Brethren, my heart's desire for you all is that you may 
    be saved; and, if there are any persons that bear evil will to me, my 
    particular wish for them is that the good-will of Him who dwelt in the bush 
    be those</p>
<p align="justify">men's portion forever. These are some of my wishes for 
    you. Will you join your wishes with mine? Will you turn your wishes into 
    prayers and let this be your prayer, "The Lord grant you your heart's 
    desire, and fulfill all your mind."</p>
<p align="justify">Brethren, do I wish you any harm in all this? If not, if 
    it is to be wished that the word of Christ were rooted in your hearts and 
    your souls, thereby rooted in the grace of God; if it is to be wished that 
    your lust were rooted out, your sins dead and dried up, your foot gotten out 
    of the snare, your souls brought into the fold, your fruits of righteousness 
    and holiness abounding and growing up to eternal life; if all this is to be 
    wished—then give in your votes with mine. Wish and pray, pray and press on, 
    press on and wait for the accomplishment of this grace in you all. I tell 
    you again, I wish you well, and not only I—but the Lord God who has sent me 
    to you. The Lord Jesus wishes you well. He wishes and woos, woos and weeps, 
    weeps and dies—that your souls might live and be blessed forever. He has 
    once more sent me to you, even to the worst among you, to tell you, from Him 
    that He is unwilling that you should perish, that He has a kindness for you 
    in His heart—if you will accept it. He has blood and affections for you— 
    blood to expiate your guilt, to wash away your filth—and affections to offer 
    you the benefit of His blood; with this wish, "Oh, that it were theirs! Oh, 
    that they would hearken and accept!"</p>
<p align="justify">Only I must add that the Lord has two sorts of wishes 
    concerning sinners. The first is, "Oh, that they would hearken!" Oh, that 
    they would come in, be healed, and be saved, Deuteronomy 5:29. This wish is 
    an olive branch which brings good tidings, and gives great hopes of peace 
    and mercy.</p>
<p align="justify">His last wish is, "Oh, that they had hearkened, that they 
    had accepted!" Psalm 81:13, "Oh that my people had hearkened to me!" Luke 
    19:42, "If you had known even you, in this your day, the things which 
    concern your peace." This wish has nothing but dread and death in it; it is 
    the black flag hung out that proclaims eternal wars. The sense is, Israel 
    had once a fair time of it, a time of love, a time of grace, a time of 
    peace, Oh, that they had hearkened then, that they had known the things 
    which concern their peace! But woe, woe to them, it is now too late. The 
    door is shut; the season is over; the day is past! "But now they are hidden 
    from your eye!"</p>
<p align="justify">There are three deadly darts in this wish: "O that you 
    had!" It includes in it these three cutting words: </p>

<p align="justify">You have not; </p>
<p align="justify">you might have; </p>
<p align="justify">you shall not have forever.</p>

<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. You have not.</p></b></font> What have I not? Why, you 
    have not known the things which belong to your eternal peace. You have had 
    the door of glory, the gate of heaven opened to you, and have been called 
    for and invited in—but you have lost the opportunity. You knew not when you 
    were well-offered, nor would take notice what a day was before you, what a 
    prize was in your hand. Your peace, the gospel of peace, the Prince of 
    peace, a kingdom of peace was set open, offered, and brought home to your 
    doors—but you had so many other matters to look after—that you took no 
    notice of it but have let it slip. There is one dart, "You have not known." 
    There is a <i>gospel </i>gone; there is a <i>Christ </i>gone; there is a <i>
    soul</i>, a <i>kingdom </i>lost!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. You might have. </p></b></font>Oh, that you had! Why—might 
    I? Yes, you might; if you would, you might. Your God did not mock you when 
    He preached peace to you; He was willing and wished it yours. If you 
    would—you might have made it your own; but while He would—you would not. 
    There is another dart—I might have known. I have none to thank but myself 
    for the loss; my undoing was my own doing. There are no such torments as 
    when the soul flies upon itself and takes revenge on itself. Oh, the gashes 
    that such self-reflection makes! "Soul, how did you come into all this 
    misery? Oh, it is of myself! I have been the cause of my own destruction! 
    The door was open, and I was told of it and was bid come in—but I would not. 
    That I am lost and undone was not my fate which I could not avoid—but my <i>
    fault </i>and my<i> folly!</i>"
<p align="justify">It seems to give some ease of our torment when we can 
    shift off the fault. "It was not I—but the woman," said Adam. "It was not 
    I—but the serpent," said the woman. If that had been true, it would have 
    given ease as well as serve for an excuse. "This thought (it was my own 
    doing) tears my heart! Oh, I have none to blame but myself, my own foolish 
    and stubborn heart. This is my ignorance, this is my unbelief, this is my 
    wilfulness! My lust and my pleasures and my idols that I was running 
    after—have brought me under this dreadful loss. It was my own doing!"</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. You shall not have forever. </p></b></font>Oh, that you 
    had! Why, may I not yet? Is there no hope of recovering the opportunity? No, 
    no, it is too late, too late! You have had your day; from henceforth no more 
    forever. There is the last dart—time is past. There is the <i>death</i>, the
    <i>hell </i>and <i>anguish</i>, the <i>worm </i>that shall gnaw to eternity! 
    This one word, "time is past", sets all hell a-roaring; and, when it is once 
    spoken to a sinner on earth—there is hell begun. Go your way, wretch; fill 
    up your measure of sin—and then go to your place in hell! The gospel has no 
    more to say to you but this one word: "But since you rejected me when I 
    called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand, since you ignored 
    all my advice and would not accept my rebuke, I in turn will laugh at your 
    disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you—when calamity overtakes 
    you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when 
    distress and trouble overwhelm you! Then they will call to me but I will not 
    answer; they will look for me but will not find me. Since they hated 
    knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord, since they would not accept 
    my advice and spurned my rebuke, they will eat the fruit of their ways and 
    be filled with the fruit of their schemes. For the waywardness of the simple 
    will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them!" Proverbs 
    1:24-32.
<p align="justify">Beloved, my hopes are, that you are yet under the first 
    wish, "Oh, that they would!" Christ is yet preaching you to faith, and sends 
    His wish along with His Word, "Oh, that they would believe!" Christ is yet 
    preaching repentance and conversion to you and wishes, "Oh, that they would 
    repent!" that they would be converted; and to this wish of my Lord, my soul, 
    and all that is within me says "Amen!"</p>
<p align="justify">Brethren, will you yet again say to your Lord "No!" Shall 
    Christ have His wish? Shall your servant for Jesus' sake, shall I have my 
    wish? Will you now at last consent to be sanctified and to he saved? Let me 
    have this wish, and I dare promise you from the Lord, you shall have yours, 
    even whatever your soul can desire. Brethren, this once hear, this once be 
    prevailed upon; be content that your <i>lusts </i>be rooted out—and your <i>
    Lord </i>planted into your souls. Be content to be <i>pardoned</i>, content 
    to be <i>converted</i>, content to be <i>saved</i>. This once hear lest, if 
    you now refuse—yet no more be persuaded with, "Oh, that they would!" but be 
    forever confounded with "Oh, that they had!" Lest all our <i>wishes </i>and
    <i>wooing </i>of you—be turned into <i>weepings </i>and <i>mournings </i>
    over you, this once hear: "Oh, that you would!"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">I heartily thank you for your good wishes and goodwill 
    towards me, for your willing and cheerful entertainment of my person, and 
    attendance on my ministry; and particularly for your passionate desire of my 
    longer stay among you, which desire, if God had not denied you, my soul 
    could not have denied you. The Almighty, to whose pleasure it is fit that we 
    all submit, has said "nay" to that wish of yours; yet let your souls say 
    "Amen" to this last wish of mine, that the Lord God would dwell among you 
    and in you, both now and forever.</p>
<p align="justify">And having thus finished my labors among you, I shall now 
    close up with this double account.</p>
<p align="justify">Of my <i>discharge </i>of my ministry in this place.</p>
<p align="justify">Of my <i>deprival</i>. And so I shall commit you to God, 
    and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you 
    an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Of my DISCHARGE of my ministry.</p></b></font> What my <i>
    doctrine </i>and <i>manner of life </i>has been, is known to you; and what 
    my <i>aim </i>and <i>intent </i>has been, is known to God. The Searcher of 
    hearts knows that it is the salvation of souls that has been the mark at 
    which I have aimed. My way has been to use all plainness that I might be 
    made manifest in your consciences. Weaknesses and infirmities, both natural 
    and sinful—may the Lord pardon; I have had many. I am sensible that much 
    more <i>might </i>have been done, both in public and in private, had it not 
    been for a <i>weak body </i>and a <i>slothful heart</i>. I repent that I 
    have had no more <i>zeal for God</i>, no more <i>compassion to souls</i>. I 
    repent that I have been no more <i>constant </i>and <i>importunate </i>with 
    you about the matters of eternity. <i>Oh, eternity, eternity, that you were 
    no more in the heart and lips of the preacher, in the hearts and ears of the 
    hearers!
</i>
<p align="justify">But while I thus judge myself for my failing, blessed is 
    God. I have a witness in my conscience, and I hope in yours also, that I 
    have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God. Brethren, I 
    call heaven and earth to witness this day that I have set before you life 
    and death, good and evil, and have not ceased from day to day to warn you to 
    choose life and that holy way that leads to it—and to escape for your lives 
    from the way of sin and death! Oh, remember the many <i>instructions </i>I 
    have given you, the many <i>arguments </i>whereby I have striven with you, 
    the many <i>prayers </i>that have been offered up for the guiding and 
    gaining your souls into the path of life, and the turning your feet out of 
    the way of destruction. Oh, might I be able to give this testimony 
    concerning you all at my departure, "They have trodden in the right path; 
    they have chosen the good part which shall not be taken from them!"</p>
<p align="justify">Brethren, beloved, with whom I have travailed in birth 
    that Christ might be formed in you, I must shortly give up my account in a 
    more solemn assembly. Will you help me to give it up with joy by showing 
    your souls before the Lord as the seals of my ministry? Every sincere 
    convert among you will be a crown of rejoicing to me in that day. Just so, 
    let me rejoice, and let my joy be the joy of you all.</p>
<p align="justify">What shall I say more? If there is any consolation in 
    Christ, if any comfort of love, any affections and mercy; if the glory of 
    the Eternal God, the honor of the everlasting gospel, the safety of your 
    immortal souls, the incorruptible crown, the exceeding eternal weight of 
    glory weighs anything with you—then, once more, let me beseech you by all 
    this to hearken to that Word of the gospel which God has spoken to you by 
    me.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Of my DEPRIVAL. </p></b></font>The most glorious <i>
    morning, </i>has an <i>evening</i>. The hour is come wherein the sun is 
    setting upon many of the godly pastors. The shadows of the evening are 
    stretched forth upon us; our day draws to a close, and our work seems to be 
    at an end. Our pulpits and places must know us no more. This is the Lord's 
    doing; let all the earth keep silence before Him.
<p align="justify">It is not a light thing for me, brethren, to be laid 
    aside from the work, and cast out of the vineyard of the Lord; and it must 
    be something of weight that must support under so severe a doom. I know 
    there are many who will add to the affliction of the afflicted, by saying 
    that it is our own fault; "They might have prevented it—if they had wanted 
    to." Whether this is so or not, God knows, and let the Lord be judge. 
    Blessed be God, that this is not laid to our charge as the reason of our <i>
    expulsion</i>, either deficiency or scandal!</p>
<p align="justify">You are not ignorant what things there are imposed on us 
    as the condition of our continuing our ministry; which, however lawful and 
    expedient they seem in the judgment of many—yet have the most specious 
    arguments that plead for them. They have left me utterly dissatisfied in my 
    conscience about them. I must profess before God, angels, and men, that my 
    non-submission is not from any disloyalty to authority, nor from pride, or 
    any factious disposition or design—but because I dare not contradict my 
    conscience nor do anything concerning which my heart tells me, "The Lord 
    says—Do it not."</p>
<p align="justify">After all my most impartial inquiries, after all my 
    seeking counsel from the Lord, after all my considering and consulting with 
    men of all persuasions about these matters—I find myself so far short of 
    satisfaction, that I am plainly put to this choice—to part with my <i>
    ministry—</i>or my <i>conscience</i>. I must choose that my ministry be 
    sealed up by my sufferings, than lengthened out by a lie. But however, 
    though I must now no longer <i>act </i>as a minister, I shall, through the 
    grace of God, endeavor peaceably and patiently to <i>suffer </i>as a 
    Christian. I should, to testify my obedience to authority, have become all 
    things to all men to the uttermost that I could, with any clearness of 
    heart; but, since matters stand so, I must lose my <i>place </i>or my <i>
    peace</i>. I cheerfully allow myself to be thrust off the stage.</p>
<p align="justify">And now, welcome the cross of Christ; welcome reproach; 
    welcome poverty, scorn and contempt, or whatever else may befall me on this 
    account! This morning I had a flock—and you had a pastor; but now, behold a 
    pastor without a flock—and a flock without a shepherd! This morning I had a 
    house—but now I have none! This morning I had a living—but now I have none! 
    "The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away! Blessed be the name of the 
    Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">Beloved, I am sensible of many weaknesses and 
    disadvantages I am under which may render a suffering state the harder to be 
    borne. Help me by your prayers, and not me only—but all my brethren also 
    with whom my lot must fall. "Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good 
    conscience, in all things willing to live honestly." Pray:</p>
<p align="justify">1. That God would make our silence speak, and preach the 
    same holy doctrine that we have preached with our lips.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That He would give supports answerable to our 
    sufferings; that He who comforts those who are cast down, will also comfort 
    His servants who are cast out.</p>
<p align="justify">3. That, according to our earnest expectation and our 
    hope, as always, Christ may be magnified in us, whether it be by life or by 
    death.</p>
<p align="justify">And thus, brethren, I bid you all farewell. In the words 
    of the Apostle, 2 Corinthians 13:11, "Finally, brethren, farewell. Aim for 
    perfection, listen to my appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God 
    of love and peace will be with you."</p>
<p align="justify">"May the God of peace, who through the blood of the 
    eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great 
    Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, 
    and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom 
    be glory for ever and ever. Amen." Hebrews 13:20-21.</p>
