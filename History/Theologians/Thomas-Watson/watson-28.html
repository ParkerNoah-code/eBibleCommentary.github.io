<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>A New Creature</b></font></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify">"Therefore, if any man is in Christ, he is a new 
    creature; old things are passed away, behold all things are become new." 2 
    Corinthians 5:17</p>
<p align="justify">In this Scripture consists the essence and soul of 
    religion. I note here two things:</p>
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">First, that the true definition of a Christian is to be 
    in Christ.</p></font> </b>"If any man is <i>in Christ</i>." He may be in the 
    visible church—yet not in Christ. It is not to be baptized into Christ's 
    name which makes a true Christian—but to be in Christ, that is, to be 
    grafted into Him by faith. And if to be<i> in Christ </i>makes a 
    Christian—then there are but few Christians. Many are in Christ nominally, 
    not really; they are in Christ by profession, not by spiritual union. Are 
    they in Christ—who do not know Him? Are they in Christ—who persecute those 
    who are in Christ? Surely, such a holy head as Christ, will disclaim such 
    spurious members.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, whoever is in Christ, is a new creature.</p></b>
</font>For illustration, I shall show what a new creature is; and what kind 
    of work it is.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">What a new creature is. </p></b></font>It is a second birth 
    added to the first birth, John 3:3. It may be thus <i>defined</i>: it is a 
    supernatural work of God's Spirit, renewing and transforming the heart into 
    the divine likeness.
<p align="justify">The <i>efficient cause </i>of the new creature, is the 
    Holy Spirit; no angel or archangel is able to produce it. Who but God, can 
    alter the hearts of men—and turn stones into flesh? If the new creature was 
    not produced by the Holy Spirit—then the greatest glory in a man's 
    conversion would belong to himself; but this glory God will not give to 
    another. The turning of the will to God—is from God.</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>instrumental cause </i>by which the new creature 
    is formed, is the Word of God. James 1:18, "He chose to give us birth 
    through the word of truth." The Word is the <i>seed—</i>out of which springs 
    the <i>flower </i>of the new creature.</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>matter </i>of which the new creature consists is 
    the restoring of God's image lost by the fall.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But does God, in the new creature, give a new 
    soul?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. No, He does not bestow new <i>faculties</i>—but 
    new <i>qualities</i>. As in the altering of a lute, the strings are not 
    new—but the tune is mended; so, in the new creature, the substance of the 
    soul is not new—but is now tuned by grace. The <i>heart </i>that before was 
    proud—is now humble; the <i>eyes </i>that before were full of lust—are now 
    full of tears. Here are new qualities infused.</p>
<p align="justify">What kind of work the new creature is. The new creature 
    is a work of divine power; so much it imports, because it is a <i>creation</i>. 
    The same power which raised Christ from the grave, goes to the production of 
    the new creature, Ephesians 1:20. It is a work of greater power to produce 
    the new creature—than to make a world. It is true, in respect to God, all 
    things are equally possible to Him; but, as to our understanding, it 
    requires a greater power to make a new creature than to make a world, for:</p>
<p align="justify">1. When God made the world He met with no <i>opposition</i>—but 
    when God is about to make a new creature He meets with opposition. <i>Satan
    </i>opposes Him, and the <i>heart </i>opposes Him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It <i>cost </i>God nothing to make the world—but to 
    make the new creature costs Him something. Christ Himself was glad to become 
    man. In making the world, it was but speaking a word; but, in making of the 
    new creature, it cost Christ the shedding of His blood!</p>
<p align="justify">3. God made the world in six days—but He is carrying on 
    the new creature in us all our lives long. The new creature is but <i>begun
    </i>here; it is not <i>perfected </i>or fully drawn in all its orient 
    colors—until it comes to heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">The new creature is a work of free grace. There is 
    nothing <i>in us, </i>to cause God to make us anew. By nature we are full of 
    pollution and enmity—yet now God forms the new creature. Behold the banner 
    of love displayed! The new creature may say, "By the grace of God I am what 
    I am!" In the creation, we may see the strength of God's <i>arm</i>; in the 
    new creature, we may see the working of God's <i>heart</i>. That God should 
    consecrate any heart, and anoint it with grace, is an act of pure love! That 
    He should pluck one out of the state of nature, and not another—must be 
    resolved into sovereign grace. Matthew 11:26, "Even so, Father, for so it 
    seemed good in Your sight." This will</p>
<p align="justify">increase the saint's triumphs in heaven, that <i>the lot 
    of free grace </i>should fall upon them—and not on others.</p>
<p align="justify">The new creature is a work of rare excellency. A natural 
    man is<i> a lump of dirt and sin mixed together</i>. God loathes him! But 
    upon the new creature is a spiritual glory, as if we should see a piece of 
    clay, turned into a sparkling diamond! Song of Solomon 3:6, "Who is this 
    that comes out of the wilderness, perfumed with myrrh and incense?" That is 
    the natural man coming out of the wilderness of sin, perfumed with all the 
    graces of the Spirit. </p>
<p align="justify">The new creature must be glorious, for it partakes of the 
    divine nature, 2 Peter 1:4. A soul beautified with holiness is like the sky, 
    bespangled with glittering stars; it is God's lesser heaven, Isaiah 57:15. 
    In the incarnation, God made Himself in the image of man; in the new 
    creation, man is made in the image of God. By our being creatures, we are 
    the sons of Adam; by being new creatures we are the members of Christ. <i>
    Reason </i>makes one live the life of <i>man</i>—the new creature makes him 
    live the life of <i>God</i>. A new creature excels the rational nature—and 
    equals the angelic.<i> It is excellent to hear of Christ's being crucified 
    for us—but more excellent to have Christ formed in us!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Concerning the new creature, I shall lay down two 
    positions.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">POSITION 1. It is not in the power of a natural man to 
    convert himself</p></b></font>, because it is a new creation. As we cannot make 
    ourselves creatures, so we cannot make ourselves new creatures.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But why does God command us to convert 
    ourselves, if we have no power? Ezekiel 18:31, "Make yourselves a new heart 
    and a new spirit." </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. We once had power. God gave us a stock of 
    holiness—but we <i>lost </i>it. If a master gives his servant money to 
    employ in his service, and he wastes and embezzles it, may not the master 
    require his money of him? Though we have lost our power to <i>obey</i>—God 
    has not lost His right to <i>command</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. Though men cannot convert themselves and make 
    themselves new creatures—yet they may do more than they do. They may avoid 
    temptations, they may read the Word. The same feet that carry them to a 
    theater—will carry them to a sermon. They may implore divine grace. But they 
    don't do what they are able to do; they put God to the trial, whether He 
    will give saving grace.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 3. God is not lacking to those who seek Him for 
    grace. He is willing to put forth His helping hand. With His <i>command </i>
    there goes a <i>promise</i>, Ezekiel 18:31, "Make yourselves a new heart and 
    a new spirit"; and there is a promise, Ezekiel 36:26, "A new heart also will 
    I give you."</p>
<p align="justify">POSITION 2. When God converts a sinner, He does more than 
    use a moral persuasion—for conversion is a new creation. Ephesians 4:24. The 
    Pelagians talk much of <i>free-will</i>. They say, "The will of man is, by 
    nature, asleep; and conversion is nothing but the awakening a sinner out of 
    sleep, which is done by moral persuasion." But man is, by nature, <i>dead
    </i>in sin, Ephesians 2:1. And God must do more than <i>awaken </i>him. He 
    must <i>enliven </i>him, before he is a new creature.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1. </p></b></font><font color="#0000FF"><b>Of terror to 
    such as are not new creatures</b></font>, such as are still growing upon the 
    stock of old Adam, who continue in their sins and are resolved so to do. 
    These are in the gall of bitterness and are the most miserable creatures 
    that ever God made—except for the devils. These stand in the place where all 
    God's arrows fly; these are the center where all God's curses meet. An 
    unregenerate person is like one in debt—who is in fear of being <i>arrested 
    by death </i>and carried prisoner to hell. Can that traitor be happy—who is 
    fed by his prince in prison—only to be kept alive for execution? God feeds 
    the wicked like prisoners. They are reserved for the day of wrath, 2 Peter 
    2:9. How should this frighten men out of their natural condition and make 
    them restless until they are new creatures!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2.</p></b></font> Of <b>trial </b>as to whether we are 
    new creatures or not. Our salvation depends upon it. I shall show you the
    <font color="#0000ff"><b>counterfeits of the new creature</b></font>; or 
    that which <i>seems </i>to be the new creature—but is not.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Natural honesty, moral virtue, prudence, justice, 
    liberality, temperance—these are not the new creature. </p></b></font>These make 
    a glorious show in the eye of the world—but differ as much from the new 
    creature, as a <i>stick </i>differs from a <i>star</i>. Morality indeed is 
    commendable, and it would be well if there were more of it. This our Savior 
    loves, Mark 10:21, "Then Jesus beholding him, loved him." It was a love of
    <i>compassion</i>, not <i>election</i>. Morality is but <i>nature at its 
    best</i>; it does not amount to grace. There is nothing of Christ in 
    morality. That fruit is sour—which does not grow on the root of Christ. 
    Moral actions are done out of a vain-glorious motive, not any respect to 
    God's glory. The Apostle calls the heathen magistrates <i>unjust</i>, 1 
    Corinthians 6:1. While they were doing justice in their civil courts—they 
    were unjust in God's court. Their <i>virtues </i>became <i>vices—</i>because 
    faith was lacking; and they did all to raise <i>trophies </i>for their own 
    praise and fame. Morality is but the wild olive tree of nature; it does not 
    amount to grace. 
<p align="justify">Heat <i>water </i>to the highest degree—and you still 
    cannot make <i>wine </i>out of it; it is water still. Just so, let morality 
    be raised to the highest, it is nature still; it is but <i>old Adam put in a 
    better dress</i>. I may say to a moral man, "yet lack you one thing," Mark 
    10:21. Moral virtue may exist with the <i>hatred of godliness</i>. A moral 
    man hates true holiness—as much as he does vice! The Stoics were moralists 
    and had sublime notions about virtue—yet were the deadliest enemies Paul 
    had, Acts 17:18. Morality is but a counterfeit jewel—not the new creation. 
    "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born 
    again." John 3:3. "You must be born again." John 3:7.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Religious education is not the new creature.</p></b></font> 
    Education greatly cultivates and refines nature. Education is a good <i>wall
    </i>to plant the vine of grace against—but it is not grace. King Jehoash was 
    good as long as his uncle Jehoiada lived—but when Jehoiada died, all 
    Jehoash's religion was buried in his uncle's grave! "Joash did what was 
    right in the eyes of the Lord all the years Jehoiada the priest instructed 
    him." 2 Kings 12:2. Have we not seen many who have been trained up 
    religiously under their parents, and were very hopeful—yet these <i>fair 
    blossoms of hope </i>have been blown off—and they have lived to be a shame 
    to their parents!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A <i>form </i>of godliness is not the new creature.</p></b></font> 
    Every bird which has <i>fine feathers</i>, does not have <i>sweet flesh</i>. 
    All who shine with the <i>golden feathers of profession</i>, are not saints. 
    2 Timothy 3:5, "Having a <i>form </i>of godliness—but denying the power." 
    What is a lifeless form? Formality is the <i>ape of piety! </i>Formalists 
    may perform all the external parts of religion—they may pray, fast and give 
    alms. Whatever duties a believer does in sincerity—the same may a formalist 
    do in hypocrisy. How devout were the Pharisees! How humble was Ahab! What a 
    reformer was Jehu! Yet this was but a formal show of religion! Daedalus, by 
    art, made images to move by themselves, insomuch that people thought they 
    were living. Formalists so counterfeit and play at devotion—that others 
    think they are living saints. They are religious charlatans!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Every <i>change of opinion </i>does not amount to the 
    new creature.</p></b></font> Man may change from <i>error </i>to <i>truth—</i>yet 
    be no new creature. Here is a change in the <i>head—</i>but not in the <i>
    heart</i>. One may be orthodox in his judgment, yet not cordially embrace 
    the gospel. He may be no <i>papist—</i>yet no true believer. He who is 
    changed only in opinion, is but <i>almost </i>a Christian, and shall be but
    <i>almost </i>saved—yet fully damned!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Every sudden passion or stirring of the affections, is 
    not the new creature. </p></b></font>There may be affections of <i>sorrow</i>. 
    Some, upon reading the history of Christ's passion, may be ready to weep—but 
    it is only a natural sentimentality and tenderness, which relents at any 
    tragic sight. 
<p align="justify">Affections of <i>desire </i>may be stirred. John 6:34, 
    "Lord, evermore give us this bread!" But these same people basely deserted 
    Christ and no longer followed Him, verse 66. Many desire heaven—but will not 
    come up to the price!</p>
<p align="justify">Affections of <i>joy </i>may be stirred. In the parable 
    of the soils, the second sort of hearers are said to receive the word with 
    joy, Matthew 13:20. What was this but to have the affections moved with 
    delight in hearing! Yet, that this did not amount to the new creature is 
    plain, first, because those hearers are said to have <i>no root</i>. Second, 
    because they <i>fell away</i>, verse 21. King Herod heard John the Baptist
    <i>gladly</i>; he was much affected with John's preaching. Where then was 
    the defect? Why was not Herod a new creature? The reason was, because Herod 
    was not <i>reformed </i>by the Baptist's preaching. His <i>affections </i>
    were moved—but his sin was not removed! Many have sweet motions of heart, 
    and seem to be much affected with the Word—but their <i>love to sin is 
    stronger than their love to the Word! </i>Therefore, all their good 
    affections prove abortive and come to nothing.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. One may have trouble for sin—yet not be a new 
    creature.</p></b></font> Trouble of spirit may appear while God's judgments lie 
    upon men. When these are removed, their trouble ceases. Psalm 78:34, 36, 37, 
    "When He killed some of them, the rest began to seek Him; they repented and 
    searched for God. But they deceived Him with their mouths, they lied to Him 
    with their tongues, their hearts were insincere toward Him, and they were 
    unfaithful to His covenant." Metal that <i>melts </i>in a furnace, when 
    taken out of the furnace will return to its former <i>hardness</i>. Many in 
    time of <i>sickness </i>seem to be like <i>melted metal</i>. What weeping 
    and wringing of hands! Do not these look like new creatures? But as soon as 
    they recover—they are as bad as ever! Their pangs leave them—and it never 
    comes to a new birth.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. A man may have some actings of the Spirit—yet not be a 
    new creature. </p></b></font>The Apostle supposes a case that one might be made 
    partaker of the Holy Spirit yet fall away, Hebrews 6:4. A man may have some
    <i>slight transient work </i>of the Spirit—but it does not go to the <i>root</i>. 
    He may have the <i>common gifts </i>of the Spirit—but not the <i>special 
    grace</i>. He may have the Spirit to <i>convince </i>him—but not to <i>
    convert </i>him. The light he has, is like a winter sun which has little or 
    no <i>influence</i>. It does not make him more holy; he has the motions of 
    the Spirit—but walks after the flesh.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Every abstaining from sin, is not the new creature.
    </p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">First</p></b>, this abstaining may be from <i>restraining </i>
    grace—not <i>renewing </i>grace—as God withheld Laban from hurting Jacob, 
    Genesis 31:24. The Lord may restrain men from sin—by the terror of a natural 
    conscience. Conscience stands as the angel with a drawn sword, and says, 
    "Don't commit this evil." Men may be <i>frightened </i>from sin—but not <i>
    divorced </i>from sin!
<b>
<p align="justify">Second</p></b>, men may abstain from sin for <i>awhile</i>—and 
    then return to it again; as Saul left off pursuing David for some time—and 
    then hunted him again. This is like a man that holds his breath under water, 
    and then takes a breath again. Jeremiah 34:15-16, "Recently you repented and 
    did what is right in my sight. But now you have turned around and profaned 
    my name."
<b>
<p align="justify">Third</p></b>, men may leave <i>gross </i>sins—and yet live 
    in more spiritual sins. They may leave drunkenness, and live in pride. They 
    may leave immorality, and live in malice. The Pharisee boasted that he was 
    no adulterer—but he could not say that he was not proud or superstitious. 
    Here he left gross sin—and lived in spiritual sins!
<b>
<p align="justify">Fourth</p></b>, men may leave sin <i>partially</i>, abstain 
    from <i>some </i>sin—not all. They feed some sin in a corner. Herod left 
    many sins—but one sin he lived in, namely, incest. All this does not amount 
    to the new creature.
<p align="justify">I shall show you <font color="#ff0000"><b>wherein the 
    essence of the new creature consists.</b></font></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">First, in GENERAL. </p></b></font>To the constituting of the 
    new creature, there must be a great change wrought. He who is a new creature 
    is not the same man he was. He is of another spirit. Numbers 14:24, "My 
    servant Caleb, because he had another spirit." When the harlot Lais came to 
    one of her old acquaintances after he was converted, and tempted him to sin, 
    he said,<i> "I am not the same man!" </i>When one becomes a new creature, 
    there is such a visible change, that all may see it. Therefore, it is called 
    a change "from darkness to light," Acts 26:18. Paul, a persecutor, when 
    converted, was so altered that all who saw him were amazed at at him, and 
    could scarcely believe that he was the same person, Acts 9:21. It was as if 
    another soul had lived in the same body! Mary Magdalene, an unchaste sinner, 
    when once savingly wrought upon—what a penitent creature she became! Her <i>
    eyes </i>once were enticements to lust—she now uses them to wash Christ's 
    feet with her tears. The <i>hair </i>which she was so proud of and which was 
    a net to entangle her lovers—she now she now uses it to wipe Christ's feet 
    with.
<p align="justify">Thus the new creature makes a <i>visible </i>change. Such 
    as are the same as they were—as vain and proud as ever—there is no new 
    creature to be seen; for then a mighty change would appear. 1 Corinthians 
    6:11, "And such <i>were </i>some of you—but you are washed—but you are 
    sanctified."</p>
<p align="justify">But every change does not evidence the new creature. 
    There is a change from one extreme to another, from a prodigal—to an usurer, 
    from a Turk—to a Papist. This is as if one should recover from one 
    disease—and die of another! There is an outward change, which is like the 
    washing of a swine. Ahab was much changed to outward view, when he "tore his 
    clothes, and put on sackcloth," 1 Kings 21:27, insomuch that God stood and 
    wondered at him, "See how Ahab humbles himself!" Yet, for all this, he was 
    but a hypocrite.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What change, then, is that which is requisite 
    in the new creature?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is an <i>inward </i>change—a change of <i>
    heart</i>. Though the heart is not newly <i>made</i>—it is newly <i>molded</i>. 
    Jeremiah 4:14, "Oh, Jerusalem, wash your heart!" Ahab's <i>clothes </i>were 
    rent—but not his<i> heart!</i> The outward change will do no good, without 
    the inward change. What will become of those, then—who have not so much as 
    an outward change? Thus you see in general that, in the production of the 
    new creature, there must be a change.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, and more PARTICULARLY</p></b></font>, the change in 
    the new creature consists in two things, and they are both set down in the 
    text: "old things are passed away; behold all things are become new."
<p align="justify">The first trial of the new creature is this:<font color="#008000"><b> 
    "Old things are passed away." </b></font>Old pride, old ignorance, old 
    malice; the old house must be pulled down, before you can set up a new one.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. But if <i>all </i>old things must pass 
    away—then there are no new creatures. Who can be quite freed from sin? Does 
    not Paul complain of a body of death?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. We must know that the change wrought in the new 
    creature, though it is a <i>thorough </i>change—yet it is not a <i>perfect
    </i>change. Sin will remain. As there is a <i>principle </i>of grace—so 
    there is a <i>principle </i>of corruption. Like wine and water mixed, there 
    is in the regenerate, flesh as well as spirit. Here a question arises.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION.<font color="#b07050"><b> If sin in the 
    regenerate is not quite done away—then how far must one put off the old man, 
    that he may be a new creature?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. <b>There must be a GRIEVING for the remains of 
    corruption.</b> Romans 7:24, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me 
    from this body of death!" Paul did not cry out of his sufferings, his being 
    beaten with rods, shipwrecked, stoned; but, like the bird of paradise, he 
    bemoaned himself for <i>sin! </i>In the new creature, there must be a daily 
    mourning for the indwelling presence of corruption. A child of God does not 
    wear sin as a <i>gold chain</i>—but as a <i>fetter</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. In the new creature, <b>there must be a 
    DETESTATION of old things</b>—as one would detest a garment in which is the 
    plague. It is not enough to be <i>angry </i>with sin—but we must <i>hate </i>
    it. Psalm 119:163, "I <i>hate </i>and <i>abhor </i>lying." Hatred is the 
    highest degree of enmity, and we must hate sin not only for its hurtful<i> 
    effect</i>—but its loathsome <i>nature</i>, as one hates a toad for its 
    poisonous quality.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 3. In the new creature, <b>there is an OPPOSITION 
    against all old things</b>. A Christian not only complains of sin—but fights 
    against it, Galatians 5:17.</p>
<p align="justify">But may not a natural man oppose sin?</p>
<p align="justify">Yes—but there is a great difference between his opposing 
    sin—and the new creature's opposing it.</p>
<p align="justify">First, there is a difference in the MANNER of opposition.
    </p>
<p align="justify">The natural man opposes sin only for the <i>shame </i>of 
    it—as it eclipses his reputation; but the new creature opposes sin for the
    <i>filth </i>of it. It is the spirit of mischief; it is like rust to gold, 
    or as a stain to beauty.</p>
<p align="justify">The natural man does not oppose <i>all </i>sin. He does 
    not oppose <i>inward </i>sins. He fights against such sins as are against 
    the light of a natural conscience—but not against heart-sins, such as the 
    first risings of vain thoughts, the stirrings of anger and lust, and the 
    venom and impurity of his nature.</p>
<p align="justify">He does not oppose <i>gospel </i>sins: pride, unbelief, 
    hardness of heart, spiritual barrenness. He is not troubled that he can love 
    God no more.</p>
<p align="justify">He does not oppose <i>complexion-sins</i>, such sins as 
    the bias of his heart carries him more strongly to—such as lust or avarice. 
    He says of his constitution-sins, as Naaman, 2 Kings 5:18, "In this thing, 
    may the Lord pardon your servant." But the new creature opposes all kinds of 
    sin, as he who hates a serpent hates all kinds of serpents. Psalm 119:104, 
    "I hate <i>every </i>false way."</p>
<p align="justify">Second, there is difference between the natural man's 
    opposing sin and the new creature's opposing sin—in regard to the MOTIVES. A 
    natural man opposes sin from carnal motives—to stop the mouth of conscience, 
    and to prevent hell. But the new creature opposes sin upon more noble 
    motives—out of love to God, and fear of dishonoring the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 4. In the new creature, <b>there is a MORTIFYING 
    of old corrupt lusts. </b>Galatians 5:24, "Those who are Christ's, have 
    crucified the flesh." The new creature is said to be dead indeed unto sin, 
    Romans 6:11. He is dead as to the love of sin—that it does not <i>captivate</i>. 
    He is dead as to the power of sin—that it does not <i>command</i>. The new 
    creature is continually crucifying sin. Some limb of the <i>old Adam </i>
    drops off every day. Though sin does not die <i>perfectly</i>, it dies <i>
    daily</i>. A gracious soul thinks he can never kill sin enough. He deals 
    with sin as Joab did with Absalom, 2 Samuel 18:14, "He took three darts in 
    his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom." So, with the three 
    darts—faith, prayer, and repentance—a Christian thrusts through the body of 
    sin! He never thinks this Absalom is enough dead!</p>
<p align="justify">Try yourself, then, and see if you have this first sign 
    of the new creature, "old things are passed away." There is a <i>grieving
    </i>for sin, a <i>detesting </i>of it, an <i>opposing </i>of it, and a <i>
    mortifying </i>of it. This is the passing away of old things, though not in 
    a legal sense—yet in an evangelical sense; and, though it is not to <i>
    satisfaction</i>—yet it is to <i>acceptance</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The second trial of the new creature is this<font color="#008000"><b>: 
    "All things are become new." </b></font>The new creature is <i>new all over</i>. 
    Grace, though it is but in part—yet it is in <i>every </i>part. By nature, 
    every branch of the soul is defiled with sin—as every part of wormwood is 
    bitter. So it is in regeneration: every part of the soul is replenished with 
    grace; therefore, grace is called the <i>new man</i>, Ephesians 4:24. Not a 
    new <i>eye </i>or a new <i>tongue</i>—but a new <i>man</i>; there are new <i>
    dispositions</i>, new <i>principles</i>, new <i>aims</i>, "all things are 
    become new!"</p>
<p align="justify">In the new creature, there is a new UNDERSTANDING, 
    Ephesians 4:23, "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind." The first thing an 
    artist draws in a portrait, is the <i>eye</i>. When God newly draws us and 
    makes us new creatures, the first thing He draws in our souls is a <i>new 
    eye</i>. The new creature is enlightened to <i>see </i>that which he never 
    saw before. </p>
<p align="justify">He knows <b>Christ </b>after another manner. An 
    unconverted man, by the light of common grace, may <i>believe </i>Christ to 
    be the Son of God; but the new creature <i>knows </i>Christ after another 
    manner—so as to <i>esteem </i>Him above all, to <i>adore </i>Him, to touch 
    Him by faith, to fetch a healing virtue from Him.</p>
<p align="justify">The new creature knows <b>himself </b>better than he did. 
    When the <i>sun </i>shines into a room—it reveals all the <i>dust </i>and <i>
    cobwebs </i>in it. Just so, when the light of the Spirit shines into the 
    heart—it reveals that <i>corruption </i>which before lay hidden; it shows a 
    man his own vileness and nothingness. Job 40:4, "Behold, I am vile!" A 
    wicked man, blinded with self-love, admires himself—like <i>Narcissus </i>
    who, seeing his own reflection in the water, fell in love with it. Saving 
    knowledge works self-abasement. "Lord, You are in heaven, and I am in hell," 
    said a martyr. Has this day-star of <i>knowledge </i>shined on our mind?</p>
<p align="justify">The new creature is renewed in his CONSCIENCE. The 
    conscience of a natural man is either blind, dumb, or seared; but conscience 
    in the new creature is renewed. Let us examine—does conscience check for 
    sin? The least hair makes the eye weep, and the least sin makes conscience 
    smite. How did David's heart smite him for cutting off the lap of Saul's 
    garment! A good conscience is a <i>star </i>to guide, a <i>register </i>to 
    record, a <i>judge </i>to determine, and a <i>witness </i>to accuse or 
    excuse. If conscience does all these office right—then it is a renewed 
    conscience, and speaks peace.</p>
<p align="justify">In the new creature, the WILL is renewed. The will, 
    having a new <i>bias of grace </i>put into it, is strongly carried to good. 
    The will of a natural man opposes God. When the wind goes one way and the 
    tide another—then there is a storm. So it is when God's will goes one way 
    and ours another. But when our will goes with God's, as the wind with the 
    tide—then there is a sweet calm of peace in the soul. The sanctified will 
    answers to God's will as the <i>echo </i>to the voice. Psalm 27:8, "When You 
    said, seek you My face, my heart said unto You<i>, Your face, Lord will I 
    seek</i>." And the will, being renewed, carries all the affections along 
    with it.</p>
<p align="justify">The new creature has a new LIFE. Grace alters a man's 
    walk. "Whoever claims to live in him must <i>walk </i>as Jesus did." 1 John 
    2:6. "So that you may <i>walk </i>worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him, 
    bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God." 
    Colossians 1:10. Before he walked <i>proudly</i>—now he walks <i>humbly</i>. 
    Before he walked <i>loosely</i>—now he walks holily. He makes the Word his 
    rule, and Christ's life his pattern. A ship can be sailing eastward—but, if 
    there comes a gale of wind, it blows it westward. So, before a man sailed 
    hell-ward and, all of a sudden, the Spirit of God comes upon him and blows 
    him heavenward. Here is a new life. It was a speech of Oecolampadius, "I 
    would not speak nor do anything that I thought Jesus Christ would not 
    approve of, if He were here physically present." Where there is circumcision 
    of heart, there is circumspection of life. If we find that all things are 
    become new—then we are new creatures and shall go to the new Jerusalem when 
    we die.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 3. Of exhortation.</p></b></font> Labor to be new 
    creatures; nothing else will avail us. Galatians 6:15, "Neither circumcision 
    avails anything, nor uncircurncision—but a new creature." We are for <i>new 
    things</i>. We love new <i>fashions</i>—why not new <i>hearts</i>? But 
    people are full of prejudices against the new creature.
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 1. If we are new creatures, there must be so 
    much strictness in religion, so much praying and watching—this discourages 
    us.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. Is there anything excellent to be obtained, 
    without labor? What pain is taken in searching for a vein of silver or 
    seeking for pearls? Men cannot have the <i>world </i>without labor—would 
    they have <i>eternal salvation </i>without labor?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. The <i>labor </i>in true religion, bears no 
    proportion with the <i>reward</i>. What are a few tears shed, compared to an 
    eternal weight of glory? The soldier is content to wrestle with difficulties 
    and undergo a bloody fight for a glorious victory. In all labor for heaven, 
    there is profit. It is like a man who digs in a golden mine—and carries away 
    all the gold!</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 3. Men take more pains to go to <i>hell</i>. What 
    pains does an <i>ambitious </i>man take to climb to the pinnacle of honor? 
    Tullia rode over the dead body of her father, to be made queen. How does the 
    covetous man tire himself, and break his sleep and his peace—to get the 
    world? Thus, some men take more pains in the service of <i>sin—</i>than 
    others do in pursuit of holiness. Men talk of pains in religion—but, when 
    God's Spirit comes into a person—He turns <i>labor </i>into <i>delight</i>. 
    It was Paul's <i>heaven </i>to serve God, Romans 7:22. The ways of wisdom 
    are ways of pleasantness, Proverbs 3:17. It is like walking among beds of 
    spices—which cast forth a sweet perfume.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 2. But if we leave our old company and become 
    new creatures—we shall be exposed to many reproaches.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Who are those who speak evil of religion—but such 
    as are evil? Besides, is it not better that men reproach us for being 
    godly—than that God damn us for being wicked? Matthew 5:11, "<i>Blessed </i>
    are you when men shall revile you." Stars are never the less glorious though 
    they have ugly names given them like "the bear" and "the dragon." A saint's 
    reproaches are like a soldier's scars, honorable. 1 Peter 4:14, "If you are 
    reproached for the name of Christ, the Spirit of God and of glory rests upon 
    you." While men clip your reputation to make it weigh lighter—they make your 
    crown heavier.</p>
<p align="justify">Having answered these objections, I come now to resume 
    the exhortation. I shall give some <font color="#0000ff"><b>MOTIVES to labor 
    above all things, to be new creatures.</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. In this true Christianity consists.</p></b></font> It is 
    not baptism which makes a Christian; many professors are no better than <i>
    baptized heathens!</i> The essential part of religion lies in the new 
    creature. Romans 2:29, "Circumcision is that of the heart." Everything has a
    <i>name </i>from the better part. We call a man a <i>reasonable </i>creature 
    because of his soul, which is the more noble part; so one is called a 
    Christian because he acts from a principle of the new creature, which the 
    carnal man does not.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It is the new creature, which fits us for communion 
    with</p>
<p align="justify">God.</p></b></font> We cannot converse with God until then. 
    Birds cannot converse with men—unless they have a rational nature put into 
    them. Nor can men converse with God—unless, being made new creatures, they 
    partake of the divine nature. Communion with God is a mystery to most. 
    Everyone who hangs around the court, does not speak with the king. All who 
    meddle with holy duties and, as it were, hang about the court of heaven do 
    not have communion with God. It is only the new creature who enjoys God's 
    presence in ordinances, and sweetly converses with Him as a child with a 
    Father.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">The NECESSITY of being new creatures.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Until then, we are odious to God.</p></b></font> Zechariah 
    11:8, "My soul loathed them." To God, an unrepentant sinner is worse than a 
    toad. A toad has no poison, but what God has put into it; but a sinner has 
    that which the devil has put into him. Acts 5:3, "Why has <i>Satan </i>
    filled your heart to lie?" A wicked man is possessed with an evil spirit. 
    One man is possessed with the devil of <i>pride</i>, another with the devil 
    of <i>malice</i>. To be possessed with the devil, must make a person odious 
    to God! Thus he remains, until he becomes a new creature.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Until we are new creatures, our duties are not 
    accepted with God.</p></b></font> They are but <i>wild </i>grapes. God accepts 
    no man—except where He sees His own image. The new creature is called the 
    renewing of God's image, Ephesians 4:24. When they brought Tamarlane a pot 
    of gold, he asked what stamp it had on it; and, when he saw the Roman stamp 
    on it, he refused it. Just so, if God does not see His own stamp and image 
    on the soul—He rejects the most splendid religious services.
<p align="justify">Duties of religion are not accepted without the new 
    creature, because there is that lacking, which makes them a sweet savor to 
    God. The holy oil for the tabernacle was to be made of several spices and 
    ingredients, Exodus 30:23. Now, if any of these spices had been left out, it 
    would not have been pleasing to God. The unregenerate man leaves out the 
    chief spice in his duties, and that is faith. Hebrews 11:6, "Without faith 
    it is impossible to please God." Faith lays hold on Christ—and so is 
    accepted.</p>
<p align="justify">Such as are not new creatures—but grow upon the <i>stock 
    of old Adam</i>, get no benefit by ordinances. They are to them as <i>
    medicine in a dead man's mouth</i>—they lose their virtue! Nay, not only do 
    ordinances do them no good—but they hurt them. It would be sad if all a man 
    ate, would turn to poison. The word preached is a savor of death; it is not
    <i>healing</i>—but <i>hardening</i> to them. Nay, Christ Himself is a rock 
    of offense to them, 1 Peter 2:8. The wicked stumble at a Savior—and suck 
    death from the tree of life!</p>
<p align="justify">Without being new creatures, we cannot arrive at heaven. 
    Revelation 21:27, "Nothing impure will ever enter it." Heaven is not like 
    Noah's ark, which received <i>clean </i>and <i>unclean</i>. A sinner is 
    compared to swine, 2 Peter 2:22. Shall a swinish creature tread upon the 
    golden pavement of heaven! Indeed, the frogs came into king Pharaoh's court; 
    but in heaven there is no entertainment for such vermin. It is only the new 
    creature which qualifies us for glory. This consecrates the heart, and only 
    the pure in heart shall see God. The new creature <i>elevates </i>the 
    soul—as the loadstone elevates the iron. A soul renewed by grace, is fit to 
    ascend to the heavenly glory.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">The excellency of the new creature</p></b></font> consists in 
    two things: The <i>nobility </i>and the <i>immortality</i>.
<p align="justify">1. The <b>nobility</b>. The new creature fetches its 
    pedigree from heaven; it is born of God. God counts none else of the royal 
    blood. The new creature ennobles a man's spirit. He aspires after the favor 
    of God, and looks no lower than a heavenly crown. The new creature raises 
    one to honor. He excels the princes of the earth, Psalm 89:27, and is a 
    joint heir with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The <b>immortality</b>. The new creature is begotten 
    of the incorruptible seed of the Word, and never dies. It lasts as long as 
    the soul, as long as heaven. God has laid out great cost for it and, if it 
    perishes, He would lose all his cost. When Xerxes destroyed all the temples 
    in Greece, he caused the temple of Diana to be preserved for its beautiful 
    structure. The new creature is God's temple, adorned with all the graces, 
    which He will not allow to be demolished. Riches take wings, king's crowns 
    tumble in the dust. Nay, some of the graces may cease—faith and hope shall 
    be no more. But the new creature abides forever! 1 John 2:27.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">The misery of the unregenerate creature. </p></b></font>Dying 
    as he is. I may say so of him, as Christ said of Judas, Mark 14:21, "Far 
    better for him if he had never been born!" Better to have been a toad, a 
    serpent, anything—if not a new creature. The old <i>sinner </i>must go into 
    old <i>Tophet</i>, Isaiah 30:33. Damned captives will have nothing to ease 
    their torments—not one drop of honey in all their gall. In the sacrifice of 
    jealousy, there was <i>no oil </i>put into it, Numbers 5. In hell, there is
    <i>no oil of mercy </i>put to the sufferings of the damned to soothe them.
<p align="justify">Therefore, get out of the wild olive tree of nature. 
    Labor to be new creatures—lest you curse yourselves at last! A sinful life, 
    will cause a hopeless and despairing death.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What shall we do to be new creatures?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. The <i>preaching of the Word </i>is the seed of 
    which the new creature is formed. This is the trumpet which must make the <i>
    dead in sin </i>come out of their grave!</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. Pray earnestly for the new creature: "Lord, You 
    have made me once—make me again! What shall I do with this old heart? It 
    defiles everything it touches!" Urge God with His promise, Ezekiel 36:26, "A 
    new heart also will I give you." Say, "Lord, I am as these dry bones—breathe 
    a supernatural life of grace into me!" Ezekiel 37:10.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 4. Of thankfulness.</p></b></font> Let such as are new 
    creatures, stand upon Mount Gerazim, blessing and praising God. Ascribe all, 
    to the riches of God's love; set the crown upon the head of free grace! God 
    has done more for you—than if He had made you kings and queens! Though you 
    have not so much of the <i>world </i>as others, you are happier than the 
    greatest monarchs upon earth! And, I dare say, you would not change place 
    with any of them. The Apostles seldom speak of the new creation—but they 
    always join some thankful praises with it. 1 Peter 1:3, "Blessed be God, 
    who, according to His abundant mercy, has begotten us again to a living 
    hope." Colossians 1:12, "Giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit 
    for the inheritance in light." The new creature is a <i>sign </i>of 
    election—a <i>badge </i>of adoption. What distinguishing love is this—that 
    God should make any of us new creatures—when He has left the greatest part 
    of the world to perish in their sins! Such as are <i>objects of mercy </i>
    should be <i>trumpets of praise!
</i>
