 </font></p>
<p align="center">1. THE COVENANT OF WORKS</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Question 12: What special act of providence did God 
    exercise towards man, in the estate wherein he was created?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer: When God had created man, he entered into a 
    covenant of life with him upon condition of perfect obedience, forbidding 
    him to eat of the tree of knowledge upon pain of death.</p>
<p align="justify">"And the Lord God commanded the man—You are free to eat 
    from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the 
    knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die." 
    Genesis 2:16-17.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. This covenant was made with Adam and all mankind</p></b></font>; 
    for Adam was a public person, and the representative of the world.
<b>
<p align="justify">For what reason did God make a covenant with Adam and his 
    posterity in innocence?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">(1.) To show his sovereignty over us. We were his 
    creatures, and as he was the great Monarch of heaven and earth, he might 
    impose upon us terms of a covenant. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) God made a covenant with Adam to bind him fast to 
    him: as God bound himself to Adam, so Adam was bound to him by the covenant.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What was the covenant?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">God commanded Adam not to eat of the <i>tree of knowledge</i>; 
    but gave him permission to eat of all the other trees of the garden. God did 
    not envy him any happiness; but said, "You are free to eat from any tree in 
    the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and 
    evil" because he would test Adam's obedience. As King Pharaoh made Joseph 
    chief ruler of his kingdom, and gave him a ring off his finger, and a chain 
    of gold—but said he must not "touch his throne." In like manner, God dealt 
    with Adam. He gave him a sparkling jewel, knowledge; and put upon him the 
    garment of original righteousness; "Only," said he, "you must not eat from 
    the tree of the knowledge of good and evil," for that is aspiring after 
    omniscience. Adam had power to keep this law: he had the copy of God's law 
    written in his heart. </p>
<p align="justify">This covenant of works had a promise annexed to it, and a 
    threatening. </p>
<p align="justify">1. The <b>promise </b>was, "Do this and live." In case 
    man had stood, it is probable he would not have died—but would have been 
    translated to a better paradise. </p>
<p align="justify">2. The <b>threatening</b>, "When you eat of it you will 
    surely die;" Hebrew, "In dying you shall die;" that is, you shall die both a 
    natural death and an eternal, unless some expedient be found out for your 
    restoration.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Why did God give Adam this law, seeing he foresaw that 
    Adam would transgress it?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It was Adam's fault that he did not keep the law. 
    God gave him a stock of grace to trade with—but by his own neglect he 
    failed. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Though God foresaw Adam would transgress—yet that 
    was not a sufficient reason that no law should be given him; for, by the 
    same reason—God should not have given his written Word to men, to be a rule 
    of faith and manners, because he foresaw that some would not believe, and 
    others would be profane. Shall laws <i>not </i>be made in the land, because 
    some will break them? </p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Though God foresaw Adam would break the law, he knew 
    how to turn it to greater good—in sending Christ. The first covenant being 
    broken, he knew how to establish a second, and a better covenant.</p>
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">II. Concerning the first covenant, consider these four 
    things:</p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">[1] The form of the first covenant in innocence was by 
    WORKS.</p></font></b> "Do this and live." Working was the ground and condition 
    of man's justification. Gal 3:12, "How different from this way of <i>faith
    </i>is the way of <i>law</i>, which says—If you wish to find life by obeying 
    the law, you must obey <i>all </i>of its commands." Not but that working is 
    required in the covenant of grace, for we are bid to work out our salvation, 
    and be rich in good works. But works in the covenant of grace are not 
    required under the same notion, as in the first covenant with Adam. Works 
    are not required for the <i>justification </i>of our persons—but as an <i>
    attestation </i>of our love to God; not as the <i>cause </i>of our 
    salvation—but as an <i>evidence </i>of our adoption. Works are required in 
    the covenant of grace, not so much in our <i>own </i>strength as in the 
    strength of Christ. "It is God who works in you." Phil 2:13. As the teacher 
    guides the child's hand, and helps him to form his letters, so that it is 
    not so much the child's writing as the master's. Just so, our obedience is 
    not so much <i>our </i>working as the <i>Spirit's </i>co-working.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The covenant of works was very strict. </p></b></font>God 
    required of Adam and all mankind, 
<p align="justify">(1.) <b>Perfect </b>obedience. Adam must do all things 
    written in the "book of the law," and not fail, either in the <i>matter </i>
    or <i>manner </i>of the works. "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to 
    do everything written in the Book of the Law." Gal 3:10. Adam was to live up 
    to the whole breadth of the moral law, and go exactly according to it, as a 
    well-made dial goes with the sun. One sinful thought would have forfeited 
    the covenant! </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) <b>Personal </b>obedience. Adam must not do his work 
    by a proxy, or have any surety bound for him; but it must be done in his own 
    person. </p>
<p align="justify">(3.) <b>Perpetual </b>obedience. He must continue in <b>
    all </b>things written in the law. "Cursed is everyone who does not continue 
    to do everything written in the Book of the Law." Gal 3:10. Thus it was very 
    strict. There was no mercy in case of failure.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] The covenant of works was not built upon a very firm 
    basis; and therefore must needs leave men full of fears and doubts.</p></b></font> 
    The covenant of works rested upon the strength of man's inherent 
    righteousness; which though in innocence was perfect—yet was subject to 
    change. Adam was created holy—but mutable; having a power to stand and a 
    power to fall. He had a stock of original righteousness to begin the world 
    with—but he was not sure he would not break. He was his own pilot, and could 
    steer right, in the time of innocence; but he was not so secured but that he 
    might dash against the rock of temptation, and he and his posterity be 
    shipwrecked; so that the covenant of works must needs leave jealousies and 
    doubtings in Adam's heart, as he had no security given him that he would not 
    fall from that glorious state.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] The covenant of works being broken by sin, man's 
    condition was very deplorable and desperate.</p></b></font> He was left in 
    himself, helpless; there was no place for repentance; the justice of God 
    being offended, set all the other attributes against him. When Adam lost his 
    righteousness, he lost his anchor of hope and his crown; there was no way 
    for relief, unless God would find out such a way as neither man nor angel 
    could devise.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one:</p></b></font> 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) See the condescension of God, who was pleased to 
    stoop so low as to make a covenant with us.</p></b></font> For the God of glory 
    to make a covenant with dust and ashes; for God to bind himself to us, to 
    give us life in case of obedience; for him to enter into covenant with us 
    was a sign of friendship, and a royal act of favor.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) See what a glorious condition man was in, when God 
    entered into covenant with him.</p></b></font> He was placed in the garden of 
    God, which for the pleasure of it was called <i>paradise</i>. He had his 
    choice of all the trees, one only excepted; he had all kinds of precious 
    stones, pure metals, rich cedars; he was a king upon the throne, and all the 
    creation did obeisance to him, as in Joseph's dream all his brethren's 
    sheaves bowed to his sheaf. Man, in innocence, had all kinds of pleasure 
    that might ravish his senses with delight, and be as baits to allure him to 
    serve and worship his Maker. He was full of holiness. Paradise was not more 
    adorned with fruit, than Adam's soul was with grace. He was the coin on 
    which God had stamped his lively image. Light sparkled in his <i>
    understanding</i>, so that he was like an earthly angel; and his <i>will </i>
    and <i>affections </i>were full of order, tuning harmoniously to the will of 
    God. 
<p align="justify">Adam was a perfect pattern of sanctity. Adam had intimacy 
    of communion with God and conversed with him, as a favorite with his prince. 
    He knew God's mind, and had his heart. He not only enjoyed the light of the 
    sun in paradise—but the light of God's countenance. This was Adam's 
    condition when God entered into a covenant with him; but this did not long 
    continue; for "man being in honor abides not," lodged not for a night. His
    <i>teeth </i>watered at the apple, and ever since it has made our <i>eyes
    </i>water.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Learn from Adam's fall, how unable we are to stand 
    in our own strength.</p></b></font> If Adam, in the state of integrity, did not 
    stand, how unable are we now, when the lock of our original righteousness is 
    cut. If <i>purified </i>nature did not stand, how then shall <i>corrupt </i>
    nature? We need more strength to uphold us than our own!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) See in what a sad condition all unbelievers and 
    impenitent persons are. </p></b></font>As long as they continue in their sins 
    they continue under the curse, under the first covenant. Faith entitles us 
    to the mercy of the second covenant; but while men are under the power of 
    their sins, they are under the curse of the first covenant; and if they die 
    in that condition, they are damned to eternity!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) See the wonderful goodness of God, who was pleased 
    when man had forfeited the first covenant, to enter into a new covenant with 
    him. </p></b></font>Well may it be called a covenant of grace; for it is 
    bespangled with promises—as the heaven with stars. When the angels, those 
    glorious spirits, fell, God did not enter into a new covenant with them to 
    be their God—but he let those <i>golden vessels</i> lie broken; yet has he 
    entered into a second covenant with us, better than the first. It is better, 
    because it is surer; it is made in Christ, and cannot be reversed. Christ 
    has engaged his strength to keep every believer. In the first covenant we 
    had a <i>power of standing</i>; in the second we have an <i>impossibility of 
    falling finally</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) Whoever they are, who look for righteousness and 
    salvation by the power of their freewill, or the inherent goodness of their 
    nature, or by virtue of their merit, as the Socinians and Papists—they are 
    all under the covenant of works. </p></b></font>They do not submit to the 
    righteousness of faith, therefore they are bound to keep the whole law, and 
    in case of failure they are condemned. The covenant of grace says, "Believe 
    in the Lord Jesus, and be saved"; but such as will stand upon their own 
    inherent righteousness, free-will and merit, fall under the first covenant 
    of works, and are in a perishing estate.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Let us labor by faith, to get into the second 
    covenant of grace, and then the curse of the first covenant will be taken 
    away by Christ.</p></b></font> If we once get to be heirs of the covenant of 
    grace, we are in a better state than before. Adam stood on his own legs, and 
    therefore he fell; we stand in the strength of Christ. Under the first 
    covenant, the justice of God, as an avenger of blood, pursues us; but if we 
    get into the second covenant we are in the city of refuge, we are safe, and 
    the justice of God is pacified towards us.
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Question 14. What is Sin?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Answer: Sin is any lack of conformity to the law of God, 
    or transgression of it.</p>
<p align="justify">"Sin is the transgression of the law." Of sin in general:</p>
<p align="justify">Sin is a violation or transgression. The Latin word, <i>
    to transgress</i>, signifies to go beyond one's bounds. The moral law is to 
    keep us within the bounds of duty. Sin is going beyond our bounds.</p>
<p align="justify">The law of God is not the law of an inferior prince—but 
    of Jehovah, who gives laws as well to angels as men; it is a law that is 
    just, and holy, and good. Rom 7:12. It is <i>just</i>, there is nothing in 
    it unequal. It is <i>holy</i>, nothing in it impure. It is <i>good</i>, 
    nothing in it harmful. So that there is no reason to break this law, no more 
    than for a beast, that is in a fat pasture, to break over the hedge, or to 
    leap into a barren heath or quagmire.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall show what a heinous and execrable thing sin is. 
    Sin is the distillation of all evil. The Scripture calls it the "accursed 
    thing." It is compared to the venom of serpents, and the stench of 
    sepulchers. The apostle uses this expression, "sin might become utterly 
    sinful," Rom 7:13, or, as it is in the Greek, "Hyperbolically sinful." The 
    devil would paint sin with the pleasing color of pleasure and profit, that 
    he may make it look fair; but I shall pull off the paint that you may see 
    its ugly face. We are apt to have slight thoughts of sin, and say to it, as 
    Lot of Zoar, "Is it not a little one?" But that you may see how great an 
    evil sin is, consider these four things:</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. The origin of sin</p></b></font>, from whence it comes. It 
    fetches its pedigree from hell; sin is of the devil. "He who commits sin is 
    of the devil." Satan was the first actor of sin, and the first tempter to 
    sin. Sin is the devil's first-born.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. The evil nature of sin.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] It is a defiling thing. </p></b></font>Sin is not only a 
    defection—but a pollution. It is to the soul as rust is to gold, as a stain 
    to beauty. It makes the soul red with guilt, and black with filth. Sin in 
    Scripture is compared to a "menstruous cloth," and to a "plague-sore." 
    Joshua's filthy garments, in which he stood before the angel, were nothing 
    but a type and hieroglyphic of sin. Sin has blotted God's image, and stained 
    the orient brightness of the soul. Sin makes God loathe a sinner; and when a 
    sinner sees his sin, he loathes himself! 
<p align="justify">Sin drops poison on our holy things, it infects our 
    prayers. The high priest was to make atonement for sin on the altar, to 
    typify that our holiest services need Christ to make an atonement for them. 
    Duties of religion are in themselves are good—but sin corrupts them, as the 
    purest water is polluted by running through muddy ground. If the leper, 
    under the law, had touched the altar—the altar would not have cleansed 
    him—but he would have defiled the altar. The apostle calls sin, "Filthiness 
    of flesh and spirit." 2 Cor 7:1. Sin stamps the devil's image on a man. 
    Malice is the devil's eye, hypocrisy his cloven foot. Sin turns a man into a 
    devil. "One of you is a devil!" John 6:70.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Sin is grieving God's Spirit. </p></b></font>"Grieve not 
    the Holy Spirit of God." To <i>grieve </i>is more than to <i>anger</i>.
<p align="justify">How can the Spirit be said to be grieved? For, seeing he 
    is God, he cannot be subject to any passion.</p>
<p align="justify">This is spoken metaphorically. Sin is said to grieve the 
    Spirit; because it is an injury offered to the Spirit, and he takes it 
    unkindly, and, as it were, lays it to heart. And is it not much thus to 
    grieve the Spirit? The Holy Spirit descended in the likeness of a dove; and 
    sin makes this blessed dove mourn! Were it only an angel, we should not 
    grieve him, much less the Spirit of God. Is it not sad—to grieve our 
    Comforter?</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Sin is an act of rebellion against God;</p></b></font> a 
    walking direct opposite to heaven. "If you will walk contrary to me." A 
    sinner tramples upon God's law, crosses his will, and does all he can to 
    affront, yes, to spite God. The Hebrew word for sin, <i>Pasha</i>, signifies 
    rebellion; there is the heart of a rebel, in every sin. "We will do whatever 
    proceeds out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven." Sin 
    strikes at the very Deity. Sin is God's would-be murderer. Sin would not 
    only unthrone God—but un-God him. If the sinner could help it, God would no 
    longer be God.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Sin is an act of ingratitude and unkindness.</p></b></font> 
    God feeds the sinner, keeps off evils from him, be-miracles him with mercy; 
    but the sinner not only forgets God's mercies—but abuses them. He is the 
    worse for mercy; like Absalom, who, as soon as David had kissed him, and 
    taken him into favor, plotted treason against him. Like the mule, who kicks 
    the mother after she has given it milk. "Is this your kindness to your 
    friend?" God may upbraid the sinner. "I have given you," he may say, "your 
    health, strength, and estate; but you requite me evil for good, you wound me 
    with my own mercies! Is this your kindness to your friend? Did I give you 
    life to sin against me? Did I give you wages to serve the devil?"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] Sin is a disease. "</p></b></font>The whole head is 
    sick;" Isa 1:1. Some are sick with pride, others with lust, others with 
    envy. Sin has distempered the intellectual part, it is a leprosy in the 
    head, it has poisoned the vitals. "Their conscience is defiled." Tit 1:15. 
    It is with a sinner as with a sick patient, his palate is distempered, the 
    sweetest things taste bitter to him. The word which is 'sweeter than the 
    honey-comb," tastes bitter to him; he puts 'sweet for bitter." This is a 
    disease, and nothing can cure this disease but the blood of the Physician!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] Sin is an irrational thing.</p></b></font> It makes a man 
    act not only wickedly—but foolishly. It is absurd and irrational to prefer 
    the less before the greater. The sinner prefers the pleasures of life, 
    before the rivers of pleasures at God's right-hand for evermore. Is it not 
    irrational to lose heaven—for the satisfying or indulging of a lust? As 
    Lysimachus, who, for a draught of water, lost a kingdom. Is it not 
    irrational to gratify an enemy? In sin we do so. When lust or rash anger 
    burns in the soul, Satan warms himself at this fire. Men's sins feast the 
    devil.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[7] Sin is a painful thing.</p></b></font> It costs men much 
    labor to pursue their sins. How do they tire themselves in doing the devil's 
    drudgery! "They weary themselves to commit iniquity." What pains did Judas 
    take to bring about his damnation! He goes to the high priest, and then 
    after to the band of soldiers, and then back again to the garden. Chrysostom 
    says, "Virtue is easier than vice." It is more pains to some to follow their 
    sins, than to others to worship their God. While the sinner travails with 
    his sin, in sorrow he brings forth; which is called '<i>serving </i>divers 
    lusts." Not <i>enjoy </i>their lusts—but <i>serve</i> their lusts. Why so? 
    Because not only of the slavery in sin—but the hard labor; it is 'serving 
    divers lusts." Many a man goes to hell in the sweat of his brow.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[8] Sin is the only thing God has an antipathy against.</p></b></font> 
    God does not hate a man because he is poor, or despised in the world; as you 
    do not hate your friend because he is sick. The only thing which which draws 
    forth the keenness of God's hatred, is sin. "Oh, do not this abominable 
    thing which I hate." And sure, if the sinner dies under God's hatred, he 
    cannot be admitted into the celestial mansions. Will God let the man live 
    with him, whom he hates? God will never lay such a viper in his bosom! Until 
    sin is removed, there is no coming where God is.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. See the evil of sin, in the price paid for it.</p></b></font> 
    It cost the blood of God to expiate it. "O man," says Augustine, "consider 
    the greatness of your sin, by the greatness of the price paid for sin." All 
    the princes on earth, or angels in heaven, could not satisfy for sin; only 
    Christ. Nay, Christ's active obedience was not enough to make atonement for 
    sin—but he must suffer upon the cross; for, without blood is no remission of 
    sin. Oh what an accursed thing is sin, that Christ should die for it! The 
    evil of sin is not so much seen in the multitude who are damned for it, as 
    that Christ died for lt.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">IV. Sin is evil in its EFFECTS.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Sin has degraded us of our honor.</p></b></font> Reuben 
    by incest lost his dignity; and though he was the first-born, he could not 
    excel. Gen 49:4. God made us in his own image, a little lower than the 
    angels; but sin has debased us. Before Adam sinned, he was like a herald 
    that has his coat of arms upon him: all reverence him, because he carries 
    the king's coat of arms; but let this coat be pulled off, and he is 
    despised, no man regards him. Sin has done this, it has plucked off our coat 
    of innocence, and now it has debased us, and turned our glory into shame. 
    "And there shall stand up a vile person." Dan 11:21. This was spoken of 
    Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a king, and his name signifies illustrious; yet 
    sin degraded him, he was a vile person.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Sin disquiets the peace of the soul.</p></b></font> "But 
    the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose waves cast up 
    mire and mud. "There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked." Isaiah 
    57:20-21. Whatever defiles, disturbs. As poison corrupts the blood, so sin 
    corrupts the soul. Sin breeds a trembling at the heart; it creates fears, 
    and there is "torment in fear." Sin makes sad convulsions in the conscience. 
    Judas was so terrified with guilt and horror, that he hanged himself to 
    quiet his conscience. In order to ease his conscience—he threw himself into 
    hell.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Sin produces all temporal evil.</p></b></font> "Jerusalem 
    has grievously sinned, therefore she is removed." It is the Trojan horse, 
    which has sword, and famine and pestilence, in its belly. Sin is a coal, 
    which not only blackens--but burns. Sin creates all our troubles; it puts 
    gravel into our bread, and wormwood in our cup. Sin rots the name, consumes 
    the estate, buries loved ones. Sin shoots the flying scroll of God's curses 
    into a family and kingdom. It is reported of Phocas, that having built a 
    wall of mighty strength about his city, there was a voice heard, "Sin is 
    within the city, and that will throw down the wall."

<p align="justify">[4] Sin unrepented of, brings final damnation.</p></b></font> 
    The canker which breeds in the rose is the cause of its perishing; just 
    so—the corruptions which breed in men's souls are the cause of their 
    damning. Sin, without repentance, brings the 'second death," that is "a 
    death always dying," Rev 20:14. Sin's pleasure will turn to sorrow at last; 
    like the book the prophet ate, sweet in the mouth—but bitter in the belly. 
    Sin brings the wrath of God, and what tears can quench that fire? "It is 
    better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into 
    hell—the unquenchable fire, where their worm does not die, and the fire is 
    not quenched." Mark 9:45-46 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: See how deadly an evil sin is, and how strange 
    is it that anyone should love it!</p></b></font> "How long will you love 
    vanity?" Psalm 4:2. "The people have turned to other gods, and love flagons 
    of wine." Hos 3:1: Sin is a dish which men cannot refrain from, though it 
    makes them sick. Who would pour rose-water into a filthy kennel? What pity 
    it is, that so sweet an affection as love should be poured upon so filthy a 
    thing as sin! Sin brings a sting in the conscience, a curse in the estate; 
    yet men love it. A sinner is the greatest self-denier; for his sin he will 
    deny himself a part in heaven.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Do anything rather than sin.</p></b></font> Oh, hate 
    sin! There is more evil in the least sin—than in the greatest bodily evils 
    which can befall us. The ermine rather chooses to die than defile her 
    beautiful skin. There is more evil in a drop of sin—than in a sea of 
    affliction. Affliction is but like a rip in a coat—but sin a stab at the 
    heart. In affliction there is some good—in this lion there is some honey to 
    be found. "It is good for me that I was afflicted." Psalm 119:71. Augustine, 
    "Affliction is God's flail to thresh off our husks. Affliction does not 
    consume—but refines." There is no good in sin; it is the quintessence of 
    evil. Sin is worse than hell; for the pains of hell are a burden to the 
    creature only; but sin is a burden to God. "I am pressed under your 
    iniquities, as a cart is pressed under the sheaves."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Is sin so great an evil?</p></b></font> Then how 
    thankful should you be to God, if he has taken away your sin! "I have taken 
    away your sins." Zech 3:4. If you had a disease on your body—how thankful 
    would you be to have it taken away! Much more to have sin taken away. God 
    takes away the <i>guilt </i>of sin by pardoning grace, and the <i>power </i>
    of sin by mortifying grace. Oh be thankful that this sickness is "not unto 
    death;" that God has changed your nature, and, by grafting you into Christ, 
    made you partake of the sweetness of that olive tree; that sin, though it 
    live, does not reign—but the elder serves the younger; sin the elder—serves 
    grace the younger.

<p align="center">2. ADAM'S SIN</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">Question 15: What was the sin whereby our first parents 
    fell from the estate wherein they were created?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: That sin was eating the forbidden fruit. "She 
    took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also to her husband." Gen 
    3:3. Here is implied, </p>
<p align="justify">1. That our first parents fell from their estate of 
    innocence. </p>
<p align="justify">2. The sin by which they fell, was eating the forbidden 
    fruit.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Our first parents fell from their glorious state of 
    innocence.</p></b></font> "God made man upright—but they have sought out many 
    inventions." Adam was perfectly holy, he had rectitude of mind, and liberty 
    of will to good; but his head ached until he had invented his own—and our 
    death! He sought out many inventions. 
<p align="justify">1. His fall was <b>voluntary</b>. He had a power not to 
    fall. Free-will was a sufficient shield to repel temptation. The devil could 
    not have forced him unless he had given his consent. Satan was only a suitor 
    to woo, not a king to compel; but Adam gave away his own power, and allowed 
    himself to be decoyed into sin; like a young gallant, who at one throw loses 
    a fair lordship. Adam had a fair lordship, he was lord of the world. "Have
    <i>dominion </i>over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and 
    over every living thing that moves." But he lost all at one throw! As soon 
    as he sinned, he forfeited paradise! </p>
<p align="justify">2. Adam's fall was <b>sudden</b>; he did not long 
    continue in his royal majesty.</p>
<p align="justify">How long did Adam continue in paradise before he fell?</p>
<p align="justify">The most probable and received opinion is, that he fell 
    the very same day in which he was created. So Irenaeus, Cyril, Epiphanius, 
    and many others. The reasons which incline me to believe so are,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is said, Satan was a murderer, <i>"from the 
    beginning." </i>Now, whom did he murder? Not the blessed angels, he could 
    not reach them; nor the cursed angels, for they had before destroyed 
    themselves. How then was Satan a murderer from the beginning? As soon as 
    Satan fell, he began to tempt mankind to sin; this was a murdering 
    temptation. By which it appears Adam did not stay long in Paradise; soon 
    after his creation the devil set upon him—and murdered him by his 
    temptation!</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Adam had not yet eaten of the tree of life. "And 
    now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat; 
    the Lord sent him forth of the garden." This tree of life, being one of the 
    choicest fruits in the garden, and being placed in the midst of Paradise, it 
    is very likely Adam would have eaten of this tree of <i>life </i>soon, had 
    not the serpent beguiled him with the tree of <i>knowledge</i>. So that I 
    conclude, Adam fell the very day of his creation, because he had not yet 
    tasted the tree of life, that tree that was most in his eye, and had such 
    delicious fruit growing upon it.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) "Man being in honor, abides not." Psalm 49:12. The 
    Rabbis read it thus, "Adam being in honor, lodged not one night." The Hebrew 
    word for abide, signifies, "To stay or lodge all night." Adam then, it 
    seems, did not take up one night's lodging in Paradise.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: From Adam's sudden fall—learn the weakness of 
    human nature. </p></b></font>Adam, in a state of integrity, quickly made a 
    defection from God, he soon lost the robe of innocence and the glory of 
    Paradise. If our nature was thus weak when it was at the <i>best</i>, what 
    is it now when it is at the <i>worst</i>? If Adam did not stand when he was 
    perfectly righteous, how unable are we to stand when sin has cut the lock of 
    our original righteousness! If <i>purified </i>nature did not stand, how 
    shall <i>corrupt </i>nature? If Adam, in a few hours, sinned himself out of 
    Paradise, how quickly would we sin ourselves into hell—if we were not kept 
    by a greater power than our own! But God puts underneath his everlasting 
    arms. Deut 33:27.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: From Adam's sudden fall—learn how sad it is for 
    a man to be left to himself. </p></b></font>Adam being left to himself, fell. Oh 
    then, what will become of us, how soon fall, if God should leave us to 
    ourselves! A man without God's grace, left to himself, is like a ship in a 
    storm, without pilot or anchor—and is ready to dash upon every rock. Make 
    this prayer to God, "Lord, do not leave me to myself! If Adam, who had 
    strength, fell so soon—how soon shall I fall who have no strength!" Oh! urge 
    God with his hand and seal. "My strength shall be made perfect in weakness." 
    2 Cor 12:9.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. The sin by which our first parents fell was eating 
    the forbidden fruit; where, consider two things:</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The occasion of it was the serpent's temptation.</p></b></font> 
    The devil crept into the serpent, and spoke in the serpent. Consider:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) The subtlety of Satan's temptation.</p></b></font> His 
    wiles are worse than his darts. Satan's subtlety in tempting; (1.) He dealt 
    all along as an impostor, he ushered in his temptation by lies. 
<p align="justify">1st Lie. "You shall not surely die." </p>
<p align="justify">2nd Lie. That God did envy our first parents their 
    happiness. "God knows, that in the day you eat, your eyes shall be opened." 
    That is, "The reason why God forbids you to eat of this tree—is because he 
    envies your felicity."</p>
<p align="justify">3rd Lie. That they would be thereby made like unto God. 
    "You shall be as gods." Here was his subtlety in tempting. The devil was 
    first a <i>liar</i>, then a <i>murderer!</i></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) In that he set upon our first parents so quickly, 
    before they were confirmed in their obedience.</p></b></font> The angels in 
    heaven are fully confirmed in holiness; they are called stars of the 
    morning, Job 38:7, and they are fixed stars; but our first parents were not 
    confirmed in their obedience, they were not fixed in their orb of holiness. 
    Though they had a possibility of standing, they had not an impossibility of 
    falling; they were <i>holy</i>—but <i>mutable</i>. There was Satan's 
    subtlety, in tempting our first parents before they were confirmed in their 
    obedience.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) His subtlety in tempting was, that he set upon Eve 
    first, because he thought she was less able to resist. </p></b></font>Satan 
    broke over the hedge where it was weakest; he knew he could more easily 
    insinuate and wind himself into <i>her, </i>by a temptation. An expert 
    soldier, when about to storm or enter a castle, carefully observes where 
    there is a breach, or how he may enter with more ease; so did Satan tempt 
    the weaker vessel. He tempted Eve first, because he knew, if once he could 
    prevail with her, she would easily draw her husband. Thus the devil handed 
    over a temptation to Job by his wife. "Curse God and die." Job 2:9. 
    Agrippina poisoned the Emperor Commodus, with wine in a <i>perfumed </i>cup; 
    the cup being perfumed and given him by his wife, it was the less suspected. 
    Satan knew a temptation coming to Adam from his wife would be more 
    prevailing, and would be less suspected. Oh bitter! sometimes relations 
    prove temptations. A wife may be a snare, when she dissuades her husband 
    from doing his duty, or entices him to evil. "Ahab sold himself to work 
    wickedness, whom his wife Jezebel stirred up." I Kings 21:25. She blew the 
    coals, and made his sin flame out the more. Satan's subtlety was in tempting 
    Adam by his wife; he thought she would draw him to sin.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Satan's subtlety in tempting was in assaulting Eve's 
    faith.</p></b></font> He would persuade her that God had not spoken truth: "You 
    shall not surely die." Gen 3:4. This was Satan's masterpiece, to weaken her 
    faith. When he had shaken that, and had brought her once to distrust: then 
    "she yielded," she presently put forth her hand to evil.
<b>
<p align="justify">Satan's CRUELTY in tempting. </p></b>As soon as Adam was 
    invested in all his glory, the devil cruelly, as it were on the day of 
    Adam's coronation, would dethrone him, and bring him and all his posterity 
    under a curse! See how little love Satan has to mankind; he has an 
    implacable antipathy against us; and <i>antipathies </i>can never be 
    reconciled. So much for the occasion of Adam's sin, or his being tempted by 
    the serpent.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The sin itself. </p></b></font>"Eating the forbidden 
    fruit." This was very heinous, and that appears three ways: 
<p align="justify">(1.) In respect of the person who committed it. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The aggravation of the sin. </p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The dreadfulness of the effect.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It was very heinous in respect of the person who 
    committed it.</p></b></font> Adam had excellent and noble endowments; he was 
    illumined with knowledge, embellished with holiness; he knew his duty, and 
    it was as easy for him to <i>obey </i>God's command, as to <i>know </i>it; 
    he might have chosen whether he would sin or not; yet he willfully did eat 
    of the forbidden tree.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The aggravation of Adam's sin.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Why is Adam's sin so great? It was but the seizing of an 
    apple! Was it such a great sin—to pluck an apple? "When the woman saw that 
    the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also 
    desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some 
    to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it." Genesis 3:6.</p>
<p align="justify">It was sin against an infinite God. It was a voluminous 
    sin, there were many sins twisted together in it. As Cicero says of 
    parricide, "He who is guilty of it, he commits many sins in one;" so there 
    were many sins in this one sin of Adam. It was a big-bellied sin, a chain 
    with many links. Ten sins were in it.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Unbelief. </p></b></font>Our first parents did not 
    believe what God had spoken was truth. God said, "You must not eat from the 
    tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will 
    surely die." They did not believe that they would die; they could not be 
    persuaded that such fair fruit had death at the door. Thus, by unbelief they 
    called God a liar; nay, which was worse, they believed the devil rather than 
    God!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Unthankfulness</p></b></font>, which is the epitome of 
    all sin. Adam's sin was committed in the midst of <i>Paradise</i>. God had 
    enriched him with variety of mercies; he had stamped his own image upon him; 
    he had made him lord of the world; gave him of all the trees of the garden 
    to eat (one only excepted). And now to take of that tree! This was high 
    ingratitude; it was like the dye to the wool, which makes it crimson. When 
    Adam's eyes were opened, and he saw what he had done—well might he be 
    ashamed, and hide himself. How could he who sinned in the midst of Paradise, 
    look God in the face without blushing!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) In Adam's sin was discontent.</p></b></font> Had he not 
    been discontented, he would never have sought to have altered his condition. 
    Adam, one would think, had enough; he differed but little from the angels, 
    he had the robe of innocence to clothe him, and the glory of Paradise to 
    crown him. Yet he was not content, he would have more; he would be above the 
    ordinary rank of creatures. How wide was Adam's heart, that a whole world 
    could not fill it!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Pride</p></b></font>, in that he would be like God. This
    <i>worm</i>, which was but newly crept out of the dust, now aspired after 
    Deity! "You will be like God," said Satan, and Adam hoped to have been so 
    indeed; he supposed the tree of knowledge would have anointed his eyes, and 
    made him omniscient. But, by climbing too high, he got a dreadful fall!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Disobedience.</p></b></font> God said, "You must not eat 
    from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil;" but he would eat of it, 
    though it cost him his life! Disobedience is a sin against equity. It is 
    right we should serve him from whom we have our existence. God gave Adam his 
    allowance, therefore it was but right he should give God his allegiance. How 
    could God endure to see his laws trampled on before his face? This made him 
    place a flaming sword at the end of the garden.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) Curiosity.</p></b></font> He meddled with that which was 
    out of his sphere, and did not belong to him. God smote the men of 
    Bethshemesh for looking into the ark. I Sam 6:19. Adam would be prying into 
    God's secrets, and tasting what was forbidden.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(7.) Wantonness. </p></b></font>Though Adam had a choice of 
    all the other trees—yet his palate grew wanton, and he must have this tree. 
    Like Israel, God sent them manna, angels' food, ay—but they had a hankering 
    after quails. It was not enough that God supplied their <i>needs</i>, unless 
    he should satisfy their <i>lusts</i>! Adam had not only everything for 
    necessity—but for delight; yet his wanton palate lusted after forbidden 
    fruit.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(8.) Sacrilege. </p></b></font>The tree of knowledge did not 
    belong to Adam—yet he took of it, and did sacrilegiously <i>rob </i>God of 
    his due. It was counted a great crime in Harpalus to rob the temple, and 
    steal the silver vessels; so it was a great crime in Adam, to steal fruit 
    from that tree which God had peculiarly enclosed for himself. Sacrilege is 
    double theft.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(9.) Murder.</p></b></font> Adam was a public person, and all 
    his posterity were involved and wrapped up in him; and he, by sinning, at 
    once destroyed all his posterity! (if free grace did not interpose.) If 
    Abel's blood cried so loud in God's ears, "The voice of your brother's blood 
    cries unto me from the ground," how loud did the blood of all Adam's 
    posterity cry against him for vengeance!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(10.) Presumption.</p></b></font> Adam presumed of God's 
    mercy; he blessed himself, saying he would have peace; he thought, though he 
    did transgress, he would not die; that God would sooner reverse his decree, 
    than punish him. This was great presumption. What a heinous sin, was Adam's 
    breach of covenant!
<p align="justify">One sin may have many sins in it. We are apt to have 
    slight thoughts of sin, and say "it is but a little one." How many sins were 
    in Adam's sin! Oh take heed of any sin! As in one volume there may be many 
    works bound up, so there may be many sins in one sin.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] The dreadfulness of the effect. </p></b></font>It has 
    corrupted man's nature. How deadly is that poison—a drop whereof, could 
    poison a whole sea! And how deadly is that sin of Adam, which could poison 
    all mankind, and bring a curse upon them—until it be taken away by him who 
    was made a curse for us!
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center"><br/>
    3. ORIGINAL SIN</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">Question 16: Did all mankind fall in Adam's first 
    transgression?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: The covenant being made with Adam, not only for 
    himself—but for his posterity, all mankind descending from him, by ordinary 
    generation, sinned in him, and fell with him in his first transgression.</p>
<p align="justify">"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one 
    man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because 
    all sinned." Romans 5:12 </p>
<p align="justify">Adam being a representative person, while he stood, we 
    stood; when he fell, we fell, We sinned in Adam; so it is in the text, "In 
    whom all have sinned."</p>
<p align="justify">Adam was the head of mankind, and being guilty, we are 
    guilty, as the children of a traitor have their blood stained. "All of us," 
    says Augustine, "sinned in Adam, because we were part of Adam."</p>
<p align="justify">If when Adam fell, all mankind fell with him; why, when 
    one angel fell, did not all fall?</p>
<p align="justify">The case is not the same. The angels had no relation to 
    one another. They are called morning-stars; the stars have no dependence one 
    upon another; but it was otherwise with us, we were in Adam's loins; as a 
    child is a branch of the parent, we were part of Adam; therefore when he 
    sinned, we sinned.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">How is Adam's sin made ours?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">(1.) By <b>imputation</b>. The Pelagians of old held, 
    that Adam's transgression is hurtful to posterity by <i>imitation </i>only, 
    not by <i>imputation</i>. But the text, "In whom all have sinned," confutes 
    that.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Adam's sin is ours by <b>propagation</b>. Not only 
    is the guilt of Adam's sin imputed to us—but the depravity and corruption of 
    his nature is transmitted to us, as poison is carried from the fountain to 
    the cistern. This is that which we call original sin. "In sin did my mother 
    conceive me." Psalm 51:5. Adam's leprosy cleaves to us, as Naaman's leprosy 
    did to Gehazi. 2 Kings 5:27. This original sin is called,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The "old man." Eph 4:22. It is said to be the old 
    man, not that it is weak, as old men are—but for its long standing, and for 
    its deformity. In old age the fair blossoms of beauty fall; so original sin 
    is the old man, because it has withered our beauty, and made us deformed in 
    God's eye.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Original sin is called "the law of sin." Rom 7:25 
    Original sin has the power of a law which binds the subject to allegiance. 
    Men must needs do what sin will have them, when they have both the <i>love
    </i>of sin to draw them, and the <i>law </i>of sin to force them.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. In original sin there is something privative, and 
    something positive.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">[1] Something <b>privative</b>. The lack of that 
    righteousness which should be ours. We have lost that excellent 
    quintessential frame of soul which once we had. Sin has cut the lock of 
    original purity, where our strength lay.</p>
<p align="justify">[2] Something <b>positive</b>. Original sin has 
    contaminated and defiled our virgin nature. Original sin has poisoned the 
    spring of our nature, it has turned beauty into leprosy; it has turned the 
    azure brightness of our souls, into midnight darkness.</p>
<p align="justify">Original sin has become natural to us. A man by nature 
    cannot but sin; though there were no devil to tempt, no bad examples to 
    imitate—yet there is such an innate principle in him that he cannot forbear 
    sinning. 2 Pet 2:14. We cannot cease to sin, as a horse that is lame, cannot 
    walk without halting. <b>In original sin there is,</b></p>
<p align="justify">(1.) An aversion from good. Man has a desire to be 
    happy—yet opposes that which would promote his happiness. He has a disgust 
    of holiness, he hates to be reformed. Since we fell from God, we have no 
    mind to return to him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) A propensity to evil.</p></b> If, as the Pelagians say, 
    there is so much goodness in us since the fall, why is there not as much 
    natural proneness to good as there is to evil? Our experience tells us, that 
    the natural bias of the soul, is to that which is bad. The very heathens by 
    the light of nature saw this. Hierocles the philosopher said, "it is grafted 
    in us by nature to sin." Men roll sin as honey under their tongue. "They 
    drink iniquity as water," Job 15:16. Like a person who thirsts for drink, 
    and is not satisfied; they have a kind of drought on them, they thirst for 
    sin. Though they are tired out in committing sin—yet they sin. "Having lost 
    all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to 
    indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more." 
    Ephesians 4:19. "They weary themselves to commit iniquity"; as a man who 
    follows his game while he is weary—yet delights in it, and cannot leave it 
    off. Jer 9:5. Though God has set so many flaming swords in the way to stop 
    men in their sin—yet they go on in it; which all shows what a strong 
    appetite they have to the forbidden fruit.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. That we may further see the nature of original sin, 
    consider,</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The UNIVERSALITY of it. </p></b></font>It has, as poison, 
    diffused itself into all the parts and powers of the soul. "The whole head 
    is sick, and the whole heart is faint." Isa 1:5. Like a sick patient, that 
    has no part sound, his liver is swelled, his feet are gangrened, his lungs 
    are withered; such infected, gangrened souls have we, until Christ, who has 
    made a medicine of his blood, cures us.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Original sin has depraved the intellectual part—the 
    MIND.</p></b></font> As in the creation "darkness was upon the face of the 
    deep," so it is with the understanding; darkness is upon the face of this 
    deep. As there is salt in every drop of the sea, bitterness in every branch 
    of wormwood, so there is sin in every faculty. The mind is darkened, we <i>
    know </i>little of God. Ever since Adam ate of the tree of knowledge, and 
    his eyes were opened—we lost our eye-sight! Besides <b>ignorance </b>in the 
    mind, there is <b>error </b>and <b>mistake</b>; we do not judge rightly of 
    things, we put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter. Isa 5:20. Besides 
    this, there is much pride, disdainfulness and prejudice, and many fleshly 
    reasonings. "How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?" Jer 4:14.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Original sin has defiled the HEART. </p></b></font>The 
    heart is deadly wicked. "The human heart is most deceitful and desperately 
    wicked. Who really knows how bad it is?" Jeremiah 17:9. It is a lesser hell. 
    In the heart are legions of lusts, obdurateness, infidelity, hypocrisy, 
    sinful lusts. It boils as the sea—with passion and revenge. "The hearts of 
    men, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while 
    they live." Ecclesiastes 9:3. The heart is "the devil's workshop," where all 
    mischief is framed.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Original sin has defiled the WILL. </p></b></font>
    Contumacy is the seat of rebellion. The sinner crosses God's will, to 
    fulfill his own. "We <i>will </i>burn incense to the queen of heaven." There 
    is a rooted enmity in the will against holiness; it is like an iron sinew, 
    it refuses to bend to God. Where is then, the <i>freedom </i>of the will, 
    when it is so full not only of indisposition—but opposition to what is 
    spiritual?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Original sin has defiled the AFFECTIONS.</p></b></font> 
    These, as the strings of a violin, are out of tune. They are the lesser 
    wheels, which are strongly carried by the will, the master-wheel. Our 
    affections are set on wrong objects. Our love is set on sin, our joy is set 
    on the creature. Our affections are naturally as a sick man's appetite, who 
    desires things which are noxious and hurtful to him. So we have impure 
    lustings, instead of holy longings.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The ADHESION of original sin. </p></b></font>It cleaves 
    to us, as blackness to the skin of the Ethiopian, so that we cannot get rid 
    of it. Paul shook off the viper on his hand—but we cannot shake off this 
    inbred corruption. It may be compared to a wild fig-tree growing on a wall, 
    the roots of which are pulled up, and yet there are some fibers of it in the 
    joints of the stonework, which will not be eradicated—but will sprout forth 
    until the wall is pulled in pieces. Original sin comes not, as a lodger, for 
    a night—but as an indweller. "Sin which dwells in me." Rom 7:17.
<p align="justify">It is an evil spirit, which haunts us wherever we go. 
    "The Canaanite would dwell in that land." Josh 17:12.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Original sin retards and hinders us in the exercise 
    of God's worship. </p></b></font>Whence is "all that dullness and deadness in 
    religion? It is the fruit of original sin. This it is, which rocks us asleep 
    in duty. "The good that I would, I do not." Rom 7:17. Sin is compared to a
    <b>weight</b>. Heb 12:2. A man who has weights tied to his legs cannot run 
    fast. It is like that fish Pliny speaks of, a sea lamprey, which cleaves to 
    the keel of the ship, and hinders its progress when it is under sail.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Original sin, though latent in the soul, and as a 
    spring which runs under ground, often breaks forth unexpectedly.</p></b></font> 
    Christian, you can not believe that evil which is in your heart, and which 
    will break forth suddenly—if God should leave you. "Is your servant a dog 
    that he should do this monstrous thing?" 2 Kings 8:13. Hazael could not 
    believe he had such a root of evil in his heart, that he should rip up 
    pregnant women. "Is your servant a dog?" Yes, and worse than a dog, when 
    that original corruption within is stirred up. If one had come to Peter and 
    said, Peter, within a few hours you will deny Christ, he would have said, 
    "Is your servant a dog?" But alas! Peter did not know his own heart, nor how 
    far that corruption within would prevail upon him. The sea may be calm, and 
    look clear; but when the wind blows—how it rages and foams! So though now 
    your heart seems good—yet, when temptation blows, how may original sin 
    reveal itself, making you foam with lust and passion. Who would have thought 
    to have found <i>adultery </i>in David, and <i>drunkenness </i>in Noah, and
    <i>cursing </i>in Job? If God leaves a man to himself, how suddenly and 
    scandalously may original sin break forth in the holiest men on the earth!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] Original sin mixes and incorporates itself with our 
    duties and graces. </p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) With our duties. </p></b></font>As the hand which is 
    paralyzed cannot move without shaking—as it lacks some inward strength; so 
    we cannot do any holy action without sinning—as we lack a principle of 
    original righteousness. As whatever the leper touched became unclean; such a 
    leprosy is original sin; it defiles our prayers and tears. We cannot write 
    without blotting. Though I do not say that the holy duties and good works of 
    the regenerate are sins, for that were to reproach the Spirit of Christ, by 
    whom they are wrought; yet this I say—that the best works of the godly have 
    sin cleaving to them. Christ's blood alone, makes atonement for our <i>holy
    </i>things.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) With our graces. </p></b></font>There is some unbelief 
    mixed with our faith, some lukewarmness mixed with our zeal, some pride 
    mixed with our humility. As bad lungs cause shortness of breath, so original 
    corruption has infected our hearts, so that our graces breathe very faintly.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] Original sin is a vigorous active principle within 
    us.</p></b></font> It does not lie still—but is ever exciting and stirring us up 
    to evil; it is a very restless inhabitant. "What I hate—that I do!" How came 
    Paul to do so? Original sin irritated and stirred him up to it. Original sin 
    is like quicksilver, always in motion. When we are asleep, sin is awake in 
    the imagination. Original sin sets the <i>head </i>plotting evil, and the <i>
    hands </i>working it. It has in it, a principle of restless activity; it is 
    like the pulse—ever beating.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[7] Original sin is the cause of all actual sin.</p></b></font> 
    It is the kindling-wood of sin; it is the womb in which all actual sins are 
    conceived. Hence come murders, adulteries, rapines. Though actual sins may 
    be more <i>scandalous</i>—yet original sin is more <i>heinous</i>; the cause 
    is always more than the effect.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[8] Original sin is not perfectly cured in this life. </p></b>
</font>Though grace does <i>subdue </i>sin—yet it does not wholly <i>remove
    </i>it. Though we are like Christ, having the <i>first </i>fruits of the 
    Spirit—yet we are unlike him, having the remainders of sinful flesh. There 
    are two nations in the womb. Original sin is like that tree, in Dan 4:23, 
    though the branches and the main body of it were hewn down—yet the stumps 
    and root of the tree were left. Though the Spirit is still weakening and 
    hewing down sin in the godly—yet <i>the stump of original sin is left</i>. 
    It is a sea that will not, in this life, be dried up.
<b>
<p align="justify">But why does God leave original corruption in us after 
    regeneration?</p></b> He could free us from it if he pleased.
<p align="justify">(1.) He does it to show the power of his grace in the 
    weakest believer. Grace shall prevail against a torrent of corruption. 
    Whence is this? The corruption is ours—but the grace is God's.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) God leaves original corruption to make us long after 
    heaven, where there shall be no sin to defile, no devil to tempt. When 
    Elijah was taken up to heaven his mantle dropped off; so, when the angels 
    shall carry us up to heaven, this mantle of sin shall drop off. We shall 
    never more complain of an aching head—or an unbelieving heart.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: If original sin be propagated to us, and will be 
    inherent in us while we live here, it confutes the Libertines and Quakers, 
    who say they are without sin. </p></b></font>They hold to sinless perfection; 
    they show much pride and ignorance; but we see the seeds of original sin 
    remain in the best. "There is not a just man lives and sins not." And Paul 
    complained of a "body of death." Though grace <i>purifies </i>nature, it 
    does not <i>perfect </i>it.
<p align="justify">But does not the apostle say of believers, that their 
    "old man is crucified;" and they are "dead to sin?"</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They are dead spiritually. They are dead as to the
    <i>guilt </i>of it; and as to the <i>power </i>of it; the <i>love </i>of sin 
    is crucified.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are dead to sin <i>legally</i>. As a man who is 
    sentenced to death is dead in law, so they are legally dead to sin. There is 
    a sentence of death gone out against sin. It shall die, and drop into the 
    grave; but at the present, sin has its life lengthened out. Nothing but the 
    death of the body can quite free us from the body of this death.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Let us lay to heart original sin, and be deeply 
    humbled for it. </p></b></font>It cleaves to us as a disease, it is an active 
    principle in us, stirring us up to evil. Original sin is worse than all 
    actual sin; the fountain is more than the stream. Some think, as long as 
    they are civil, they are well enough; ay—but the nature is poisoned. A river 
    may have fair streams—but vermin at the bottom. You carry a hell about you, 
    you can do nothing but you defile it; your heart, like muddy ground, defiles 
    the purest water that runs through it. Nay, though you are regenerate, there 
    is much of the old man in the new man. Oh how should original sin humble us!
<p align="justify">This is one reason God has left original sin in us, 
    because he would have it as a thorn in our side to humble us. As the bishop 
    of Alexandria, after the people had embraced Christianity, destroyed all 
    their idols but one, that the sight of that idol might make them loathe 
    themselves for their former idolatry; so God leaves original sin to pull 
    down the plumes of pride. Under our silver wings of grace, are black feet.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Let the sense of this make us daily look up to 
    heaven for help. </p></b></font>Beg Christ's blood to wash away the <i>guilt </i>
    of sin, and his Spirit to mortify the <i>power </i>of it; beg further 
    degrees of grace. Though grace cannot make sin not to <i>be</i>—yet it makes 
    it not to <i>reign</i>; though grace cannot <i>expel </i>sin, it can <i>
    repel </i>it. And for our comfort, where grace makes a <i>combat </i>with 
    sin—death shall make a <i>conquest</i> of sin.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Let original sin make us walk with continual 
    jealousy and watchfulness over our hearts. </p></b></font>The sin of our nature 
    is like a sleeping lion, the least thing which awakens it, makes it rage. 
    Though the sin of our nature seems quiet, and lies as fire hidden under the 
    embers—yet if it be a little stirred and blown up by a temptation, how 
    quickly may it flame forth into scandalous evils! therefore we need always 
    to walk watchfully. "I say to you all—Watch!" A wandering <i>heart</i>, 
    needs a watchful <i>eye!</i>

    4. Man's Misery By The Fall</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">Question 19: What is the MISERY of that estate into which 
    man fell?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: All mankind by their fall lost communion with 
    God, are under his wrath and curse, and so made liable to all the miseries 
    in this life, to death itself, and to the pains of hell forever.</p>
<p align="justify">"As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and 
    sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and 
    of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in 
    those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one time, 
    gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and 
    thoughts. Like the rest, we <i>were by nature objects of wrath</i>." 
    Ephesians 2:1-3. </p>
<p align="justify">Adam left an unhappy portion to his posterity—Sin and 
    Misery. Having considered the first of these, original sin, we shall now 
    advert to the misery of that state. In the first, we have seen mankind 
    offending; in the second, we shall see him suffering. The misery ensuing 
    from original sin is two-fold.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Privative.</p></b></font> By this first hereditary sin we 
    have <b>lost </b>communion with God. Adam was God's familiar friend, his 
    favorite; but sin has put us all out of favor. When we lost God's image, we 
    lost his acquaintance. God's banishing Adam out of paradise, 
    hieroglyphically showed how sin has banished us out of God's love and favor.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Positive.</p></b></font> In four things. 
<p align="justify">1. Under the power of Satan. </p>
<p align="justify">2. Heirs of God's wrath. </p>
<p align="justify">3. Subject to all the miseries of this life. </p>
<p align="justify">4. Exposed to hell and damnation.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The first misery is, that by nature we are under the 
    power of Satan,</p></b></font> who is called "the prince of the power of the 
    air." Before the fall man was a free citizen, now he has become a slave of 
    Satan. Before the fall man was king on the throne, now he is in fetters. And 
    whom is man enslaved to? To one who is a hater of him. This was an 
    aggravation of Israel's servitude. "Those who hated them ruled over them." 
    By sin we are enslaved to Satan, who is a hater of mankind, and writes all 
    his laws in blood. Sinners before conversion are under Satan's command; as 
    the donkey at the command of the driver, so he does all the devil's 
    drudgery. No sooner Satan tempts—but he obeys. As the ship is at the command 
    of the pilot, who steers it which way he will, so is the sinner at the 
    command of Satan; and he ever steers the ship into hell's mouth! The devil 
    rules all the powers and faculties of a sinner.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) He rules the UNDERSTANDING.</p></b></font> He <i>blinds
    </i>men with ignorance, and then <i>rules </i>them; as the Philistines first 
    put out Samson's eyes, and then bound him. Satan can do what he will with an 
    ignorant man; because he does not see the error of his way, the devil can 
    lead him into any sin. You may lead a blind man any where. Every sin is 
    founded upon ignorance.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Satan rules the WILL. </p></b></font>Though he cannot 
    force the will—yet he can, by temptation, draw it. "The lusts of your 
    father, you <i>will </i>do." He has got your hearts, and him you will obey. 
    "We will burn incense to the queen of heaven." When the devil spurs a sinner 
    by a temptation, he will over hedge and ditch break all God's laws, that he 
    may obey Satan. Where then is <i>free will</i>, when Satan has such power 
    over the will? "His lusts you <i>will </i>do." There's not any member of the 
    body but is at the devil's service: the <i>head </i>to plot sin, the <i>
    hands </i>to work it, the <i>feet </i>to run the devil's errand. Satan is 
    the worst tyrant; the cruelty of a cannibal, or Nero, is nothing compared to 
    his. Other tyrants do but rule over the bodies, but Satan over the 
    conscience. Other tyrants have some pity on their slaves; though they work 
    in the galley, they give them food, let them have hours for rest; but Satan 
    is a merciless tyrant, he lets them have no rest. What pains did Judas take! 
    The devil would let him have no rest until he had betrayed Christ, and 
    afterwards imbrued his hands in Christ's own blood.
<b>
<p align="justify">Use one: see here our misery by original sin; enslaved to 
    Satan.</p></b> Satan is said to work effectually in the children of 
    disobedience. What a sad plague is it for a sinner, to be at the will of the 
    devil! Just like a slave, if the Turks bid him dig in the mines, hew in the 
    quarries, tug at the oar—the slave must do it, he dares not refuse. If the 
    devil bids a man lie or steal, he does not refuse; and, what is worse, he 
    willingly obeys this tyrant. Other slaves are forced against their will: 
    "Israel sighed by reason of their bondage," but sinners are willing to be 
    slaves, they will not take their freedom; they kiss their fetters!
<b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Let us labor to get out of this deplorable 
    condition into which sin has plunged us, and get out from under the power of 
    Satan. </p></b>If any of your children were slaves, you would give great sums of 
    money to purchase their freedom; and when your souls are enslaved, will you 
    not labor for their freedom? Improve the gospel. The gospel proclaims a 
    jubilee to captives. Sin binds men—but the gospel looses them. Paul's 
    preaching was "to turn men from the power of Satan to God." The gospel star 
    leads you to Christ; and if you get Christ, then you are made free, though 
    not from the indwelling of sin—yet from Satan's tyranny. "If the Son makes 
    you free, you shall be free indeed." You hope to be kings to reign in 
    heaven, and will you let Satan reign in you now? Never think to be <i>kings
    </i>when you die, and <i>slaves </i>while you live. The crown of glory is 
    for <i>conquerors</i>, not for <i>captives</i>. Oh get out of Satan's 
    jurisdiction; get your fetters of sin filed off by repentance!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The second misery is, by nature we are "the children 
    of wrath."</p></b></font> By children of wrath, the apostle means heirs of 
    wrath, exposed to God's displeasure. God was once a friend—but sin broke the 
    knot of friendship; now God's smile is turned into a frown; we have now 
    become children of wrath. "And who knows the power of God's wrath?" Psalm 
    90:2. "The wrath of a king is as the roaring of a lion." How did Haman's 
    heart tremble, when the king rose up from the banquet in wrath! But God's 
    wrath is infinite, all other wrath, is but as a spark compared to a flame! 
    Wrath in God is not a passion, as in us; but it is an act of God's holy 
    will, whereby he abhors sin, and decrees to punish it. This wrath is very 
    dreadful; it is this wrath of God which embitters afflictions in this life, 
    for when sickness comes attended with God's wrath, it puts conscience into 
    an agony. The mingling of the <i>fire </i>with the <i>hail </i>made it most 
    dreadful. Exod 9:24. So mingling God's wrath with affliction, makes it 
    torturing; it is the nail in the heart. God's wrath, when but in a <i>
    threatening </i>(as a shower hanging in the cloud), made Eli's ears to 
    tingle; what is it then, when this wrath is <i>executed!</i> It is dreadful 
    when the king examines and judges a traitor; but it is more dreadful when he 
    causes him to be set upon the rack! "Who knows the power of God's wrath?"
    
<p align="justify">While we are children of wrath, we have nothing to do 
    with any of the precious promises; they are as the tree of life, bearing 
    several sorts of fruit—but we have no right to pluck one leaf. "Children of 
    wrath." "Strangers to the covenants of promise." The promises are as a 
    fountain sealed. While we are in the state of nature, we see nothing but the 
    flaming sword; and, as the apostle says, "There remains nothing but a 
    fearful looking for of fiery indignation!" While children of wrath, we are 
    "heirs to all God's <i>curses</i>." How can the sinner eat and drink in that 
    condition? Like Damocles' banquet—who while he sat at table with a sword 
    hanging over his head by a small thread, could have little stomach to eat; 
    so the sword of God's <i>wrath </i>and <i>curse </i>hangs every moment over 
    a sinner's head. We read of a flying scroll, written with curses. Zech 5:3. 
    A scroll written with curses goes out against every person who lives and 
    dies in sin. God's curse blasts, wherever it comes. There is a curse on the 
    sinner's name, a curse on his soul, a curse on his estate and posterity, a 
    curse on the ordinances. Sad, if all a man eats should turn to poison; yet 
    the sinner eats and drinks his own damnation at God's table. Thus it is 
    before conversion. As the <i>love </i>of God makes every <i>bitter </i>
    thing, sweet; so the curse of God makes every <i>sweet </i>thing, bitter.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Use one: See our misery by the fall.</p></b> Heirs of wrath. 
    And is this estate to be rested in? If a man is fallen under the king's 
    displeasure, will he not labor to re-ingratiate himself into his favor? Oh 
    let us flee from the wrath of God! And where should we fly—but to Jesus 
    Christ? There is none else to shield off the wrath of God from us. "Jesus 
    has delivered us from the wrath to come."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] The third misery is, that by nature we are subject to 
    all outward miseries.</p></b></font> All the troubles incident to man's life, 
    are the bitter fruits of original sin. The sin of Adam has "subjected the 
    creature to vanity." Is it not a part of the creature's vanity, that all the 
    comforts below will not fill the heart, any more than the mariner's breath 
    can fill the sails of a ship? "In the midst of his sufficiency he shall be 
    in straits." There is still something lacking, and a man would have more; 
    the heart is always restless; it thirsts—but is never satisfied. Solomon put 
    all the creatures into a crucible; and when he came to extract the spirit 
    and quintessence, there was nothing but froth, "all was vanity." Nay, it is
    <i>vexing </i>vanity; not only emptiness—but bitterness. Our life is labor 
    and sorrow. We come into the world with a cry—and go out with a groan! Psalm 
    90:10. Some have said, that they would not live the life they have lived 
    over again, because their life has had more <i>water </i>in it than <i>wine</i>; 
    more water of tears, than wine of joy. "Long life is merely long torment." 
    Augustine. 
<p align="justify">"Man is born to trouble." Everyone is not born heir to 
    land—but he is born heir to trouble. As well separate weight from lead, as 
    separate trouble from man. We do not finish our troubles in this life—but 
    change them. Trouble is the vermin, which is bred out of the putrid matter 
    of sin. Whence come all our <i>fears</i>, but from sin? "There is torment in 
    fear." Fear is the plague of the soul—fear sets it shaking; some fear 
    poverty, others alarms, others fear loss of relations; if we rejoice, it is 
    with <i>trembling</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Whence come all our <i>disappointments </i>of hopes, but 
    from sin? Where we look for comfort—there is a cross; where we expect 
    honey—there we taste wormwood. Whence is it, that the earth is filled with
    <i>violence</i>, that the wicked oppresses the man who is more righteous 
    than he? Hab 1:13. Whence is there so much <i>fraudulence </i>in dealing, so 
    much falseness in friendship, such crosses in relations? Whence is it, that 
    children prove undutiful, and they that should be as the staff of the 
    parents' old age, are a sword to pierce their hearts? Whence is it, that 
    servants are unfaithful to their masters? The apostle speaks of some who 
    have entertained angels in their houses; Heb 13:3; but how often, instead of 
    entertaining angels in their houses, do some entertain devils! Whence come 
    all the mutinies and divisions in a kingdom? "In those days there was no 
    peace to those who went out, nor to him that came in." All this is but the 
    sour core in the apple which our first parents ate—the fruit of original 
    sin! Besides, all the <i>deformities </i>and <i>diseases </i>of the body—are 
    from sin! There had never been a stone in the <i>kidneys</i>—if there had 
    not been first a stone in the <i>heart!</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Yes, the <i>death </i>of the body is the fruit and result 
    of original sin. "Sin entered into the world, and death by sin." Adam was 
    made immortal, conditionally, if he had not sinned. Sin dug Adam's grave! 
    Death is dreadful to nature. Louis, king of France, forbade all who came 
    into his court to mention the word, <i>'death' </i>in his ears. The 
    Socinians say, that death comes only from the infirmities of the body. But 
    the apostle says, Sin ushered in death into the world: by sin came death. 
    Certainly, had not Adam ate of the tree of knowledge, he would not have 
    died. "In the day you eat, you shall surely die;" implying, if Adam had not 
    eaten, he would not have died. Oh then, see the misery ensuing upon original 
    sin! Sin dissolves the harmony and well-being of the body, and pulls its 
    frame in pieces.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] The fourth misery is, that original sin without 
    repentance, exposes to hell and damnation. </p></b></font>This is the second 
    death. Rev 20:14. Two things are in it:
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Punishment of LOSS.</p></b></font> The soul is banished 
    from the beatific presence of God, in whose presence is fullness of joy.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Punishment of SENSE. </p></b></font>The sinner feels 
    scalding vials of God's wrath. It is penetrating, abiding, John 3:36, and 
    reserved, 2 Pet 2:17. If when God's anger is kindled but a little, and a <i>
    spark </i>or two of it flies into a man's conscience in this life, it is so 
    dreadful; what will it be when God stirs up <i>all </i>his anger? In hell 
    there is the <i>worm </i>and the <i>fire</i>. Mark 9:44. Hell is the very 
    epitome of misery! In hell, there is judgement without mercy. Oh what flames 
    of wrath, what seas of vengeance, what rivers of brimstone—are poured out 
    there upon the damned! Bellarmine is of opinion, That one glimpse of 
    hell-fire were enough to make the most flagitious sinner to turn Christian; 
    nay, live like a hermit, a most strict mortified life. What is all other 
    fire compared to the fire of hell—but painted fire? To <i>bear </i>it will 
    be intolerable, to <i>escape </i>it will be impossible! And these hell 
    torments are <i>forever</i>, they have no <i>end </i>put to them. "They 
    shall seek death, and shall not find it." Origen fancied a fiery stream in 
    which the souls of sinful men were to be purged after this life, and then to 
    pass into heaven. But the miseries of hell are forever! The breath of the 
    Lord kindles that fire; and where shall we find buckets to quench it? "And 
    the smoke of their torment ascends up forever and ever, and they have no 
    rest day nor night." We can thank original sin for all this misery.
<b>
<p align="justify">Use one: What dreadful thoughts should we have of 
    original sin, which has created so many miseries! </p></b>What honey can be 
    gotten out of this lion? What grapes can we gather off this thorn? It sets 
    heaven and earth against us. While we choose this bramble to rule, fire 
    comes out of the bramble to devour us!
<b>
<p align="justify">Use two: How are all believers bound to Jesus Christ, who 
    has freed them from that misery to which sin has exposed them! </p></b>"In whom 
    we have redemption through his blood." Sin has brought trouble and a curse 
    into the world: Christ has sanctified the trouble, and removed the curse. 
    Nay, he has not only <i>freed </i>believers from misery—but <i>purchased </i>
    for them a crown of glory and immortality! "When the chief Shepherd shall 
    appear, you shall receive an unfading crown of glory!"
