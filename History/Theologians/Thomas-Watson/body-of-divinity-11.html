<p align="justify">Question 38: What benefits do believers receive from 
    Christ, at the resurrection?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: At the resurrection, believers being raised up in 
    glory, shall be openly acknowledged and acquitted in the day of judgment, 
    and made perfectly blessed in the full enjoyment of God, to all eternity!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. The BODIES of believers shall be raised up to glory.</p></b></font> 
    The doctrine of the resurrection is a fundamental article of our faith. The 
    apostle puts it among the first principles of the doctrine of Christ. Heb 
    6:2. The body shall rise again; we are not so sure to rise out of our 
    beds—as we are to rise out of our graves. The saved body shall rise again. 
    Some hold that the soul shall be clothed with a new body; but then it were 
    improper to call it a resurrection, it would be rather a creation. "Though 
    worms destroy this body—yet in <i>my </i>flesh shall I see God." Job 19:26. 
    Not in another flesh—but my flesh. "<i>This </i>corruptible must put on 
    incorruption." I Cor 15:53.
<b>
<p align="justify">By what arguments may the resurrection be proved?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">(1.) By Scripture. "I will raise him up at the last day." 
    "He will swallow up death in victory." That is, by delivering our bodies 
    from the captivity of the grave, wherein death for a time had power over 
    them. "Those who sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ is risen; therefore the bodies of the saints 
    must rise. Christ did not rise from the dead as a private person—but as the 
    public head of the church; and the head being raised, the rest of the body 
    shall not always lie in the grave. Christ's rising is a pledge of our 
    resurrection. "Knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus, shall raise up 
    us also by Jesus." 2 Cor 4:14. Christ is called the first-fruits of those 
    who sleep. 1 Cor 15:20. As the first-fruits is a sure evidence that the 
    harvest is coming, so the resurrection of Christ is a sure evidence of the 
    rising of our bodies from the grave. Christ cannot be perfect as he is 
    Christ mystical, unless his members are raised with him.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) In respect of God's justice. If God is a just God, 
    he will reward the <i>bodies </i>of the saints, as well as their <i>souls</i>. 
    It cannot be imagined that the souls of believers should be glorified, and 
    not their bodies. They have served God with their bodies; their bodies have 
    been members of holiness; their <i>eyes </i>have dropped tears for sin; 
    their <i>hands </i>have relieved the poor; their <i>tongues </i>have set 
    forth God's praise; therefore justice and equity require that their bodies 
    should be crowned as well as their souls; and how can that be—unless they 
    are raised from the dead?</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) If the body did not rise again, a believer would not 
    be completely happy; for, though the soul can subsist without the body—yet 
    it has "a desire of reunion" with the body; and it is not fully happy until 
    it is clothed with the body. Therefore, undoubtedly, the body shall rise 
    again. If the soul should go to heaven, and not the body, then a believer 
    would be only half saved.</p>
<p align="justify">But some say, as the Virgin Mary to the angel, "How can 
    this be?" How can it be, that the body, which is consumed to ashes, should 
    rise again?</p>
<p align="justify">It does not <i>oppose </i>reason—but <i>transcends </i>
    it. There are some resemblances of the resurrection in nature. The corn, 
    which is sown in the ground, dies before it springs up. "When you put a seed 
    into the ground, it doesn't grow into a plant unless it dies first." 1 Cor 
    15:36. In winter the fruits of the earth die; in spring there is a 
    resurrection of them. Noah's olive-tree springing after the flood, was a 
    lively emblem of the resurrection. After the passion of our Lord, many of 
    the saints which slept in the grave arose. Matt 27:52. God can more easily 
    raise the body out of the grave—than we can wake a man out of sleep!</p>
<p align="justify">But when the dust of many are mingled together; how is it 
    possible that a separation should be made and the same identical body arise?</p>
<p align="justify">If we believe God can create, why not distinguish the 
    dust of one body from another? Do we not see that the chemist, out of 
    several metals mingled together, as gold, silver, alchemy, can extract one 
    from the other, the silver from the gold, the alchemy from silver, and can 
    reduce every metal to its own kind? And shall we not much more believe, that 
    when our bodies are mingled and confounded with other substances, the wise 
    God is able to reinvest every soul with its own body?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Shall only the bodies of the righteous be raised?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">All who are in the grave shall hear Christ's voice, and 
    shall come forth. "There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the 
    just and unjust." "I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God." But 
    though all shall be raised out of their graves—yet all shall not be raised 
    alike.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The bodies of the wicked shall be raised with 
    ignominy. Those bodies which on the earth tempted and allured others with 
    their beauty, shall at the resurrection be loathsome to behold; they shall 
    be ghastly spectacles. "They shall be an abhorring unto all flesh." But the 
    bodies of the saints shall be raised with honor. "It is sown in dishonor, it 
    is raised in glory." The saints' bodies then shall shine as sparkling 
    diamonds. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The bodies of the saints shall rise out of their 
    graves with triumph; but the bodies of the wicked with trembling. The one, 
    as about to receive their fatal doom; the other, awake from the dust too, 
    shall sing for joy. "Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust." When the 
    archangel's trumpet sounds, the bodies of believers shall come out of the 
    grave to be made happy—as the chief butler came out of the prison, and was 
    restored to all his dignity at the court; but the bodies of the wicked shall 
    come out of the grave—as the chief baker out of prison, to be executed.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: Believe this doctrine of the resurrection</p></b></font>; 
    that the same body that dies shall rise again, and with the soul be crowned. 
    Without the belief of this, all true religion falls to the ground. If the 
    dead rise not, then Christ is not risen, and then our faith is vain. I Cor 
    15:14.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: The body shall rise again. </p></b></font>This was 
    Job's comfort. "Though worms destroy this body—yet in my flesh shall I see 
    God." Job 19:26. The body is sensible of joy, as well as the soul; and 
    indeed, we shall not be in all our glory, until our bodies are reunited to 
    our souls. Oh consider what joy there will be at the reuniting of the body 
    and the soul at the resurrection! Look what sweet embraces of joy were 
    between old Jacob and Joseph, when they first saw one another; such, and 
    infinitely more, will there be when the body and soul of a saint shall meet 
    together at the resurrection. Gen 46:29. How will the body and soul greet 
    one another! What a welcome will the soul give to the body! "Oh, blessed 
    body! When I prayed, you attended my prayers with hands lifted up, and knees 
    bowed down; you were willing to suffer with me, and now you shall reign with 
    me; you were sown in dishonor—but now are raised in glory. Oh, my dear body! 
    I will enter into you again, and be eternally married to you!"
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: The resurrection of the body is a cordial when 
    a Christian is dying. </p></b></font>Your body, though it drops into the 
    sepulcher, shall revive and flourish in the resurrection. The grave is a bed 
    of dust, where the bodies of saints <i>sleep</i>; but they shall be awakened 
    by the trumpet of the archangel. The grave is your <i>long </i>home—but not 
    your <i>last </i>home. Though death strips you of your beauty, at the 
    resurrection you shall have it restored again. As when David found Saul 
    asleep, he took away his spear and cruse of water—but when Saul awoke he 
    restored them again, so, though at death all our strength and beauty be 
    taken away, at the resurrection God will restore all again in a more 
    glorious manner.
<p align="justify">But how shall we know that our bodies will be raised to a 
    glorious resurrection?</p>
<p align="justify">If we have a part in the first resurrection. "Blessed is 
    he who has a part in the first resurrection." What is meant by this? It is 
    rising by repentance out of the grave of sin. He who lies buried in sin, can 
    have little hope of a joyful resurrection; his body shall be raised—but not 
    in glory. O then, ask conscience, have you a part in the first resurrection? 
    Has the Spirit entered into you, and lifted you up? Has he raised you out of 
    your unbelief? Has he raised your hearts above the earth? This is the first 
    resurrection; and if your souls are thus spiritually raised, your bodies 
    shall be gloriously raised; and shall shine as stars in the kingdom of 
    heaven. <i>Regeneration </i>makes way for a glorious <i>resurrection</i>.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Seeing you expect your bodies shall rise to 
    glory, keep them unspotted from sin. </p></b></font>Shall a <i>drunken </i>body 
    rise to glory? Shall an <i>unclean </i>body rise to glory? Shall a <i>
    thievish </i>body steal into heaven? O keep your bodies pure! Keep your <i>
    eyes </i>from unchaste glances, your <i>hands </i>from bribes, your <i>
    tongues </i>from slander. Defile not your bodies, which you hope shall rise 
    one day to glory. Your bodies are the members of Christ. Hear what the 
    apostle says: "Shall I take the members of Christ, and make them the members 
    of an harlot? God forbid." Keep your bodies unspotted; let them be 
    instruments of righteousness. "Glorify God in your body." <i>If your bodies 
    glorify God, God will glorify your bodies!
</i>
<p align="justify">But seeing our bodies must be laid in the grave, and may 
    lie many years rotting there before the resurrection, <font color="#008000">
<b>what support and comfort have we in this case?</b></font></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) That God will not leave his people in the grave.</p></b></font> 
    Our friends bring us to the grave and leave us there—but God will not. He 
    will go to the grave with us, and watch over our dead bodies, and take care 
    of our ashes. Rizpah watched over the dead bodies of the sons of Saul, and 
    guarded them against the ravenous fowls of the air. 2 Sam 21:10. Thus the 
    Lord watches over the dead bodies of the saints, and looks to it that none 
    of their dust be missing. Christian, you have a God to watch over your body 
    when you are dead.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The bodies of the saints in the grave, though 
    separated from their souls, are united to Christ.</p></b></font> The dust of a 
    believer is part of Christ's mystic body.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) When the bodies of the saints are in the sepulcher, 
    their souls are in paradise</p></b></font>; the soul does not sleep in the body, 
    "but returns to God who gave it." The soul immediately partakes of those 
    joys the blessed angels do. When the body returns to <i>dust</i>—the soul 
    returns to <i>rest</i>; when the body is <i>sleeping</i>—the soul is <i>
    triumphing</i>; when the body is <i>buried</i>—the soul is <i>crowned</i>. 
    As the spies were sent before—to taste of the fruits of the land; so at 
    death the soul is sent before into heaven—to taste of the fruit of the holy 
    land. Numb 13:20.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) When God's time is come, the "graves shall deliver 
    up their dead." </p></b></font>Rev 20:13. When the judge sends, the jailor must 
    deliver up his prisoners. As God said to Jacob, "I will go down with you 
    into Egypt, and I will surely bring you up again;" Gen 46:4, so the Lord 
    will go down with us into the grave, and will surely bring us out again.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Though the bodies of the saints shall rot and be 
    loathsome in the grave—yet afterwards they shall be made illustrious and 
    glorious.</p></b></font> The bodies of the saints, when they arise, shall be 
    lovely and beautiful. The body of a saint in this life may be deformed; 
    those even whose minds are adorned with virtue, may have misshapen bodies; 
    but those deformed bodies shall be attractive and beautiful. This beauty 
    consists in two things, 
<b>
<p align="justify">(1:) Perfection of parts.</p></b> There shall be a full 
    proportion of all the members. In this life there is often a defect of 
    members: the eye is lost, the arm is cut off; but in the resurrection all 
    parts of the body will be restored again; therefore the resurrection is 
    called the time of restoring all things. Acts 3:21.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2:) Splendor. </p></b>The bodies of the saints shall have a 
    graceful majesty in them; they shall be like Stephen, whose face shone as if 
    it had been the face of an angel. Acts 6:15. Nay, they will be made like 
    Christ's glorious body. Phil 3:21.
<p align="justify">The bodies of the saints, when they arise, shall be free 
    from the necessities of nature, as hunger and thirst. "They shall hunger no 
    more." Rev 7:16. Moses on the mount was so filled with the glory of God, 
    that he did not need bodily nourishment. Much more in heaven shall the 
    bodies of the saints be so filled with God's glory, as to be upheld without 
    food.</p>
<p align="justify">The bodies of the saints, when they arise, shall be swift 
    and nimble. Our bodies on earth are dull and heavy in their motion; then 
    they shall be swift, and made fit to ascend, as the body of Elijah, in the 
    air. Now the body is a <i>clog</i>; in heaven it shall be a <i>wing</i>. We 
    shall be as the angels. Matt 22:30. And how nimble are they? The angel 
    Gabriel in a short time came from heaven to the earth. Dan 9:21. As the helm 
    turns the ship instantly where the steersman wills, so the body in an 
    instant will move which way the soul wills.</p>
<p align="justify">The bodies of the saints, at the resurrection, shall be 
    firm and strong. "It is raised in power." Through frequent labor and 
    sickness, the strongest body begins to languish: but at the resurrection we 
    shall be of a strong constitution; there will be no weariness in the body, 
    nor faintness in the spirits. This may comfort you who now conflict with 
    many bodily weaknesses. This weak body shall be raised in power; the body, 
    which is now a weak reed, shall be like a rock.</p>
<p align="justify">The bodies of the saints, at the resurrection, will be 
    immortal. "This mortal shall put on immortality." Our bodies shall run 
    parallel with eternity. "Neither can they die any more." Heaven is a 
    healthful climate, there is no bill of mortality there. If a physician could 
    give you a recipe to keep you from dying, what sums of money would you give! 
    At the resurrection Christ shall give the saints such a recipe. "There shall 
    be no more death!"</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. They shall be openly acquitted at the day of 
    judgment.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">[1] This is to be laid down for a proposition, that there 
    shall be a day of judgment. "For we must <i>all </i>appear before the 
    judgment-seat of Christ." This is the grand assize; the greatest appearance 
    that ever was. Adam shall then see all his posterity at once. We must <i>all
    </i>appear; the greatness of men's persons does not exempt them from 
    Christ's tribunal; kings and captains are brought in trembling before the 
    Lamb's throne. Rev 6:15. We must all appear, and appear in our own persons; 
    not by proxy.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">How does it appear that there shall be a day of judgment? 
    Two ways. </p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) By the testimony of Scripture.</p></b> "For God shall 
    bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing." "For he comes, for 
    he comes to judge the earth." The reduplication denotes the certainty. "I 
    beheld until the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, 
    whose garment was white as snow. . . The judgment was set, and the books 
    were opened." Dan 7:9-10.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) It appears from the petty sessions kept in a man's 
    own conscience.</p></b> When a man does virtuously, conscience excuses him; when 
    evil, conscience arraigns and condemns him. Now, what is this private 
    session kept in the court of conscience—but a certain forerunner of that 
    general day of judgment, when all the world shall be summoned to God's 
    tribunal?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Why must there be a day of judgment?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">That there may be a day of <i>retribution</i>—in which 
    God may render to everyone according to his work. Things seem to be done 
    very unequally in the world: the <i>wicked </i>to prosper—as if they were 
    rewarded for doing evil; and the <i>godly </i>to suffer—as if they were 
    punished for being good. Therefore, for vindicating the justice of God, 
    there must be a day wherein there shall be a righteous distribution of 
    punishments and rewards to men, according to their actions.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Who shall be judge?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The Lord Jesus Christ. "The Father has committed all 
    judgment to the Son." John 5:22. It is an article of our creed, that "Christ 
    shall come to judge the living and the dead." It is a great honor put upon 
    Christ; he who was himself judged, shall be judge. He who once hung upon the 
    cross—shall sit upon the throne of judgment! He is fit to be judge, as he 
    partakes of both the manhood and Godhead.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Of the manhood. Being clothed with the human nature, 
    he may be visibly seen of all. It is requisite the judge should be seen. 
    "Behold, he comes with clouds, and every eye shall see him."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) As he partakes of the Godhead. He is of infinite <i>
    knowledge </i>to understand all causes brought before him; and of infinite
    <i>power </i>to execute offenders. He is described with <i>seven eyes</i>, 
    Zech 3:9, to denote his wisdom; and an <i>iron rod</i>, Psalm 2:9, to denote 
    His power. He is so <i>wise </i>that he cannot be deceived, and so <i>strong
    </i>that he cannot be resisted.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">When will the time of judgment be?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The time of the general judgment, is a secret kept from 
    the angels. "Of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of 
    heaven." But it cannot be far off. One great sign of the approach of the day 
    of judgment, is, "That iniquity shall abound." Sure then that day is near at 
    hand, for iniquity never more abounded than in this age, in which <i>lust 
    grows hot</i>, and <i>love grows cold</i>. When the elect are all converted, 
    then Christ will come to judgment. As he who rows a ferry-boat, stays until 
    all the passengers are taken in, and then rows away; so Christ stays until 
    all the elect are gathered in, and then he will hasten away to judgment.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">What shall be the manner of trial?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">(1.) The citing of men to the court. The dead are cited 
    as well as the living. Men, when they die, avoid the censure of our 
    law-courts; but at the last day, they are cited to God's tribunal. "I saw 
    the dead, small and great, stand before God." This citing of men will be by 
    the sound of a trumpet. 1 Thess 4:16. This trumpet will sound so loud, that 
    it will raise men from their graves. Matt 24:31. Such as will not hear the 
    trumpet of the <i>gospel </i>sound "repent, and believe," shall hear the 
    trumpet of the <i>archangel </i>sounding, "arise, and be judged!"</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The approach of the judge to the tribunal.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) This will be terrible to the wicked. How can a 
    guilty prisoner endure the sight of the judge? If Felix trembled when Paul 
    preached of judgment, Acts 24:25, how will sinners tremble when they shall 
    see Christ come to judgment! Christ is described, sitting in judgment, with 
    a fiery stream issuing from him. Dan 7:10. The Lamb of God will then be 
    turned into a lion, the sight of whom will strike terror into sinners. When 
    Joseph said to his brethren, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into 
    Egypt," "they were troubled at his presence." Gen 45:4. How did their hearts 
    smite them for their sin! So, when Christ shall come to judgment, and say, 
    "I em Jesus, whom you sinned against; I em Jesus, whose laws you have 
    broken, whose blood you despised. I am now come to judge you." Oh, what 
    horror and amazement will take hold of sinners! How they will be troubled at 
    the presence of their judge!</p>
<p align="justify">(2:) The approach of Christ to the bench of judicature 
    will be comfortable to the righteous. Christ will come in splendor and great 
    glory. His first coming in the flesh was obscure. Isa 53:2. He was like a 
    prince in disguise; but his second coming will be illustrious; he shall come 
    in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels. Mark 8:38. Oh, what a 
    bright day will that be, when a vast number of angels, those morning stars, 
    shall appear in the air, and Christ the Sun of Righteousness shall shine in 
    splendor above the brightest cherub! He will come as a friend. Indeed, if 
    the saints' judge were their enemy, they might fear to be condemned; but he 
    who loves them, and prayed for them, is their judge; he who is their husband 
    is their judge, therefore they need not fear but all things shall go well on 
    their side.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The trial itself, which has a dark and a light side. 
    A <i>dark </i>side. It will fall heavy on the wicked, when the judge being 
    set, the books shall be opened, the book of <i>conscience</i>, and the book 
    of <i>God's remembrance</i>. Rev 20:12. The sinners, charge being read, all 
    their sins laid open, their murder, drunkenness, and uncleanness, Christ 
    will say, "What can you plead for yourselves, that the sentence of death 
    should not pass?" Then, being convicted, they will be <i>speechless</i>. 
    Then follows the dismal sentence: "depart from me, you cursed ones, into 
    everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." Matt 25:41. He who 
    said to God, "Depart from me," Job 21:14, and to true religion, "Depart from 
    me," must now hear that word pronounced from his judge, "Depart from me"—a 
    dreadful, but a righteous sentence. Psalm 51:4. The sinner himself shall 
    cry, "Guilty!" <b>Though he has a sea of wrath, he has not one drop of 
    injustice. </b>When once the sentence is passed, it is irreversible; there 
    is no appealing to a higher court. The trial has also a <i>light </i>side. 
    It will increase the joy and happiness of the righteous. The day of judgment 
    will be a day of jubilee to them.</p>
<p align="justify">[2] At that day Christ their judge will own them by name. 
    Those whom the world scorned, and looked upon as madmen and fools, Christ 
    will take by the hand, and openly acknowledge to be his favorites. What is 
    his "confessing of men," but his openly acknowledging them to be precious in 
    his eyes? Luke 12:8.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ as judge will plead for them. It is not usual to 
    be both judge and advocate, to sit on the bench and plead; but it shall be 
    so at the day of judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Christ will plead his own blood for the saints. 
    "These people I have purchased; they are the travail of my soul; they have 
    sinned—but my soul was made an offering for their sin."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ will vindicate them from all unjust censures. 
    They were strangely misrepresented in the world—as proud, hypocritical, 
    factious; as Paul was called a seditious man, the head of a faction. Acts 
    24:5. But at the day of judgment Christ will clear their innocence; he will 
    "bring forth their righteousness as the light." Ps 37:6. He will wipe off 
    tears from their <i>eyes</i>, and dust from their <i>names</i>. When Moses 
    was charged with taking too much upon him, he comforted himself with this, 
    "Tomorrow will the Lord show who are his." Numb 16:5. So the saints' when 
    reproached, may comfort themselves with the day of judgment, in which Christ 
    will say who are his, and they shall come forth as the wings of a dove 
    covered with silver.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Christ as judge will absolve his people before men 
    and angels. As Pilate said of Christ, "I find no fault in this man." Just 
    so, will Christ say of the elect, "I find no fault in them, I pronounce them 
    righteous." Then follows, "Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the 
    kingdom." As if Christ should say, "O you happy ones, the delight of my 
    soul, the fruit of my sufferings, stand no longer at the bar. You are heirs 
    to the crown of heaven—enter and take possession!" At the hearing of this 
    sentence, with what ravishing joy will the saints be filled! This word, 
    "Come, you blessed!" will be music to their ear, and a cordial to their 
    heart.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Christ will mention before men and angels all the 
    good deeds the saints have done. "For I was hungry, and you fed me. I was 
    thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me into 
    your home." Matthew 25:35. You who have wept in secret for sin, that have 
    shown any love for Christ's name, that have been rich in good works; Christ 
    will take notice of it at the last day, and say, "Well done, good and 
    faithful servant!" He himself will be the herald to proclaim your praises; 
    thus it shall be done to the man whom Christ delights to honor.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Christ will call his saints from the bar, to sit 
    upon the bench with him to judge the world. "Behold, the Lord comes with ten 
    thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all." "Know you not, that 
    the saints shall judge the world?" The saints shall sit with Christ in 
    judgment as justices of peace with the judge; they shall applaud Christ's 
    righteous sentence on the wicked, and, as it were, vote with Christ. As it 
    is a great honor to the saints, so it must needs add to the sorrows of the 
    wicked, to see those whom they once hated and derided, sit as judges upon 
    them!</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) The saints shall be fully crowned with the enjoyment 
    of God forever. They shall be in his sweet presence, "in whose presence is 
    fullness of joy," and this shall be forever. The banner of God's love shall 
    be eternally displayed. The joys of heaven shall be without intermission and 
    expiration, "and so shall we ever be with the Lord."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: It is dreadful news to the wicked</p></b></font>, 
    that they shall "not <i>stand </i>in judgment," that they shall <i>come </i>
    to judgment—but shall not <i>stand </i>in judgment; they shall not stand 
    acquitted, they shall not stand with boldness—but sneak and hang down their 
    heads, and not be able to look their judge in the face. But it is great 
    consolation to the godly. When the apostle had said, "The Lord shall descend 
    from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and the trumpet 
    of God," he presently adds, "Therefore comfort one another with these 
    words."
<p align="justify">(1.) The day of judgment is comfort in respect of 
    weakness of grace. A Christian is ready to be troubled to see his grace so 
    minute and imperfect. But, at the last day, if Christ find but a grain of 
    true grace, it shall be accepted. If you have true gold, though it is very 
    little, Christ will put his merits into the scales, and make it pass 
    current.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) What a comfort is it to such of the saints who have 
    met with unrighteous judgment in the world, who have been wronged of their 
    estates in lawsuits, or had their lives taken away by an unrighteous 
    sentence: Christ will judge things over again, and will give a righteous 
    sentence. If your estates have been taken away wrongfully, you shall be 
    restored a thousandfold at the day of judgment. If you have lost your lives 
    for Christ, you shall not lose your crown; you shall wear an unfading 
    garland made of the flowers of paradise.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Meditate much upon the day of judgment. </p></b>
</font>Feathers swim upon the water—but gold sinks into it; so, light, 
    feathery people float in vanity; they mind not the day of judgment; but 
    serious spirits sink deep into the thoughts of it.
<p align="justify">(1.) The meditation of this last day should make us very
    <b>sincere</b>. We should labor to approve our hearts to God, the great 
    judge and umpire of the world. It is easy to look good before men—but there 
    is no dissembling or prevaricating with God. He sees what the heart is—and 
    will accordingly pass his verdict.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The meditation of Christ's coming to judge us, 
    should keep us from <b>judging</b> our brethren. We are apt to judge the 
    final state of others; which is for men to step into Christ's place, and 
    take his work out of his hand. "Who are you that judge another?" You who 
    pass a rash sentence upon another, you must come yourself shortly to be 
    judged, and then, perhaps, <i>he </i>may be acquitted, and <i>you </i>
    condemned!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: So live, that, at the last day of judgment, 
    you may be sure to be acquitted, and have the glorious privileges with which 
    the saints shall be crowned.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">How is that?</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) If you would stand acquitted at the day of judgment, 
    then </p>
<p align="justify">(1:) Labor to get into Christ. "That I may be found in 
    him." Faith implants us into Christ, it engarrisons us in him, and then 
    "there is no condemnation." There is no standing <i>before </i>Christ—but by 
    being <i>in </i>Christ. </p>
<p align="justify">(2:) Labor for humility, which is a kind of 
    self-annihilation. "Though I am nothing." Christian, have you great 
    abilities? Can you cover them with the veil of humility, as Moses, when his 
    face shone, put a veil over it? If you are humble, you shall be acquitted at 
    the day of judgment. "He shall save the humble person." A humble man judges 
    himself for his sins, and Christ will acquit those who judge themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) If you would stand acquitted at the last day, keep a 
    clear conscience. Do not load yourself with guilt, and furnish your judge 
    with matter against you. "The Lord," says Paul, "has appointed a day in 
    which he will judge the world." How would Paul fit himself for that day? 
    "Herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence 
    toward God and toward men." Be careful of the first and second table; be 
    holy and just. Have <i>hearts </i>without false aims, and <i>hands </i>
    without false weights. Keep <i>conscience </i>as clear as your eye, that no
    <i>dust of sin </i>fall into it. Those who sin against conscience, will be 
    shy of their judge; as such as take in prohibited goods cannot endure to see 
    the searchers that are appointed to open their packs. Christian, your pack 
    will be opened at the last day, I mean, your conscience (and Christ is the 
    searcher), to see what sins, what prohibited goods you have taken in; and 
    then he proceeds to judgment. Oh! be sure to keep a good conscience; which 
    is the best way to stand with boldness at the day of judgment. The voice of 
    conscience is the voice of God. If conscience, upon just grounds, acquits 
    us, God will acquit us. "If our heart condemns us not, then have we 
    confidence toward God."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) If you would stand acquitted at the last day, trade 
    with your talents for God's glory; lay out yourselves for him; honor him 
    with your substance; relieve Christ's members, that you may be acquitted. He 
    who had five talents traded with them, and made them five talents more; "His 
    Lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant!"</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) If you would stand acquitted at the day of judgment, 
    get a sincere love to the saints. Love is the truest touchstone of 
    sincerity. To love grace for grace, shows the spirit of God to be in a man. 
    Does conscience witness for you? Are you perfumed with this sweet spice of 
    love? Do you delight most in those in whom the image of God shines? Do you 
    reverence their graces? Do you bear with their infirmities? A blessed 
    evidence that you shall be acquitted in the day of judgment. "We know that 
    we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren." 1 John 
    3:14.</p>
