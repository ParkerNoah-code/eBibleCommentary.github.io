<p align="center"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>The Comforting Rod</b></font></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">"Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me." Psalm 23:4</p>
<p align="justify">Bernard calls this Psalm, a noble and illustrious Psalm. 
    The Jews used to repeat this Psalm when they sat down to eat. In it, David 
    sets forth two things—his <i>experience </i>and his <i>confidence</i>. His 
    confidence, in the first and last verses. In the first verse, "The Lord is 
    my Shepherd; (therefore) I shall not lack." In the last verse, "Surely 
    goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life." Here is David's 
    confidence. His faith was risen up into a great degree of confidence. But 
    that which I shall speak to, is David's <i>experience </i>in the words I 
    have read, "Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me."</p>
<p align="justify">What is meant here by <b>staff</b>? A staff is for 
    support, whether it is the staff one walks with to support the body, or 
    whether it is the staff of bread that supports the life of man. Staff is for 
    support, and so it is used here in the text, "Your staff comforts me." By 
    staff is meant, metaphorically, the staff of God's support, "Your staff 
    comforts me." God's providence is a wing to cover the saints. It is a breast 
    to feed them, and a staff to uphold them. In the most calamitous times, the 
    Church of God has the staff of God's support, and this is the reason that 
    the Church is preserved in spite of all malice and opposition. This bush 
    burns—yet it is not consumed. Though the lion roars—yet the lambs of 
    Christ's fold are in safety. Though the rulers take counsel against the 
    saints of the Most High—yet they are kept alive.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is the reason Your staff comforts me. The saints 
    always have the staff of divine protection. God secretly preserves them and 
    sets an invisible guard about them. We see the staff that smites the 
    godly—but we do not see the staff that upholds them. We see their danger—but 
    do not see their defense. God is their staff of support. God's continual 
    care of His Church is as a wall of brass against which the gates of hell 
    shall never prevail. The Church of God has God for her Guardian. "The 
    enemies must first overcome God—before they can overcome His Church," said 
    Luther.</p>
<p align="justify">For the use of this briefly: This is no small comfort to 
    God's Church. She has a staff of support. God is her protection. The saints 
    of God have malignant enemies to conflict with. The powers of the earth are 
    against the godly. We read that the beast in Revelation had on his head 
    seven horns and ten crowns, Revelation 13:1, "And it was given him to make 
    war with the saints." You see, the people of God were then in an bad case. 
    They had the horns and the crowns against them. But the saints have the <i>
    Lion of the tribe of Judah </i>on their side. And Christ has a staff to 
    protect them and teeth to devour all His enemies.</p>
<p align="justify">So much briefly for that expression, for I have only 
    glanced at it. "Your staff comforts me." Your staff of support and glorious 
    providence is always with me. It comforts me.</p>
<p align="justify">But that which I shall chiefly speak to, is the first of 
    these in the text,<font color="#008000"><b> "Your ROD comforts me."</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">QUESTION. What is meant by rod?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. This word rod, when it is ascribed to God, is 
    taken three ways in Scripture.</p>
<p align="justify">First, for God's <b>destroying</b> rod.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, for God's <b>pastoral</b> rod, as that of a 
    shepherd.</p>
<p align="justify">Third, for His <b>disciplining</b> rod, or rod of 
    affliction.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. God's DESTROYING rod. </p></b></font>The rod, when it is 
    ascribed unto God, which He uses towards His enemies. Psalm 12:9, "You shall 
    break them with a rod of iron." This rod of God upon His enemies, comforts 
    the godly, Psalm 58:10. The righteous shall rejoice when they see the 
    vengeance. God's destroying rod upon sinners is a matter of rejoicing and 
    comfort unto the godly. We read of Deborah's triumphant song and the Jew's 
    festival after the destruction of Haman, Esther 9:22. The rod of God upon 
    the wicked, comforts the godly.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But some may say, "How far may the godly be 
    comforted in the destruction of wicked men? How far may they rejoice?"</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. </p>
<p align="justify">First, The godly may be comforted in the destruction of 
    wicked men, so far as now there is a stop put to their sins, and they cannot 
    live any longer to dishonor God.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, God's destroying rod upon the wicked is a matter 
    of comfort to the godly, as hereby God's justice is declared to all the 
    world. Why did God smite Pharaoh? For his pride and tyranny. The saints 
    rejoice and triumph to see God's justice executed upon His enemies, Exodus 
    15:1. They are comforted to see God's justice in punishing the wicked of the 
    world.</p>
<p align="justify">Third, it is comfort to the people of God, to see a 
    wicked man destroyed. God's ruining of sinners is a warning to others to 
    make them fear sin. This is clear from Deuteronomy 17:12-13. The man who 
    sins presumptuously shall die, and all the people shall hear and fear and 
    shall no more sin presumptuously. God's judgments upon wicked persecutors 
    may make others afraid and tremble to go on in their sin. Thus far God's 
    destroying rod is a comfort to the godly. They rejoice to think that this 
    may be a warning to sinners, and may be a means to reclaim many from their 
    impieties.</p>
<p align="justify">Fourth, and last, God's destroying rod upon the wicked is 
    a comfort to the godly upon this account—as peace and deliverance arises to 
    the Church of God. When Pharaoh was destroyed, Israel had a writ of ease now 
    granted them. Nay, further, the destruction of the wicked, such as are 
    desperate sinners, not only causes liberty to arise in the Church of God—but 
    it causes the growth of religion. A clear instance: Herod being eaten up 
    with worms, the text says immediately that "the Word of God grew and 
    multiplied," Acts 12:23. Thus far God's destroying rod upon the wicked, 
    flagitious sinners is a comfort to the godly. "Your rod comforts me." Your
    <i>rod of iron </i>which breaks the profane sinners of the world, comforts 
    me.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. </p></b></font>As there is God's destroying rod which 
    comforts the godly, so there is <font color="#b07050"><b>God's PASTORAL rod
    </b></font>which He uses towards His sheep, conducting them to green 
    pastures and still waters. There is God's shepherding rod, by which He leads 
    His elect sheep to the green pastures and still waters. These green pastures 
    and still waters may be meant of the ordinances and that sweet comfort the 
    people of God find in the use of them. Why, this rod of God, this shepherd's 
    rod, this pastoral rod, comforts the godly.
<p align="justify">3. Third, and last, there is <font color="#b07050"><b>
    God's DISCIPLINING rod</b></font>, or His rod of affliction. This also is a 
    comfort to the people of God. 2 Samuel 7:14, "I will chasten him with a rod 
    of Mine." And in Micah 6:9, "Hear the rod, and He who has appointed it." And 
    in this sense I understand this text of Scripture, "Your rod comforts me." 
    So, then, the observation is this:</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE: God's rod, His afflicting rod upon His people, 
    yields matter of comfort to us.</p>
<p align="justify">"Your rod comforts me." This, I confess, seems strange to 
    flesh and blood; it is a paradox. What, that the rod of correction should 
    give comfort! If David had said, "Your <i>promises</i>, Lord, they comfort 
    me," it would have been no wonder. But that he should say, "Your rod 
    comforts me," how can this be? Is it usual for a person to call pain, 
    comfort? How, then, does David say, "Your rod comforts me"? Who can of such 
    thistles, gather figs? Or of such thorns, gather grapes? How can there be 
    comfort, from the rod?</p>
<p align="justify">I shall show you that there is much consolation gathered 
    out of correction. "Your rod comforts me." The rod of God is not like Moses' 
    rod when turned into a serpent—but it is like Jonathan's rod, which had <i>
    honey </i>at the end of it. The rod of God is like Aaron's rod which brought 
    forth buds, blossoms, and almonds, Numbers 17:8.</p>
<p align="justify">Then the question is this:<font color="#008000"><b> How 
    does this afflicting rod give comfort? </b></font>In six particulars.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. God's afflicting rod comforts us—as it gives us 
    instruction.</p></b></font> Where it teaches, it comforts. Micah 7:14, "Teach 
    Your people with Your rod." How does the rod teach? Why, it teaches with 
    instruction, so it teaches with comfort. Luther said there were many Psalms 
    in the Bible he never rightly understood until he was in affliction. The rod 
    teaches to know <b>God </b>aright—and is that not matter of comfort? In 2 
    Chronicles 33:11, when Manasseh was afflicted—then he knew the Lord was God. 
    And the rod teaches a man to know <b>himself</b>. He sees that corruption 
    working in his heart that he could never discern before. The eyes which sin 
    shuts—affliction opens. The rod gives wisdom; it is a teaching rod, and thus 
    God comforts. What if it makes us weaker—so long as it makes us wiser?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. God's afflicting rod has comfort in it—as it is a 
    token of special favor He bears towards us</p></b></font>. "As many as I love, I 
    rebuke and chasten." Revelation 3:19. We think God cannot favor us unless He 
    has us in His lap. Yet He loves and favors us—when He gives us the bitter 
    drink of affliction. God's rod and God's love both stand together. Thus the 
    rod comforts; it brings us a token of God's love. It is no love in God, to 
    let men go on in sin and never smite; this is not love. Is it any love to 
    your child to let him run into the water and drown? To be without the rod of 
    God's discipline, is a sign of a bastard child, a mark of reprobation, "But 
    if you are without chastisement, then you are bastards, and not sons." 
    Hebrews 12:8. If God will let any fall upon the rock of ruin, then He will 
    allow them to go on in sin and not correct them. Hosea 4:14, "I will <i>not
    </i>punish your daughters when they commit whoredom." Take notice, God 
    spares the rod—in anger! God's hand is heaviest—when it is lightest. God 
    punishes most—when He does not punish!
<p align="justify">But God smites His people—that He may save them, and is 
    that not love? And the love of God allays and takes off the smarting power 
    of the rod and gives the soul comfort. Let me feel God's smiting <i>hand—</i>so 
    that I may have His loving <i>heart</i>.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. God's rod comforts—as it makes way for comfort. </p></b>
</font>Medicine, though bitter—yet has comfort in it—as it makes way for 
    health. The rod is to make way for comfort. The rod of God is to beat out 
    the <i>dust </i>and make us purer. The launderer dips his cloth in water—to 
    whiten the cloth. The water of afflictions is to make God's people white. 
    Daniel 12:10, "Many shall be tried—and made white."
<p align="justify">Nay, farther, God's rod upon His children not only makes 
    way for comfort but, what is more, this rod distills comfort into the soul. 
    Even as the fire causes sweet water to drop from the still—so out of <i>
    affliction</i>, God distills the sweet water of <i>consolation</i>. A clear 
    instance is in 2 Corinthians 1:4, "Who <i>comforts </i>us in all our <i>
    tribulations</i>." Here is the rod of God comforting. When the saints' 
    trials have been sharpest, their comforts have been sweetest. Behold here <i>
    honey </i>at the end of the rod. John 16:22, "Your <i>sorrows </i>shall be 
    turned into <i>joy</i>." Here is the saints' water—turned into wine. That 
    holy martyr who was in prison dates his letter thus, "From the pleasant 
    garden of prison." God candies His wormwood with sugar. The saints never 
    tasted so much of God's <i>compassion, </i>as in their deepest <i>affliction</i>. 
    And in this sense David might truly say, "Your rod comforts me." So said the 
    Apostle, "God comforts us in all our tribulations."</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. God's afflicting rod has comfort in it—as it brings 
    the good news to the soul that this is the worst which shall ever befall 
    him. </p></b></font>The Lord comes down with a <i>murdering axe </i>to hew down 
    wicked men—but He has only a <i>rattling rod </i>for His children. This is 
    all the hell they ever shall feel. Is this not comfort? 1 Corinthians 11:32, 
    "We are judged and disciplined by the Lord—that we should not be condemned 
    with this world." Is this not comfort to know, that this is the <i>worst </i>
    we shall have? God lays upon us a light affliction—and saves us from wrath 
    to come! Here is the rod full of comfort. What the <i>drop of sorrow </i>
    which the godly taste--compared to the <i>bottomless sea of wrath</i>, which 
    the damned endure forever?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Yet farther, the rod is full of comfort—as it makes us 
    happy.</p></b></font> And for this consult Job 5:17, "Blessed is the man whom 
    God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty."
<p align="justify">Some place their happiness in riches, some in wisdom, 
    some in pleasure and the like—but who ever placed happiness in affliction?</p>
<p align="justify">The worldlings cry, "If this is happiness, Lord, deliver 
    me from it!" But Job said, "Happy is that man whom God corrects." How is he 
    happy? He is happy—who is made better by affliction. Though the affliction 
    makes the outward condition worse—yet it makes the heart better.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, he is happy—who has God to visit him. Don't we 
    account him a happy person—who has a king to visit him? How much more to 
    have a God to visit him? Persecution is a rod, yes—but for all that it is a 
    blessed rod, it is a healing rod. Though the rod smarts—yet it saves the 
    soul. Well, then, may a Christian say, "Lord, Your rod comforts me. This 
    makes me happy." Happy is that man whom God corrects.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Last, God's rod has comfort in it—as a means to bring 
    us to glory.</p></b></font> God's rod whips us to heaven! 2 Corinthians 4:17, 
    "These light afflictions, which are but for a moment, work for us a far more 
    exceeding and eternal weight of glory." Affliction is like throwing a bag of 
    money at another person; it may bruise him—but it enriches him. So 
    affliction may bruise us but it enriches us, and this works for us a far 
    more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
<p align="justify">In short, the black rod prepares for the white rod. O 
    Christian! You who are now humbled by some sharp affliction—shall shortly 
    wear a garland made of the flowers of paradise. You shall have your soul set 
    thicker with the <i>jewels of heaven—</i>than the sky is with the stars.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus you see this truth is verified, "Your rod comforts 
    me."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 1. INFERENCE.</p></b></font> I will name but four:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. See then from hence, the difference between the wicked 
    and the godly. </p></b></font>God makes the <i>worst </i>things tend to the 
    consolation of the godly—and the <i>best </i>things tend to the condemnation 
    of the wicked. Let the people of God meet with affliction—it is for the 
    better. God's rod comforts. "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me." Let 
    the wicked have prosperity, it is for the worse. <i>Cordials </i>kill them. 
    To the godly—<i>evil </i>things have good in them. To the wicked—<i>good </i>
    things have hurt in them. This is clear Scripture, "Their table is a snare." 
    I say, the wicked man's table is a snare, Psalm 69:22. Wicked men have mercy 
    out of God's hand as Israel had quails. They were sauced with the wrath of 
    God. Ecclesiastes 5:13 is a clear Scripture, "I have seen an evil under the 
    sun, riches kept for owners to their hurt." Riches are like Haman's 
    banquet—which was a prologue to his execution. To wicked men, even spiritual 
    mercies are turned into judgments. The <i>Word </i>preached is a savor of 
    death to the wicked, 2 Corinthians 2:16. Nay, farther, <i>Jesus Christ </i>
    Himself is a rock of offense to the wicked, 1 Peter 2:7. Christ is equally 
    for the <i>falling—</i>as the <i>rising </i>of many, Luke 2:34. In short, 
    sinners stumble at a Savior and pluck death from the tree of life. As for 
    the godly—God's rod comforts them. As for the wicked—God's mercy ruins them.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. See then from hence, that true religion is not to be 
    looked on as a melancholy thing. </p></b></font>Some people discourage religion 
    and draw it with a sour countenance, and in a frightful dress. But we see 
    the worst of religion, has much comfort in it. The very rod of God comforts 
    the godly. See the Scripture in James 1:2, "Consider it pure joy, my 
    brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds." Take the part of religion 
    that is sourest to the <b>soul</b>, <i>repentance</i>; and that which is 
    sour to the <b>body</b>, <i>affliction</i>—and there is comfort in both.
<p align="justify">There is comfort in that which is sour to the soul—<b>repentance</b>. 
    For whom is the oil of joy prepared but for God's mourners? Isaiah 61:3. A 
    gracious soul is never more enlarged and comforted, than when he can melt 
    kindly for sin. Christ Jesus made the best wine from <i>water</i>. The best 
    wine of joy is made of the <i>water of true repentance</i>. The Hebrew word 
    for repentance signifies to take comfort. None have such ground of comfort 
    as a true penitent. When God makes him weep for sin—he goes away weeping for 
    joy! Thus you see, that the sourest part of religion has comfort in it.</p>
<p align="justify">Take that which is sour to the body—<b>affliction</b>, 
    and it has comfort in it. A parallel Scripture for this is worth observing. 
    2 Corinthians 6:20, "As sorrowful—yet always rejoicing." There is comfort in 
    the rod. A Christian is like a bird that can sing in the winter season. He 
    can pick <i>comfort </i>out of the rod and, with Samson, fetch <i>honey </i>
    out of the lion. 1 Thessalonians 1:6, "Having received the Word with much 
    affliction, <i>with joy</i>." Here is God's rod comforting that Christian, 
    who knows affliction tends to better him—making his grace purer and his 
    crown brighter! He can rejoice in affliction and say as David, "O Lord, Your 
    rod comforts me." Thus, you see, true religion is no uncheerful thing.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. If God's rod comforts, then it shows us what good 
    reason we have to choose affliction rather than sin. </p></b></font>There is 
    something in affliction to comfort us—but there is nothing in sin to comfort 
    us. Sin is evil—and nothing but evil. It defiles the mind and disturbs the 
    peace. It puts a worm into conscience, a sting into death, and a fire into 
    hell. This is, in Scripture, called "the abominable thing," Jeremiah 44:4, 
    "Do not do this abominable thing which I hate." Sin binds the soul over unto 
    God's wrath forever. Oh, then, what wisdom is it to choose affliction rather 
    than sin! A Christian can say, "There is comfort in the rod," but he cannot 
    say, "There is comfort in sin." Sin puts the soul into an agony and makes it 
    the very suburb of hell. Moses chose affliction rather than sin for a 
    season, Hebrews 11:25.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Last, if God's rod comforts—then what does God's love 
    do?</p></b></font> If there is any comfort, as you have heard, while God is <i>
    afflicting </i>us—what comfort is there while He is <i>embracing </i>us! If 
    there is any comfort in the valley of tears—what is there then in paradise! 
    There is the bed of spices and the river of pleasures. If God can make a <i>
    prison </i>sweet—what then is <i>heaven! </i>If afflicting mercy is so 
    great—what is crowning mercy! If God made one of the martyr's flames a bed 
    of roses, why then, how sweet is it to lie in Christ's bosom, the bed of 
    perfume!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 2. EXHORTATION.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">If God's rod has so much comfort in it to the godly, then 
    be not too much dejected and cast down in affliction. If you meet with 
    losses, if you meet with pirates at sea and hornets on land—you see God can 
    turn all these to good. "Your rod comforts me." Therefore, be not too much 
    cast down. Though we are not to <i>pray </i>for affliction, for it is in 
    itself penal, neither must we <i>despond </i>under affliction.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh," said one, "if God loved me, He would not have dealt 
    this severely with me. He has bereaved me of such and such a dear comfort, 
    which is like plucking a limb from the body."</p>
<p align="justify">But Christian, consider that which you call a dear 
    comfort, which God has taken away. Perhaps it was an idol! It may be, you 
    loved it more than you loved God; and if you had not lost this <i>comfort</i>, 
    you might have lost your <i>soul </i>and <i>heaven </i>too! Why then—has God 
    done you any wrong in taking away this comfort? There is mercy in all this! 
    You have much cause to say at last, "Your rod comforts me."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 3. TRIAL.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Let us examine whether we have had any honey out of the 
    lion, any comfort out of affliction. Has the rod of God upon us blossomed 
    and brought forth almonds? It's certain we have met with affliction in one 
    kind or another—but what benefit have we got by affliction? What advantage 
    for our souls? Can we say indeed as David, "Lord, Your rod comforts me"? Can 
    we say that we have met with such and such a sore trial, and it has brought 
    us nearer to God and weaned us from the world? that it has conquered our 
    pride and tamed our covetousness? When God's rod upon us fetches water of 
    tears and makes us weep bitterly for our sin, then it is a good rod.</p>
<p align="justify">In short, if God's rod has made us better, it has made us 
    reform and break off iniquity. This is when we can say with Ephraim, Hosea 
    14:8, "What have I to do with idols?"</p>
<p align="justify">To conclude all, let it be our daily prayer to God that 
    we may find some comfort in affliction, some honey mingled with our gall. 
    David speaks of comfort in affliction, Psalm 119:50, "This is my comfort in 
    affliction." Affliction is not joyous but grievous. Oh—but when the Lord 
    blesses and sanctifies it to us, then it brings comfort with it.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us pray that we may hear the voice of the rod and 
    kiss the rod and bless the hand that holds it. Let us pray unto God that we 
    may see His hand in every affliction and wherefore God contends with us that 
    we may turn to him who smites and say, as David does here in the text, "Oh, 
    Lord, Your rod and Your staff—they comfort me!"</p>
