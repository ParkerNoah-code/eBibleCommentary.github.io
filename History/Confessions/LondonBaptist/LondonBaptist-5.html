        <h2>Chapter 5. Of Divine Providence</h2>
        <p>
          1. God the good Creator of all things, in His infinite power and
          wisdom does uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all creatures and
          things, 1 from the greatest even to the least. 2 by His most wise and
          holy providence, to the end for the which they were created, according
          unto His infallible foreknowledge, and the free and immutable counsel
          of His own will; to the praise of the glory of His wisdom, power,
          justice, infinite goodness, and mercy. 3
        </p>
        <p>1. Hebrews 1:3; Job 38:11; Isaiah 46:10, 11; Psalms 135:6</p>
        <p>2. Matthew 10:29-31</p>
        <p>3. Ephesians 1:11</p>
        <p>
          2. Although in relation to the foreknowledge and decree of God, the
          first cause, all things come to pass immutably and infallibly; 4 so
          that there is not anything befalls any by chance, or without His
          providence; 5 yet by the same providence He ordered them to fall out
          according to the nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely,
          or contingently. 6
        </p>
        <p>4. Acts 2:23</p>
        <p>5. Proverbs 16:33</p>
        <p>6. Genesis 8:22</p>
        <p>
          3. God, in his ordinary providence makes use of means, 7 yet is free
          to work without, 8 above, 9 and against them 10 at His pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>7. Acts 27:31, 44; Isaiah 55:10-11</p>
        <p>8. Hosea 1:7</p>
        <p>9. Romans 4:19-21</p>
        <p>10. Daniel 3:27</p>
        <p>
          4. The almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness of
          God, so far manifest themselves in His providence, that His
          determinate counsel extends itself even to the first fall, and all
          other sinful actions both of angels and men; 11 and that not by a bare
          permission, which also He most wisely and powerfully binds, and
          otherwise orders and governs, 12 in a manifold dispensation to His
          most holy ends; 13 yet so, as the sinfulness of their acts proceeds
          only from the creatures, and not from God, who, being most holy and
          righteous, neither is nor can be the author or approver of sin. 14
        </p>
        <p>11. Romans 11:32-34; 2 Samuel 24:1; 1 Chronicles 21:1</p>
        <p>12. 2 Kings 19:28; Psalms 76:10</p>
        <p>13. Genesis 1:20; Isaiah 10:6-7, 12</p>
        <p>14. Psalms 1:21; 1 John 2:16</p>
        <p>
          5. The most wise, righteous, and gracious God does often times leave
          for a season His own children to manifold temptations and the
          corruptions of their own hearts, to chastise them for their former
          sins, or to discover unto them the hidden strength of corruption and
          deceitfulness of their hearts, that they may be humbled; and to raise
          them to a more close and constant dependence for their support upon
          Himself; and to make them more watchful against all future occasions
          of sin, and for other just and holy ends. 15 So that whatsoever
          befalls any of His elect is by His appointment, for His glory, and
          their good. 16
        </p>
        <p>15. 2 Chronicles 32:25-26, 31; 2 Corinthians 12:7-9</p>
        <p>16. Romans 8:28</p>
        <p>
          6. As for those wicked and ungodly men whom God, as the righteous
          judge, for former sin does blind and harden; 17 from them He not only
          withholds His grace, whereby they might have been enlightened in their
          understanding, and wrought upon their hearts; 18 but sometimes also
          withdraws the gifts which they had, 19 and exposes them to such
          objects as their corruption makes occasion of sin; 20 and withal,
          gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and
          the power of Satan, 21 whereby it comes to pass that they harden
          themselves, under those means which God uses for the softening of
          others. 22
        </p>
        <p>17. Romans 1:24-26, 28, 11:7-8</p>
        <p>18. Deuteronomy 29:4</p>
        <p>19. Matthew 13:12</p>
        <p>20. Deuteronomy 2:30; 2 Kings 8:12-13</p>
        <p>21. Psalms 81:11-12; 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12</p>
        <p>22. Exodus 8:15, 32; Isaiah 6:9-10; 1 Peter 2:7-8</p>
        <p>
          7. As the providence of God does in general reach to all creatures, so
          after a more special manner it takes care of His church, and disposes
          of all things to the good thereof. 23
        </p>
        <p>23. 1 Timothy 4:10; Amos 9:8-9; Isaiah 43:3-5</p>
