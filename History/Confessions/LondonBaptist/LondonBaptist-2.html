        <h2>Chapter 2. Of God and of the Holy Trinity</h2>
        <p>
          1. The Lord our God is but one only living and true God; 1 whose
          subsistence is in and of Himself, 2 infinite in being and perfection;
          whose essence cannot be comprehended by any but Himself; 3 a most pure
          spirit, 4 invisible, without body, parts, or passions, who only hath
          immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; 5
          who is immutable, 6 immense, 7 eternal, 8 incomprehensible, almighty,
          9 every way infinite, most holy, 10 most wise, most free, most
          absolute; working all things according to the counsel of His own
          immutable and most righteous will, 11 for His own glory; 12 most
          loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and
          truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of
          them that diligently seek Him, 13 and withal most just and terrible in
          His judgments, 14 hating all sin, 15 and who will by no means clear
          the guilty. 16

          2. God, having all life, 17 glory, 18 goodness, 19 blessedness, in and
          of Himself, is alone in and unto Himself all-sufficient, not standing
          in need of any creature which He hath made, nor deriving any glory
          from them, 20 but only manifesting His own glory in, by, unto, and
          upon them; He is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through
          whom, and to whom are all things, 21 and He hath most sovereign
          dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them,
          whatsoever Himself pleases; 22 in His sight all things are open and
          manifest, 23 His knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent
          upon the creature, so as nothing is to Him contingent or uncertain; 24
          He is most holy in all His counsels, in all His works, 25 and in all
          His commands; to Him is due from angels and men, whatsoever worship,
          26 service, or obedience, as creatures they owe unto the Creator, and
          whatever He is further pleased to require of them.

        <p>26. Revelation 5:12-14</p>
        <p>
          3. In this divine and infinite Being there are three subsistences, the
          Father, the Word or Son, and Holy Spirit, 27 of one substance, power,
          and eternity, each having the whole divine essence, yet the essence
          undivided: 28 the Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding;
          the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; 29 the Holy Spirit
          proceeding from the Father and the Son; 30 all infinite, without
          beginning, therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in nature
          and being, but distinguished by several peculiar relative properties
          and personal relations; which doctrine of the Trinity is the
          foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable dependence
          on Him.
