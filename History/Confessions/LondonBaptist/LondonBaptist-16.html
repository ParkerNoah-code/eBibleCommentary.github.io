        <h2>Chapter 16. Of Good Works</h2>
        <p>
          1. Good works are only such as God has commanded in his Holy Word, 1
          and not such as without the warrant thereof are devised by men out of
          blind zeal, or upon any pretense of good intentions. 2
        </p>
        <p>1. Micah 6:8; Hebrews 13:21</p>
        <p>2. Matthew 15:9; Isaiah 29:13</p>
        <p>
          2. These good works, done in obedience to God’s commandments, are the
          fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith; 3 and by them
          believers manifest their thankfulness, 4 strengthen their assurance, 5
          edify their brethren, adorn the profession of the gospel, 6 stop the
          mouths of the adversaries, and glory God, 7 whose workmanship they
          are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto, 8 that having their fruit unto
          holiness they may have the end eternal life. 9
        </p>
        <p>3. James 2:18, 22</p>
        <p>4. Psalms 116:12-13</p>
        <p>5. 1 John 2:3, 5; 2 Peter 1:5-11</p>
        <p>6. Matthew 5:16</p>
        <p>7. 1 Timothy 6:1; 1 Peter 2:15; Philemon 1:11</p>
        <p>8. Ephesians 2:10</p>
        <p>9. Romans 6:22</p>
        <p>
          3. Their ability to do good works is not all of themselves, but wholly
          from the Spirit of Christ; 10 and that they may be enabled thereunto,
          besides the graces they have already received, there is necessary an
          actual influence of the same Holy Spirit, to work in them and to will
          and to do of his good pleasure; 11 yet they are not hereupon to grow
          negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty, unless upon
          a special motion of the Spirit, but they ought to be diligent in
          stirring up the grace of God that is in them. 12
        </p>
        <p>10. John 15:4-5</p>
        <p>11. 2 Corinthians 3:5; Philippians 2:13</p>
        <p>12. Philippians 2:12; Hebrews 6:11, 12; Isaiah 64:7</p>
        <p>
          4. They who in their obedience attain to the greatest height which is
          possible in this life, are so far from being able to supererogate, and
          to do more than God requires, as that they fall short of much which in
          duty they are bound to do. 13
        </p>
        <p>13. Job 9:2-3; Galatians 5:17; Luke 17:10</p>
        <p>
          5. We cannot by our best works merit pardon of sin or eternal life at
          the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between
          them and the glory to come, and the infinite distance that is between
          us and God, whom by them we can neither profit nor satisfy for the
          debt of our former sins; 14 but when we have done all we can, we have
          done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants; and because they are
          good they proceed from his Spirit, 15 and as they are wrought by us
          they are defiled and mixed with so much weakness and imperfection,
          that they cannot endure the severity of God’s punishment. 16
        </p>
        <p>14. Romans 3:20; Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 4:6</p>
        <p>15. Galatians 5:22-23</p>
        <p>16. Isaiah 64:6; Psalms 43:2</p>
        <p>
          6. Yet notwithstanding the persons of believers being accepted through
          Christ, their good works also are accepted in him; 17 not as though
          they were in this life wholly unblamable and unreprovable in God’s
          sight, but that he, looking upon them in his Son, is pleased to accept
          and reward that which is sincere, although accompanied with many
          weaknesses and imperfections. 18
        </p>
        <p>17. Ephesians 1:5; 1 Peter 1:5</p>
        <p>18. Matthew 25:21, 23; Hebrews 6:10</p>
        <p>
          7. Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter of them
          they may things which God commands, and of good use both to themselves
          and to others; 19 yet because they proceed not from a heart purified
          by faith, 20 nor are done in a right manner according to the Word, 21
          nor to a right end, the glory of God, 22 they are therfore sinful, and
          cannot please God, nor make a man meet to receive the grace from God,
          23 and yet their neglect of them is more sinful and displeasing to
          God. 24

        <p>19. 2 Kings 10:30; 1 Kings 21:27, 29</p>
        <p>20. Genesis 4:5; Hebrews 11:4, 6</p>
        <p>21. 1 Corinthians 13:1</p>
        <p>22. Matthew 6:2, 5</p>
        <p>23. Amos 5:21-22; Romans 9:16; Titus 3:5</p>
        <p>24. Job 21:14-15; Matthew 25:41-43</p>
