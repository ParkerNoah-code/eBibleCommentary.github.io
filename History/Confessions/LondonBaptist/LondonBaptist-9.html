        <h2>Chapter 9. Of Free Will</h2>
        <p>
          1. God has endued the will of man with that natural liberty and power
          of acting upon choice, that it is neither forced, nor by any necessity
          of nature determined to do good or evil. 1
        </p>
        <p>1. Matthew 17:12; James 1:14; Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
        <p>
          2. Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom and power to will and
          to do that which was good and well-pleasing to God, 2 but yet was
          unstable, so that he might fall from it. 3
        </p>
        <p>2. Ecclesiastes 7:29</p>
        <p>3. Genesis 3:6</p>
        <p>
          3. Man, by his fall into a state of sin, has wholly lost all ability
          of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation; 4 so as a
          natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in sin,
          5 is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or to prepare
          himself thereunto. 6
        </p>
        <p>4. Romans 5:6, 8:7</p>
        <p>5. Ephesians 2:1, 5</p>
        <p>6. Titus 3:3-5; John 6:44</p>
        <p>
          4. When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of
          grace, He frees him from his natural bondage under sin, 7 and by His
          grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which is
          spiritually good; 8 yet so as that by reason of his remaining
          corruptions, he does not perfectly, nor only will, that which is good,
          but does also will that which is evil. 9
        </p>
        <p>7. Colossians 1:13; John 8:36</p>
        <p>8. Philippians 2:13</p>
        <p>9. Romans 7:15, 18-19, 21, 23</p>
        <p>
          5. This will of man is made perfectly and immutably free to good alone
          in the state of glory only. 10
        </p>
        <p>10. Ephesians 4:13</p>
