        <h2>Chapter 11. Of Justification</h2>
        <p>
          1. Those whom God effectually calls, he also freely justifies, 1 not
          by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and
          by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous; 2 not for
          anything wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ&#x27;s sake
          alone; 3 not by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any
          other evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness; but by
          imputing Christ&#x27;s active obedience unto the whole law, and
          passive obedience in his death for their whole and sole righteousness
          by faith, 4 which faith they have not of themselves; it is the gift of
          God. 5
        </p>
        <p>1. Romans 3:24, 8:30</p>
        <p>2. Romans 4:5-8, Ephesians 1:7</p>
        <p>3. 1 Corinthians 1:30-31, Romans 5:17-19</p>
        <p>4. Philippians 3:8-9; Ephesians 2:8-10</p>
        <p>5. John 1:12, Romans 5:17</p>
        <p>
          2. Faith thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness,
          is the alone instrument of justification; 6 yet is not alone in the
          person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving
          graces, and is no dead faith, but works by love. 7
        </p>
        <p>6. Romans 3:28</p>
        <p>7. Galatians 5:6, James 2:17, 22, 26</p>
        <p>
          3. Christ, by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the debt of
          all those who are justified; and did, by the sacrifice of himself in
          the blood of his cross, undergoing in their stead the penalty due to
          them, make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God’s justice in
          their behalf; 8 yet, in as much as he was given by the Father for
          them, and his obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead, and
          both freely, not for anything in them, 9 their justification is only
          of free grace, that both the exact justice and rich grace of God might
          be glorified in the justification of sinners. 10
        </p>
        <p>8. Hebrews 10:14; 1 Peter 1:18-19; Isaiah 53:5-6</p>
        <p>9. Romans 8:32; 2 Corinthians 5:21</p>
        <p>10. Romans 3:26; Ephesians 1:6-7, 2:7</p>
        <p>
          4. God did from all eternity decree to justify all the elect, 11 and
          Christ did in the fullness of time die for their sins, and rise again
          for their justification; 12 nevertheless, they are not justified
          personally, until the Holy Spirit in time does actually apply Christ
          to them. 13
        </p>
        <p>11. Galatians 3:8, 1 Peter 1:2, 1 Timothy 2:6</p>
        <p>12. Romans 4:25</p>
        <p>13. Colossians 1:21-22, Titus 3:4-7</p>
        <p>
          5. God continues to forgive the sins of those that are justified, 14
          and although they can never fall from the state of justification, 15
          yet they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure; 16
          and in that condition they usually do not have the light of his
          countenance restored to them, until they humble themselves, beg
          pardon, and renew their faith and repentance. 17
        </p>
        <p>14. Matthew 6:12, 1 John 1:7, 9</p>
        <p>15. John 10:28</p>
        <p>16. Psalms 89:31-33</p>
        <p>17. Psalms 32:5, Psalms 51, Matthew 26:75</p>
        <p>
          6. The justification of believers under the Old Testament was, in all
          these respects, one and the same with the justification of believers
          under the New Testament. 18
        </p>
        <p>18. Galatians 3:9; Romans 4:22-24</p>
