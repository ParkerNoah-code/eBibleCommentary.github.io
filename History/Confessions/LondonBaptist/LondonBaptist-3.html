        <h2>Chapter 3. Of God&#x27;s Decree</h2>
        <p>
          1. God hath decreed in himself, from all eternity, by the most wise
          and holy counsel of His own will, freely and unchangeably, all things,
          whatsoever comes to pass; 1 yet so as thereby is God neither the
          author of sin nor hath fellowship with any therein; 2 nor is violence
          offered to the will of the creature, nor yet is the liberty or
          contingency of second causes taken away, but rather established; 3 in
          which appears His wisdom in disposing all things, and power and
          faithfulness in accomplishing His decree. 4
        </p>
        <p>1. Isaiah 46:10; Ephesians 1:11; Hebrews 6:17; Romans 9:15, 18</p>
        <p>2. James 1:13; 1 John 1:5</p>
        <p>3. Acts 4:27, 28; John 19:11</p>
        <p>4. Numbers 23:19; Ephesians 1:3-5</p>
        <p>
          2. Although God knoweth whatsoever may or can come to pass, upon all
          supposed conditions, 5 yet hath He not decreed anything, because He
          foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to pass upon such
          conditions. 6
        </p>
        <p>5. Acts 15:18</p>
        <p>6. Romans 9:11, 13, 16, 18</p>
        <p>
          3. By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some men
          and angels are predestinated, or foreordained to eternal life through
          Jesus Christ, 7 to the praise of His glorious grace; 8 others being
          left to act in their sin to their just condemnation, to the praise of
          His glorious justice. 9
        </p>
        <p>7. 1 Timothy 5:21; Matthew 25:34</p>
        <p>8. Ephesians 1:5-6</p>
        <p>9. Romans 9:22-23; Jude 4</p>
        <p>
          4. These angels and men thus predestinated and foreordained, are
          particularly and unchangeably designed, and their number so certain
          and definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished. 10
        </p>
        <p>10. 2 Timothy 2:19; John 13:18</p>
        <p>
          5. Those of mankind that are predestinated to life, God, before the
          foundation of the world was laid, according to His eternal and
          immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of His
          will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of His mere
          free grace and love, 11 without any other thing in the creature as a
          condition or cause moving Him thereunto. 12
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Ephesians 1:4, 9, 11; Romans 8:30; 2 Timothy 1:9; 1 Thessalonians
          5:9
        </p>
        <p>12. Romans 9:13, 16; Ephesians 2:5, 12</p>
        <p>
          6. As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so He hath, by the
          eternal and most free purpose of His will, foreordained all the means
          thereunto; 13 wherefore they who are elected, being fallen in Adam,
          are redeemed by Christ, 14 are effectually called unto faith in
          Christ, by His Spirit working in due season, are justified, adopted,
          sanctified, 15 and kept by His power through faith unto salvation; 16
          neither are any other redeemed by Christ, or effectually called,
          justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only. 17
        </p>
        <p>13. 1 Peter 1:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:13</p>
        <p>14. 1 Thessalonians 5:9-10</p>
        <p>15. Romans 8:30; 2 Thessalonians 2:13</p>
        <p>16. 1 Peter 1:5</p>
        <p>17. John 10:26, 17:9, 6:64</p>
        <p>
          7. The doctrine of the high mystery of predestination is to be handled
          with special prudence and care, that men attending the will of God
          revealed in His Word, and yielding obedience thereunto, may, from the
          certainty of their effectual vocation, be assured of their eternal
          election; 18 so shall this doctrine afford matter of praise, 19
          reverence, and admiration of God, and of humility, 20 diligence, and
          abundant consolation to all that sincerely obey the gospel. 21
        </p>
        <p>18. 1 Thessalonians 1:4-5; 2 Peter 1:10</p>
        <p>19. Ephesians 1:6; Romans 11:33</p>
        <p>20. Romans 11:5-6, 20</p>
        <p>21. Luke 10:20</p>
