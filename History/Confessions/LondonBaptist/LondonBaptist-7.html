        <h2>Chapter 7. Of God&#x27;s Covenant</h2>
        <p>
          1. The distance between God and the creature is so great, that
          although reasonable creatures do owe obedience to him as their
          creator, yet they could never have attained the reward of life but by
          some voluntary condescension on God&#x27;s part, which he hath been
          pleased to express by way of covenant. 1
        </p>
        <p>1. Luke 17:10; Job 35:7,8</p>
        <p>
          2. Moreover, man having brought himself under the curse of the law by
          his fall, it pleased the Lord to make a covenant of grace, 2 wherein
          He freely offers unto sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ,
          requiring of them faith in Him, that they may be saved; 3 and
          promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto eternal life,
          His Holy Spirit, to make them willing and able to believe. 4
        </p>
        <p>2. Genesis 2:17; Galatians 3:10; Romans 3:20-21</p>
        <p>3. Romans 5:12-19; 1 Corinthians 15:21-22, 45, 49</p>
        <p>4. Romans 8:3; Mark 16:15-16; John 3:16</p>
        <p>
          3. This covenant is revealed in the gospel; first of all to Adam in
          the promise of salvation by the seed of the woman, 5 and afterwards by
          farther steps, until the full discovery thereof was completed in the
          New Testament; 6 and it is founded in that eternal covenant
          transaction that was between the Father and the Son about the
          redemption of the elect; 7 and it is alone by the grace of this
          covenant that all the posterity of fallen Adam that ever were saved
          did obtain life and blessed immortality, man being now utterly
          incapable of acceptance with God upon those terms on which Adam stood
          in his state of innocency. 8

        <p>5. Genesis 3:15</p>
        <p>6. Hebrews 1:1</p>
        <p>7. 2 Timothy 1:9; Titus 1:2</p>
        <p>8. Hebrews 11:6, 13; Romans 4:1-2ff.; Acts 4:12; John 8:56</p>
