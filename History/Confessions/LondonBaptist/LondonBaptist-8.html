        <h2>Chapter 8. Of Christ the Mediator</h2>
        <p>
          1. It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the
          Lord Jesus, His only begotten Son, according to the covenant made
          between them both, to be the mediator between God and man; 1 the
          prophet, 2 priest, 3 and king; 4 head and savior of the church, 5 the
          heir of all things, 6 and judge of the world; 7 unto whom He did from
          all eternity give a people to be His seed and to be by Him in time
          redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified. 8
        </p>
        <p>1. Isaiah 42:1; 1 Peter 1:19-20</p>
        <p>2. Acts 3:22</p>
        <p>3. Hebrews 5:5-6</p>
        <p>4. Psalms 2:6; Luke 1:33</p>
        <p>5. Ephesians 1:22-23</p>
        <p>6. Hebrews 1:2</p>
        <p>7. Acts 17:31</p>
        <p>8. Isaiah 53:10; John 17:6; Romans 8:30</p>
        <p>
          2. The Son of God, the second person in the Holy Trinity, being very
          and eternal God, the brightness of the Father&#x27;s glory, of one
          substance and equal with Him who made the world, who upholds and
          governs all things He has made, did, when the fullness of time was
          complete, take upon Him man&#x27;s nature, with all the essential
          properties and common infirmities of it, 9 yet without sin; 10 being
          conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary, the Holy
          Spirit coming down upon her: and the power of the Most High
          overshadowing her; and so was made of a woman of the tribe of Judah,
          of the seed of Abraham and David according to the Scriptures; 11 so
          that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures were inseparably joined
          together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion;
          which person is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only
          mediator between God and man. 12
        </p>
        <p>9. John 1:14; Galatians 4;4</p>
        <p>10. Romans 8:3; Hebrews 2:14, 16-17, 4:15</p>
        <p>11. Matthew 1:22-23</p>
        <p>12. Luke 1:27, 31, 35; Romans 9:5; 1 Timothy 2:5</p>
        <p>
          3. The Lord Jesus, in His human nature thus united to the divine, in
          the person of the Son, was sanctified and anointed with the Holy
          Spirit above measure, 13 having in Him all the treasures of wisdom and
          knowledge; 14 in whom it pleased the Father that all fullness should
          dwell, 15 to the end that being holy, harmless, undefiled, 16 and full
          of grace and truth, 17 He might be throughly furnished to execute the
          office of mediator and surety; 18 which office He took not upon
          himself, but was thereunto called by His Father; 19 who also put all
          power and judgement in His hand, and gave Him commandment to execute
          the same. 20
        </p>
        <p>13. Psalms 45:7; Acts 10:38; John 3:34</p>
        <p>14. Colossians 2:3</p>
        <p>15. Colossians 1:19</p>
        <p>16. Hebrews 7:26</p>
        <p>17. John 1:14</p>
        <p>18. Hebrews 7:22</p>
        <p>19. Hebrews 5:5</p>
        <p>20. John 5:22, 27; Matthew 28:18; Acts 2:36</p>
        <p>
          4. This office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake, 21 which
          that He might discharge He was made under the law, 22 and did
          perfectly fulfill it, and underwent the punishment due to us, which we
          should have born and suffered, 23 being made sin and a curse for us;
          24 enduring most grievous sorrows in His soul, and most painful
          sufferings in His body; 25 was crucified, and died, and remained in
          the state of the dead, yet saw no corruption: 26 on the third day He
          arose from the dead 27 with the same body in which He suffered, 28
          with which He also ascended into heaven, 29 and there sits at the
          right hand of His Father making intercession, 30 and shall return to
          judge men and angels at the end of the world. 31
        </p>
        <p>21. Psalms 40:7-8; Hebrews 10:5-10; John 10:18</p>
        <p>22. Galatians 4:4; Matthew 3:15</p>
        <p>23. Galatians 3:13; Isaiah 53:6; 1 Peter 3:18</p>
        <p>24. 2 Corinthians 5:21</p>
        <p>25. Matthew 26:37, 38; Luke 22:44; Matthew 27:46</p>
        <p>26. Acts 13:37</p>
        <p>27. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4</p>
        <p>28. John 20:25, 27</p>
        <p>29. Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11</p>
        <p>30. Romans 8:34; Hebrews 9:24</p>
        <p>31. Acts 10:42; Romans 14:9-10; Acts 1:11; 2 Peter 2:4</p>
        <p>
          5. The Lord Jesus, by His perfect obedience and sacrifice of Himself,
          which He through the eternal Spirit once offered up to God, has fully
          satisfied the justice of God, 32 procured reconciliation, and
          purchased an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, for all
          those whom the Father has given unto Him. 33
        </p>
        <p>32. Hebrews 9:14, 10:14; Romans 3:25-26</p>
        <p>33. John 17:2; Hebrews 9:15</p>
        <p>
          6. Although the price of redemption was not actually paid by Christ
          until after His incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefit
          thereof were communicated to the elect in all ages, successively from
          the beginning of the world, in and by those promises, types, and
          sacrifices wherein He was revealed, and signified to be the seed which
          should bruise the serpent&#x27;s head; 34 and the Lamb slain from the
          foundation of the world, 35 being the same yesterday, and today and
          for ever. 36
        </p>
        <p>34. 1 Corinthians 4:10; Hebrews 4:2; 1 Peter 1:10-11</p>
        <p>35. Revelation 13:8</p>
        <p>36. Hebrews 13:8</p>
        <p>
          7. Christ, in the work of mediation, acts according to both natures,
          by each nature doing that which is proper to itself; yet by reason of
          the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is
          sometimes in Scripture, attributed to the person denominated by the
          other nature. 37
        </p>
        <p>37. John 3:13; Acts 20:28</p>
        <p>
          8. To all those for whom Christ has obtained eternal redemption, He
          does certainly and effectually apply and communicate the same, making
          intercession for them; 38 uniting them to Himself by His Spirit,
          revealing to them, in and by His Word, the mystery of salvation,
          persuading them to believe and obey, 39 governing their hearts by His
          Word and Spirit, 40 and overcoming all their enemies by His almighty
          power and wisdom, 41 in such manner and ways as are most consonant to
          His wonderful and unsearchable dispensation; and all of free and
          absolute grace, without any condition foreseen in them to procure it.
          42
        </p>
        <p>38. John 6:37, 10:15-16, 17:9; Romans 5:10</p>
        <p>39. John 17:6; Ephesians 1:9; 1 John 5:20</p>
        <p>40. Romans 8:9, 14</p>
        <p>41. Psalms 110:1; 1 Corinthians 15:25-26</p>
        <p>42. John 3:8; Ephesians 1:8</p>
        <p>
          9. This office of mediator between God and man is proper only to
          Christ, who is the prophet, priest, and king of the church of God; and
          may not be either in whole, or any part thereof, transferred from Him
          to any other. 43
        </p>
        <p>43. 1 Timothy 2:5</p>
        <p>
          10. This number and order of offices is necessary; for in respect of
          our ignorance, we stand in need of His prophetical office; 44 and in
          respect of our alienation from God, and imperfection of the best of
          our services, we need His priestly office to reconcile us and present
          us acceptable unto God; 45 and in respect to our averseness and utter
          inability to return to God, and for our rescue and security from our
          spiritual adversaries, we need His kingly office to convince, subdue,
          draw, uphold, deliver, and preserve us to His heavenly kingdom. 46
        </p>
        <p>44. John 1:18</p>
        <p>45. Colossians 1:21; Galatians 5:17</p>
        <p>46. John 16:8; Psalms 110:3; Luke 1:74-75</p>
