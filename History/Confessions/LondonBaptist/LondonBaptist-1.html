        <h2>Chapter 1. Of the Holy Scriptures</h2>
        <p>
          1. The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible
          rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience. 1 Although the
          light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far
          manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men
          inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God
          and his will which is necessary unto salvation. 2 Therefore it pleased
          the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners to reveal himself, and
          to declare that his will unto his church; 3 and afterward for the
          better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure
          establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the
          flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same
          wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most
          necessary, those former ways of God&#x27;s revealing his will unto his
          people being now ceased. 4
        </p>
        <p>1. 2 Timothy 3:15-17; Isaiah 8:20; Luke 16:29, 31; Ephesians 2:20</p>
        <p>2. Romans 1:19-21; Romans 2:14-15; Psalms 19:1-3</p>
        <p>3. Hebrews 1:1</p>
        <p>4. Proverbs 22:19-21; Romans 15:4; 2 Peter 1:19-20</p>
        <p>
          2. Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are
          now contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are
          these:
        </p>
        <p>OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</p>
        <p>
          Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges,
          Ruth, I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, II Kings, I Chronicles, II
          Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs,
          Ecclesiastes, The Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations,
          Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum,
          Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi
        </p>
        <p>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</p>
        <p>
          Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts of the Apostles, Paul&#x27;s
          Epistle to the Romans, I Corinthians, II Corinthians, Galatians,
          Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, I Thessalonians, II Thessalonians,
          I Timothy, II Timothy, To Titus, To Philemon, The Epistle to the
          Hebrews, Epistle of James, The first and second Epistles of Peter, The
          first, second, and third Epistles of John, The Epistle of Jude, The
          Revelation All of which are given by the inspiration of God, to be the
          rule of faith and life. 5
        </p>
        <p>5. 2 Timothy 3:16</p>
        <p>
          3. The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine
          inspiration, are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and,
          therefore, are of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any
          otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings. 6
        </p>
        <p>6. Luke 24:27, 44; Romans 3:2</p>
        <p>
          4. The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be
          believed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but
          wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore
          it is to be received because it is the Word of God. 7
        </p>
        <p>
          7. 2 Peter 1:19-21; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 John 5:9
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God
          to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the
          heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the
          majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the
          whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes
          of the only way of man&#x27;s salvation, and many other incomparable
          excellencies, and entire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it
          doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet
          notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible
          truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the
          Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts. 8
        </p>
        <p>8. John 16:13-14; 1 Corinthians 2:10-12; 1 John 2:20, 27</p>
        <p>
          6. The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his
          own glory, man&#x27;s salvation, faith and life, is either expressly
          set down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which
          nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the
          Spirit, or traditions of men. 9 Nevertheless, we acknowledge the
          inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the
          saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word, 10
          and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God,
          and government of the church, common to human actions and societies,
          which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence,
          according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be
          observed. 11
        </p>
        <p>9. 2 Timothy 3:15-17; Galatians 1:8-9</p>
        <p>10. John 6:45; 1 Corinthians 2:9-12</p>
        <p>11. 1 Corinthians 11:13-14; 1 Corinthians 14:26,40</p>
        <p>
          7. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor
          alike clear unto all; 12 yet those things which are necessary to be
          known, believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded
          and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the
          learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain
          to a sufficient understanding of them. 13
        </p>
        <p>12. 2 Peter 3:16</p>
        <p>13. Psalms 19:7; Psalms 119:130</p>
        <p>
          8. The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the
          people of God of old), 14 and the New Testament in Greek (which at the
          time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations),
          being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and
          providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in
          all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to
          them. 15 But because these original tongues are not known to all the
          people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures,
          and are commanded in the fear of God to read, 16 and search them, 17
          therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every
          nation unto which they come, 18 that the Word of God dwelling
          plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and
          through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope. 19
        </p>
        <p>14. Romans 3:2</p>
        <p>15. Isaiah 8:20</p>
        <p>16. Acts 15:15</p>
        <p>17. John 5:39</p>
        <p>18. 1 Corinthians 14:6, 9, 11-12, 24, 28</p>
        <p>19. Colossians 3:16</p>
        <p>
          9. The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture
          itself; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full
          sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be
          searched by other places that speak more clearly. 20
        </p>
        <p>20. 2 Peter 1:20-21; Acts 15:15-16</p>
        <p>
          10. The supreme judge, by which all controversies of religion are to
          be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient
          writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined,
          and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy
          Scripture delivered by the Spirit, into which Scripture so delivered,
          our faith is finally resolved. 21
        </p>
        <p>21. Matthew 22:29, 31-32; Ephesians 2:20; Acts 28:23</p>
