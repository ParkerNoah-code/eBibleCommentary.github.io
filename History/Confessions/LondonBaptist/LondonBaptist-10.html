        <h2>Chapter 10. Of Effectual Calling</h2>
        <p>
          1. Those whom God hath predestinated unto life, He is pleased in His
          appointed, and accepted time, effectually to call, 1 by His Word and
          Spirit, out of that state of sin and death in which they are by
          nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ; 2 enlightening their
          minds spiritually and savingly to understand the things of God; 3
          taking away their heart of stone, and giving to them a heart of flesh;
          4 renewing their wills, and by His almighty power determining them to
          that which is good, and effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ; 5
          yet so as they come most freely, being made willing by His grace. 6
        </p>
        <p>1. Romans 8:30, 11:7; Ephesians 1:10, 11; 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14</p>
        <p>2. Ephesians 2:1-6</p>
        <p>3. Acts 26:18; Ephesians 1:17-18</p>
        <p>4. Ezekiel 36:26</p>
        <p>5. Deuteronomy 30:6; Ezekiel 36:27; Ephesians 1:19</p>
        <p>6. Psalms 110:3; Song of Solomon 1:4</p>
        <p>
          2. This effectual call is of God&#x27;s free and special grace alone,
          not from anything at all foreseen in man, nor from any power or agency
          in the creature, 7 being wholly passive therein, being dead in sins
          and trespasses, until being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit;
          8 he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace
          offered and conveyed in it, and that by no less power than that which
          raised up Christ from the dead. 9
        </p>
        <p>7. 2 Timothy 1:9; Ephesians 2:8</p>
        <p>8. 1 Corinthians 2:14; Ephesians 2:5; John 5:25</p>
        <p>9. Ephesians 1:19-20</p>
        <p>
          3. Elect infants dying in infancy are regenerated and saved by Christ
          through the Spirit; 10 who works when, and where, and how He pleases;
          11 so also are all elect persons, who are incapable of being outwardly
          called by the ministry of the Word.
        </p>
        <p>10. John 3:3, 5-6</p>
        <p>11. John 3:8</p>
        <p>
          4. Others not elected, although they may be called by the ministry of
          the Word, and may have some common operations of the Spirit, 12 yet
          not being effectually drawn by the Father, they neither will nor can
          truly come to Christ, and therefore cannot be saved: 13 much less can
          men that do not receive the Christian religion be saved; be they never
          so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature and
          the law of that religion they do profess. 14
        </p>
        <p>12. Matthew 22:14, 13:20-21; Hebrews 6:4-5</p>
        <p>13. John 6:44-45, 65; 1 John 2:24-25</p>
        <p>14. Acts 4:12; John 4:22, 17:3</p>
