        <h2>Chapter 15. Of Repentance Unto Life and Salvation</h2>
        <p>
          1. Such of the elect that are converted at riper years, having
          sometime lived in the state of nature, and therein served divers
          pleasures, God in their effectual calling gives them repentance to
          life. 1
        </p>
        <p>1. Titus 3:2-5</p>
        <p>
          2. Whereas there is none that does good and does not sin, 2 and the
          best of men may, through the power and deceitfulness of their
          corruption dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall
          in to great sins and provocations; God has, in the covenant of grace,
          mercifully provided that believers so sinning and falling be renewed
          through repentance unto salvation. 3
        </p>
        <p>2. Ecclesiastes 7:20</p>
        <p>3. Luke 22:31-32</p>
        <p>
          3. This saving repentance is an evangelical grace, 4 whereby a person,
          being by the Holy Spirit made sensible of the manifold evils of his
          sin, does, by faith in Christ, humble himself for it with godly
          sorrow, detestation of it, and self-abhorrancy, 5 praying for pardon
          and strength of grace, with a purpose and endeavor, by supplies of the
          Spirit, to walk before God unto all well-pleasing in all things. 6
        </p>
        <p>4. Zechariah 12:10; Acts 11:18</p>
        <p>5. Ezekiel 36:31; 2 Corinthians 7:11</p>
        <p>6. Psalms 119:6, 128</p>
        <p>
          4. As repentance is to be continued through the whole course of our
          lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the motions thereof,
          so it is every manâ€™s duty to repent of his particular known sins
          particularly. 7
        </p>
        <p>7. Luke 19:8; 1 Timothy 1:13, 15</p>
        <p>
          5. Such is the provision which God has made through Christ in the
          covenant of grace for the preservation of believers unto salvation,
          that although there is no sin so small but it deserves damnation, 8
          yet there is no sin so great that it shall bring damnation to them
          that repent, 9 which makes the constant preaching of repentance
          necessary.
        </p>
        <p>8. Romans 6:23</p>
        <p>9. Isaiah 1:16-18, 55:7</p>
