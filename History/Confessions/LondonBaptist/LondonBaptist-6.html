        <h2>
          Chapter 6. Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment Thereof
        </h2>
        <p>
          1. Although God created man upright and perfect, and gave him a
          righteous law, which had been unto life had he kept it, and threatened
          death upon the breach thereof, 1 yet he did not long abide in this
          honor; Satan using the subtlety of the serpent to subdue Eve, then by
          her seducing Adam, who, without any compulsion, did willfully
          transgress the law of their creation, and the command given to them,
          in eating the forbidden fruit, 2 which God was pleased, according to
          His wise and holy counsel to permit, having purposed to order it to
          His own glory.
        </p>
        <p>1. Genesis 2:16-17</p>
        <p>2. Genesis 3:12-13; 2 Corinthians 11:3</p>
        <p>
          2. Our first parents, by this sin, fell from their original
          righteousness and communion with God, and we in them whereby death
          came upon all: 3 all becoming dead in sin, 4 and wholly defiled in all
          the faculties and parts of soul and body. 5
        </p>
        <p>3. Romans 3:23</p>
        <p>4. Romans 5:12, etc.</p>
        <p>5. Titus 1:15; Genesis 6:5; Jeremiah 17:9; Romans 3:10-19</p>
        <p>
          3. They being the root, and by God&#x27;s appointment, standing in the
          room and stead of all mankind, the guilt of the sin was imputed, and
          corrupted nature conveyed, to all their posterity descending from them
          by ordinary generation, 6 being now conceived in sin, 7 and by nature
          children of wrath, 8 the servants of sin, the subjects of death, 9 and
          all other miseries, spiritual, temporal, and eternal, unless the Lord
          Jesus set them free. 10
        </p>
        <p>6. Romans 5:12-19; 1 Corinthians 15:21-22, 45, 49</p>
        <p>7. Psalms 51:5; Job 14:4</p>
        <p>8. Ephesians 2:3</p>
        <p>9. Romans 6:20, 5:12</p>
        <p>10. Hebrews 2:14-15; 1 Thessalonians 1:10</p>
        <p>
          4. From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed,
          disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all
          evil, 11 do proceed all actual transgressions. 12
        </p>
        <p>11. Romans 8:7; Colossians 1:21</p>
        <p>12. James 1:14-15; Matthew 15:19</p>
        <p>
          5. The corruption of nature, during this life, does remain in those
          that are regenerated; 13 and although it be through Christ pardoned
          and mortified, yet both itself, and the first motions thereof, are
          truly and properly sin. 14
        </p>
        <p>13. Romans 7:18, 23; Ecclesiastes 7:20; 1 John 1:8</p>
        <p>14. Romans 7:23-25; Galatians 5:17</p>
