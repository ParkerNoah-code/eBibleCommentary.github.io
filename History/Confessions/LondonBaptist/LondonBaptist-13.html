        <h2>Chapter 13. Of Sanctification</h2>
        <p>
          1. They who are united to Christ, effectually called, and regenerated,
          having a new heart and a new spirit created in them through the virtue
          of Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection, are also farther sanctified,
          really and personally, 1 through the same virtue, by his Word and
          Spirit dwelling in them; 2 the dominion of the whole body of sin is
          destroyed, 3 and the several lusts of it are more and more weakened
          and mortified, 4 and they more and more quickened and strengthened in
          all saving graces, 5 to the practice of all true holiness, without
          which no man shall see the Lord. 6
        </p>
        <p>1. Acts 20:32; Romans 6:5-6</p>
        <p>2. John 17:17; Ephesians 3:16-19; 1 Thessalonians 5:21-23</p>
        <p>3. Romans 6:14</p>
        <p>4. Galatians 5:24</p>
        <p>5. Colossians 1:11</p>
        <p>6. 2 Corinthians 7:1; Hebrews 12:14</p>
        <p>
          2. This sanctification is throughout the whole man, 7 yet imperfect in
          this life; there abides still some remnants of corruption in every
          part, 8 wherefrom arises a continual and irreconcilable war; the flesh
          lusting against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. 9
        </p>
        <p>7. 1 Thessalonians 5:23</p>
        <p>8. Romans 7:18, 23</p>
        <p>9. Galatians 5:17; 1 Peter 2:11</p>
        <p>
          3. In which war, although the remaining corruption for a time may much
          prevail, 10 yet, through the continual supply of strength from the
          sanctifying Spirit of Christ, the regenerate part does overcome; 11
          and so the saints grow in grace, perfecting holiness in the fear of
          God, pressing after an heavenly life, in evangelical obedience to all
          the commands which Christ as Head and King, in his Word has prescribed
          to them. 12
        </p>
        <p>10. Romans 7:23</p>
        <p>11. Romans 6:14</p>
        <p>12. Ephesians 4:15-16; 2 Corinthians 3:18, 7:1</p>
