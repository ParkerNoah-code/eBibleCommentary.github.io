        <h2>Chapter 4. Of Creation</h2>
        <p>
          1. In the beginning it pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, 1
          for the manifestation of the glory of His eternal power, 2 wisdom, and
          goodness, to create or make the world, and all things therein, whether
          visible or invisible, in the space of six days, and all very good. 3
        </p>
        <p>1. John 1:2-3; Hebrews 1:2; Job 26:13</p>
        <p>2. Romans 1:20</p>
        <p>3. Colossians 1:16; Genesis 1:31</p>
        <p>
          2. After God had made all other creatures, He created man, male and
          female, 4 with reasonable and immortal souls, 5 rendering them fit
          unto that life to God for which they were created; being made after
          the image of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness; 6
          having the law of God written in their hearts, 7 and power to fulfill
          it, and yet under a possibility of transgressing, being left to the
          liberty of their own will, which was subject to change. 8
        </p>
        <p>4. Genesis 1:27</p>
        <p>5. Genesis 2:7</p>
        <p>6. Ecclesiastes 7:29; Genesis 1:26</p>
        <p>7. Romans 2:14-15</p>
        <p>8. Genesis 3:6</p>
        <p>
          3. Besides the law written in their hearts, they received a command
          not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, 9 which while
          they kept, they were happy in their communion with God, and had
          dominion over the creatures. 10
        </p>
        <p>9. Genesis 2:17</p>
        <p>10. Genesis 1:26, 28</p>
