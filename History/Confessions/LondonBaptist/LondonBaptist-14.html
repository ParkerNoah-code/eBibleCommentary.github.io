        <h2>Chapter 14. Of Saving Faith</h2>
        <p>
          1. The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the
          saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their
          hearts, 1 and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of the Word; 2 by
          which also, and by the administration of baptism and the Lord&#x27;s
          supper, prayer, and other means appointed of God, it is increased and
          strengthened. 3
        </p>
        <p>1. 2 Corinthians 4:13; Ephesians 2:8</p>
        <p>2. Romans 10:14,17</p>
        <p>3. Luke 17:5; 1 Peter 2:2; Acts 20:32</p>
        <p>
          2. By this faith a Christian believes to be true whatsoever is
          revealed in the Word for the authority of God himself, 4 and also
          apprehends an excellency therein above all other writings and all
          things in the world, 5 as it bears forth the glory of God in his
          attributes, the excellency of Christ in his nature and offices, and
          the power and fullness of the Holy Spirit in his workings and
          operations: and so is enabled to cast his soul upon the truth
          consequently believed; 6 and also acts differently upon that which
          each particular passage thereof contains; yielding obedience to the
          commands, 7 trembling at the threatenings, 8 and embracing the
          promises of God for this life and that which is to come; 9 but the
          principle acts of saving faith have immediate relation to Christ,
          accepting, receiving, and resting upon him alone for justification,
          sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of grace.
          10
        </p>
        <p>4. Acts 24:14</p>
        <p>5. Psalms 19:7-10, 69:72</p>
        <p>6. 2 Timothy 1:12</p>
        <p>7. John 15:14</p>
        <p>8. Isaiah 66:2</p>
        <p>9. Hebrews 11:13</p>
        <p>10. John 1:12; Acts 16:31; Galatians 2:20; Acts 15:11</p>
        <p>
          3. This faith, although it be in different stages, and may be weak or
          strong, 11 yet it is in the least degree of it different in the kind
          or nature of it, as is all other saving grace, from the faith and
          common grace of temporary believers; 12 and therefore, though it may
          be many times assailed and weakened, yet it gets the victory, 13
          growing up in many to the attainment of a full assurance through
          Christ, 14 who is both the author and finisher of our faith. 15

        <p>13. Ephesians 6:16; 1 John 5:4, 5</p>
