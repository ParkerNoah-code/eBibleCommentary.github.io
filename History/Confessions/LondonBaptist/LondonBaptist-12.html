        <h2>Chapter 12. Of Adoption</h2>
        <p>
          1. All those that are justified, God conferred, in and for the sake of
          his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption,
          1 by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and
          privileges of the children of God, 2 have his name put on them, 3
          receive the spirit of adoption, 4 have access to the throne of grace
          with boldness, are enabled to cry Abba, Father, 5 are pitied, 6
          protected, 7 provided for, 8 and chastened by him as by a Father, 9
          yet never cast off, 10 but sealed to the day of redemption, 11 and
          inherit the promises as heirs of everlasting salvation. 12
