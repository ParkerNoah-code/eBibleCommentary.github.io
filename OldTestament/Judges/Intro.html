        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Book of Judges covers the period between the conquest of Canaan
          under Joshua and the establishment of the monarchy under Saul. It
          recounts the struggles of the Israelites as they settled into their
          new homeland and faced various military threats from the surrounding
          peoples. The book is named after the judges, charismatic leaders whom
          God raised up to deliver His people from their enemies when they cried
          out to Him. The narrative follows a cyclical pattern: the Israelites
          fall into idolatry and disobedience, God allows them to be oppressed
          by their enemies, the people cry out to God for help, and He sends a
          judge to deliver them. This cycle repeats multiple times throughout
          the book, highlighting the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful to
          God and their continual need for His intervention and mercy. The book
          also includes the notable stories of Deborah, Gideon, and Samson,
          showcasing how God can use unlikely individuals to accomplish His
          purposes.
