        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>
          In the Hebrew Bible, this book is known as "Shemot" (שְׁמוֹת), which
          means "Names." This title is derived from the opening words of the
          book: "These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt
          with Jacob" (Exodus 1:1). This naming convention, where a book is
          titled after its opening words, is common in the Hebrew Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The English title "Exodus" comes from the Greek Septuagint (LXX),
          where it is called "Exodos" (Ἔξοδος), meaning "exit" or "departure."
          This title aptly describes the central event of the book: the
          departure of the Israelites from Egypt. The Latin Vulgate retained
          this Greek title, from which we get our English name for the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The title "Exodus" is significant as it encapsulates the primary
          narrative thrust of the book - the liberation of the Israelites from
          Egyptian slavery and their journey towards the Promised Land. This
          exodus event becomes a defining moment in Israel's history, frequently
          referred to throughout the rest of the Bible as a demonstration of
          God's power and faithfulness to His covenant promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's worth noting that while the Hebrew title focuses on the
          continuity with Genesis (by referring to the names of Jacob's sons),
          the Greek/English title emphasizes the new chapter in Israel's history
          that this book represents. The prosperity and hope of Joseph’s era
          have given way to the suffering and oppression of Israel under a new
          Egyptian dynasty. This shift sets the stage for a narrative of
          redemption, where God emerges as the ultimate deliverer, acting
          through the chosen leader, Moses, to fulfill His covenant promises.
          Both aspects - continuity and new beginnings - are crucial themes in
          Exodus.
        </p>

        <h2>Authorship</h2>
        <p>
          The traditional view, held by both Jewish and Christian traditions for
          many centuries, attributes the authorship of Exodus (along with the
          rest of the Pentateuch) to Moses. This view is based on several
          factors:
        </p>
        <p>Internal Evidence:</p>
        <p>Several passages in Exodus explicitly mention Moses writing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Exodus 17:14 - "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Write this on a scroll
            as something to be remembered...'"
          </li>
          <li>
            Exodus 24:4 - "Moses then wrote down everything the Lord had said."
          </li>
          <li>
            Exodus 34:27 - "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Write down these
            words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant
            with you and with Israel.'"
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Moreover, Moses' central role in the narrative and his unique position
          as mediator between God and Israel supports the idea that he recorded
          these events.
        </p>
        <p>External Evidence:</p>
        <p>
          Other biblical books attribute the Pentateuch to Moses (e.g., Josh
          1:7-8, 1 Kings 2:3, 2 Kings 14:6, Ezra 6:18, Neh 13:1, Dan 9:11-13,
          Mal 4:4). In the New Testament, Jesus and the apostles refer to Moses
          as the author of the Pentateuch (e.g., Mk 12:26, Lk 24:27, Jn 5:46-47,
          Rom 10:5).
        </p>
        <p>Challenges to Mosaic Authorship:</p>
        <p>
          Since the 19th century, some scholars have challenged Mosaic
          authorship based on several arguments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Apparent anachronisms (e.g., references to the Philistines in Exod
            13:17)
          </li>
          <li>Variations in style and vocabulary</li>
          <li>The account of Moses' death in Deuteronomy</li>
          <li>
            The Documentary Hypothesis (discussed more in the introduction to
            Deuteronomy), which posits multiple sources compiled over centuries
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Conservative scholars have responded to these challenges, arguing
          that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some apparent anachronisms may be later editorial updates</li>
          <li>
            Variations in style can be explained by the different genres within
            the book
          </li>
          <li>
            Moses could have written most of the Pentateuch, with later inspired
            additions (like the account of his death)
          </li>
          <li>
            The unity and coherence of the Pentateuch argue against the
            fragmentation suggested by the Documentary Hypothesis
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While debate continues in academic circles about the authorship of the
          Pentateuch, there is a lot less focus on the hypothetical Documentary
          Hypothesis and a greater focus on the received text. Conservative
          scholars maintain that Moses was the substantial author of Exodus,
          possibly with some later inspired editorial additions. This view
          aligns with the book's internal claims, the testimony of later
          Scripture, and doesn't rely on purely theoretical speculations about
          the compilation of sources after the time of Moses.
        </p>

        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          Given the traditional view, we can establish the following timeline
          for Exodus:
        </p>
        <p>Date of Composition:</p>
        <p>
          The Exodus would have been written during the Israelites' wilderness
          wanderings, approximately 1445-1405 BC. Moses, as an eyewitness and
          the leader of the Exodus, would have recorded these events shortly
          after they occurred.
        </p>
        <p>Date of Events:</p>
        <p>
          The date of the Exodus itself can be calculated based on 1 Kings 6:1,
          which states that Solomon began building the temple in the 480th year
          after the Exodus. Given that Solomon's fourth year is generally dated
          to around 966 BC, this places the Exodus at approximately 1446 BC.
        </p>
        <p>This dating aligns with other biblical chronological markers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Judges 11:26 indicates that Israel had occupied Canaan for 300 years
            by the time of Jephthah (c. 1100 BC).
          </li>
          <li>
            The 430 years mentioned in Exodus 12:40-41 places Jacob's family's
            entry into Egypt around 1876 BC.
          </li>
          <li>
            This timing corresponds with Joseph's rise to power in Egypt during
            the Middle Kingdom period.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Egyptian Historical Context</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the chronology, the events of Exodus would have taken place
          during Egypt's 18th Dynasty, specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The oppression of the Israelites likely began under Thutmose I (c.
            1526-1513 BC).
          </li>
          <li>
            The Pharaoh of the Exodus was most likely Thutmose III (c. 1479-1425
            BC) or possibly Amenhotep II (c. 1425-1400 BC).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This period marked the height of Egypt's New Kingdom era,
          characterized by imperial expansion and grand building projects, which
          aligns well with the biblical narrative. The use of slave labor for
          construction was common during this time.
        </p>

        <h2>Historical Reliability</h2>
        <p>
          While direct archaeological evidence for the Exodus is limited given
          the kind of event that it was, many aspects of the narrative align
          with what we know of ancient Egyptian culture and practices:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The absence of the Pharaoh's name in Exodus is consistent with
            Egyptian royal protocol of the time.
          </li>
          <li>
            The plagues described in Exodus can be understood as direct
            challenges to various Egyptian deities, demonstrating a deep
            understanding of Egyptian religion.
          </li>
          <li>
            The structure and content of the covenant in Exodus bear
            similarities to other ancient Near Eastern treaties of the second
            millennium BC.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's important to note that the lack of direct archaeological evidence
          does not disprove the Exodus account. Many scholars point out that we
          wouldn't necessarily expect to find archaeological remains of nomadic
          people in the desert, and that the Egyptian practice of not recording
          defeats could explain the absence of the Exodus in Egyptian records.
        </p>
        <p>
          This traditional timeline provides a coherent framework for
          understanding the events of Exodus, God's mighty acts of deliverance
          and covenant-making with Israel, within their historical context.
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The overarching purpose of Exodus is to demonstrate God's faithfulness
          to His covenant promises, to establish Israel as His chosen people,
          and to provide the historical and theological foundation for Israel's
          relationship with God. It serves as a pivotal narrative in the history
          of redemption, bridging God's promises to the patriarchs with the
          establishment of Israel as a nation set apart for His purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Record God's Deliverance of Israel: The primary purpose of Exodus
          is to recount how God fulfilled His promises to Abraham by delivering
          his descendants from slavery in Egypt. This dramatic rescue
          demonstrates God's power over earthly kingdoms and His faithfulness to
          His covenant promises. The Exodus event becomes the defining moment in
          Israel's national identity and is frequently referenced throughout the
          rest of Scripture as a testament to God's might and love for His
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Establish Israel as a Covenant Nation: Exodus narrates the
          transformation of Israel from a large family to a nation set apart for
          God. The giving of the Law at Sinai, including the Ten Commandments,
          establishes the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This
          covenant defines Israel's unique identity and provides the framework
          for their religious and social life.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Reveal God's Character: Throughout Exodus, God reveals Himself in
          new and profound ways. He discloses His personal name (YHWH) to Moses,
          demonstrating His desire for a close relationship with His people. The
          narrative highlights God's attributes of justice, mercy, holiness, and
          faithfulness, providing a foundational understanding of God's nature
          for Israel and future readers.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Prefigure Christ and Salvation: The Passover lamb, the crossing of
          the Red Sea, the provision of manna, and other events are types
          pointing to Christ's redemptive work. This typological significance
          reveals the depth of the book's purpose in God's plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Establish Worship Practices: A significant portion of Exodus is
          devoted to instructions for building the Tabernacle and instituting
          the priesthood. These detailed prescriptions serve to establish proper
          worship of God, emphasizing His holiness and the need for mediation
          between God and His people.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Provide a Historical Foundation for Israel's Laws: Many of Israel's
          laws and customs find their origin and explanation in the events of
          Exodus. The book provides the historical context for understanding why
          certain laws were given and why they were significant for Israel's
          identity and relationship with God.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Themes</h2>
        <p>Throughout Exodus, several key themes and elements emerge:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Divine Intervention:</strong> God's direct involvement in
            human history is evident throughout, from the plagues to the parting
            of the Red Sea.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Leadership of Moses:</strong> Moses' development as a leader
            is a central narrative thread, showcasing both his strengths and
            weaknesses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Covenant Relationship:</strong> The establishment of the
            covenant at Sinai defines Israel's unique relationship with God and
            their identity as His chosen people.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Law and Ethics:</strong> The giving of the Ten Commandments
            and the detailed laws that follow provide the ethical and legal
            framework for Israel's national life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Worship and Holiness:</strong> The detailed instructions for
            the Tabernacle and priesthood emphasize the importance of proper
            worship and the concept of holiness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>God's Character:</strong> Throughout the narrative, God's
            attributes of power, justice, mercy, and faithfulness are displayed.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Structure and Content</h2>
        <p>
          The book of Exodus can be divided into three main sections, each
          focusing on a key aspect of Israel's journey from slavery to covenant
          nationhood:
        </p>
        <p>I. Deliverance from Egypt (Chapters 1-15)</p>
        <p>
          This section narrates Israel's oppression in Egypt and God's
          miraculous deliverance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Israel's oppression and the birth of Moses (1-2)</li>
          <li>God's call to Moses and his return to Egypt (3-4)</li>
          <li>Confrontations with Pharaoh and the Ten Plagues (5-11)</li>
          <li>The Passover and the Exodus (12-13)</li>
          <li>Crossing the Red Sea (14-15)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>II. Journey to Sinai (Chapters 15-18)</p>
        <p>
          This transitional section recounts Israel's journey from the Red Sea
          to Mount Sinai:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provision of water and manna (15-16)</li>
          <li>Victory over the Amalekites (17)</li>
          <li>Jethro's visit and advice on governance (18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>III. Covenant at Sinai (Chapters 19-40)</p>
        <p>
          The final and largest section focuses on God's covenant with Israel at
          Mount Sinai:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Theophany at Sinai and the Ten Commandments (19-20)</li>
          <li>The Book of the Covenant - detailed laws (21-23)</li>
          <li>Covenant confirmation (24)</li>
          <li>Instructions for the Tabernacle and priesthood (25-31)</li>
          <li>The Golden Calf incident and covenant renewal (32-34)</li>
          <li>Construction and consecration of the Tabernacle (35-40)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The structure of Exodus moves from physical deliverance (from Egypt)
          to spiritual formation (at Sinai). It begins with Israel in bondage to
          an earthly king and concludes with them in covenant relationship with
          their divine King, symbolized by the presence of the Tabernacle in
          their midst. This structure and content serve the book's overall
          purpose of demonstrating God's faithfulness to His covenant promises
          and establishing Israel as a nation set apart for His purposes.
        </p>
