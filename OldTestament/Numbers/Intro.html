          The book of Leviticus as well as the book of Numbers follow
          immediately after the book of Exodus. The book of Numbers begins with
          the words "And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sina√Ø,
          in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second
          month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of
          Egypt" (c.f. Exod 40:17)
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord Jesus includes the book of Numbers in His words when
          explaining to His disciples all that was written concerning Himself
          ("in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms" Lk
          24:44).
