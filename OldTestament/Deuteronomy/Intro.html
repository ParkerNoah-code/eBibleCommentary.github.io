        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Deuteronomy is the last book of the Pentateuch (Greek for "Fivebook")
          or of the Thora (Hebrew word for "law"). The unity of the Pentateuch
          and the fact that Moses is the author of it have often been denied
          since the 19th century. Criticism has especially focused on the book
          of Deuteronomy as it is said to have been written only at the time of
          Josiah, or even later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting from 2 Timothy 3:16: "All scripture is given by inspiration
          of God" we can see in the Old as well as in the New Testament that
          Moses is considered to be the author of Deuteronomy and therefore the
          time of writing is confirmed. In Deuteronomy 31:9, 24-26 it is
          testified that Moses wrote the book and that he gave it to the Levites
          to keep it. In Joshua 8:32-35 explicit reference is made to
          Deuteronomy 27:8-12 as "all that Moses the servant of the Lord had
          commanded before". While mentioning the law of Moses (Thora) in 2
          Chronicles 34:14 and Nehemiah 8:1 the book of Deuteronomy is included
          as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the question is being raised as to who was the author of
          Deuteronomy 34 where we find the death and burial of Moses. It
          probably was Joshua, the friend and successor of Moses (Deut 34:9) who
          under the guidance and inspiration of the Holy Spirit added this short
          appendix to the whole work of his predecessor.
