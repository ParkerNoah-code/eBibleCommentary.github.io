        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author and Date</h2>
        <p>
          The first verse of this short book names Joel (meaning Jehovah is God)
          the son of Pethuel as author. Besides this very short message we do
          not know anything about the person and circumstances of Joel&#x27;s
          life. There have been many guesses as to the time of when Joel lived.
          Some scientists say the book has been written around 400 BC or even
          later; other expositors think that Joel lived during the 9th century
          BC, maybe at the time of king Jehoash in Judah.
        </p>
        <p>
          A huge plague of locusts connected with a great drought gave the
          occasion for writing this book. Such incidents however are so frequent
          in wide parts of the east that one cannot draw any conclusions from it
          as to the historical background. As the Holy Scriptures are silent as
          to the time of writing we ought to respect this.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The prophecy of Joel draws a wide circle from the calamity of his days
          up to time when the people of God will be oppressed and restored and
          blessed at the day of Christ. So Joel may be correctly called the
          prophet of the day of Jehovah.
        </p>
        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
          Ch. 1: The great locust plague and the drought were a punishment of
          Jehovah. Already Moses and Solomon had prophesied such forms of
          judgement (Deut 28:38-39 and 1 Kings 8:37). But the people of Israel
          would not recognize the hand of Jehovah in it. This is why, the
          prophet calls the old men and the priests to lamentation and
          repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ch. 2: Shows an extended view of the judgment. Here we see not only
          the locusts but an army of enemies invading the land from the north
          and destroying it. An alarm is sounded in mount Zion and the people
          repent. Now comes the day of Jehovah in which He Himself saves His
          people from the army of the north. The land is not only blessed
          outwardly by the early and the latter rain but the Holy Spirit will be
          poured out upon all flesh. Although Peter in Acts 2:16-21 repeats
          these words of Joel&#x27;s verbally the final fulfilment of this
          prophecy is yet to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ch. 3: Describes the judgment of the nations which will happen in the
          day of Jehovah in the valley of Jehoshaphat.
        </p>
