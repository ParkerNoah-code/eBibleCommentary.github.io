        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Book of Job is a profound and thought-provoking work of wisdom
          literature that grapples with the age-old question of human suffering
          and the justice of God. The book opens with an introduction to Job, a
          righteous and prosperous man who fears God and shuns evil. In a
          heavenly council, God permits Satan to test Job's faith by inflicting
          him with a series of devastating losses and physical afflictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of the book consists of poetic dialogues between Job and
          his three friends—Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar—who come to comfort him
          in his distress. The friends insist that Job's suffering must be a
          consequence of his sin, urging him to repent and seek God's
          forgiveness. Job, however, maintains his innocence and struggles to
          understand why God has allowed him to suffer so terribly.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the dialogues progress, Job's friends become increasingly harsh in
          their judgments, while Job grows more desperate in his pleas for
          understanding and vindication. A fourth friend, Elihu, then enters the
          conversation, offering a different perspective on Job's suffering and
          God's justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, God Himself speaks to Job out of a whirlwind, challenging him
          with a series of questions that highlight the vast gulf between divine
          wisdom and human understanding. In the face of God's power and
          majesty, Job humbly acknowledges his own limitations and repents of
          his accusations against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book concludes with God rebuking Job's friends for their misguided
          counsel and restoring Job's fortunes, granting him twice as much as he
          had before. The Book of Job offers a complex and nuanced exploration
          of the nature of suffering, the character of God, and the limits of
          human wisdom. It invites readers to grapple with difficult questions
          of faith and to trust in God's sovereignty even in the midst of pain
          and uncertainty.
