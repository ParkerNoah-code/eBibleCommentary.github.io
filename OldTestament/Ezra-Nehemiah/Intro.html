        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, which were originally combined as one
          book in the Hebrew Bible, chronicle the return of the Jewish exiles
          from Babylon and the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple in the
          post-exilic period. The narrative takes place after the fall of the
          Babylonian Empire, when the Persian king Cyrus the Great allows the
          Jews to return to their homeland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ezra, a priest and scribe, leads the first group of exiles back to
          Jerusalem. The book of Ezra focuses on the rebuilding of the temple,
          which faces opposition from the surrounding peoples. Despite the
          challenges, the temple is eventually completed, and Ezra leads the
          people in a renewal of their covenant with God, emphasizing the
          importance of obedience to the Law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nehemiah, a cupbearer to the Persian king, learns of the dire
          situation in Jerusalem and requests permission to return and rebuild
          the city walls. The book of Nehemiah details the construction of the
          walls, which is met with resistance and threats from enemies.
          Nehemiah's leadership and the people's determination enable them to
          complete the walls in just 52 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Ezra and Nehemiah emphasize the importance of spiritual renewal
          and the need for the people to separate themselves from the influences
          of the surrounding nations. They also stress the significance of
          obedience to God's Law, the proper observance of religious feasts and
          practices, and the role of prayer and repentance in the life of the
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah provide valuable insights
          into the challenges and triumphs of the Jewish people as they seek to
          rebuild their lives, their city, and their relationship with God in
          the aftermath of the Babylonian exile.
