        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Book of Ezekiel is a powerful prophetic work in the Old Testament,
          chronicling the visions, messages, and symbolic actions of the prophet
          Ezekiel. A contemporary of Jeremiah, Ezekiel ministered to the Jewish
          exiles in Babylon during the early years of the Babylonian captivity,
          which began around 597 BCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book is known for its rich and complex symbolism, vivid visions,
          and dramatic prophetic sign-acts. It can be divided into three main
          sections. The first section (chapters 1-24) focuses on God's judgment
          against Judah and Jerusalem, with Ezekiel delivering messages of
          rebuke for the people's idolatry, social injustice, and covenant
          unfaithfulness. This section includes the famous vision of the valley
          of dry bones, symbolizing God's power to restore and revive His
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second section (chapters 25-32) contains oracles of judgment
          against various foreign nations, such as Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia,
          Tyre, and Egypt. These prophecies demonstrate God's sovereignty over
          all nations and His judgment against those who oppose His people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final section (chapters 33-48) shifts in tone, offering messages
          of hope, restoration, and renewal for Israel. Ezekiel prophesies about
          the future gathering of God's people, the restoration of their land,
          and the establishment of a new covenant and a new temple. The book
          concludes with a detailed vision of a restored Jerusalem and a renewed
          worship in the presence of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the book, Ezekiel stresses the holiness and glory of God,
          the seriousness of sin, the importance of individual responsibility,
          and the promise of God's faithfulness to His covenant people. He also
          emphasizes the role of the prophet as a watchman, responsible for
          warning the people of impending judgment and calling them to
          repentance.
