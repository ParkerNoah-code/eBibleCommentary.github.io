        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Book of Ruth is a short narrative that takes place during the time
          of the judges, providing a glimpse of hope and redemption amidst the
          chaos and moral decline of that era. The story revolves around Ruth, a
          Moabite woman who chooses to leave her homeland and follow her
          mother-in-law, Naomi, back to Bethlehem after the death of her
          husband. Despite facing the challenges of being a foreigner and a
          widow, Ruth's loyalty, humility, and faith in the God of Israel are
          evident throughout the book. Through her devotion to Naomi and her
          hard work in the fields of Boaz, a wealthy relative of Naomi's
          deceased husband, Ruth captures Boaz's attention and eventually
          becomes his wife. The book concludes with the birth of their son,
          Obed, who becomes the grandfather of King David, thus establishing
          Ruth as an important figure in the lineage of Jesus Christ. The Book
          of Ruth serves as a testament to God's providence, love, and
          redemption, demonstrating how He can use seemingly insignificant
          individuals to fulfill His greater purposes.
