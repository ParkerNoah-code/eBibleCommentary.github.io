        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          The book of Proverbs, a treasure trove of wisdom literature in the Old
          Testament, is largely credited to the legendary King Solomon, who
          reigned over Israel from around 971 to 931 B.C. (1:1; 10:1). Solomon
          was renowned for his God-given wisdom. However, the book of Proverbs
          is not solely the work of Solomon; it also contains additional wisdom
          from various sources spanning several centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to Solomon's contributions, the book includes a collection
          of proverbs transcribed by the scribes of King Hezekiah, who ruled
          Judah from approximately 715 to 686 B.C. (25:1). The book also
          features two distinct sets of sayings attributed to a group known as
          "the wise" (22:17–24:22; 24:23–34). Furthermore, the book of Proverbs
          contains "oracles" or prophetic utterances from two enigmatic figures:
          Agur (30:1–33) and Lemuel (31:1–9). The book concludes with an
          acrostic poem extolling the virtues of a noble wife (31:10–31).
        </p>
        <p>
          While the foundation of Proverbs was laid during Solomon's reign, it
          appears that the book reached its final form during the time of King
          Hezekiah. This suggests that the wisdom contained in Proverbs was
          carefully preserved, compiled, and crafted, reflecting the timeless
          nature of its insights and the enduring value placed on wisdom in
          ancient Israelite society.
