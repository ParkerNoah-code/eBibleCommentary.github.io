            This whole Psalm offers itself to be drawn into these two opposite
            propositions: a godly man is blessed, a wicked man is miserable;
            which seem to stand as two challenges, made by the prophet: one,
            that he will maintain a godly man against all comers; the other,
            that albeit the ungodly make a show in the world of being happy, yet
            they of all men are most miserable.
          </p>

                >Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the
                wicked,<br />
                nor stand on the path of sinners,<br />
                nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</em

          </p>
          <p>
            See how this Book of Psalms opens with a benediction, even as did
            the famous Sermon of our Lord upon the Mount! The word translated
            "blessed" is a very expressive one. The original word is plural, and
            it is a controverted matter whether it is an adjective or a
            substantive. Hence we may learn the multiplicity of the blessings
            which shall rest upon the man whom God hath justified, and the
            perfection and greatness of the blessedness he shall enjoy. We might
            read it, "Oh, the blessednesses!" and we may well regard it as a
            joyful acclamation of the gracious man's felicity. May the like
            benediction rest on us!
          </p>
          <p>
            Here the gracious man is described both negatively (verse 1) and
            positively (verse 2). He is a man who does not walk in the counsel
            of the ungodly. He takes wiser counsel, and walks in the
            commandments of the Lord his God. To him the ways of piety are paths
            of peace and pleasantness. His footsteps are ordered by the Word of
            God, and not by the cunning and wicked devices of carnal men. It is
            a rich sign of inward grace when the outward walk is changed, and
            when ungodliness is put far from our actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note next, he standeth not in the way of sinners. His company is of
            a choicer sort than it was. Although a sinner himself, he is now a
            blood-washed sinner, quickened by the Holy Spirit, and renewed in
            heart. Standing by the rich grace of God in the congregation of the
            righteous, he dares not herd with the multitude that do evil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again it is said, "nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful." He
            finds no rest in the atheist's scoffings. Let others make a mock of
            sin, of eternity, of hell and heaven, and of the Eternal God; this
            man has learned better philosophy than that of the infidel, and has
            too much sense of God's presence to endure to hear His name
            blasphemed. The seat of the scorner may be very lofty, but it is
            very near to the gate of hell; let us flee from it, for it shall
            soon be empty, and destruction shall swallow up the man who sits
            therein. Mark the gradation in the first verse:
          </p>
          <p>
            He walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,<br />
            Nor standeth in the way of sinners,<br />
            Nor SITTETH in the SEAT of SCORNFUL.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >Ver 2.
              <em
                >but his delight is in Yahweh’s law.<br />
                On his law he meditates day and night.</em
              ></b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            When men are living in sin they go from bad to worse. At first they
            merely walk in the counsel of the careless and ungodly, who forget
            God—the evil is rather practical than habitual—but after that, they
            become habituated to evil, and they stand in the way of open sinners
            who wilfully violate God's commandments; and if let alone, they go
            one step further, and become themselves pestilent teachers and
            tempters of others, and thus they sit in the seat of the scornful.
            They have taken their degree in vice, and as true Doctors of
            Damnation they are installed, and are looked up to by others as
            Masters in Belial. But the blessed man, the man to whom all the
            blessings of God belong, can hold no communion with such characters
            as these. He keeps himself pure from these lepers; he puts away evil
            things from him as garments spotted by the flesh; he comes out from
            among the wicked, and goes without the camp, bearing the reproach of
            Christ. O for grace to be thus separate from sinners.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now mark his positive character. "His delight is in the law of
            the Lord." He is not under the law as a curse and condemnation, but
            he is in it, and he delights to be in it as his rule of life; he
            delights, moreover, to meditate in it, to read it by day, and think
            upon it by night. He takes a text and carries it with him all day
            long; and in the night-watches, when sleep forsakes his eyelids, he
            museth upon the Word of God. In the day of his prosperity he sings
            psalms out of the Word of God, and in the night of his affliction he
            comforts himself with promises out of the same book. "The law of the
            Lord" is the daily bread of the true believer. And yet, in David's
            day, how small was the volume of inspiration, for they had scarcely
            anything save the first five books of Moses! How much more, then,
            should we prize the whole written Word which it is our privilege to
            have in all our houses! But, alas, what ill-treatment is given to
            this angel from heaven! We are not all Berean searchers of the
            Scriptures. How few among us can lay claim to the benediction of the
            text! Perhaps some of you can claim a sort of negative purity,
            because you do not walk in the way of the ungodly; but let me ask
            you—Is your delight in the law of God? Do you study God's Word? Do
            you make it the man of your right hand—your best companion and
            hourly guide? If not, this blessing belongeth not to you.
          </p>

            <b
              >Ver 3.
              <em
                >He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,<br />
                that produces its fruit in its season,<br />
                whose leaf also does not wither.<br />
                Whatever he does shall prosper.</em

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            "And he shall be like a tree planted"—not a wild tree, but "a tree
            planted," chosen, considered as property, cultivated and secured
            from the last terrible uprooting, for "every plant which my heavenly
            Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up:" Matthew 15:13. "By the
            rivers of water;" so that even if one river should fail, he hath
            another. The rivers of pardon and the rivers of grace, the rivers of
            the promise and the rivers of communion with Christ, are
            never-failing sources of supply. He is "like a tree planted by the
            rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season;" not
            unseasonable graces, like untimely figs, which are never
            full-flavored. But the man who delights in God's Word, being taught
            by it, bringeth forth patience in the time of suffering, faith in
            the day of trial, and holy joy in the hour of prosperity.
            Fruitfulness is an essential quality of a gracious man, and that
            fruitfulness should be seasonable. "His leaf also shall not wither;"
            his faintest word shall be everlasting; his little deeds of love
            shall be had in remembrance. Not simply shall his fruit be
            preserved, but his leaf also. He shall neither lose his beauty nor
            his fruitfulness. "And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."
          </p>
          <p>
            Blessed is the man who hath such a promise as this. But we must not
            always estimate the fulfillment of a promise by our own eye-sight.
            How often, my brethren, if we judge by feeble sense, may we come to
            the mournful conclusion of Jacob, "All these things are against me!"
            For though we know our interest in the promise, yet we are so tried
            and troubled, that sight sees the very reverse of what that promise
            foretells. But to the eye of faith this word is sure, and by it we
            perceive that our works are prospered, even when everything seems to
            go against us. It is not outward prosperity which the Christian most
            desires and values; it is soul prosperity which he longs for. We
            often, like Jehoshaphat, make ships to go to Tarshish for gold, but
            they are broken at Ezion-geber; but even here there is a true
            prospering, for it is often for the soul's health that we would be
            poor, bereaved, and persecuted. Our worst things are often our best
            things. As there is a curse wrapped up in the wicked man's mercies,
            so there is a blessing concealed in the righteous man's crosses,
            losses, and sorrows. The trials of the saint are a divine husbandry,
            by which he grows and brings forth abundant fruit.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >Ver 4.
              <em
                >The wicked are not so,<br />
                but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</em
              ></b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            We have now come to the second head of the Psalm. In this verse the
            contrast of the ill estate of the wicked is employed to heighten the
            coloring of that fair and pleasant picture which precedes it. The
            more forcible translation of the Vulgate and of the Septuagint
            version is— "Not so the ungodly, not so." And we are hereby to
            understand that whatever good thing is said of the righteous is not
            true in the case of the ungodly. Oh! how terrible is it to have a
            double negative put upon the promises! and yet this is just the
            condition of the ungodly. Mark the use of the term "ungodly," for,
            as we have seen in the opening of the Psalm, these are the beginners
            in evil, and are the least offensive of sinners. Oh! if such is the
            sad state of those who quietly continue in their morality, and
            neglect their God, what must be the condition of open sinners and
            shameless infidels? The first sentence is a negative description of
            the ungodly, and the second is the positive picture. Here is their
            character — "they are like chaff," intrinsically worthless, dead,
            unserviceable, without substance, and easily carried away. Here,
            also, mark their doom, — "the wind driveth away;" death shall hurry
            them with its terrible blast into the fire in which they shall be
            utterly consumed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >Ver 5.
              <em
                >Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,<br />
                nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</em
              ></b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            They shall stand there to be judged, but not to be acquitted. Fear
            shall lay hold upon them there; they shall not stand their ground;
            they shall flee away; they shall not stand in their own defence; for
            they shall blush and be covered with eternal contempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well may the saints long for heaven, for no evil men shall dwell
            there, "nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous." All our
            congregations upon earth are mixed. Every Church hath one devil in
            it. The tares grow in the same furrows as the wheat. There is no
            floor which is as yet thoroughly purged from chaff. Sinners mix with
            saints, as dross mingles with gold. God's precious diamonds still
            lie in the same field with pebbles. Righteous Lots are this side
            heaven continually vexed by the men of Sodom. Let us rejoice then,
            that in "the general assembly and church of the firstborn" above,
            there shall by no means be admitted a single unrenewed soul. Sinners
            cannot live in heaven. They would be out of their element. Sooner
            could a fish live upon a tree than the wicked in Paradise. Heaven
            would be an intolerable hell to an impenitent man, even if he could
            be allowed to enter; but such a privilege shall never be granted to
            the man who perseveres in his iniquities. May God grant that we may
            have a name and a place in his courts above!
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >Ver 6.
              <em
                >For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,<br />
                but the way of the wicked shall perish.</em
              ></b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, as the Hebrew hath it yet more fully, "The Lord is knowing the
            way of the righteous." He is constantly looking on their way, and
            though it may be often in mist and darkness, yet the Lord knoweth
            it. If it be in the clouds and tempest of affliction, he
            understandeth it. He numbereth the hairs of our head; he will not
            suffer any evil to befall us. "He knoweth the way that I take: when
            He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold." (Job 23:10.) "But the
            way of the ungodly shall perish." Not only shall they perish
            themselves, but their way shall perish too. The righteous carves his
            name upon the rock, but the wicked writes his remembrance in the
            sand. The righteous man ploughs the furrows of earth, and sows a
            harvest here, which shall never be fully reaped till he enters the
            enjoyments of eternity; but as for the wicked, he ploughs the sea,
            and though there may seem to be a shining trail behind his keel, yet
            the waves shall pass over it, and the place that knew him shall know
            him no more for ever. The very "way" of the ungodly shall perish. If
            it exist in remembrance, it shall be in the remembrance of the bad;
            for the Lord will cause the name of the wicked to rot, to become a
            stench in the nostrils of the good, and to be only known to the
            wicked themselves by its putridity.
          </p>
          <p>
            May the Lord cleanse our hearts and our ways, that we may escape the
            doom of the ungodly, and enjoy the blessedness of the righteous!

            This psalm, though without a title, may reasonably be thought to be
            a psalm of David; since the next psalm, which is also without a
            title, is ascribed to him (Acts 4:25); and since both are joined
            together as one psalm by the Jews (Acts 4:25); and since this is the
            general preface to the whole book, which is chiefly of David's
            penning.

            <em>Blessed is the man</em>. The words may be rendered, "O, the
            blessednesses of the man", or "of this man"; he is doubly blessed, a
            thrice happy and blessed man; blessed in things temporal and
            spiritual; happy in this world, and in that to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is to be praised and commended as a good man, so the Targum: "The
            goodness, or, Oh, the goodness of the man;" or as others, "Oh, the
            right goings or happy progress, or prosperous success of the man,"
            who answers to the following descriptions; which right walking of
            his is next observed, and his prosperity in Psalms 1:3. Some have
            interpreted this psalm of Christ, and indeed these are properly
            understood of him.

            In the metaphrase of Apollinarius it is entitled, &quot;A Song of
            David, the Prophet and King.&#x27;&#x27;
          </p>
          <p>
            As the book of the Canticles is called the Song of Songs by a
            Hebraism, it being the most excellent, so this Psalm may not unfitly
            be entitled, the Psalm of Psalms, for it contains in it the very
            pith and quintessence of Christianity. What Jerome saith on St.
            Paul's epistles, the same may I say of this Psalm; it is short as to
            the composure, but full of length and strength as to the matter.
            This Psalm carries blessedness in the frontpiece; it begins where we
            all hope to end: it may well be called a Christian's Guide, for it
            discovers the quicksands where the wicked sink down in perdition,
            and the firm ground on which the saints tread to glory.—Thomas
            Watson's Saints Spiritual Delight, 1660
          </p>
          <p>
            This whole Psalm offers itself to be drawn into these two opposite
            propositions: a godly man is blessed, a wicked man is miserable;
            which seem to stand as two challenges, made by the prophet: one,
            that he will maintain a godly man against all comers, to be the only
            Jason for winning the golden fleece of blessedness; the other, that
            albeit the ungodly make a show in the world of being happy, yet they
            of all men are most miserable.—Sir Richard Baker, 1640

            I have been induced to embrace the opinion of some among the ancient
            interpreters (Augustine, Jerome, etc.), who conceive that the first

            the JUST ONE, i.e. the Lord Jesus.—John Fry, B.A., 1842

            The psalmist saith more to the point about true happiness in this

            together; they did but beat the bush, God hath here put the bird
            into our hand.—John Trapp, 1660
          </p>

            Where the word blessed is hung out as a sign, we may be sure that we

            "Walketh NOT....NOR standeth....NOR sitteth," etc. Negative precepts
            are in some cases more absolute and peremptory than affirmatives;
            for to say, "that hath walketh in the counsel of the godly," might
            not be sufficient; for, he might walk in the counsel of the godly,
            and yet walk in the counsel of the ungodly too; not both indeed at
            once, but both at several times; where now, this negative clears him
            at all times.—Sir Richard Baker.

            The word (Heb) haish is emphatic, that man; that one among a

          </p>
          <p>
            "That walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly." Mark certain
            circumstances of their differing characters and conduct. I. The
            ungodly man has his counsel. II. The sinner has his way; and III.
            The scorner has his seat. The ungodly man is unconcerned about
            religion; he is neither zealous for his own salvation nor for that
            of others; and he counsels and advises those with whom he converses
            to adopt his plan, and not trouble themselves about praying,
            reading, repentance, etc., etc.; "there is no need for such things;
            live an honest life, make no fuss about religion, and you will fare
            well enough at last." Now "blessed is the man who walks not in this
            man's counsel," who does not come into his measures, nor act
            according to his plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sinner has his particular way of transgressing; one is a
            drunkard, another dishonest, another unclean. Few are given to every
            species of vice. There are many covetous men who abhor drunkenness,
            many drunkards who abhor covetousness; and so of others. Each has
            his easily besetting sin; therefore, says the prophet, "Let the
            wicked forsake HIS WAY." (Isaiah 55:7) Now, blessed is he who stands
            not is such a man's WAY.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scorner has brought, in reference to himself, all religion and
            moral feeling to an end. He has sat down—is utterly confirmed in
            impiety, and makes a mock at sin. His conscience is seared, and he
            is a believer in all unbelief. Now, blessed is the man who sits not
            down in his SEAT.—Adam Clarke.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Hebrew, the word "blessed" is a plural noun, ashrey
            (blessednesses), that is, all blessednesses are the portion of that
            man who has not gone away, etc.; as though it were said, "All things
            are well with that man who," etc. Why do you hold any dispute? Why
            draw vain conclusions? If a man has found that pearl of great price,
            to love the law of God and to be separate from the ungodly, all
            blessednesses belong to that man; but, if he does not find this
            jewel, he will seek for all blessednesses but will never find one!
            For as all things are pure unto the pure, so all things are lovely
            unto the loving, all things good unto the good; and, universally,
            such as thou art thyself, such is God himself unto thee, though he
            is not a creature. He is perverse unto the perverse, and holy unto
            the holy. Hence nothing can be good or saving unto him who is evil:
            nothing sweet unto him unto whom the law of God is not sweet. The
            word "counsel" is without doubt here to be received as signifying
            decrees and doctrines, seeing that no society of men exists without
            being formed and preserved by decrees and laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            David, however, by this term strikes at the pride and reprobate
            temerity of the ungodly. First, because they will not humble
            themselves so far as to walk in the law of the Lord, but rule
            themselves by their own counsel. And then he calls it their
            "counsel," because it is their prudence, and the way that seems to
            them to be without error. For this is the destruction of the
            ungodly—their being prudent in their own eyes and in their own
            esteem, and clothing their errors in the garb of prudence and of the
            right way. For if they came to men in the open garb of error, it
            would not be so distinguishing a mark of blessedness not to walk
            with them. But David does not here say, "in the folly of the
            ungodly," or "in the error of the ungodly;" and therefore he
            admonishes us to guard with all diligence against the appearance of
            what is right, that the devil transformed into an angel of light do
            not seduce us by his craftiness. And he contrasts the counsel of the
            wicked with the law of the Lord, that we may learn to beware of
            wolves in sheep's clothing, who are always ready to give counsel to
            all, to teach all, and to offer assistance unto all, when they are
            of all men least qualified to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term "stood" descriptively represents their obstinacy, and
            stiff-neckedness, wherein they harden themselves and make their
            excuses in words of malice, having become incorrigible in their
            ungodliness. For "to stand," in the figurative manner of Scripture
            expression, signifies to be firm and fixed: as in Romans 14:4, "To
            his own master he standeth or falleth: yea, he shall be holden up,
            for God is able to make him stand." Hence the word "column" is by
            the Hebrew derived from their verb "to stand," as is the word statue
            among the Latins. For this is the very self-excuse and
            self-hardening of the ungodly—their appearing to themselves to live
            rightly, and to shine in the eternal show of works above all others.
            With respect to the term "seat," to sit in the seat, is to teach, to
            act the instructor and teacher; as in Matthew 23:2, "The scribes sit
            in Moses' chair." They sit in the seat of pestilence, who fill the
            church with the opinions of philosophers, with the traditions of
            men, and with the counsels of their own brain, and oppress miserable
            consciences, setting aside, all the while, the word of God, by which
            alone the soul is fed, lives, and is preserved.—Martin Luther,
            1536-1546.

            "The scornful." Peccator cum in profundum venerit contemnet—when a
            wicked man comes to the depth and worst of sin, he despiseth. Then
            the Hebrew will despise Moses (Exodus 2:14), "Who made thee a prince
            and a judge over us?" Then Ahab will quarrel with Micaiah (1 Kings
            22:18), because he doth not prophecy good unto him. Every child in
            Bethel will mock Elisha (2 Kings 2:23), and be bold to call him
            "bald pate." Here is an original drop of venom swollen to a main
            ocean of poison: as one drop of some serpents' poison, lighting on
            the hand, gets into the veins, and so spreads itself over all the
            body till it hath stifled the vital spirits. God shall "laugh you to
            scorn," (Psalm 2:4), for laughing Him to scorn; and at last despise
            you that have despised him in us. That which a man spits against
            heaven, shall fall back on his own face. Your indignities done to
            your spiritual physicians shall sleep in the dust with your ashes,
            but stand up against your souls in judgment.—Thomas Adams, 1614.

            "But his will is in the law of the Lord." The "will," which is here
            signified, is that delight of heart, and that certain pleasure, in
            the law, which does not look at what the law promises, nor at what
            it threatens, but at this only; that "the law is holy, and just, and
            good." Hence it is not only a love of the law, but that loving
            delight in the law which no prosperity, nor adversity, nor the
            world, nor the prince of it, can either take away or destroy; for it
            victoriously bursts its way through poverty, evil report, the cross,
            death, and hell, and in the midst of adversities, shines the
            brightest.—Martin Luther.

            "His delight is in the law of the Lord."—This delight which the
            prophet here speaks of is the only delight that neither blushes nor
            looks pale; the only delight that gives a repast without an after
            reckoning; the only delight that stands in construction with all
            tenses; and like AEneas Anchyses, carries his parents upon his
            back.—Sir Richard Baker.

            "In His law doth he meditate." In the plainest text there is a world
            of holiness and spirituality; and if we in prayer and dependence
            upon God did sit down and study it, we should behold much more than
            appears to us. It may be, at once reading or looking, we see little
            or nothing; as Elijah's servant went once, and saw nothing;
            therefore he was commanded to look seven times. What now? says the
            prophet, "I see a cloud rising, like a man's hand;" and by-and-by,
            the whole surface of the heavens was covered with clouds. So you may
            look lightly upon a Scripture and see nothing; meditate often upon
            it, and there you shall see a light, like the light of the
            sun.—Joseph Caryl, 1647.

            "In His law doth he meditate day and night."—The good man doth
            meditate on the law of God day and night. The pontificians beat off
            the common people from this common treasury, by objecting this
            supposed difficulty. Oh, the Scriptures are hard to be understood,
            do not you trouble your heads about them; we will tell you the
            meaning of them. They might as well say, heaven is a blessed place,
            but it is a hard way to it; do not trouble yourselves, we will go
            thither for you. Thus in the great day of trial, when they should be
            saved by their book, alas! they have no book to save them. Instead
            of the Scriptures they can present images; these are the layman's
            books; as if they were to be tried by a jury of carvers and
            painters, and not by the twelve apostles. Be not you so cheated; but
            study the gospel as you look for comfort by the gospel. He that
            hopes for the inheritance, will make much of the conveyance.—Thomas
            Adams.

          <p>
            To "meditate," as it is generally understood, signifies to discuss,
            to dispute; and its meaning is always confined to a being employed
            in words, as in Psalm 32:30, "The mouth of the righteous shall
            meditate wisdom." Hence Augustine has, in his translation,
            "chatter;" and a beautiful metaphor it is—as chattering is the
            employment of birds, so a continual conversing in the law of the
            Lord (for talking is peculiar to man), ought to be the employment of
            man. But I cannot worthily and fully set forth the gracious meaning
            and force of this word; for this "meditating" consists first in an
            intent observing of the words of the law, and then in a comparing of
            the different Scriptures; which is a certain delightful hunting,
            nay, rather a playing with stags in a forest, where the Lord
            furnishes us with the stags, and opens to us their secret coverts.
            And from this kind of employment, there comes forth at length a man
            well instructed in the law of the Lord to speak unto the
            people.—Martin Luther.
          </p>
          <p>
            "In his law doth he meditate day and night." The godly man will read
            the Word by day, that men, seeing his good works, may glorify his
            Father who is in heaven; he will do it in the night, that he may not
            be seen of men: by day, to show that he is not one of those who
            dread the light; by night, to show that he is one who can shine in
            the shade: by day, for that is the time for working—work whilst it
            is day; by night, lest his Master should come as a thief, and find
            him idle.—Sir Richard Baker.

            "Meditate." Meditation doth discriminate and characterise a man; by
            this he may take a measure of his heart, whether it be good or bad;
            let me allude to that; "For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he."
            Proverbs 23:7. As the meditation is, such is the man. Meditation is
            the touchstone of a Christian; it shows what metal he is made of. It
            is a spiritual index; the index shows what is in the book, so
            meditation shows what is in the heart.—Thomas Watson's Saints'
            Spiritual Delight.

            Meditation chews the cud, and gets the sweetness and nutritive

            The naturalists observe that to uphold and accommodate bodily life,
            there are diverse sorts of faculties communicated, and these among
            the rest:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. An attractive faculty, to assume and draw in the food;<br />
            2. A retentive faculty, to retain it when taken in;<br />
            3. As assimilating faculty to concoct the nourishment;<br />
            4. An augmenting faculty, for drawing to perfection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meditation is all these. It helps judgment, wisdom, and faith to
            ponder, discern, and credit the things which reading and hearing
            supply and furnish. It assists the memory to lock up the jewels of
            divine truth in her sure treasury. It has a digesting power, and
            turns special truth into spiritual nourishment; and lastly, it helps
            the renewed heart to grow upward and increase its power to know the
            things which are freely given to us of God.—Condensed from Nathaniel
            Ranew, 1670.

            "A tree."—There is one tree, only to be found in the valley of the
            Jordan, but too beautiful to be entirely passed over; the oleander,
            with its bright blossoms and dark green leaves, giving the aspect of
            a rich garden to any spot where it grows. It is rarely if ever
            alluded to in the Scriptures. But it may be the tree planted by the
            streams of water which bringeth forth his fruit in due season, and
            "whose leaf shall not wither."—A. P. Stanley, D.D., in "Sinai and
            Palestine."
          </p>
          <p>
            "A tree planted by the rivers of water."—This is an allusion to the
            Eastern method of cultivation, by which rivulets of water are made
            to flow between the rows of trees, and thus, by artificial means,
            the trees receive a constant supply of moisture.
          </p>
          <p>
            "His fruit in his season."—In such a case expectation is never
            disappointed. Fruit is expected, fruit is borne, and it comes also
            in the time in which it should come. A godly education, under the
            influences of the divine Spirit, which can never be withheld where
            they are earnestly sought, is sure to produce the fruits of
            righteousness; and he who reads, prays, and meditates, will ever see
            the work which God has given him to do; the power by which he is to
            perform it; and the times, places, and opportunities for doing those
            things by which God can obtain most glory, his own soul most good,
            and his neighbour most edification.—Adam Clarke.
          </p>
          <p>
            "In his season." The Lord reckons the times which pass over us, and
            puts them to our account: let us, therefore, improve them, and with
            the impotent persons at the pool of Bethesda, step in when the angel
            stirs the water. Now the church is afflicted, it is a season of
            prayer and learning; now the church is enlarged, it is a season of
            praise; I am now at a sermon, I will hear what God will say; now in
            the company of a learned and wise man, I will draw some knowledge
            and counsel from him; I am under a temptation, now is a fit time to
            lean on the name of the Lord; I am in a place of dignity and power,
            let me consider what it is that God requireth of me in such a time
            as this. And thus as the tree of life bringeth fruit every month, so
            a wise Christian, as a wise husbandman, hath his distinct
            employments for every month, bringing forth his fruit in his
            season.—John Spencer's Things New and Old, 1658.
          </p>
          <p>
            "In his season." Oh, golden and admirable word! by which is asserted
            the liberty of Christian righteousness. The ungodly have their
            stated days, stated times, certain works, and certain places; to
            which they stick so closely, that if their neighbours were perishing
            with hunger, they could not be torn from them. But this blessed man,
            being free at all times, in all places, for every work, and to every
            person, will serve you whenever an opportunity is offered him;
            whatsoever comes into his hands to do, he does it. He is neither a
            Jew, nor a Gentile, nor a Greek, nor a barbarian, nor of any other
            particular person. He gives his fruit in his season, so often as
            either God or man requires his work. Therefore his fruits have no
            name, and his times have no name.—Martin Luther.
          </p>
          <p>
            "His leaf also shall not wither." He describes the fruit before he
            does the leaf. The Holy Spirit himself always teaches every faithful
            preacher in the church to know that the kingdom of God does not
            stand in word but in power. 1 Corinthians 4:20. Again, "Jesus began
            both to do and to teach." Acts 1:1. And again, "Which was a prophet
            mighty in deed and word." Luke 24:19. And thus, let him who
            professes the word of doctrine, first put forth the fruits of life,
            if he would not have his fruit to wither, for Christ cursed the fig
            tree which bore no fruit. And, as Gregory saith, that man whose life
            is despised is condemned by his doctrine, for he preaches to others,
            and is himself reprobated.—Martin Luther.
          </p>
          <p>
            "His leaf also shall not wither." The Lord's trees are all
            evergreens. No winter's cold can destroy their verdure; and yet,
            unlike evergreens in our country, they are all fruit bearers.—C. H.
            S.
          </p>
          <p>
            "And whatsoever he doeth, [or, maketh or taketh in hand] shall
            prosper." And with regard to this "prospering," take heed that thou
            understandest not a carnal prosperity. This prosperity is hidden
            prosperity, and lies entirely secret in spirit; and therefore if
            thou hast not this prosperity that is by faith, thou shouldest
            rather judge thy prosperity to be the greatest adversity. For as the
            devil bitterly hates this leaf and the word of God, so does he also
            those who teach and hear it, and he persecutes such, aided by all
            the powers of the world. Therefore thou hearest of a miracle the
            greatest of all miracles, when thou hearest that all things prosper
            which a blessed man doeth.—Martin Luther.
          </p>
          <p>
            A critical journal has shown that instead of "Whatsoever it doeth
            shall prosper," the rendering might be, "Whatsoever it produceth
            shall come to maturity." This makes the figure entire, and is
            sanctioned by some MSS. and ancient versions.

            Outward prosperity, if it follow close walking with God, is very
            sweet; as the cipher, when it follows a figure, adds to the number,
            though it be nothing in itself.—John Trapp.

            "Chaff." Here, by the way, we may let the wicked know they have a
            thanks to give they little think of; that they may thank the godly
            for all the good days they live upon the earth, seeing it is for
            their sakes and not for their own that they enjoy them. For as the
            chaff while it is united and keeps close to the wheat, enjoys some
            privileges for the wheat's sake, and is laid up carefully in the
            barn; but as soon as it is divided, and parted from the wheat, it is
            cast out and scattered by the wind; so the wicked, whilst the godly
            are in company and live amongst them, partake for their sake of some
            blessedness promised to the godly; but if the godly forsake them or
            be taken from them, then either a deluge of water comes suddenly
            upon them, as it did upon the old world when Noah left it; or a
            deluge of fire, as it did upon Sodom, when Lot left it, and went out
            of the city.—Sir Richard Baker.

            "Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment," etc. And
            may not a reason also be conceived thus, why the ungodly can never
            come to be of the congregation of the righteous: the righteous go a
            way that God knows, and the wicked go a way that God destroys; and
            seeing that these ways can never meet, how should the men meet that
            go these ways? And to make sure work that they shall never meet
            indeed, the prophet expresseth the way of the righteous by the first
            link of the chain of God's goodness, which is his knowledge; but
            expresseth the way of the wicked by the last link of God's justice,
            which is his destroying; and though God's justice and his mercy do
            often meet, and are contiguous one to another, yet the first link of
            his mercy and the last link of his justice can never meet, for it
            never comes to destroying till God be heard to say Nescio vos, "I
            know you not," and nescio vos in God, and God's knowledge, can
            certainly never possibly meet together.—Sir Richard Baker.

            and adversities. For this "way" of the righteous all men utterly
            reprobate; thinking also, that God knoweth nothing about any such
            way. But this is the wisdom of the cross. Therefore, it is God alone
            that knoweth the way of the righteous, so hidden is it to the
            righteous themselves. For his right hand leads them on in a
            wonderful manner, seeing that it is a way, not of sense, nor of
