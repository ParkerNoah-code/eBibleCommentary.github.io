        <h2>119:150-176</h2>
        <p>
          150. They draw near that follow after mischief: they are far from Your
          law. 151. You are near, O Lord: and all Your commandments are truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The imminent danger in which David was living quickened his cries to
          his God. Often does the Lord permit this pressing trial!, Seldom, but
          in extremity, are our graces brought to their full exercise.
          Confidence is then shaken from man, and established in God. For now it
          is that we enjoy our God as &quot;a very present help in
          trouble,&quot; and that our dependence on His commandment is a true
          and solid foundation of comfort to our soul. A dreadful character is
          indeed drawn of the ungodly—They are far from God&#x27;s law—and that
          not from ignorance, but from willful enmity. This is God&#x27;s
          witness against them; and they are not ashamed to consent, that this
          &quot;witness is true.&quot; No wonder, therefore, that those, that
          are far from God&#x27;s law, should draw near to follow after
          mischief. But if they draw near, the Lord is nearer still. &quot;I am
          your shield&quot;—says He to His distressed child—who echoes back the
          promise in the cheerfulness of faith, &quot;You are my hiding place,
          and my shield: I hope in Your word.&quot; Elisha knew the power of
          this shield, when he quelled the alarm of his terrified servant. He
          beheld them draw near that follow after mischief. But the eye of faith
          assured his heart; and when &quot;the Lord opened the eyes of the
          young man,&quot; he too was enabled to testify—You are near, O Lord!
        </p>
        <p>
          But near as the Lord is to His people as their outward shield, is He
          not yet nearer still, as dwelling in their hearts? Here is &quot;His
          temple,&quot; His desired habitation—like Zion of old, of which He
          said, &quot;This is my rest forever; here will I dwell, for I have
          desired it.&quot; This is the dwelling, which, once possessed of its
          Divine Inhabitant, will never be left desolate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our spiritual enemies, like David&#x27;s persecutors, are ever present
          and active. The devouring &quot;lion,&quot; or the insinuating
          &quot;serpent,&quot; is near to follow after mischief; and so much the
          more dangerous, as his approaches are invisible. Near also is a
          tempting, ensnaring world: and nearer still a lurking world within,
          separating us from communion with our God. But in turning habitually
          and immediately to our stronghold, we can enjoy the confidence—You are
          near, O Lord. Though &quot;the High and Lofty One, whose name is
          Holy;&quot; though the just and terrible God, yet are You made near to
          Your people, and they to You, &quot;by the blood of the cross.&quot;
          And You manifest Your presence to them in &quot;the Son of Your
          love.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed to the Son Himself, the nearness of His Father&#x27;s presence
          was a source of consolation and support, when they drew near, that
          followed after mischief. &quot;He is near&quot;—said he, &quot;which
          justifies Me: who will contend with Me? let us stand together. Who is
          my adversary? Let him come near to Me. Behold! the Lord God will help
          Me: who is he who shall condemn Me? Lo they all shall wax old as does
          a garment: the moth shall eat them up.&quot; &quot;Behold,&quot; said
          He to His affrighted disciples, as His hour drew near, &quot;the hour
          comes, yes is now come, that you shall be scattered everyone to his
          own, and shall leave Me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the
          Father is with Me.&quot; And thus His people in earthly desolation
          flee to the promises of their God; and in the recollection of His
          faithful, ever-present help, &quot;set to their seal,&quot; that all
          His commandments are truth. The mischief intended for them only
          proves, that &quot;You, Lord, will bless the righteous; with favor
          will You compass him as with a shield.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But may the Lord not only be brought near in our interest in Him, but
          may we be kept near in communion with Him! Let our hearts be sacred to
          Him. Let us be most careful to watch against any strangeness with this
          beloved Friend, and to cultivate a growing cordiality and closeness in
          our walk with Him. If our character is formed by the society in which
          we live, what &quot;treasures of wisdom and knowledge&quot; should we
          find, what a spirit of unbounded love should we imbibe—by a nearer and
          more constant communion with Him; willing as He is to impart Himself
          freely, inexhaustibly unto us! In a backsliding state, we must expect
          to lose this heavenly nearness. In a state of darkness, it is the
          exercise of faith, to believe that unseen He is near; and the
          practical influence of faith will lead us to speak, and pray, and
          think, and praise, &quot;as seeing Him who is invisible.&quot; In a
          state of enjoyment, let us anticipate the time when He will be ever
          near to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold! the
          tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they
          shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their
          God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          152. Concerning Your testimonies, I have known of old, that You have
          founded them forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;truth of the commandments,&quot; which the Psalmist had just
          asserted, was an everlasting foundation. He stated it not upon slight
          conviction. But he knew it—and that not recently—but as the result of
          early consideration—he had known it of old. It is most important to
          have a full certainty of the ground of our faith. How else can we have
          that &quot;good thing—a heart established with grace?&quot;—how
          &quot;continue in the faith grounded and settled?&quot;—how be kept
          from being &quot;moved away from the hope of the gospel?&quot; Praised
          be God! We feel our ground to be firm. As God is the same, so must His
          testimonies be. We cannot conceive of His promising without
          performance, or threatening without effect. They are therefore
          expressly revealed as a firm foundation, in express contrast with this
          world&#x27;s fairest promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us mark this eternal basis of the testimonies. The whole plan
          of redemption was emphatically founded forever. The Savior &quot;was
          foreordained before the foundation of the world.&quot; The people of
          God are &quot;chosen in Christ before the world began!&quot; The great
          Author &quot;declares the end from the beginning,&quot; and thus
          clears His dispensations from any charge of mutability or contingency.
          Every event in the church is fixed, permitted, and provided for—not in
          the passing moment of time, but in the counsels of eternity. All
          God&#x27;s faithful engagements with His people of old are founded
          forever upon the oath and promise of God—the two &quot;immutable
          things, in which it is impossible for God to lie.&quot; May we not
          then &quot;have strong consolation&quot; in venturing every hope for
          eternity upon this rock? nor need we be dismayed to see all our
          earthly stays, &quot;the world, and the lust, and the fashion of
          it—passing away&quot; before us. Yet we are most of us strangely
          attached to this fleeting scene, even when experience and Divine
          teaching have instructed us in its vanity and it is not until repeated
          proofs of this truth have touched us very closely in the destruction
          of our dearest consolations, that we take the full comfort of the
          enduring foundation of God&#x27;s testimonies, and of the imperishable
          character of their treasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let me realize the special support of this view in a dying hour:
          &#x27;I am on the borders of an unknown world; but &quot;my hope makes
          not ashamed&quot; at the moment of peril it is as &quot;an anchor of
          the soul, sure and steadfast;&quot; and in the strength of it I do not
          fear to plunge into eternity. &quot;I know whom I have believed, and
          am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed to
          Him against that day.&quot; I know—not His sufficiency merely, but His
          All-sufficiency. I know His conquering power over the great enemies of
          my soul. I know that He has &quot;spoiled the principalities and
          powers&quot; of hell, of the strength to triumph over His ransomed
          people. I know also, that He is &quot;the Lord; He changes not;&quot;
          His word changes not; His testimonies abide the same: I have known of
          old, that He has founded them forever.&#x27; Thus we look for the
          removing of those &quot;things which are shaken, as of things that are
          made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.&quot; The
          scoffer may say, &quot;If the foundations be destroyed, what can the
          righteous do?&quot;—Let God Himself give the answer, &quot;Lift up
          your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the
          heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like
          a garment, and those who dwell therein shall die in like manner; but
          my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be
          abolished.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          153. Consider my affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget Your
          law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another note of the child of sorrow! Hated by the world—vexed by his
          restless enemy—chastened by his God—burdened with his &quot;body of
          death&quot;—what else can he do but cry—Consider my affliction! How
          manifestly is this world, not our rest, but our exercise for rest!
          Well is it that our &quot;days are few,&quot; when they are so
          &quot;evil.&quot; But how could we hold on as we do, had we not our
          Savior&#x27;s pitying heart and Almighty help? The want of this
          sympathy was the overwhelming sorrow, that well-near &quot;broke
          His&quot; sorrowing &quot;heart&quot; &quot;I looked for some to take
          pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.&quot;
          This depth of trial combined with every other part of His unknown
          sufferings to make Him &quot;such an High Priest as became us,&quot;
          &quot;touched with the feeling of our infirmities&quot;; considering
          our afflictions: and, &quot;in that He Himself has suffered being
          tempted, able to support them that are tempted.&quot; With what
          sympathy did He consider the affliction of His people in Egypt!,
          &quot;I have surely seen the affliction of My people which are; in
          Egypt, and I know their sorrows.&quot; At a subsequent period,
          &quot;his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel&quot;—a cheering
          example of that compassionate interest, with which &quot;in all His
          people&#x27;s afflictions He is afflicted.&quot; Well may His people
          take encouragement to pray, Consider my affliction. &quot;Now,
          therefore, let not all the trouble seem little before You, that has
          come upon us.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet is He not only sympathizing to consider, but mighty to deliver.
          &quot;Who is this glorious&quot; conqueror with His &quot;dyed
          garments&quot; of victory, &quot;traveling in the greatness of His
          strength? I that speak in righteousness—mighty to save.&quot; Such did
          the noble confessors in Babylon—such did Daniel in the den of
          lions—find Him, fully justifying their unwavering confidence in His
          love and power. And what age of the Church has been wanting in
          testimony, that &quot;the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of
          temptations,&quot; and that &quot;He who has delivered, does deliver,
          and will even to the end deliver?&quot; The consciousness that we do
          not forget His law, is our plea, that He would consider our
          affliction, and deliver us; and is of itself an evidence, that the
          affliction has performed its appointed work. Let me then expect in my
          affliction the fulfillment of His gracious promise, &quot;Because he
          has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him
          on high, because he has known My name. He shall call upon Me, and
          &quot;I will deliver him: I will be with him in trouble; I will
          deliver him, and honor him.&quot; In the midst of my trials I would
          prepare my hymn of praise for His kind consideration and faithful
          deliverance, &quot;I will be glad and rejoice in Your mercy: for You
          have considered my trouble; You have known my soul in adversities, and
          have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet
          in a large room!&quot; Let me then remember my affliction, only as it
          may be the means of increasing my acquaintance with my tender and
          Almighty friend. Poor and afflicted as I may be, let me be more poor
          and afflicted still, if I may but have fresh evidence that He
          &quot;thinks upon me&quot;—that He considers my affliction, and in His
          own gracious time and way will deliver me.
        </p>
        <p>
          154. Plead my cause, and deliver me; quicken me according to Your
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oppressed as the Psalmist appeared to be by the weight of his
          affliction, he is at no loss where to apply for help. He carries his
          righteous cause to Him, who &quot;stills the enemy and the
          avenger&quot; &quot;Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with
          me: fight against them that fight against me. Take hold of shield and
          shield, and stand up for my help. Draw out also the spear, and stop
          the way against them that persecute me; say unto my soul, I am Your
          salvation.&quot; Thus must we throughout our warfare maintain
          &quot;the patience of hope,&quot; waiting for the Lord, &quot;until He
          plead our cause, and execute judgment for us.&quot; If there is an
          accuser to resist, &quot;we have an advocate&quot; to plead, who could
          testify of His prevailing acceptance in the court of heaven,
          &quot;Father, I thank You, that You have heard Me. And I knew that You
          hear Me always.&quot; Our Redeemer does indeed plead our cause
          successfully for our deliverance; when but for His powerful advocacy
          we must have stood speechless in the judgment—helpless, without any
          prospect of acceptance. Awful indeed was the cause which He had to
          manage. Our adversary had the law on his side. We could not deny the
          charge, or offer satisfaction. We could neither &quot;stand in the
          judgment,&quot; nor flee from the impending wrath. But at that moment
          of infinite peril, our cause was pleaded by a &quot;Counselor,&quot;
          who never was nonsuited in court, who brought irresistible pleas, and
          produced satisfaction that could not be denied. The voice of
          deliverance was heard in heaven, &quot;Deliver them from going down to
          the pit: I have found a ransom.&quot; This ransom is no less than the
          price of His own &quot;precious blood,&quot; &quot;shed for many for
          the remission of sins,&quot; a ransom, which has merited and obtained
          eternal deliverance for His people, and which still pleads for the
          expiation of the guilt, which attaches to their holiest services, and
          defiles their happiest approaches to their God. When therefore Satan
          accuses me: yes, when my own heart condemns me, I may look upward to
          my heavenly Advocate—Plead my cause, and deliver me. &quot;O Lord, I
          am oppressed; undertake for me. You will answer, O Lord, my God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Poor trembling sinner! take courage. &quot;Your Redeemer is strong—He
          will thoroughly plead your cause,&quot; and leave no charge
          unanswered. But you say &#x27;How know I that He speaks for me?&#x27;
          Yet if not for you, for whom does He speak? Who needs an advocate more
          than you? He pleads indeed nothing favorable of you; but much, very
          much for you. For He pleads the merit of His own blood, &quot;that
          takes away the sin of the world&quot;—even that great sin of
          &quot;unbelief,&quot; of which His Spirit is now
          &quot;convincing&quot; you; and which you are now made to feel,
          lament, and resist, as the bitterest foe to your peace. And does He
          not &quot;ever live to make intercession for you?&quot; Why then
          hesitate to apply the certain and consoling inference, that &quot;he
          is able to save to the uttermost?&quot; Why discouraged by the sight
          of sin, temptation; backsliding, difficulty, and fear, arising before
          you on every side; when after you have taken the most extended view of
          the prospect o f sorrow, this one word &quot;uttermost&quot; goes
          beyond it? If you feel it hard to believe, send up your cry,
          &quot;Help my unbelief.&quot; Only do not dishonor Him by willful
          despondency; and do not add the sin of disobedience, in delaying this
          moment to come to Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, however, even while exercising faith in our heavenly
          Advocate, we must mourn over our sluggishness in His service. Well,
          therefore, do we accompany our pleading for deliverance with the
          supplication—Quicken me! Every moment&#x27;s perseverance depends upon
          this Divine supply. Blessed be God for the sure warrant of
          expectation—According to Your word! Here we shall receive not only the
          living principle, but its lively operation; not only the fire to
          kindle the lamp, but the oil to feed the flame. For He who is our
          Advocate to plead for us, and our Savior to deliver us, is also our
          quickening Head, filled with &quot;the residue of the Spirit&quot; to
          &quot;revive His work.&quot; &quot;You have ascended on high, and have
          received gifts for men: yes, for the rebellious also, that the Lord
          God might dwell among them.&quot; Do we therefore want a heart to
          pray, to praise, to believe, to love? Let us only look to an ascended
          Savior, sending down the life-giving influence from above, as the
          purchase of His blood, and the fruit of His intercession. Thus will
          our hope be enlivened, our faith established, and the graces of the
          Spirit will abound to the glory of our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          155. Salvation is far from the wicked; for they seek not Your
          statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          How striking the contrast!—how awfully destitute the condition! They
          have no one to consider their affliction—no one to deliver them—no one
          to plead their cause. Indeed, all the misery that an immortal soul is
          capable of enduring throughout eternity is included in this
          sentence—Salvation is far from the wicked. The full picture of it is
          drawn by our Lord Himself, &quot;The rich man died, and was buried;
          and in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Abraham
          afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.&quot; The present enjoyment of
          salvation is far from the wicked. &quot;There is no peace, says my
          God, to the wicked.&quot; Their common employments are
          &quot;sin.&quot; Their &quot;sacrifice is an abomination.&quot; Their
          life is &quot;without Christ, having no hope, and without God in the
          world.&quot; But who can tell the curse of eternity, with this
          salvation far from them? To be eternally shut out from God—from
          heaven! To be eternally shut in with the enemies of God, and the heirs
          of hell! Fellow-Christians—look from what you have escaped—what you
          were, when &quot;you were sometimes afar off,&quot;—what you would
          have been now and forever, had you not &quot;in Christ Jesus been made
          near by the blood of Christ:&quot; and then &quot;if you hold your
          peace, the stones will immediately cry out&quot; against you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But whence this inexpressibly awful condition of the wicked? Is not
          salvation offered to them? Are they shut out from hope, and sternly
          refused an interest in the covenant? Oh! no! it is their own doing, or
          rather their own undoing. Would they but seek the ways of God, they
          might plead for deliverance; yes, they might have a prevailing
          Advocate to plead their cause, and deliver them. But now salvation is
          far from them, because &quot;they are far from God&#x27;s law.&quot;
          It does not fly from them; but they fly from it. Every act is a stride
          of mind, more or less vigorous in departure from God. No—such is their
          pride, that &quot;they will not even seek His statutes.&quot; They
          &quot;desire not the knowledge of His ways.&quot; They say to God,
          &quot;Depart from us;&quot; God, therefore, will say to them,
          &quot;Depart from me.&quot; They say to Christ, &quot;We will not have
          this man to reign over us;&quot; He will say of them, &quot;Those My
          enemies, that would not I should reign over them, bring here, and slay
          them before me.&quot; It is not then so much God that punishes them,
          as those who punish themselves. Their own sin—the necessity of the
          case—punishes them. They &quot;will not come to Christ, that they
          might have life:&quot; &quot;so that they are without excuse&quot;—die
          they must.
        </p>
        <p>
          But who are the wicked? Alas! this is a melancholy question, as
          involving within its sphere so much that passes for amiable, virtuous,
          and lovely, in the estimation of the world. Not to speak of those,
          whose name is broadly written upon their foreheads; it includes
          &quot;all that forget God,&quot; however blameless their moral
          character, or their external Christian profession. It is determined
          upon immutable authority—it is the decree of our eternal Judge,
          &quot;If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of
          His;&quot; and if none of His, then it follows in unavoidable
          consequence, that salvation is far from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! could we but persuade such of their awful state. Oh! could we
          awake them from their death-like, deadly sleep—slumbering on the brink
          of ruin! on the borders of hell! But they are closed up in their own
          self-esteem, or in the favorable comparison drawn between themselves
          and many around them; forgetting that the rule, by which they will be
          judged, is not the world&#x27;s standard of moral rectitude, but the
          statutes of a holy, heart-searching God; forgetting too, that all may
          be decency without, while all is corruption within. Let them test
          their hearts by an honest and prayerful scrutiny of the statutes; and
          while they must confess themselves guilty before God, a sense of
          danger would awaken the hearty cry for salvation which would not then
          be far from them. For &quot;the Lord is near unto all them that call
          upon Him, to all that call upon Him in truth. He will fulfill the
          desire of them that fear Him; He also will hear their cry, and—will
          save them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          O You Almighty Spirit, whose power is alone able to &quot;turn the
          hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just,&quot; &quot;raise
          up Your power, and come among us;&quot; &quot;rend the heavens, and
          come down;&quot; rend the hearts of sinners, of the ungodly, the
          moral, the naturally amiable, the self-righteous. &quot;Fill their
          faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O Lord.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          156. Great are Your tender mercies, O Lord; quicken me according to
          Your judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is most cheering to pass from judgment to mercy—from the awful
          state of the wicked, to adore the mercies of God to His own people. We
          were naturally no better than they. The most eminent saved sinner
          looks on himself with wonder, &quot;Is not this a brand plucked out of
          the fire?&quot; Never will he lose the remembrance, &quot;Who makes
          you to differ?&quot; To mercy—rich mercy alone—we trace the
          distinction between those that are &quot;quickened,&quot; and those
          that remain &quot;dead in trespasses and sins.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us mark the features of this mercy. How great in extent!
          Estimate its greatness by the infinite debt which it blots out—the
          eternal ruin from which it saves—the heavenly crown to which it
          raises. Trace it to the mind of God—that first eternal purpose of
          mercy, which set us apart for His glory. Mark it in that &quot;time of
          love,&quot; when His mercy rescued us from Satan, sin, death, and
          hell, and drew us to Himself. As soon might we span the arch of
          heaven, as fully grasp the greatness of His mercy. And then how tender
          is it in its exercise! Such was the first beam of mercy that
          &quot;visited us.&quot; Such has been the continued display. So
          natural, as from a Father. So yearning, &quot;as one whom his mother
          comforts!&quot; Such a multitude of those tender mercies! The
          overflowing stream follows us through every step of our wilderness
          journey. The blessing &quot;compasses us about,&quot; abounds towards
          us, keeps us steadfast, or restores us when wandering, and will
          preserve us to the end. Happy are we—not in the general perception—not
          in the hearsay report—but in the experimental enjoyment of it.
          &quot;Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His
          holy name.&quot; But what poor returns have we made for this infinite
          love! Surely the petition for quickening grace suits us well. This was
          the constant burden of David&#x27;s prayer. For he was not like many
          professors, who can maintain their assurance in a lower and careless
          walk. No, he was a believer of a very high standard; desirous not only
          of proving his title to the blessing, but of living in its habitual
          and active enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often as this petition has been brought before us, in the course of
          this Psalm, it is too important ever to be passed over. Let us at this
          time use it for the purpose of individual self-inquiry. In what
          respects do I need quickening grace? Are my views of sin, and
          especially of the sin of my own heart, slight and superficial? Do they
          fail in producing humility, abasement, tenderness of conscience,
          circumspection of conduct? If it be so—Quicken me, O my God! Does my
          apprehension of a Savior&#x27;s love serve to embitter sin to me? to
          crucify sin in me, to warm and enliven my heart with love to Him, and
          zeal in His service? If I am convicted of coldness to such a Savior,
          and sluggishness in such a service, I need to pray—O Lord, quicken me!
          And how do I find it with regard to prayer itself? Are not my prayers
          general—unfrequent—wandering? Is not my service too often constrained,
          a forced duty, rather than a privilege and delight? O Lord, quicken
          me!
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet many Christians, through a mistaken perception, know not when they
          have received the blessing. They have looked for it in strong and
          sensible excitement; and in defect of this they sink into despondency.
          Whereas the solid influence is independent of sensations, and consists
          in a tender sensibility of sin, a spiritual appetite for the gospel,
          active energy in Christian duties, and continual progress in heavenly
          exercises. But under no circumstances must the evil of a dead and
          drooping state be lightly thought of; obscuring as it does the
          difference between the believer and the worldling, or rather between
          the believer and the formalist. O believer, you have great need to
          carry your complaint again and again unto the Lord! &#x27;Quicken
          me—quicken me—according to Your judgments—according to those gracious
          promises, which are the method of Your proceedings, and the rule of
          Your dispensations of grace.&#x27; You cannot be too earnest to
          welcome the breathings of the Spirit, or too cautious, that your
          indolence resists not His Divine impression. When He quickens you with
          His influence, do you quicken Him with your supplications,
          &quot;Awake, O north wind; and come, you south: blow upon my garden,
          that the spices thereof may flow out.&quot; Persuade—entreat—constrain
          His stay. Enlivened by His energy, how happy, and in your own sphere
          how useful, a member of the Church of Christ you may be found! Your
          soul will be invigorated—your graces strengthened—and your affections
          elevated—in humble, cheerful, steady dependence upon the Savior, and
          in daily renewed devotedness to His service. The more the spiritual
          life is thus &quot;exercised unto godliness, the more delightfully
          will you realize the active service and everlasting praise, which will
          constitute the perfection of heavenly enjoyment.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          157. Many are my persecutors and my enemies; yet do I not decline from
          Your testimonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          David&#x27;s experience is common to us all. Many, indeed, are our
          persecutors and enemies. This is a solemn cost. Let those who are
          setting out in the Christian course count it well. From neglect of our
          Lord&#x27;s rule of Scriptural calculation, many seem to begin well;
          but they have been &quot;hindered&quot;—they turn back; they are
          zealous but inconsiderate; warmhearted, but ignorant of themselves,
          their work, and their resources. They were allured at first, perhaps,
          by an interest in the Gospel—some delusive excitement of love to the
          Savior—the picture of the paths of &quot;pleasantness and peace,&quot;
          or the joys of heaven. The cross was out of sight, and out of mind.
          But this promise of ease and happiness was no less foolish and
          unwarrantable, than that of a soldier, utterly forgetful of his
          profession, and who should promise himself peace at the very time that
          he was called out to the wars. Surely, if like God&#x27;s ancient
          people, we begin our road in sunshine, it is well to be provided
          against the storms, which will soon overtake us. We would say
          therefore to all—specially to sanguine beginners—Let your course be
          commenced with serious consideration, and zealous self-scrutiny.
          Beware of hasty determinations. See to it, that your resources are
          drawn, not from your own resolutions, or from the sincerity and ardor
          of your love; but from the fullness that is treasured up in Jesus for
          your present distress. Feel every step of your way by the light of the
          sacred word. If you expect Christian consistency to command the esteem
          of an ungodly world, you have forgotten both your Master&#x27;s word
          and example; and you will soon be ready to exclaim—Many are my
          persecutors, and my enemies. For if their hostility is not always
          active, the enmity &quot;is not dead, but sleeps.&quot; If, however,
          their unexpected surprisals and inveteracy should daunt you in the
          conflict, you are again forgetting the word of cheering support in the
          most awful crisis, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you; for My
          strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot; Thus the word of God will
          be &quot;the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the
          left.&quot; Presumption is cast down, self-confidence is humbled, and
          the trembling simplicity of dependence upon an Almighty arm is upheld
          and honored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Count then upon the difficulties that beset the heavenly path. You
          will never pluck the Rose of Sharon, if you are afraid of being
          pierced by the thorns which surround it. You will never reach the
          crown, if you flinch from the cross in the way to it. Oh! think of the
          honor of bearing this cross. It is conformity to the Son of God. Let
          the mind be deeply imbued with the remembrance of his daily cross of
          suffering and reproach; and we shall gladly &quot;go forth without the
          camp, bearing His reproach,&quot; yes—even &quot;rejoicing, if we are
          counted worthy to suffer shame&quot; with Him and for Him. Indeed,
          what is our love, if we will not take up a cross for Him? How can we
          be His followers, without His cross? How can we be Christians, if we
          are not confessors of Christ before a world that despises His Gospel?
        </p>
        <p>
          But a steady, consistent profession is no matter of course. The crown
          is not easily won. Many are our persecutors, and our enemies.
          Persecution, to the false professor, is an occasion of apostasy; to
          the faithful servant of Christ, it is the trial of his faith, the
          source of his richest consolations, the guard of his profession, and
          the strength of his perseverance. It drives him to his God. He casts
          himself upon his Savior for immediate refuge and support; and the
          quickening influence, which he had just been seeking, enables him to
          say—Yet do I not decline from Your testimonies. Thus did the great
          Apostle, at the time, when his persecutors were many, and human help
          even from his friends had failed him, maintain an unshaken confidence
          in the service of his God, &quot;At my first answer&quot;—he tells us,
          &quot;no man stood with me, but all men forsook me. Notwithstanding,
          the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me.&quot; David himself often
          acknowledged the same principle of perseverance under similar trials,
          &quot;Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! Many are those who
          rise up against me. Many there be, which say of my soul, There is no
          help for him in God. But You, O Lord, are a shield for me; my glory,
          and the lifter-up of my head. O God the Lord, the strength of my
          salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But have we never taken a devious path in declining from the
          Lord&#x27;s testimonies, to escape the appointed cross? Do we never
          shrink from &quot;the voice of him that reproaches&quot; and
          blasphemes, by reason of the enemy and the avenger? Can we always in
          the integrity of our heart appeal to an Omniscient God, &quot;All this
          is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten You, neither have we dealt
          falsely in Your covenant; our heart is not turned back, neither have
          our steps declined from Your way: though You have sore broken us in
          the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death?&quot;
          This profession is not the foolish confidence of boasting; but the
          fulfillment of the covenant promise, &quot;I will put My fear in their
          hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.&quot; So beautifully does
          the promise of perseverance connect itself with the duty of
          persevering! And so clearly in this, as in every other way, does the
          &quot;wrath of man&quot; (&quot;howbeit he means not so, neither does
          his heart think so&quot;) &quot;praise God.&quot; How glorious is the
          display of the power of His grace in the constancy of His people! like
          the rocks in the ocean, immoveable amid the fury of the waves; like
          the trees of the forest, &quot;rooted and established&quot; by every
          shaking of the tempest! Must not the world, in witnessing the total
          defeat of their enmity against the Lord&#x27;s people (or rather its
          eventual results in their increased prosperity), be constrained to
          confess to the honor of God, &quot;Surely there is no enchantment
          against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel:
          according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel—What
          has God wrought!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          158. I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
          not Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall not tire in listening to this repeated expression of the
          Psalmist&#x27;s tenderness for the honor of God. No trouble from his
          many persecutors and enemies came so near to his heart, as the sight
          of the dishonor and contempt of God&#x27;s word. The glory of God was
          dearer to him than life. O that every recollection of this tried
          servant of God might deepen the special mark of acceptance upon our
          too cold and indifferent hearts! Our joys and sorrows are the pulse of
          the soul. A fellowship with the joys of angels over repenting sinners
          will be accompanied with bitterness of godly sorrow over the hardness
          and impenitency of those, who keep not the word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even here we need much and earnest prayer, in order to obtain a
          clear perception of our real principles. Sin is so subtle in its
          nature and workings that it insinuates itself into our holiest
          desires, and often so far interweaves itself into the graces of the
          Spirit, as greatly to mar their beauty, and obstruct their operations.
          How often is zeal for the honor of God mingled with the unhallowed
          fire of our own spirit! True zeal is indeed a precious fruit of the
          Spirit. Its other name is love—active, self-denying, compassionate
          love for sinners. &#x27;Let me never fancy I have zeal&#x27;—said a
          Christian of a very high order—&#x27;until my heart overflows with
          love to every man living.&#x27; If then we are really under its holy
          influence, we shall lose no opportunity of active exertions on behalf
          of wretched transgressors: and the limits of our zeal will be only the
          limits of a fallen world. Especially within our own sphere shall we
          employ all our labors and pains to stem the tide of unrighteousness,
          &quot;saying unto the fools—deal not foolishly—How long, you simple
          ones, will you love simplicity? Turn, turn, why will you die?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the fervency of zeal will express itself in something more
          difficult than personal service. We can often warn and plead with
          transgressors, when we are sinfully backward in sending up sighs and
          cries on their behalf; and in presenting these poor lepers by faith to
          that great and good Physician, whose &quot;power present to heal&quot;
          has been so abundantly manifested. This is indeed zeal of rare
          attainment through our own unbelief. But it brings its own rich
          blessing to the soul; because it is the zeal of the compassionate
          Jesus; who, though He looked round on sinners with anger, &quot;being
          grieved for the hardness of their hearts,&quot; did not forget to
          plead on their behalf, &quot;Father, forgive them; for they know not
          what they do.&quot; It was the zeal and love of Him, who so identified
          His Father&#x27;s interest with His own, that He endured the
          reproaches cast upon Him in His bosom. And should not the members
          feel, when the Head is wounded? Should not we consider every dishonor
          done to Jesus as a shaft piercing our own bosom? Can we bear to behold
          all around us united in a conspiracy against the honor, and—if it were
          possible—against the life, of our dearest friend and benefactor, and
          not be painfully grieved? Yet genuine grief must begin with our own
          heart, &quot;all of us mourning, everyone for his iniquity.&quot; The
          wickedness of others will stir up the conviction within our own
          conscience, &quot;I do remember my faults this day.&quot; And when
          once we begin the enumeration, where shall we end? Who can understand
          his errors? Cleanse me from secret faults. Enter not into judgment
          with Your servant.&quot;

          159. Consider how I love Your precepts; quicken me, O Lord, according
          to Your loving-kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Love for the precepts, such as this Psalm describes, is a
          distinguishing characteristic of a child of God. The transgressors
          neither love the precepts, nor desire quickening grace to keep them.
          For though &quot;not grievous&quot; in themselves, they are too
          strict, too humbling for the unrenewed, proud, worldly heart. Love
          therefore to them—not being the growth of the natural man—must be
          &quot;a plant which our heavenly Father has planted,&quot; a witness
          of the Spirit of adoption, and the principle of Christian devotedness.
          And how encouraging is the recollection of the Lord&#x27;s readiness
          to consider how we love His precepts! &quot;I know Abraham, that he
          will command his children and his household after him, and they shall
          keep the way of the Lord, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that
          which He has spoken of him.&quot; Thus also did He challenge &quot;the
          accuser of the brethren,&quot; to &quot;consider His servant Job that
          there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
          that fears God, and eschews evil.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But while love of the precepts realizes the full confidence of the
          Lord&#x27;s consideration, the consciousness of its imperfection and
          scanty measure will always prevent us from urging it as the ground of
          acceptance. Christian! you know not—or at least you allow not—the
          proud boast, &quot;God, I thank You, that I am not as other men
          are.&quot; No, rather—your constant cry to the end is—Quicken me. Your
          plea is not merit, but mercy. Not that you deserve to be
          helped—because you love the precepts: but you desire and trust to be
          helped—according to Your loving-kindness. And what must be the
          loving-kindness of a God of infinite love! Only do not sit still, and
          wait for the breezes of His love. Rather call to the &quot;north wind
          to awake, and to the south wind to blow,&quot; to fill your sails, and
          urge you on. God—His word, His works, His perfections, His holiness;
          Jesus—His pity, His love, His grace—is your delight, your chief
          delight; yet how infinitely is it below the scriptural standard of
          privilege, attainment, and expectation!
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the painful influence of straitened desires and heartless
          affections, how refreshing is it to mark the springs of life flowing
          from the loving-kindness of the Lord! Yes, indeed—He is the
          overflowing spring of His church. Every mercy is His grace. Every holy
          suggestion is His influence. Even the passing thought that our
          Christian progress proceeds from our own resources, opens the door of
          fearful departure from God. And yet such is the self-deceitfulness of
          the heart, that, in the very act of professing to &quot;rejoice in
          Christ Jesus,&quot; the Omniscient eye traces a &quot;confidence in
          the flesh.&quot; The real dependence is on the &quot;mountain that
          stands strong,&quot; not on &quot;the favor that makes&quot; it so.
          Even our first father, in his original unimpaired strength, could
          &quot;not quicken his own soul.&quot; Can we wonder that the fallen
          nature, even though partially upheld by Divine power, is changeable
          and unstable? The most advanced Christian needs the supply to the end,
          as much as he did in his first stage of infantile weakness. And will
          he not continue to need it throughout eternity, in every exercise of
          adoring service, as well as for his active existence?
        </p>
        <p>
          But when we ask for this quickening, are we expecting, as we ought to
          be, a large answer to our prayer? Or are we &quot;limiting&quot; our
          God, by the scanty apprehensions of our poor faith? Remember He is
          glorified—not in possessing, but in dispensing His gifts. If we really
          expect His blessing, can we be satisfied without it? It is not our
          unworthiness, but our unbelief, that stops the current. Would that we
          gave Him full credit for His exuberant flow of free, rich, ceaseless
          mercy!
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed Jesus! we plead Your promise to be filled. We have life from
          You; but give it us &quot;more abundantly&quot;—as much as these
          houses of clay—as much as these earthen vessels—can contain. Our taste
          of Your love, and our knowledge of its unbounded fullness, encourage
          our plea to ask You still for more—Quicken us according to Your
          loving-kindness. Often as the Psalmist had repeated this prayer for
          quickening grace, it was not a &quot;vain repetition.&quot; Each time
          was it enlivened with faith, feeling of necessity, and ardent
          affection: and should we, in the consciousness of our weakness and
          coldness, offer it a hundred times a-day, it would never fail of
          acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          160. Your word is true from the beginning: and everyone of Your
          righteous judgments endures forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;loving-kindness and the truth of God&quot; were two heavenly
          notes, on which &quot;the sweet Psalmist of Israel&quot; loved to
          dwell—His &quot;loving-kindness&quot; in giving, and His
          &quot;truth&quot; in fulfilling—His gracious promises. Indeed the
          displays of His truth—whether to His Church collectively, or to His
          people individually—have always been every way worthy of Himself.
          Often has His word seemed on the eve of being falsified, clearly with
          the design of a brighter and more striking display of its
          faithfulness. The very night previous to the close of the four hundred
          and thirty years, Israel was, to all human appearances, as far from
          deliverance as at any former period. But &quot;the vision was for an
          appointed time:&quot; nothing could hasten, nothing could delay it;
          for &quot;it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
          years, even the self-same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of
          the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.&quot; At a subsequent
          period, the family of David appeared upon the point of extinction; and
          it seemed as if the promise of God would fall to the ground. But to
          exhibit the word of God, as true from the beginning, a providential,
          and almost a miraculous, interference was manifested. When Athaliah
          destroyed all the seed-royal of the house of Judah, Joash was stolen
          away, put under a nurse, hid in the house of the Lord six years, and
          in God&#x27;s appointed time brought forth to the people as the
          fulfillment of the express promise of God, &quot;Behold! the
          king&#x27;s son shall reign, as the Lord had said of the sons of
          David.&quot; &quot;Whoever is wise, and will observe these things,
          even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus have many of His own people been tempted in seasons of
          despondency to &quot;charge God foolishly.&quot; But who of them has
          not afterwards, in some unexpected deliverance, &quot;set to his
          seal&quot;—Your word is true from the beginning? &quot;The Lord shall
          judge His people, and repent Himself for His servants, when He sees
          that their power is gone, and there is none shut up or left.&quot; And
          how do these recollections put to shame the suggestions of unbelief,
          and strengthen our confidence in the prospect, or even in the present
          endurance, of &quot;manifold temptations!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The full acknowledgment of the truths of God&#x27;s word is the ground
          of all our peace and comfort. The believing reception of the testimony
          opens to us a free access to God. We stand before Him self-condemned,
          and yet we believe that &quot;there is no condemnation.&quot;
          &quot;The Spirit bears witness&quot; to and &quot;with our
          spirits,&quot; that &quot;this God is our God forever and ever&quot;
          &quot;unto death,&quot; in death, and through eternity. In this
          simplicity of rest upon the testimony, we go to our God, like Abraham,
          in sensible helplessness, but in assured confidence, &quot;strong in
          faith, giving glory to God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Many, however, have been so used to indulge the pride of their own
          reasonings, that they scarcely know how to read the Book of God
          without caviling. If they believe while it is in their hands, they are
          not prepared to give a reason of their faith. They have ventured into
          conflict with the enemy with unproved armor, and so have been shaken
          and troubled. Or perhaps their faith does not reach the whole
          testimony: and therefore, being partial only it is not genuine. For if
          we do not give full credence to all, we do not give true credence to
          any. We do not receive it on the authority of God, but only so far as
          our reasoning can explain it, or our will may approve it. What need
          then have we to pray for a teachable simplicity of faith—not
          asking—&#x27;What think you?&#x27; but, &quot;How read you?&quot; In
          this spirit we shall hold our anchor on solid ground; and should we
          again be &quot;tossed with the tempest,&quot; we shall look to Him,
          who stills the storm, and there shall be &quot;a great calm.&quot;
          Confidence simply built upon the word of God, will endure the storms
          of earth and hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet we may loosely believe all, while we practically believe none. The
          generalities of truth have no influence without an individual
          application. The summary look of acquiescence will miss all the solid
          blessings of a reverential and experimental faith. But to find—as the
          woman of Samaria found—that &#x27;it is all true,&#x27;—because it
          answers to our convictions, our wants, and our feelings to know that
          the promises are true, because they have been fulfilled in us—this is
          tasting, feeling, handling—this is indeed blessedness—this makes the
          word unspeakably precious to us, &quot;a treasure to be desired.&quot;
          To have the witness in ourselves that &quot;we have not followed
          cunningly devised fables,&quot; but that it is &quot;a faithful
          saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the
          world to save sinners&quot;—this is indeed &quot;life from the
          dead.&quot; Oh! how should we seek thus to receive the word &quot;with
          much assurance!&quot; The Israelites were not satisfied with inquiring
          respecting the manna, &quot;What is this?&quot; or with discovering
          that it had descended from heaven; but they gathered it each for
          himself, and fed upon it as their daily bread. Nor will it be of any
          avail to us to prove beyond contradiction, and to acknowledge with the
          fullest assurance, the truth of God&#x27;s word, unless we thus
          embrace it, and live upon it as our heavenly portion. Faith alone can
          give this spiritual apprehension, &quot;He who believes, has the
          witness in himself.&quot; But if the word be the truth of God from the
          beginning, it must be eternal truth in its character and its results;
          like its Great Author in every particular—enduring forever.
          &quot;Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven; Your
          faithfulness is unto all generations.&quot; Here is the rock of my
          confidence. How could I rest my hope on any salvation, that did not
          proceed from the primary, unchangeable, eternal mind? What assurance
          could I have elsewhere, that the grand plan might not be defeated by
          some unexpected combination? Whereas every act of reliance in His
          faithfulness establishes more firmly His title to my confidence, and
          strengthens the soul into a habit of intelligent, vigorous faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord! give unto us that &quot;precious faith,&quot; which makes the
          acknowledgment of the truth of Your word from the beginning, and its
          endurance forever, the spring of continual life and consolation to our
          souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          161. Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart stands
          in awe of Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          So contrary are the principles of God and the world! God chastens His
          people for their sin; the world persecutes them for their godliness.
          So it has been from the beginning, and will continue to the end. David
          had before mentioned his persecutors as many. Now he tells us, that
          they were, like those of David&#x27;s Lord, the princes of the earth.
          In both cases, however, was it confessedly without cause. Had it been
          with cause, it would have been his shame. Now it was his glory. In the
          former case it would have been his own—here it was his
          Master&#x27;s—cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          His awe of God&#x27;s word was the gracious restraint to his own
          spirit. And this godly fear has always marked the people of God.
          Witness Joseph, Moses, Nehemiah, and the Jews, and the three
          Babylonish captives. Josiah also obtained a special mark of
          acceptance. For the man &quot;that trembles at God&#x27;s word,&quot;
          whether he be found on the throne or on the ash-heap, is the man,
          &quot;to whom the Lord will look.&quot; And certainly where, as with
          David, the wrath of princes and the wrath of God are weighed against
          each other; who can doubt, but that it is better to incur the
          persecution of men by a decided adherence to the word of God, than the
          wrath of God by declining from it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Savior, &quot;knowing what was in man,&quot; had clearly
          fore-warned and fore-armed His disciples against these difficulties.
          The trial at the first onset proved too hard for them; Peter&#x27;s
          heart stood in awe of the persecuting princes, and in a moment of
          temptation he disowned his Master: but when &quot;the Spirit of
          power&quot; was poured from on high, such was the holy awe, in which
          himself and his brethren stood of God&#x27;s word, that they declared,
          in the face of the whole council, &quot;Whether it be right in the
          sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge you. We
          ought to obey God rather than men.&quot; &#x27;I fear
          God,&#x27;—Colonel Gardiner used to say—&#x27;and I have nothing else
          to fear.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed the spirit of adoption—the Christian&#x27;s distinguishing
          character and privilege—produces an awe of God; a dread of sinning
          against the tenderest Father, of grieving the dearest Friend. And this
          awe of God will naturally extend to His word; so that we shall be more
          tenderly afraid of disregarding its dictates, than the most faithful
          subject of breaking the law of his beloved Sovereign. There is nothing
          slavish or legal in this fear. It is the freedom and the holiness of
          the Gospel, the very soul of religion; the best preservative of our
          joys and privileges; and the best evidence of their scriptural
          character. We shall find, with David, this principle a valuable
          safeguard against the richest allurements, or the more powerful
          reproach of men, to go &quot;beyond the word of the Lord to do less or
          more.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But what must be the state of that heart, where the word of the great
          God—the Creator and Judge of the earth—commands no reverence! Could
          the sinner hear a voice from heaven, addressed distinctly to himself,
          would he dare to reject it? Yet &quot;we have a more sure word,
          whereunto we do well that we take heed;&quot; that we receive it with
          silent awe, bow before it with the most unlimited subjection, and
          yield ourselves entirely to its holy influence. But if it does not
          stand infinitely higher in our estimation than all—even the best—books
          of man, we have no just perception of its value, nor can we expect any
          communication of its treasures to our hearts. The holiness of God is
          stamped upon its every sentence. Let us then cherish an awe of His
          word, &quot;receiving it&quot;—not as a common book, &quot;not as the
          word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God&quot;, in the true
          spirit of Cornelius and his company, &quot;Now therefore are we all
          here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded you of
          God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>162. I rejoice at Your word, as one that finds great spoil.</p>
        <p>
          The awe in which we should stand of God&#x27;s word, so far from
          hindering our delight in it, is, as we have just hinted, the most
          suitable preparation for its most happy enjoyment. In receiving every
          word of it as the condescending message from Him, before whom angels
          veil their faces, we shall rejoice at it, as one that finds great
          spoil. Often had David found great spoil in his many wars; but never
          had his greatest victories brought him such rich spoil, as he had now
          discovered in the word of God. The joy in this treasure (like that of
          the church at the advent of Christ [Isaiah 9:3], described by this
          figure) evidently implied no common delight. If then the saints of old
          could so largely enrich their souls from their scanty portion of the
          word; must not we, who are favored with the entire revelation of God,
          acknowledge, &quot;The lines are fallen unto us in pleasant places;
          yes, we have a goodly heritage?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This expressive image may remind us, that the spoils of this precious
          word are not to be gained without conflict: Here &quot;the kingdom of
          heaven suffers violence.&quot; Our natural taste and temper revolt
          from the word. Our indolence indisposes for the necessary habitual
          effort of prayer, self-denial, and faith. But still &quot;the violent
          do take the kingdom by force.&quot; No pains are lost—no struggle is
          ineffectual. What great spoil is divided as the fruit of the conflict!
          What abundant recompense is in reserve for the &quot;good soldier of
          Jesus Christ,&quot; who is determined, in Divine strength, to
          &quot;endure hardness,&quot; until he overcomes the reluctance of his
          heart for the spiritual duty? It is not a sudden flash, or impression
          upon the imagination; but the conqueror&#x27;s joy in spoiling the
          field of conflict—solid and enriching. Sometimes indeed (as in the
          Syrian camp, 2 Kings 7:8), we find the spoil unexpectedly. Sometimes
          we see the treasure long before we can make it our own. And when we
          gird ourselves to the conflict, paralyzed by the weakness of our
          spiritual perceptions and the power of unbelief; many a prayer, and
          many a sigh, is sent up for Divine aid, before we are crowned with
          victory, and as the fruit of our conquest, joyfully appropriate the
          word to our present distress.
        </p>
        <p>
          But from a cursory, superficial reading of the word of God, no such
          fruit can be anticipated. When therefore the flesh or the world have
          deadened our delight, and taken from us this great spoil, should we
          not arm ourselves for repossession of it? Should we be unaffected by
          our loss? Oh, then, since there are such treasures found and enjoyed
          in this field of conflict, let us not lose our interest in them by the
          indulgence of presumption, heartlessness, or despondency. Before we
          attempt to read, let us cry to the Lord, under the sense of utter
          helplessness to perform one spiritual act, for His powerful help and
          Almighty teaching. Then we shall persevere with unconquerable and
          unwearied vigor, and not fail to share in the blessed spoil of
          victory, views of a Savior&#x27;s dying love—an interest in the
          precious blessings of the cross—great spoil, &quot;unsearchable
          riches.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>163. I hate and abhor lying: but Your law do I love.</p>
        <p>
          We can neither stand in awe of God&#x27;s word, nor rejoice at it,
          unless we abhor all contrary ways. And here lies the spiritual
          conflict. For so opposed are our natural affections to the character
          and will of God, that we love what God hates, and we hate what God
          loves. Our new principle and bias, however, as directly falls in with
          the dictates of God&#x27;s law, as before we have revolted from it.
          Lying is now hated and abhorred as contrary to &quot;a God of
          truth;&quot; and the law is now loved, as the reflection of His image,
          and the manifestation of His will. David had before prayed to have
          &quot;lying ways removed from him,&quot; and a love for the law of God
          imparted. His utter detestation shows, that these ways had been
          removed, and a renewed inclination to the law granted to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          To have avoided lying, and to have practiced the law, might have been
          sufficient for the regulation of his outward conduct. But his was the
          religion of the heart—not meant only to control his actions; but to
          renew his habits, motions, tempers, and taste. He would not therefore
          only refrain from lying, or manifest a disinclination to it—he must
          hate and abhor it as hell itself. Nor was external conformity, or
          approval of the law, his standard: he must love it. If sin was counted
          common, fashionable, venial, profitable, or pleasant; if contempt was
          cast upon the law of God—this stopped him not. Every sin, though only
          a hair&#x27;s breadth deviation from the rule, was in his eyes
          hateful, defiling, damning. He would &quot;resist unto blood, striving
          against it.&quot; Every act, desire, and habit of conformity, with
          whatever shame it might be attended, was his delight. Such, Christian,
          should be our standard. Lord! humble us in the daily sense of
          deviation and defect. Give to us larger desires, growing conformity to
          Your perfect rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well had it been for Eve and for her children, had she turned from the
          tempter&#x27;s lie with this strong determination. But, &quot;You
          shall not surely die&quot;—has from that fatal moment been a most
          effectual instrument in captivating unwary souls. So plausible is it
          in itself, so agreeable to our natural inclinations, that it is
          readily cherished, even where the first contact with temptation
          assures the wretched victims, that its &quot;deceit is
          falsehood.&quot; But they do not hate and abhor it: they do not flee
          from it, as a concern for the honor of God and their own safety would
          lead them; and therefore justly are they &quot;given up to believe
          it&quot; as the fruit of their delusion, and the punishment of their
          unfaithfulness. Oh! if we are ever tempted by the flattery and
          allurements of the world, let us only mark the opposition of their
          standard, taste, maxims, and pursuits to the truth of God, and we
          shall turn away with hatred and abhorrence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;overseers of the purchased flock&quot; of Christ—yes, all
          &quot;who earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered
          unto the saints&quot; will anxiously watch any deterioration of
          doctrine or principle—any deviation from the simplicity of the Gospel,
          and brand it as a lie. &quot;I have not written unto you&quot;—said
          the venerable Apostle, &quot;because you know not the truth; but
          because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth. Who is a liar,
          but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?&quot; How does the great
          Apostle teach us to look at the adulteration of the doctrine of grace
          before referred to—a system not of faith, but of fear—not of joy, but
          of slavish awe—not of confidence, but of doubt—palsying the springs of
          life: withering, blighting, chilling the glow of love;
          &quot;entangling again the free-born children of God in a yoke of
          bondage!&quot; The champion of the faith would not tolerate it for a
          moment. And he bids his people hate and abhor it, even though from an
          angel&#x27;s mouth, as the beguiling lie of the great
          &quot;corrupter&quot; of the church. Equally would he have us abhor
          the licentious abuse of the gospel flowing from the same source,
          &quot;Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God
          forbid!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, however, this verse must include an abhorrence of the
          literal sin of lying in all its forms. A lie is so gross a sin, that
          we might be disposed to spiritualize this expression, rather than to
          analyze some of the plausible shapes, in which the sin may be detected
          in our own profession. Exaggeration, a false gloss, a slight deviation
          (hardly perceptible) from the straight line, excuses made to one
          another, which we dare not make to God, want of accuracy in relating
          what we hear—all these are forms of lying to be shunned, hated and
          abhorred by the man, who is really &quot;walking in the light, and
          having fellowship with God,&quot; as much as the more palpable
          falsehoods, with which the world abounds, which it excuses, and even
          boasts of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Believer! would you have your hatred and abhorrence of every kind of
          lying yet further deepened? Would you summon every passion of the
          soul, &quot;indignation, vehement desire, zeal, revenge&quot;—against
          it? Then learn to abhor it, not only as your enemy, but as God&#x27;s.
          Pray that the arrow of conviction may be dipped in the blood of
          Christ; and then, however deep and painful be the wound, it cannot be
          mortal. Mortal indeed it will be to the sin, but healing to the soul.
          Pray that your hatred of sin may flow from a sense of reconciliation;
          for never will it be so perfect, as when you feel yourself sheltered
          from its everlasting curse. To lie before your Savior as His redeemed
          sinner, and to wash His feet with your tears of contrition, will be
          your highest and happiest privilege on this side heaven. In this
          spirit and daily posture you will most clearly manifest the
          inseparable connection of hatred of lying ways with a love for the law
          of God.

          164. Seven times a day do I praise You, because of Your righteous
          judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          David had just spoken of his fear, joy, hatred, and love. He now
          expresses his love in praise. And indeed it is the mixture of praise
          with prayer, that makes this Psalm so complete an exhibition of
          Christian experience. Early and late, and habitually throughout the
          day, have we seen this man of God &quot;give himself to prayer.&quot;
          But his &quot;spirit of supplication,&quot; in strict conformity with
          the Apostolic rule, was ever mingled &quot;with thanksgiving.&quot;
          Indeed, self-love—the sense of want—may prompt us to pray. But love to
          God is the spirit of praise. The neglect, therefore, of this service
          is robbing God, no less than ourselves. Not that He needs it, but that
          He deserves and desires it. Not that it brings any merit to us, but
          that it strengthens our dependence, and elevates our love. If then we
          feel it to be &quot;good, lovely, and pleasant,&quot; it will be as
          needless to define its frequency, as to prescribe the limit of our
          service to a beloved friend, to whom our obligations were daily
          increasing. The casuistry of love would answer all the entangling
          scruples of a bondage system. We should aim at living in praise, as
          the element of our souls, the atmosphere of our enjoyment, our reward
          more than our duty—that which identifies our interest with heaven, and
          forms our fitness for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Young Christians indeed sometimes unwarily bring themselves into
          &quot;bondage,&quot; in forcing their consciences to a frequency of
          set times for duty, interfering with present obligations, or pressing
          unduly upon the weakness of the flesh. Our rule of service, though not
          measured by our indolence, yet should be accommodated to those
          legitimate daily engagements, which, when &quot;done as to the
          Lord,&quot; form as real and necessary a part of our religion, as the
          more spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise. To observe any
          particular time (beyond the Sabbath, and the &quot;morning and evening
          sacrifice&quot;) because it is the time—however wearied our spirits
          may be, or however immediate obligations may interfere—is to forget
          the weighty instruction of one well qualified to speak, &quot;Bodily
          exercise profits little.&quot; Rather let us &quot;go, and learn what
          that means—I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.&quot; Growth in grace
          will, however, gradually mold our profession into habitual communion
          with God. As our views become more solid and settled, each duty of the
          day will find its proper place, our services will become more free,
          and our obedience more evangelical.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the formalist considers seven times a-day—to be an infringement of
          the sacred canon, &quot;Be not righteous overmuch.&quot; He pays his
          customary service twice a-day; he says his prayers and his praises
          too; and his conscience slumbers again. And alas! there are times of
          slumber, when we little differ from him. Oh! let us be alarmed at
          every symptom of such a state, and &quot;find no rest to our
          spirit,&quot; until we have regained, some measure of this frame of
          hearty and overflowing praise. If there be a heavenly nature, there
          must be a heavenly work. Tongue and heart should be set on fire by
          love. Thus we will go to our work, whatever it may be, and sing at it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Christian sometimes feels, that he has no heart, and—he almost
          fears—no right to praise. Having no sensible token of love to call him
          forth, his harp &quot;hangs upon the willows;&quot; nor does he care
          to take it down, even to &quot;sing one of the Lord&#x27;s songs in
          this strange land.&quot; But how many have found with
          Bunyan—&#x27;When I believe and sing, my doubting ceases!&#x27;
          &quot;Meat comes out of the eater,&quot;—cheering rays out of the
          darkest cloud. Endeavor therefore to bring to mind some spiritual, or
          even temporal, mercies. Or, if recollection fails you, open your
          Bible; turn to some subject of praise, such as the song of the Angels
          at the birth of our Savior, or the song of the Redeemed to the honor
          of the Lamb. Have you no part or interest in it? Do you not need the
          Savior? Can you be happy without Him? Then inquire, and feel, and try,
          whether you cannot give &quot;thanks unto God for His unspeakable
          gift.&quot; Perhaps, your notes may rise into praise, and in the
          excitement of praise, prayer will again mingle itself with its
          customary enjoyment. It is your sinful folly to yield to that
          continual depression, which unfits you for the exercise of your duties
          and your privileges. How fully do our Liturgical services elevate and
          sustain the ascent of the soul heavenward! Language better adapted for
          strengthening its feeble aspiration will not readily be found;
          consecrated as it is in the remembrance of its acceptable use by a
          throng of the Lord&#x27;s favored people during successive
          generations, now united to the general assembly above, and worshiping
          with everlasting acceptance &quot;before the throne of God and the
          Lamb.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord&#x27;s righteous judgments in His word are a constant matter
          for praise. Such light, food, and comfort! Such a stronghold of God!
          Such a firm hope to anchor on! Such a clear rule to walk by! Truly the
          distinguishing favor of this gracious gift stirs up the song,
          &quot;Praise the Lord.&quot; Add to which—the righteous judgments—His
          decrees and declarations respecting His Church—occupied the
          Psalmist&#x27;s &quot;midnight,&quot; as well as his daily, song.
          &quot;O Lord, You are my God&quot;—said the enraptured prophet in the
          name of the Church, &quot;I will exalt You, I will praise Your name;
          for You have done wonderful things; Your counsels of old are
          faithfulness and truth.&quot; Inscrutable indeed they may sometimes
          appear; and opposed to our best prospects of happiness; yet the
          language of faith in the darkest hour will be, &quot;We know that all
          things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
          the called according to His purpose.&quot; But neither seven times
          a-day, nor &quot;seventy times seven,&quot; will satisfy us in heaven.
          Then our song—even &quot;the song of Moses and the Lamb&quot;—will
          still be &quot;the Lord&#x27;s righteous judgments;&quot; and for this
          ever &quot;new song&quot; the harps of God will never be unstrung, and
          never out of tune, throughout an eternity of praise. But a moment, and
          we shall be engaged in this heavenly employ—no reluctancy of the
          spirit—no weariness of the flesh. Every moment is hastening on this
          near, this cheering, this overwhelming glorious—prospect. Blessed be
          God!

          165. Great peace have they which love Your law, and nothing shall
          offend them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the happiness of a child of God summed up in one word—peace.
          Looked at with an eye of sense, slighted by the world, and often
          chastened with &quot;the rod of affliction,&quot; he is an object of
          pity. But look at him with the eye of faith—he loves the law of his
          God, and his heritage is peace. Every feature of the covenant bears
          some resemblance to its nature; full of grace, peace, and love. Two of
          the agents are fitly represented by the lamb and the dove—emblems of
          peace. The tendency of its principles &quot;is first pure,&quot;
          &quot;then peaceable.&quot; Its present enjoyment and privilege is
          peace—great peace. Its end will be universal, eternal peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian! have you not discovered the connection of peace with love
          for the law—the whole revealed will of God? Looking at it as the law
          of truth—was not its disturbance of your peace of self-satisfaction
          and self-delusion the first step to the attainment of solid peace? You
          learned to see yourself as God sees you. Every fresh view humbled you
          more deeply. Your dissatisfaction exercised you in an anxious and
          diligent search for true peace. And then, looking at it again as the
          &quot;law of faith&quot;—here is your ground of peace laid open. Your
          way to God is clear—your acceptance free—your confidence assured—your
          communion heavenly. &quot;Being justified by faith, you have peace
          with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;&quot; yes—you are &quot;filled
          with peace, all peace in believing.&quot; And have you not equal
          reason to love this law, as a law of obedience? Here is your question
          answered, &quot;Lord! what will You have me to do?&quot; Let
          &quot;this word dwell in you richly in all wisdom;&quot; and it will
          be your daily directory of life and conduct. You will &quot;delight in
          it after the inner man.&quot; Walking in the light of it, you will go
          on to the full enjoyment of peace. &quot;Taking&quot; cheerfully your
          Savior&#x27;s &quot;yoke upon you, and learning of Him, you will&quot;
          ever &quot;find rest unto your soul.&quot; &quot;All His paths are
          peace.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Professor! what do you lose by your indulged indifference to the law
          of God? Conscience tells you, that you are a stranger to this
          peace—this great peace. A secret root of idolatry cankers the
          principles of peace. Notions will not bring it. Nothing but vital
          godliness—the love for God&#x27;s law, &quot;the truth received in the
          love of it&quot;—will realize the blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Young Christian! be not disheartened, though your love to the law be
          so weak, interrupted, clouded, that sometimes you fear that you have
          no love at all. Do you not mourn over its coldness? Do you not desire
          to love? Seek to know more of the constraining influence of the love
          of Christ. If your chariot-wheels now, like those of the Egyptians,
          drive heavily, you will then move, like the chariots in the
          prophet&#x27;s vision, &quot;upon wheels and upon wings.&quot; At
          least you are on the way to peace. Stir up the habit of diligent
          faith; be active—be more earnest in dependence on the Lord. Soon will
          He visit you with His cheering sunshine, and bless you with His
          heavenly peace. &quot;The Lord is your shepherd:&quot; and dwelling
          near the shepherd&#x27;s tent, &quot;you shall not want.&quot; Nothing
          comes to you without His appointment; and whatever He takes away was
          only what He had first given, and leaves you nothing but to say,
          &quot;Blessed be the name of the Lord!&quot; Whatever He lays upon you
          is infinitely less than you deserve, and with the fatherly design
          &quot;to do you good at the latter end.&quot; Whatever He gives you is
          peace, great peace, &quot;perfect peace:&quot; and though at best, as
          to its actual enjoyment, it is only a chequered gift, linked with
          &quot;this world&#x27;s tribulation;&quot; yet, as the earnest of that
          &quot;peace into which the righteous shall enter, when taken away from
          the evil to come,&quot; it is an incalculable blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The steadfastness of our profession is a most important fruit of this
          blessing—Nothing shall offend them. The daily cross, the humbling
          doctrine, the fiery trial—which, by offending the professor, detect
          the unsoundness of his heart—these are the principles of strength and
          consolation to the faithful lover of God&#x27;s law. Those &quot;had
          no root in themselves,&quot; who were stumbled by &quot;tribulation or
          persecution.&quot; Hence there was no love in their hearts;
          consequently no peace in their experience, and no stability in their
          course. The frequency of such cases in a day of profession is a most
          painful subject of observation. A course of religion, commenced under
          the impulse of momentary excitement, is like a &quot;reed shaken by
          the wind.&quot; The first breath of the storm beats down all
          resolutions, that were not formed upon the conviction of utter
          helplessness, and in entire dependence upon Divine grace. Light
          without love ends in fearful ruin. Genuine love to the law alone keeps
          the soul—a love of no common character—a devoted, persevering
          attachment. The claim of the law is above every other. Everything—even
          life itself—if need be—must be sacrificed for it. And when it has been
          thus embraced on a fair calculation of its cost, from a deep sense of
          its value, and with a spiritual perception of its character and
          application to our necessities—there will be no stumbling-block.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed genuine love will prove our safeguard against all grounds of
          offence. The doctrine of the total depravity of man is objected to:
          but love to the law of God, molding our minds into its heavenly
          impression—will remove all ground of offence. The pride of man&#x27;s
          wisdom revolts from the doctrine of the cross, and the freeness of the
          grace of God. But we love it as a part of the law of faith. It suits
          our case. It answers our need, and therefore here also nothing offends
          us. Thus, whatever be the hindrance—whether from Satan or
          himself—whether from the enmity of the world, or the inconsistencies
          of the church—the believer, while he mourns over these things, is not
          offended at them, or at the Gospel through them. He has learned a more
          Scriptural standard, and to exercise a more discriminating judgment.
          Love to the law of God enables him, instead of being &quot;tossed to
          and fro&quot; in doubtful perplexity, to &quot;make straight paths for
          his feet.&quot; If his cross be grievous, he seeks from the Lord a
          quiet spirit; and thus, &quot;in patience possessing his soul,&quot;
          he finds &quot;the yoke easy, and the burden light.&quot; His
          difficulties exercise and strengthen his faith, and add fresh
          testimony to the faithfulness of the promise. Whether therefore his
          way be dark or light, his soul is at peace. In the enjoyment of his
          Savior&#x27;s love, he has the witness in his own heart, that
          &quot;the work of righteousness&quot;—of love to the law of his God,
          &quot;shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and
          assurance forever.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          166. Lord, I have hoped for Your salvation, and done Your
          commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great peace connected with the love of God&#x27;s law, is at once
          the fruit of faith, and the motive of obedience. And the enjoyment of
          it leads the man of God to give renewed expression to his faith and
          devotedness. &quot;Faith, which works by love,&quot; is no less the
          characteristic of the Old, than of the New Testament, Church. For mark
          here the principle and the object of faith—I have hoped for Your
          salvation—and the practical influence of faith—I have done Your
          commandments. &quot;Walked not believers always in the same spirit?
          Walked they not in the same steps?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith is the exercise of the soul in a sense of need, in desire, and
          in trust. Faith goes to God on the ground of the promise; hope in the
          expectation of the thing promised. Thus hope implies the operation of
          faith. It appropriates to itself the object of faith. The power to
          take hold of the promises of faith, and to stay our souls upon their
          &quot;everlasting consolation,&quot; is the energy of &quot;a good
          hope through grace&quot;—such as &quot;makes not ashamed.&quot;
          Conscious unworthiness may give a trembling feebleness to the hand of
          faith; but the feeblest apprehension of one of the least of the
          promises of the gospel assures us of our interest in them all. Why may
          we not set all the fullness of the covenant before the weakest as well
          as before the strongest believer, and proclaim to both with equal
          freedom the triumphant challenge, &quot;Who shall lay anything to the
          charge of God&#x27;s elect? Who is he who condemns?&quot; Every
          believer is alike interested in the gospel of grace. &quot;There is no
          difference&quot; in the righteousness of the gospel, which is
          &quot;the righteousness of God&quot;—nor in the imputation of it,
          which is &quot;unto all and upon all,&quot; nor in the subjects—which
          is them that believe—nor in the means of its application, which in all
          cases is &quot;by faith of Jesus Christ,&quot;—nor in the need of the
          blessing, &quot;All have sinned&quot; without difference. All
          therefore are justified without difference. The only difference
          regards the strength or weakness of the faith, by which the
          righteousness is more or less distinctly appropriated, and its
          consequent blessings enjoyed. No soul, however, can sink into
          perdition, that grasps the promise of Christ with the hand of faith,
          be that hand ever so weak and trembling; though if the promise did not
          hold us more firmly by its unchangeableness, than we hold it by our
          faith, who could ever attain the blessing?
        </p>
        <p>
          Not that our interest in the Gospel is transient or uncertain. For
          though the perception of it may be often interrupted, yet is it not
          still in the Bible, in the covenant of God, in the heart of God? And
          is it not constantly renewed in the exercise of faith? The repetition
          of the same act of faith is therefore equally necessary every
          successive moment, as at the first moment of our spiritual life. What
          ever be our standing in the Gospel, faith will always realize to the
          end the same hope for God&#x27;s salvation. Indeed the neglect of the
          cultivation of its habitual exercise materially weakens its operation
          in great emergencies. Let it then be regarded as the breathing of the
          soul. Let it be constantly exercised in the daily occasions of need;
          and we shall enjoy its clear light and active influence upon
          occasions, where its special energy is required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now is not this sometimes your experience? You are distressed by an
          unsuccessful struggle with wandering, defiling imaginations. You know
          the promise, and the remedy. But &quot;the shield of faith&quot; has
          been laid by. You have therefore to seek it, when you want it at hand
          for the present moment; and thus you lie powerless, at a distance from
          the cure, instead of being able to bring your sin at once to
          Jesus—&#x27;Lord, this is my trouble; this is the &quot;plague of my
          heart;&quot; &quot;but speak the word only, and Your servant shall be
          healed.&quot;&#x27; Thus the indolent neglect of the quickening
          principle greatly impairs its powerful energy, and the
          &quot;confidence and rejoicing of hope&quot; flowing from it. If
          &quot;the life in the flesh is&quot; not &quot;a life of faith on the
          Son of God,&quot; no solid rest or acceptance can be known.
        </p>
        <p>
          But on what ground is this hope for the Lord&#x27;s salvation built?
          On His faithfulness, not on our sincerity; on His promises, not on our
          frames; on His unchangeableness, not on our constancy. It is built,
          not on the work of grace in us, but on the work of Christ for us; a
          work which has satisfied every claim, provided every security, and
          pledged all the Divine perfections on our behalf; a work so finished
          and complete, that all the difficulties of salvation on the part of
          God are removed; and the sinner, finding no hindrance in the way but
          himself, is warranted, though covered with guilt and defilement, to
          apply for full, immediate, and unconditional forgiveness. What then
          hinders the instant reception of the privilege, but disbelief of the
          record? It is this which dares to &quot;make God a liar;&quot; which
          therefore must not, as is too often the case, be lamented as an
          infirmity (except indeed in cases of constitutional weakness); but
          watched, prayed against, and resisted, as a deep and aggravated sin.
          The present enjoyment of the blessing is indeed often marred by
          looking at the fruits of faith (contrition, love, diligence, &amp;c.)
          as prerequisites for believing, instead of looking to the object of
          faith, to put away our sin, and to produce these fruits in us. This
          not only binds our sin upon us, but robs God of His honor;—and, while
          it restrains His blessing on our souls, reflects upon His wisdom and
          grace, who has laid the foundation of a sinner&#x27;s hope on His own
          dear Son, irrespective of any warrant of faith in himself. We want to
          be enlivened with sensible comfort, as a ground for our believing in
          Christ; or, if we look for it from faith, it is from faith as an act
          (in which respect it is no more a proper ground for comfort than any
          other grace,) instead of looking for it from the object of faith. Thus
          we not only lose the peace and joy we are seeking, but we lose it by
          our mistaken way of seeking it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fullness of Christ, and the promises of God in Him, are the only
          basis of a full assurance of salvation: and this basis is equally firm
          at all times, and under all circumstances. &quot;You are complete in
          Him.&quot; Your title at this moment is as perfect, your interest as
          secure, as ever it will be at the day of &quot;the redemption of the
          purchased possession.&quot; Awakened sinner! let not then a sense of
          unworthiness paralyze your faith. As a guilty sinner, you are invited.
          As a willing sinner, you are welcome. As a believing sinner, you are
          assured. Why hesitate then to &quot;lay hold on eternal life?&quot; Is
          it presumption in the drowning man to attempt to swim to the rock of
          safety? Why then should not the sinking soul cast itself upon the
          &quot;Rock of Ages?&quot; Lord, I have hoped for Your salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Believer! &quot;Behold!&quot; says your Lord, &quot;I come quickly;
          hold that fast which You have, that no man take your crown.&quot;
          &quot;Hold fast your confidence and the rejoicing of your hope.&quot;
          This is of no trifling importance. An established confidence ought to
          result from, and to witness to, your interest in the Lord&#x27;s
          salvation. For without it, you have no relief from the spirit of
          bondage; no enlargement in duties; no enjoyment of privileges; no
          &quot;growth in grace, and in the knowledge of the Savior;&quot; no
          honored usefulness in the Church of God. &quot;The things which remain
          will be ready to die.&quot; Rest not, then, satisfied with an
          occasional gleam of light and joy, while your horizon is overcast with
          doubts and fears. Waste not time in heartless complaints, that would
          be far better employed in a vigorous habit of faith. Live above frames
          and feelings, upon this glorious truth—&#x27;Christ has undertaken for
          me.&#x27; He lives, and reigns, and pleads for every sinner that
          trusts in Him. Exercise your dependence upon Him in importunate and
          persevering supplication. &quot;Give all diligence&quot;—at all
          times—in all ways, private and public, &quot;instant in season and out
          of season.&quot; Thus &quot;an entrance into&quot; the joy, peace, and
          glory of &quot;the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior, will be
          richly ministered unto you.&quot; You shall be released from the
          prison-house of despondency, and shall breathe the free atmosphere of
          adoption and heavenly love.
        </p>
        <p>
          But remember, that this &quot;assurance of hope,&quot; even in its
          weakest and lowest influence, is a practical principle—I have done
          Your commandments. &quot;Every man that has this hope in Him purifies
          himself, even as He is pure.&quot; All obedience that springs not from
          this source is of a low and legal character; the fruit of self-will,
          self-righteousness, self-sufficiency. Evangelical obedience can only
          flow from Evangelical faith and hope. Love to Christ catches fire from
          the perception of His love to us. Without this perception, all is
          weariness, toil, and travail of soul in His service; duty, not
          privilege; constraint, not delight; conscience, not love. Hence the
          most assured believers will be the most devoted servants of their
          Master. &quot;The joy of the Lord&quot; &quot;the joy of faith,&quot;
          of acceptance, of communion, &quot;is their strength.&quot; They live
          by faith; and as they believe, they love; they deny themselves; they
          lay themselves out for their Master&#x27;s work; they conquer all that
          opposes their progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot, therefore, do His commandments without a hope for His
          salvation. For only in proportion as we have assured our title to the
          promises of the Gospel, can we take hold of them, plead them, or
          experience their support. When therefore our hope is indistinct, we
          are almost left to our own unassisted resources; and our course will
          probably end in &quot;perpetual backsliding.&quot; Active devotedness
          flows from assured acceptance. Where there is no certainty, there can
          be little love, little delight, little diligence. Let us walk in
          sunshine, and we shall work cheerfully and honorably for God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep then the eye fixed on Christ as the ground, and on obedience as
          the evidence, of our hope. Thus will our own confidence be more
          established; and others, beholding in us the power of our Christian
          hope, will be led to say, &quot;We will go with you, for we have heard
          that God is with you.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          167. My soul has kept Your testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.
          168. I have kept Your precepts and Your testimonies: for all my ways
          are before You.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those only who have hoped in the Lord&#x27;s salvation can express
          this joyful delight in His precepts. The Christian does not
          acknowledge the popular separation of duty and privilege, according as
          it may be constraint or indulgence to his inclination. Every part of
          his walk identifies these terms of distinction. If it is his duty, it
          is no less his privilege, to love the precepts. Nothing holds him to
          them—nothing enables him thoroughly to keep them, but love. All
          resolutions, vows, covenants, would be as ineffectual to bind him, as
          the green withs to fasten the giant. David had not done the
          commandments from constraint; but his soul kept them; yes, he loved
          them exceedingly. Indeed, the bias of the new nature to keep the
          precepts is as prevalent, as that of the old nature to break them.
          Once the believer would have wished the law of God blotted out of the
          universe, or at least exchanged for a more indulgent dispensation. But
          now that it is written in his heart, even its restraint is delightful
          to him; and as he gains a closer intimacy with it, and a clearer
          discernment of its spirituality, he loves it exceedingly. Not one,
          indeed, of the precepts or testimonies does he keep as he ought, and
          as he desires; but there is not one of them that he does not delight
          in, and most anxiously desire to fulfill. Thus every feature of the
          Divine image is inwrought in the soul, beautiful in its place and
          proportion; and all other graces grow in connection with love to the
          testimonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor let our consciousness of daily failures restrain this strong
          expression of confidence. The most humble believer need not hesitate
          to adopt it &#x27;as an evidence of grace, not as a claim of
          merit.&#x27; This frequent repetition marks the godly jealousy of the
          man of God, mindful of his own self-deceitfulness and manifold
          infirmities, and &quot;giving&quot; careful &quot;diligence to make
          his calling and election sure.&quot; David knew himself to be a poor
          sinner; but he was conscious of spirituality of obedience, exceeding
          love to the word, and an habitual walk under the eye of his God—the
          evidences of a heart (often mentioned in the Old Testament)
          &quot;perfect with Him.&quot; &#x27;Christ alone kept the old law, and
          He enables us to observe the new.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          The active love to the word should be cultivated on the principle of
          our public walk before God. We must not study the Scripture merely for
          our present gratification, or to furnish materials for our Christian
          communion. We ought rather, from every step in the history of Christ,
          as well as from the more finished course of instruction in the
          Epistles, to be gathering some help to &quot;set the Lord always
          before us&quot;—realizing the interest that He takes in us, and His
          presence with us as our Father, Governor, Teacher, Comforter, Friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let us ask—Do our souls thus keep the Lord&#x27;s testimonies
          habitually, perseveringly? Does conscience testify that, with all our
          defects and sinful mixture, they are uppermost in our minds; that our
          love rises above the worldly rules of expediency, prudence, or the
          example of those around us (the too common measurement of scanty
          obedience)—as if it could never burn with sufficient fervor in His
          service, &quot;who loved us, and gave Himself for us?&quot; Why, then,
          should we shrink from this acknowledgment of &quot;simplicity and
          godly sincerity?&quot; If we are ready to own, that &quot;without
          Christ we can do nothing;&quot; that His Spirit &quot;has wrought all
          our works in us;&quot; that &quot;by the grace of God we are what we
          are;&quot; that our hope of acceptance is grounded only upon the
          finished work on the cross—why should we refuse to confess the grace
          of God in us? Yet we must not forget, that allowed unfaithfulness,
          neglect of secret prayer, impurity of motive, or any &quot;iniquity
          regarded in the heart&quot;—though they will not loosen the ground of
          our hope—will obscure the comfort of our Christian confidence. How
          beautiful is that princely spirit, which will not serve the Lord
          &quot;of that which costs us nothing;&quot; that not only longs for
          holiness as the way to heaven, but loves heaven the better for the
          holy way that leads to it, and for the perfect holiness that reigns
          there eternally!
        </p>
        <p>
          But never let us lose sight of the recollection, that all our ways are
          before God! that every act, every thought, every desire, every word,
          is registered by conscience as His viceregent, and laid up in His book
          of remembrance! Well would it be for us, if we walked less before men,
          and more before God; if in secret, in business, at home and abroad, we
          heard the solemn voice, &quot;I am the Almighty God: walk before Me,
          and be perfect.&quot; We may be unreproveable in the sight of men,
          while it is a mere artificial walk, grounded upon base external
          principles—a &quot;walking after the flesh&quot;—not before God. Even
          the engagements of active duty may be the subtle snare of the great
          enemy to divert us from intense personal religion, and to spoil the
          hidden walk of communion with God, by concentrating the mind upon a
          more public, and, apparently, a more useful walk. Thus too often the
          vital principle of religion sinks into a stated formal habit.
          &quot;Walking with God&quot; is the secret spring of the Christian.
          &quot;Walking before God&quot; is the manifestation and the exercise
          of the hidden principle. For in all things, private as well as public,
          the most trivial as well as the most weighty, to have our eye fixed in
          dutiful reverence upon the Omniscient, Omnipresent eye of Jehovah—what
          solemnity would it give to our whole behavior! what influence would it
          have upon our public professions, our general conversation, our secret
          duties! We should be energetic in &quot;serving our own generation by
          the will of God;&quot; and yet, while walking before men, should be
          truly &quot;walking before God&quot;—all our ways before Him,
          &quot;done&quot; in His sight, &quot;as to Him,&quot; and accepted in
          His favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          When, therefore, I am about to venture upon any line of conduct, let
          me consider the watchful eye, that pierces into the deepest recesses
          of my thoughts, and brings, as it were, to daylight, my principles, my
          motives, and my ends. Above all, let me ever recollect, that he,
          before whom are all my ways, is He who hung upon the cross for my
          sins. Let me then walk, as if He were standing before me in all the
          endearing obligations of His love. Oh, do not I owe Him sacrifice for
          sacrifice, heart for heart, life for life? Then surely I cannot be
          dead, insensible, sluggish in keeping His precepts. I cannot forbear
          to show this practical proof of my love to Him. Let not, then, the
          fear of legality make me neglect this privilege of &quot;keeping the
          commandments&quot; of my beloved Master and Lord. Let me live under
          the solemn recollection, &quot;You, God, see me;&quot; and in the
          joyful assurance, &quot;You, God, love me;&quot; and His ways will be
          to me holiness, happiness, heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          169. Let my cry come near before You, O Lord; give me understanding,
          according to Your word. 170. Let my supplication come before You:
          deliver me according to Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          We mark David here, where he always loved to be, a supplicant at the
          throne of grace. Many had been his cries and supplications. His
          petition now is—that they may come near before his Lord. Oh, that our
          wants of every moment were felt with the same pressure, and carried to
          the Lord with the same faith, earnestness, humility, and perseverance!
          Richness of expression, and fluency of utterance, are the mere shell
          and shadow of prayer. The life of prayer is the cry of the heart to
          God. The eloquence of prayer is its earnestness. The power of prayer
          is that, which comes not from education, or from the natural desire of
          the man; but that &quot;which is from above&quot; &quot;the spirit of
          supplication&quot; &quot;the spirit of adoption.&quot; The urgency of
          present need calls for instant prayer. The soul is at stake; the enemy
          is within the walls, perhaps within the citadel. Oh, what a privilege
          to know, that we have a &quot;strong habitation, whereunto we may
          continually resort;&quot; to be able to remind the Lord, &quot;You
          have given commandment to save me: for You are my rock and my
          fortress!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But then we must see that our cry comes before—comes near before—the
          Lord; that nothing blocks up the way, or interrupts the communication.
          If we are believers, the way is open: &quot;the middle wall of
          partition is broken down.&quot; Oh, let us be excited to greater
          nearness of communion, &quot;Having boldness to enter into the holiest
          by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He has
          consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, His flesh,&quot;
          why should we be backward to come? Had we not seen the way marked by
          this blood of sprinkling, we should (if we have had any sight into our
          own hearts) no more have dared to take one step into the awful
          presence of God, than to rush into the devouring flame. If in a moment
          of extremity, we had felt that we must pray or perish, we should have
          had no boldness to open our mouth before God, much less to expect that
          our supplication would come near before Him, had we not been
          &quot;made near by the blood of Christ.&quot; But what an amount of
          privilege is it, that this way to God is always open; that, as members
          of Christ, we stand in the sight of God as pure as Christ is pure;
          that we have not only &quot;access,&quot; but &quot;access with
          confidence;&quot;—yes, with the same confidence as the Son of God
          Himself! For the Father is never weary of delighting in His dear Son,
          or in those who are one with Him. If He, therefore, takes our names
          into the holy place; if He offer sacrifice and incense for us, and
          sprinkle us with His blood, we &quot;are complete in him&quot;
          &quot;in Him,&quot; therefore, let us &quot;glory.&quot; &quot;Having
          an High-priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true
          heart, in full assurance of faith.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But where we feel as if we did not, could not, reach the throne of
          grace, &quot;is there not a cause?&quot; Our distance from God must be
          traced to a deeper origin than the dullness and insensibility of our
          hearts. The real difficulty of prayer, and indeed the actual inability
          to pray, arises in many, and probably in most, cases, from an
          indistinct perception of the way of access. We must admit this, not
          only in those who are totally ignorant of Christ, but also in the
          cases of weak, unestablished, or negligent Christians. Through
          ignorance of the fullness and freeness of the gospel in the one, and
          indulgence of sin or secret unwatchfulness in the other, the way of
          access (only perceptible by the eye of faith) becomes obscured, the
          desire faint, the spiritual strength weakened. And instead of the
          acknowledgment, &quot;The Lord has heard the voice of my
          supplications,&quot; we have the mournful complaints, &quot;My soul
          cleaves to the dust—oh, that I were as in months past!&quot; It must
          be so; for prayer without faith is a heartless ceremony in the spirit
          of bondage. That which gives to it life and acceptance is the
          believing apprehension of Christ. The ignorant and self-righteous may
          find it a matter of course (as easy as it is fruitless) to bow their
          knee in the form of prayer. But the light that darts in upon the
          awakened conscience reveals something hitherto unknown of God and of
          themselves, and shows the ground of confidence, for a self-condemned
          sinner, to be a matter of the deepest mystery, and most amazing
          difficulty. Such a confidence, however, God has laid open to us. We
          cannot honor Him more than by making use of it. All that come in the
          name of Jesus are welcome. Why, then, penitent sinner, should not you
          be welcome? The throne of grace was raised for sinners such as you.
          You cannot want larger promises or a better plea. You come, not
          because you are worthy, but because you are bid, to come. Take the
          command and lay it upon your conscience. Christ is your only way to
          God. Faith is the act and exercise of coming to Christ. Faith,
          therefore, will bring you to God, if you have not hitherto come; or
          restore you to God, if you have wandered from Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there may be a secret departure from God even in the engagement of
          active service, or in the exercises of social religion. For if these
          duties are substituted for secret communion with God, &quot;the things
          that remain in us will be ready to die;&quot; ordinances will fail to
          enrich; Christian fellowship will bring no refreshment; and the soul,
          while blessed with the abundance of means of grace, &quot;in the
          fullness of its sufficiency will be in straits.&quot; Indeed, if our
          affections and feelings are moved in social exercises, and are cold
          and insensible when we are alone with God, it is a bad symptom of our
          state. What, then, do we know of the comforts of the closet? Do we
          pray, because we love to pray, or only because our consciences
          constrain us to the duty? Does the Lord mark those secret transactions
          with Himself, that manifest our hearts to be really drawn to Him? Is
          it any pressing business of our soul&#x27;s salvation that brings us
          to God? Are our services enlivened with spiritual manifestations of
          Christ? It is possible long to continue in the outward course of duty:
          and yet not one of our prayers to come near before the Lord. We have
          not come in the appointed way; and, therefore, we have not really come
          at all. Or if the name of Christ has been affixed to our prayers, it
          has been as a component part of a formal system, not as an exercise of
          dependence in seeking acceptance with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it may be, that we have backslidden from God, in a habit of
          indulged coldness or willful iniquity. Now if we would expect
          &quot;the candle of the Lord again to shine upon our heads, and His
          secret to be upon our tabernacle,&quot; we must rest satisfied with
          nothing short of the full restoration of our privileges. We must
          return to the Lord with deepened contrition in His appointed way, and
          wait for Him to look upon us, and once more to let our supplication
          come near before Him. He had &quot;gone, and returned to His place,
          until we acknowledged our offence, and sought His face;&quot; and He
          is now sitting on a &quot;throne of grace, waiting that He may be
          gracious.&quot; Again and again, therefore, let us fall down at His
          feet, and never cease to pray, until we feel that our cry and
          supplication come near before Him, and spiritual understanding of our
          case, and deliverance from our danger, are given. As a God of wisdom
          and yearning mercy, we may trust Him to &quot;perform all things for
          us.&quot; Let Him then judge for the time and means of our
          deliverance. Only let it be according to His own word of faithfulness,
          and we &quot;shall yet praise Him.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is beautiful to observe the oil of the Psalmist&#x27;s faith
          feeding the flame of his supplication. Every petition is urged upon
          the warrant of a promise—according to Your word. The promises were the
          very breath of his supplication; exciting his expectation for a
          favorable answer, and exercising his patience, until the answer should
          come. Though in possession of so comparatively small a portion of the
          blessed book, he seemed always to find a word for the present
          occasion; always able to show to his God His own hand and seal. Alas!
          sometimes, with the whole word of God before us, we are at a loss to
          appropriate one of its innumerable promises to the present emergency.
          Yet with all our contracted views of the covenant, still our interest
          in it is not denied. Such is the condescension of our tender Father,
          that He accepts even the stammering language of faith in His children!
          The cry &quot;Abba, Father&quot;—&#x27;though&#x27; (as Luther sweetly
          expresses it) &#x27;it is but a cry; yet it does so pierce the clouds,
          that there is nothing else heard in heaven of God and His
          angels.&#x27; And how delightful is the thought that God&#x27;s
          elect—as they will shortly be gathered a countless multitude around
          the heavenly throne—so do they now hold spiritual communion with each
          other, while &quot;they cry day and night&quot; before their
          Father&#x27;s throne of grace! True it is—we understand not one
          another&#x27;s tongues. Yet does our loving Father understand us all.
          Nor do our different dialects cause any confusion in heaven—rather do
          they unite, and form one cloud of incense, ascending with continual
          acceptance and delight in His presence. Ineffable is the delight, with
          which our Beloved enjoys that communion with His people, &quot;which
          He purchased with His own blood&quot; &quot;O my dove, that are in the
          clefts of the rocks, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see
          your countenance, let me hear your voice; for sweet is your voice, and
          your countenance is lovely.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          171. My lips shall utter praise, when You have taught me Your
          statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          How happy is it to bring to God a heart as large in praise as in
          prayer! The answer of the supplication for spiritual understanding and
          deliverance naturally issues in the sacrifice of praise. Guilt had
          sealed David&#x27;s lips; while living in sin, and restrained alike
          the utterance of praise and prayer. But when awakened to a sense of
          his sin, how earnest were his cries!, &quot;Restore to me the joy of
          Your salvation. O Lord, open my lips; and my mouth shall show forth
          Your praise.&quot; And if guilt or unbelief has made us dumb, his
          petitions will tune our hearts to the &quot;songs of Zion.&quot; When
          the Lord has taught us in His statutes the revelation of Himself, as
          having given His dear Son for us and to us, &quot;the tongue of the
          dumb is made to sing.&quot; &quot;Thanks be to God for His unspeakable
          gift!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And do I not remember &quot;the time of love,&quot; when I first knew
          myself to be &quot;a brand plucked out of the fire&quot;—a redeemed
          sinner—a pardoned rebel—destined for a seat on the throne of
          God—indulged with a taste, and assured of the completion, of heavenly
          bliss? This was a work worthy of God—a work, which none but God could
          have wrought. What mercy is this! Everlasting! Unchangeable! Let me
          cast myself daily upon it; yes, let me bury myself in it! What
          gratitude is demanded! My lips shall utter praise, now that He has
          taught me His statutes. &quot;O Lord, I will praise You; though You
          were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, and You comfort
          me.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Again—I seemed to have sunk beyond all help. No means, no ministers,
          no providences, could reach my extremity. All were &quot;physicians of
          no value,&quot; tried and tried again: but tried in vain. But &quot;in
          weakness&quot; thoroughly felt, &quot;strength was made perfect.&quot;
          The threatening clouds were dispersed; the breaches were healed; the
          veil of unbelief was rent. &quot;The right hand of the Lord has
          brought mighty things to pass.&quot; &quot;He has both spoken unto me,
          and Himself has done it,&quot; and it is &quot;marvelous in our
          eyes.&quot; Let my stammering lips utter praise. What a display of
          power! It is the spark preserved in the ocean unquenched, the drop in
          the flames unconsumed; the feather in the storm unshaken. &quot;Who is
          a God like unto You? Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us; but unto Your
          name give glory.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And again—I was perplexed in a dark and bewildered path. Every
          dispensation appeared to frown upon me. One dark hour had blotted out
          all the recollections of my former comforts; and it was as if I never
          could, never should, rejoice again. But little did I think how the
          Lord was &quot;abounding towards me in all wisdom and
          prudence&quot;—how His arrows were sharpened with love—how He was
          &quot;humbling me, and proving me, to know what was in my heart&quot;
          and in the moment of chastening was speaking to me, &quot;I know the
          thoughts that I think towards you, thoughts of peace, and not of evil,
          to give you an expected end.&quot; What a display of
          &quot;wisdom!&quot; My lips shall utter praise; for if I &quot;should
          hold my peace, the stones would immediately cry out.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought of what I was before my conversion—what I have been
          since—what I am now, overwhelms me with shame and with praise.
          &quot;Lord, how is it that You should have manifested Yourself to me,
          as You have not unto the world?&quot; &quot;Who am I, O Lord God, that
          You have brought me hitherto?&quot; And how much more &quot;that You
          have spoken of Your servant for a great while to come!&quot; For You
          have prepared for me a happy eternity in Your unclouded presence.
          Should not then my praise be bubbling up, as from a fountain—pouring
          forth, as from a rich treasure-house? Should not my instrument, if not
          always employed, be always kept in tune? Forward we may be in prayer.
          But how backward we are in praise! Self-love may constrain the one.
          Only the love of God will quicken the other. And yet ought we not to
          be more touched in receiving mercies, than we were in asking for them?
          In the one case we only knew them by testimony or report. In the other
          we know them by our own experience. We hear of one, who had much
          forgiven, and who &quot;loved much.&quot; And surely the more sin
          pardoned—the more mercies received—does not God justly expect of us
          more love in the heart—more utterance of praise from the lips?
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet who of us are fit to praise, except those whom God has taught?
          The &quot;new song&quot; ill accords with the old heart. God
          vouchsafes His grace for the praise of His grace. Ought not we then to
          glory in our Savior—a privilege as high as to enjoy Him—no—the very
          means of increasing our enjoyment of Him, in the active excitement of
          our love, and every grace for His sake? Let not the enemy rob me, as
          too often he has done, of my high privilege. Let me prize secret
          prayer. Let me be separated from an ensnaring world. Let me dread
          separation from my God; and if ever estranged from Him, let me never
          rest, until, by &quot;receiving the atonement,&quot; always presented
          and accepted on my behalf, I once more walk in the light of His
          countenance. Let me then fix the eye of my faith, weak and dim as it
          may be, constantly upon Jesus. He must do all for me, in me, by me; He
          must teach me more and more of the statutes of my God, that my heart
          may be delightfully engaged with my lips in uttering His praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          172. My tongue shall speak of Your word; for all Your commandments are
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          To speak of God and for Him, will be the desire and delight of him,
          whose heart and lips have been taught to utter praise. Yet alas! how
          seldom is &quot;our conversation seasoned with grace!&quot; So much of
          this poor world&#x27;s nothing! So little of Jesus! &#x27;If only five
          minutes can be redeemed for prayer, for Scripture, or for thought; let
          it be seized as an inestimable jewel. If we can pass five minutes less
          in foolish or ensnaring company, secure the advantage.&#x27; If vain
          words are flowing up from the bottom, look on the restraint that
          represses them from our lips as a triumphant mercy. This active energy
          of Christian discipline will communicate a fragrance to our
          conversation, most acceptable to our beloved Lord; and will make our
          &quot;lips&quot; enriching, feeding, and instructive to His church.
          And truly when we see how hardly men judge of Him, how they count His
          &quot;commandments grievous,&quot; and His ways &quot;unequal,&quot;
          it will be delightful to bear our testimony, that all His commandments
          are righteousness; restraining the power of sin, and conforming the
          soul to His image.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Lord, open my lips, that my tongue may speak of Your word.&quot;
          Honor me, O my God, by helping me to show, that all Your commandments
          are righteousness. In our own atmosphere, and our own spirit, how
          often do we pour out our words without waiting on the Lord for unction
          and power; speaking of the things of God without His presence and
          blessing! Were we living fully in the atmosphere and breathing of
          prayer, enriched with habitual meditation in the word; how much more
          fluent would our tongue be to speak of His word &quot;to the use of
          edifying!&quot; It would be made really our own, known experimentally;
          and then how cheering, how enlivening the conversation of the man of
          God! His &quot;light so shines before men, that&quot; they are
          constrained to &quot;glorify His Father which is in heaven.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps, Believer, supposed inability, natural bashfulness, or want of
          seasonable opportunity, may restrain your lips. But under the most
          unfavorable circumstances something may generally be said or done in
          the service of God. And while it is well carefully to watch against
          the &quot;talk of the lips, which tends only to poverty;&quot; beware,
          lest, through the scrupulous tenderness of conscience, &quot;Satan get
          advantage&quot; to shut the mouth of the faithful witnesses of God,
          and thus to weaken that cause, which it is your first desire to
          support. Guard then against the influence of unbelief. Bring your
          weakness and inability daily to the Lord. Let any dreaded
          inconsistency of profession be searched out, examined, and lamented
          before Him, and opposed in dependence on His grace; but never let it
          be made a covering for indolence, or supply fuel for despondency.
          Consider how your interest in a Divine Savior makes your way open to
          bring all your wants to Him. Be encouraged therefore to ask for the
          Spirit of God to guide your lips: that a poor weak sinner may be
          permitted to &quot;show forth the praises of Him,&quot; who is
          surrounded with all the Hosts of Heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          When however our silence has arisen from the too feeble resistance of
          our natural carelessness and indolence, the recollection of many
          important opportunities of glorifying our Savior, lost beyond recall,
          may well excite the prayer, &quot;Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O
          God; and my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.&quot; Oh!
          to have the preciousness of souls deeply impressed upon our hearts!
          Oh! for that compassionate love, that would never suffer us to meet a
          fellow-sinner without lifting up our hearts to God on his behalf:
          without making an effort to win his soul to Christ, and manifesting an
          earnest desire for his salvation! What loss is there to our own souls
          in these neglected opportunities of blessing the souls of others! For
          never do we receive richer fruit to ourselves, than in the act or
          endeavor to communicate to others. The heart becomes enlarged by every
          practical exercise of Christian love. Yet much simplicity, much
          unction from above, much tenderness of heart, much wisdom combined
          with boldness—is needed in our daily conversation, that we may
          &quot;make manifest the savor of the knowledge of Christ in every
          place;&quot; and especially, that our very desires to bring sinners to
          the Gospel may proceed, not from a goading conscience, much less from
          pride and vainglory; but from the pure source of love to Christ and to
          our fellow-sinners. For even if we are as &quot;full of matter&quot;
          as Elihu was, nothing will be said for God—nothing, that will
          &quot;minister grace to the hearers,&quot; unless the influence of the
          Divine Spirit fills our hearts, as &quot;a well of water, springing up
          into everlasting life&quot;—a blessing to all around us.
        </p>
        <p>173. Let Your hand help me: for I have chosen Your precepts.</p>
        <p>
          David, having engaged himself to a bold profession of his God, now
          comes to seek His needful supply of help. Let Your hand help me. And
          if we may &quot;come to the throne of grace,&quot; that we may find
          &quot;grace to help in time of need,&quot; when should we not come?
          For is not every moment a &quot;time of need,&quot; such as may
          quicken us to flee to the &quot;strong tower,&quot; where &quot;the
          righteous runs, and is safe?&quot; Besieged without; betrayed within;
          &quot;wrestling against flesh and blood,&quot; and yet &quot;not
          against flesh and blood&quot; only: disputing every inch of ground,
          yet often discouraged by the little ground we seem to gain; surely we
          need all the help of Omnipotence to sustain us in the tremendous
          conflict. We may plead our choice of His precepts, in looking for His
          help. David had before &quot;taken the testimonies of God as his
          heritage&quot;—including all the precious promises of the Gospel,
          extending to every necessity of time, and to every prospect of
          eternity. He now confesses his obligation, in choosing the precepts—a
          happy choice, the influence of the Spirit upon his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          This choice is the distinctive mark of the Lord&#x27;s people—the
          exercise of a well-instructed and deliberate judgment; prompt
          obedience in the simplicity of faith. It is the choice of all the
          precepts—no other than the voluntary acknowledgment of our Baptismal
          obligations. Many carnal suggestions offer themselves the moment that
          the purpose is forming into the choice. &quot;The things that were
          gain to us,&quot; and which now must be &quot;counted loss for
          Christ,&quot; (should we allow their weight in the balance at this
          crisis) will bring much hesitation and perplexity. Conferences
          &quot;with flesh and blood&quot; are most subtle hindrances to
          Christian determination. &#x27;What will the world say? If I go too
          far, I shall give offence; I shall lose all my influence, and blast
          all my prospects of eventual benefit to those around me.&#x27; The
          apprehension also of losing the affection and of incurring the
          displeasure of those whom my heart holds dear, is most fearful. And
          then this sacrifice is too costly to make; that pleasure too hard to
          resign. Such thoughts—the injections of the tempter—are ever at the
          door; and even when effectual resistance is offered, the struggle is
          most severe. But it is such a mighty help in this conflict, when one
          desire has taken sole possession of the heart, &quot;Lord, what will
          You have me to do?&quot;—when we are so crucified to worldly
          influence, whether of pleasure, profit, fear, or esteem, as to be
          ready to act upon the resolution, &quot;Therefore henceforth know we
          no man after the flesh.&quot; Now the heavenly beauty of the religion
          of the gospel breaks in upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience of our own weakness, and of the great power of the world,
          is gradually preparing us for victory over it. We shall then most
          specially find our happiness in losing our own will; and our
          Master&#x27;s cross will be a delightful burden; like wings to a bird,
          or sails to a ship; assisting, instead of retarding, our course. The
          more we trust to His help and guidance in everything, the more we
          shall be able to do, and the more delightful will His service be to
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lack of a determined choice is the secret of the halting
          profession that prevails among us. A compromise is attempted with the
          world. &quot;The offence of the cross&quot; begins to
          &quot;cease.&quot; A middle path of serious religion is marked out,
          divested of what is called needless offensiveness. But the religion
          that pleases the world will never be acceptable with God; nor can the
          religion that pleases God, be ever accommodated to the inclination of
          the world. Oh! we shall do well to consider, whether the way of the
          Lord&#x27;s precepts may not be found too hard, too strait, too
          unfrequented; whether we are prepared to brave the pointed finger and
          whispered scoff of the ungodly, and perhaps the mistaken opposition of
          beloved friends. Often has the profession of Christ been hastily taken
          up and relinquished. He who wishes to abide by it, must daily learn
          this lesson, &quot;Without Me you can do nothing:&quot; and in
          conscious helplessness, he will often breathe the cry—Let Your hand
          help me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this petition needful only in the first determination of this
          choice. In the growing and more decided conviction of its superior
          happiness, and in the daily endeavor to live in it, we shall find
          increasing need for the same acknowledgment of helplessness, and the
          same cry for support. Dependence is a principle of deep humility and
          mighty energy. The thought that we are entering upon the work in the
          Lord&#x27;s strength is a great stay. Blessed indeed is that
          helplessness, that makes us lie in the bosom of our Savior, supported
          and cherished! Blessed be God for the &quot;help laid&quot; for us
          &quot;upon one that is mighty;&quot; so that our insufficiency and
          all-sufficiency are visible at one glance: and &quot;when we are&quot;
          most &quot;weak, then are we&quot; most &quot;strong!&quot;
          &quot;Those who war against you shall be as nothing, and as a thing of
          nothing. For I the Lord your God will hold your right hand, saying
          unto you, Fear not, I will help you.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          174. I have longed for Your salvation, O Lord; and Your law is my
          delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we close this Psalm, let us dwell once more upon this
          word—salvation. Common as is its use, to the believer it has a
          constant freshness and an infinite meaning. Do we wonder at his
          longing for it? Look at its fullness—including all the mercy of the
          everlasting covenant. Look at its ground—that work of Calvary&#x27;s
          cross once &quot;finished,&quot; and leaving nothing to be filled up
          or improved; standing out in all its glorious completeness;
          constraining the admiration—and encouraging the confidence, of the
          chief of sinners; but wholly disclaiming all assistance from the most
          eminent saint. Look at its simplicity—not keeping the sinner aloof
          from the Savior, not hedging up or bewildering the open freeness of
          his path, but bringing to him immediate peace and joy in resting upon
          the great atonement of the gospel. Mark its
          unchangeableness—independent of and above all frames and feelings, so
          that, while &quot;walking in darkness&quot; we can &quot;stay upon our
          God,&quot; expecting salvation even from the hand that seems ready for
          our destruction; leaving it to our heavenly Father to frown or to
          smile, to change as He pleases from the one to the other; and looking
          at every aspect of His countenance, as only a different arrangement of
          the same features of ineffable paternity; and the different, suitable,
          and seasonable expression of unchangeable covenant love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is not this an object for the longing of the soul, that feels its own
          pressing wants, and sees in this salvation an instant and full supply?
          This longing marks the character of evangelical religion—not merely
          duty, but delight. The mind wearies in the continued exertion for
          duty; but it readily falls in with delight. Duties become privileges,
          when Christ is their source and life. Thus every step of progress is
          progress in happiness. The world&#x27;s all to the believer is really
          nothing. It presents nothing to feed the appetite, or quench the
          thirst, of an immortal soul. Indeed the creatures were commissioned to
          withhold consolation, until every desire was concentrated in the
          single object. &quot;You, O God, are the thing that I long for;&quot;
          until the sinner has found rest in the answer to his prayer, &quot;Say
          unto my soul, I am Your salvation.&quot; And now he enjoys his earthly
          comforts, &quot;as not abusing them,&quot; because he loves them as
          God would have them loved, and longs for His salvation above them all.
          This is true religion; when the Lord of all occupies that place in the
          heart, which He fills in the universe—There He is &quot;All in
          all.&quot; Here the believer cries, &quot;Whom have I in heaven but
          You? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside You.&quot; Oh,
          what a privilege is it to have Him in heart, in thought, and in view;
          to be rejoicing in His presence; and to be longing for a more full
          conformity to His image, and for a more lively enjoyment of His love!
          If this be but earth, what must heaven be! This longing is a
          satisfactory evidence of the work of God. It exercises the soul in
          habitual contemplation of the Savior, in nearer communion with Him,
          and supreme delight in His law. Such desires will be unutterably
          increased, and infinitely satisfied in the &#x27;fruition of His
          glorious Godhead.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Lord often brings this charge against His professing people,
          &quot;You have left your first love.&quot; The principle is not dead,
          but the energy is decayed. Human nature is prone to apostasy. Slumber
          unconsciously steals upon the soul. Faith is not in habitual exercise.
          The attraction of the Savior is not felt. His love is not meditated
          upon. The soul is satisfied with former affections to Him. There is
          little heart to labor for Him. The means of communion with Him are
          slighted. The heart naturally becomes cold in spiritual desires, and
          warm in worldly pursuits and too often without any smitings of
          conscience for divided love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some professors indeed consider this declension of affections to be a
          matter of course. The young convert is supposed to abound most in
          love, and, as he advances, his fervor gradually subsides into matured
          judgment. Those indeed, who &quot;have no root in themselves,&quot;
          lose their lively affections, and their religion with them. But surely
          the real principle of love cannot decay; that is, our esteem of God
          cannot be lowered: our longing for His salvation cannot languish; our
          delight in its enjoyment cannot diminish, without guilt and loss to
          our souls, He claims our love, and it is most unreasonable to deny Him
          His own. He is the same, as when we first loved Him. Then we thought
          Him worthy of our highest love. Do we now repent of having loved Him
          so much? Have we found Him less than our expectations? Can we bestow
          our heart elsewhere with stricter justice, or to better advantage? Do
          not all the grounds of our love to Him continue in full force? Have
          they not rather increased every day and hour? What would an indulgent
          husband think of incessant and increasing attentions repaid with
          diminished affection? Oh! let us be ashamed of our indolence, and
          &quot;remember&quot; the times when our longings for His salvation
          were more intense; when our communion with Him was more heavenly; when
          we were ready to labor and suffer for Him, and even to die to go home
          to His presence. Let us &quot;repent&quot; with deeper contrition, and
          &quot;do our first works:&quot; never resting until we can take up
          afresh the language of delight—I have longed for Your salvation, O
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, however, of the Lord&#x27;s dear children are distressed in the
          conscious coldness of their spiritual affections. But if it be a mark
          of the decay of grace to &quot;lose our first love,&quot; it is at
          least a mark of the truth of grace to mourn over this loss. There is
          always a blessing for those &quot;that hunger and thirst after
          righteousness.&quot; These restless desires are the beating pulse of
          the hidden life; and if there be not always a sensible growth of
          desire and enjoyment, there may be (as with the trees in winter)
          growth at the root, in a more fixed habit of grace and love, in a
          deeper spirit of humility, and in a more established self-knowledge
          and simplicity. Yet the shortest way of peace will be to look off from
          our longing for this salvation, to the salvation itself. For nothing
          is more desecrating to this great work—nothing is more paralyzing to
          its saving power, than the incorporating with it the admixture of our
          own experience as the ground of hope. The most Christian feelings must
          find no place at the foundation. Indeed their continual variation
          renders them, especially in the hour of temptation, very uncertain.
          Yet amid all these fluctuations, Christ may always be safely trusted.
          While therefore our coldness humbles us before Him, let not brooding
          despondency cover His precious cross from view. Let not our eyes be so
          filled with tears of contrition, as to obscure the sight of His free
          and full salvation. &quot;Looking&quot; singly &quot;unto Jesus&quot;
          as our peace and our life, is at once our duty, our safety, and the
          secret principle of our daily progress heavenward. We shall but
          realize the perception of our own emptiness in the contemplation of
          His unbounded fullness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the connection between longing for salvation, and delight in the
          law, is at least an incidental evidence, that right apprehensions of
          salvation must be grounded upon the word or law of God; and that a
          religion of feeling is self-delusion. Our delight is not only in His
          love, but in His law. And so practical is Christian privilege, that
          longing for salvation will always expand itself in habitual delight in
          the law: which in its turn will enlarge the desire for the full
          enjoyment of salvation. All spiritual desire therefore, that is not
          practical in its exercise, is impulse, excitement; not, as in this man
          of God, the religion of the heart; holiness, delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would that this beautiful Psalm might quicken us to be followers of
          Him, who evidently knew so much of the heavenly joys of religion! Why
          should we not, why do we not determine to know as much of God as we
          can? Why are our longings for His salvation so transient and so few?
          The religion of thousands who bear the name is of a very different
          stamp; empty instead of solid; withering instead of profitable;
          insipid instead of delightful. If there be any exercise, it is only
          &quot;the door turning upon hinges,&quot; movement without progress.
          The head is stored with knowledge, but there is no unction in the
          heart, &quot;ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of
          the truth.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the soul that really longs shall &quot;not be ashamed of its
          hope.&quot; Even to taste the present fruits (though it be but a
          taste) in a sense of reconciliation, liberty of access, a beam of the
          love of Jesus in the heart, is unutterable enjoyment. It strengthens
          the soul for endurance of trials, and for a devoted, self-denying,
          obedient service. But there are heights and depths of Divine love yet
          unexplored. He who has given large apprehensions of them to others,
          &quot;is rich in mercy to all that call upon Him.&quot; The fountain
          of everlasting love is ever flowing, ever full; and He who commands us
          to &quot;open our mouths wide,&quot; has promised, &quot;I will fill
          them.&quot; After all, however, the grand consummation is the object,
          to which these longings for salvation stretch with full expansion. The
          fullness and likeness of God; the complete and everlasting deliverance
          from sin; the glorious &quot;manifestation of the sons of God;&quot;
          the coming of the Lord. Then—not until then—will they be fully and
          eternally satisfied. Praised be God! &quot;Now is our salvation nearer
          than when we believed.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord of all power and might! create in our souls a more intense
          longing for Your salvation, and a more fervent delight in Your law.
          And as our longings for Your salvation increase, oh! nail us to the
          door-posts of Your house, that we may be Your happy servants forever!
        </p>
        <p>
          175. Let my soul live, and it shall praise You; and let Your judgments
          help me.
        </p>
        <p>
          There must be life, in order to praise. For how can the dead speak?
          Yet is it as natural for the living soul to praise, as for the living
          man to speak. And is not the life that the Psalmist is now praying
          for, the salvation for which he was longing? The taste that he has
          received makes him hunger for a higher and continued enjoyment; not
          for any selfish gratification, but that he might employ himself in the
          praise of His God. Indeed, the close of this Psalm exhibits that
          pervading character of praise which has been generally remarked in the
          concluding Psalms of this sacred book. Yet he alone is fitted for this
          heavenly exercise, of whom it has been said, &quot;This my son was
          dead, and is alive again.&quot; And how will he, who has &quot;looked
          to the hole of the pit whence he was dug,&quot; who has been awakened
          to a sight of that tremendous gulf, from which he is but
          &quot;scarcely saved,&quot; long to give utterance to the effusions of
          a praising heart! How will he cry for the quickening influence of
          &quot;the Lord and Giver of life,&quot; to stir him up to this
          delightful privilege! Praise springs from prayer—Let my soul live, and
          it shall praise You. When the breathing of life into our souls
          enlivens our services, we become, in the noblest sense, &quot;living
          souls.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Too often, however, the consciousness of inconsistency, carelessness,
          and unspirituality, damps our song. But let every recollection of our
          sin be accompanied with an humble yet assured confidence in the
          Lord&#x27;s pardoning grace. The abominations of a desperately wicked
          and unsearchably deceitful heart may well lead us to &quot;abhor
          ourselves in dust and ashes.&quot; Yet in the lowest depths of
          abasement, the Savior&#x27;s blood, applied to the conscience,
          &quot;cleanses from all sin.&quot; He who once &quot;passed by us, and
          saw us polluted in our blood, and said unto us, when we were in our
          blood, Live&quot;—still &quot;holds our souls in life;&quot; covering
          our daily infirmities, and maintaining our everlasting acceptance
          before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while the song of praise dwells on our lips for life thus freely
          given, let us guard against all hindrance to its growth and influence.
          For if the life within waxes low, praise will be dull and heartless.
          But when the assured believer cries with acceptance—Let my soul live,
          and it shall praise You—see how his spirit kindles with holy fire,
          &quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
          according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively
          hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead!&quot; The work
          of praise is now his nature, his element, his delight. No wonder,
          then, that he continues his cry for the daily renewal of his spiritual
          life, that he may return to this sweet foretaste of heaven—Let my soul
          live. And, indeed, this life—the more it is known, the more will it
          form the constant matter for prayer. For what besides makes existence
          tolerable to a child of God? The mere actings of a sickly pulsation
          can never satisfy him. Considering how much nearer he might live to
          God than he has yet known, he longs for more vigorous influence of the
          Divine principle. In his most active enjoyments, his insufficiency for
          this sacred work presses upon him, and stirs up petition for help—Let
          Your judgments help me. Give me such an enlightened apprehension of
          Your word, of Your character, and of Your perfections as the God of my
          salvation, as may furnish abundant matter of unceasing praise; so that
          my daily exercise may be, &quot;Giving thanks always for all things
          unto God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          176. I have gone astray like a lost sheep: seek Your servant; for I do
          not forget Your commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The natural disposition to wander from the fold is constant ground for
          prayer for the help of the Lord&#x27;s judgments, to give us clearer
          light and preserving principles. Yet our need of this safeguard opens
          to us a most humbling truth. Who can gainsay the testimony from the
          mouth of God—that &quot;all we like sheep have gone astray?&quot; But
          how afflicting is the thought, that this should not only be the
          description of a world living without God, but the confession even of
          God&#x27;s own people! And yet where is the child of God that does not
          set his own seal with shame to the confession—I have gone astray like
          a lost sheep? &quot;Who can understand his errors?&quot; If he be not
          found, like Peter, in the open path of wandering; yet has he not need
          to cry, &quot;Cleanse me from secret faults?&quot; Is he never led
          away by sense, fancy, appetite? If the will be sincere, how far is it
          from being perfect! And only a little yielding, a little bending to
          the flesh, giving way to evil—who knows what may be the end of this
          crooked path? Who knows what pride, waywardness, earthliness, may be
          working within, even while the gracious Lord is strengthening,
          guiding, comforting His poor straying sheep? That they should ever
          wander from privileges so great, from a God so good, from a Shepherd
          so kind! What can induce them to turn their backs upon their best
          Friend, and sin against the most precious love that was ever known,
          but something that must, upon reflection, fill them with shame! The
          blame is readily cast upon the temptations of Satan, the seductive
          witcheries of the world, or some untoward circumstances. But whoever
          deals with himself must trace the backsliding to his own heart,
          &quot;This is my infirmity.&quot; And have we replaced what we have
          wilfully yielded up, with anything of equal or superior value? May it
          not be asked of us, &quot;What fruit had you in those things, whereof
          you are now ashamed; for the end of those things is death.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is no enjoyment while distant from the beloved fold. It is
          as impossible for the child of God to be happy, when separated from
          his God, as if he were in the regions of eternal despair. He has not
          lost—he cannot wholly lose—his recollection of the forsaken blessing.
          In struggling, weeping faith, he cries—Seek Your servant. &#x27;I
          cannot find my way back: the good Shepherd must seek me. Once I knew
          the path: but now that I have wandered into bye-paths, I am no more
          able to return, than I was to come at first. I have no guide but the
          Shepherd whom I have left.&#x27; How cheering, then, is His office
          character!, &quot;Behold I, even I, will both search My sheep, and
          seek them out: as a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is
          among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out My sheep, and
          will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in
          the cloudy and dark day&quot; Cannot I set my seal to His faithful
          discharge of His office, &quot;He restores my soul?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          If I want further encouragement to guide my steps homeward, let me
          think of His own description of tender faithfulness, and compassionate
          yearnings over His lost sheep; not showing it the way back to the
          fold, and leaving it to come after Him: but &quot;laying it upon His
          own shoulders, and bringing it home:&quot; all upbraidings forgotten;
          all recollection of His own pains swallowed up in the joy, that He has
          &quot;found the sheep which was lost.&quot; Let me remember the
          express commission, that brought the Shepherd from heaven to earth,
          from the throne of God to the manger, and thence to the garden and
          cross, &quot;to seek and to save that which was lost.&quot; Let me see
          upon Him the especial mark of &quot;the Good Shepherd, giving His life
          for the sheep.&quot; Let me observe this sacrifice, as covering the
          guilt of my wanderings, and opening my way to return—yes, drawing me
          into the way. Surely then, I may add to my contrite confession the
          prayer of confidence—seek Your servant. I cannot forbear to plead,
          that though a rebellious prodigal, I am still Your servant, Your
          child: I still bear the child&#x27;s mark of an interest in Your
          covenant. Though a wanderer from the fold, I do not forget Your
          commandments. Nothing can erase Your law, which was &quot;written in
          my mind and inward parts&quot; by the finger and Spirit of God, as an
          earnest of my adoption, as the pledge of my restoration. What man
          writes is easily blotted out; what God writes is indelible. Let me
          then lie humbled and self-abased. But let me not forget my claim—what
          has been done for me. Thus, again, I hope to be received as a
          &quot;dear&quot; and &quot;pleasant child;&quot; again to be clothed
          with &quot;the best robe,&quot; to be welcomed with fresh tokens of my
          Father&#x27;s everlasting love, and to be assured with the precious
          promise, &quot;My sheep shall never perish, and none shall pluck them
          out of My hand.&quot;

          Such, Christian reader, would be the application we should make of
          this verse to ourselves; and such a penitent confession of our
          backslidings, united with a believing dependence on the long-tried
          grace and faithfulness of our God, would form a suitable conclusion to
          our meditations on this most interesting Psalm. We would unite the
          tax-collector&#x27;s prayer with the great Apostle&#x27;s confidence;
          and, while in holy brokenness of heart we would wish to live and die,
          smiting upon our bosom, and saying, &quot;God be merciful to me a
          sinner:&quot; the remembrance of our adoption warrants the expression
          of assurance, &quot;I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that
          He is able to keep that which I have committed to Him against that
          day.&quot; Yet, as it regards the experience of David, is there not
          something striking, and we had almost said, unexpected, in the
          conclusion of this Psalm? To hear one, who has throughout been
          expressing such holy and joyful aspirations for the salvation of his
          God, such fervent praises of His love, that we seem to shrink back
          from the comparison with him, as if considering him almost on the
          verge of heaven—to hear this &quot;man after God&#x27;s own
          heart,&quot; sinking himself to the lowest dust, under the sense of
          the evil of his heart, and his perpetual tendency to wander from his
          God, is indeed a most instructive lesson. It marks the believer&#x27;s
          conflict sustained to the end:—the humility, and yet the strength, of
          his confidence; the highest notes of praise combining with the deepest
          expressions of abasement—forming that harmony of acceptable service,
          which ascends &quot;like pillars of smoke&quot; before God. And thus
          will our Christian progress be chequered, until we reach the regions
          of unmixed praise, where we shall no longer mourn over our wanderings,
          no longer feel any inclination to err from Him, or the difficulty of
          returning to Him—where we shall be eternally safe in the heavenly
          fold, to &quot;go no more out.&quot;

          &quot;That is why they are standing in front of the throne of God,
          serving him day and night in his Temple. And he who sits on the throne
          will live among them and shelter them. They will never again be hungry
          or thirsty, and they will be fully protected from the scorching
          noontime heat. For the Lamb who stands in front of the throne will be
          their Shepherd. He will lead them to the springs of life-giving water.
          And God will wipe away all their tears.&quot; Revelation 7:15-17
