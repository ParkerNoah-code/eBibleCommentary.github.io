        <h2>119:101-125</h2>
        <p>
          101. I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep
          Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          David&#x27;s wisdom was of a practical—not of a merely intellectual or
          speculative—character. It taught him to &quot;keep the Lord&#x27;s
          precepts;&quot; and in order to this, to refrain his feet from every
          evil way. And will not advancing wisdom show itself by increasing
          tenderness of conscience and carefulness of conduct? The professor is
          afraid of hell; the child of God—of sin. The one refrains from the
          outward act—the other seeks to be crucified to the love of sin.
          Observe not only the practice, but the motive—that he might keep the
          word. Shall we not &quot;abhor that which is evil,&quot; that we might
          &quot;cleave to that which is good&quot; &quot;abstaining from all
          appearance of evil&quot; lest unconsciously we should be drawn into
          the atmosphere of sin, &quot;hating even the garment spotted by the
          flesh&quot;—fearing the infection of sin worse than death? But how
          fearful the danger of self-deception! What need to entreat the Lord to
          &quot;see if there be any wicked way in us?&quot; Oh! for the large
          supply of grace and unction, to maintain an upright walk before a
          heart-searching God; to &quot;keep ourselves from our iniquity;&quot;
          and in dependence upon the promises, and in the strength of the
          gospel, to &quot;perfect holiness in the fear of God!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how awful to hear men talk of keeping the word in a loose and
          careless profession! For how can it be kept, if the heart has not felt
          its holiness? For this is its beautiful peculiarity; that, in order to
          keep it, there must be a separation from sin. The two things are
          incompatible with each other. The two services are at variance at
          every point; so that the love of sin must be cast out, where the love
          of God is engrafted in the heart. Yet so strongly are we disposed to
          every evil way, that only the Almighty power of grace can enable us to
          refrain from one or another crooked path. Often is the pilgrim (yes,
          has it not too often happened to ourselves?) held back by a temporary
          ascendancy of the flesh—by a little license given to sin—or by a
          relaxed circumspection of walk. At such seasons, the blessed privilege
          of keeping the word is lost. We are sensible of a declining delight in
          those spiritual duties, which before were our &quot;chief joy.&quot;
          And &quot;is there not a cause?&quot; Have we not provoked our
          gracious God by harboring his enemy in our bosom—no more—by pleading
          for its indulgence? Has not &quot;the Holy Spirit been grieved&quot;
          by neglect, or by some worldly compliance: so that His light has been
          obscured, and His comforting influence quenched? No consolations,
          consistent with the love and power of sin, can ever come from the
          Lord. For the holiness of the word of God cannot be either spiritually
          understood, or experimentally enjoyed, but in a consistent Christian
          walk. And yet, such is the true blessedness of the word, that the very
          expectation of keeping it may operate as a principle of restraint from
          every evil way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there any bondage in this restraint from sin? Oh, no! Sin is
          slavery; and therefore deliverance from it is &quot;perfect
          freedom.&quot; There is indeed a legal restraint much to be
          deprecated, when the conscience is goaded by sins of omission or of
          wilfulness; and the man, ignorant of, or imperfectly acquainted with,
          the only way of deliverance, hopes to get rid of his burden by a more
          circumspect walk. But not until he casts it at the foot of the cross,
          and learns to look wholly to Jesus his deliverer, can he form his
          resolution upon safe and effectual grounds. Oh, may I therefore seek
          to abide within a constant view of Calvary! Sin will live everywhere
          but under the cross of Jesus. Here it withers and dies. Here rises the
          spring of that holiness, contrition, and love, which refreshes and
          quickens the soul. Here let me live: here let me die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed Lord! You know that I desire to keep Your word. Prepare my
          heart to receive and to retain it. May I so &quot;abide in
          Christ,&quot; that I may receive the sanctifying help of His Spirit
          for every moment&#x27;s need! And while I rejoice in Him as my Savior,
          may I become daily more sensible of every deviation from the straight
          path! May my eye guide my feet! &quot;Looking to Jesus,&quot; may I
          have light and grace! And may daily grace be given to refrain my feet
          from every evil way, that I may keep Your word!
        </p>
        <p>
          102. I have not departed from Your judgments; for You have taught me.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I have refrained my feet from sin—if I have not departed from
          God&#x27;s judgments—to Him be all the glory. Oh, my soul! Are you not
          a wonder to yourself? So prone to depart—to be carried away by
          uncertain notions—by the oppositions of Satan—by the example or
          influence of the world—how is it, that you are able to hold on your
          way? Because the covenant of the Lord engages Your perseverance,
          &quot;I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart
          from Me.&quot; While conscious of my own corrupt bias to depart, let
          me humbly and thankfully own the work of Divine teaching. Man&#x27;s
          teaching is powerless in advancing the soul one step in Christian
          progress. The teaching from above is &quot;the light of life.&quot; It
          gives not only the light, but the principle to make use of it. It not
          only points the lesson, and makes it plain: but imparts the
          disposition to learn, and the grace to obey. So that now I see the
          beauty, the pleasantness, the peace, and the holiness of the
          Lord&#x27;s judgments, and am naturally constrained to walk in them.
          Oh, how much more frequent would be our acknowledgment of the work of
          God, did we keep nearer to the Fountain-head of life and light! How
          may we trace every declension in doctrine and practice—all our
          continual estrangement from the Lord&#x27;s judgments—to following our
          own wisdom, or depending upon human teaching! &quot;Trusting in
          man,&quot; is the departing of the heart from the Lord. I never shall
          depart from sin by the influence of human persuasion. I never shall
          depart from the Lord, so long as I have the witness in my heart—You
          teach me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reader! what has been your habit and progress in the judgments of God?
          Have you been careful to avoid bye-paths? Has your walk been
          consistent, steady, advancing &quot;in the fear of the Lord, and in
          the comfort of the Holy Spirit?&quot; If there has been no allowed
          departure from the ways of God, it has been the blessed fruit of
          &quot;ceasing from your own wisdom,&quot; and the simple dependence
          upon the promise &quot;written in the prophets—And they shall be all
          taught of God.&quot; And how delightfully does this heavenly teaching
          draw your heart with a deeper sense of need and comfort to the Savior!
          For, as He Himself speaks, &quot;Every man therefore that has heard,
          and has learned of the Father, comes unto Me.&quot; Remember—it was no
          superior virtue or discernment that has restrained your departure from
          God, but—You have taught me the way to come to God; the way to abide
          in Him—Christ the way—Christ the end. And His teaching will abide with
          you. It will win you by light and by love, and by a conquering power
          allure your heart with that delight in His judgments, and fear of
          offending against them, that shall prove an effectual safeguard in the
          hour of temptation. Watch the first step of departure—the neglect of
          secret prayer—the want of appetite for the sincere word—the relaxing
          of diligence—the loss of the savor of godliness. Be careful therefore
          that the teaching of the Lord be not lost upon you. Inquire into your
          proficiency in His instructive lessons. And do not forget to prize His
          teaching rod—that loving correction, of which David had felt the
          blessing, and which He so often uses, to keep His children from
          departing from His judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord! do lead me by the hand, that I may make daily progress in Your
          judgments. Restrain my feet from &quot;perpetual backsliding.&quot;
          All human instruction will be ineffectual to keep me from departing
          from Your judgments, except You teach me. Neither grace received, nor
          experience attained, nor engagements regarded, will secure me for one
          moment without continual teaching from Yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          103. How sweet are Your words to my taste! yes, sweeter than honey to
          my mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          None but a child of God could take up this expression. Because none
          besides has a spiritual taste. The exercises of David in this sacred
          word were delightfully varied. Its majesty commanded his reverence.
          Its richness called forth his love. Its sweetness excited his joy. Its
          holy light, keeping his heart close with God, naturally endeared it to
          his soul. How barren is a mere external knowledge of the Gospel! The
          natural man may talk or even dispute about its precious truths. But he
          has never tasted them—at least not so as to relish and feed on them.
          The highest commendation cannot explain the sweetness of honey to one
          who has never tasted it. Thus nothing but experience can give a
          spiritual intelligence. But what we have really tasted, we can warmly
          commend, &quot;Oh! taste and see that the Lord is good.&quot; Having
          once tasted of His Divine goodness, the sweetest joys of earth will be
          insipid, distasteful, and even bitter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do we ask—what is it that gives this unutterable sweetness to the
          word? Is it not that name, which &quot;is as ointment poured
          forth?&quot; Is it not &quot;the savor of the knowledge of
          Christ&quot;, that revives the soul in every page with the breath of
          heaven? For can the awakened sinner hear, that &quot;God so loved the
          world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in
          Him should not perish, but have everlasting life&quot;—and not be
          ready to say—How sweet are Your words to my taste! yes, sweeter than
          honey to my mouth? Can the weary soul listen to the invitation to
          &quot;all that labor and are heavy-laden;&quot; and not feel the
          sweetness of those breathings of love? Who can tell the sweetness of
          those precious words to the conflicting, tempted soul—displaying the
          Divine sovereignty in choosing him, the unchanging faithfulness in
          keeping him, and the Almighty power of the Divine will in the gift of
          eternal life? And how can the believer hear his Savior &quot;knock at
          the door&quot; of his heart, calling him to fresh communion with
          Himself: and not turn to Him with the ardent excitement of his love,
          &quot;All Your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
          the ivory palaces, whereby they have made You glad!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But are there not times, when we gather no sweetness from the word? It
          is with the spiritual, as with the natural food—a want of appetite
          gives disgust, instead of sweetness and refreshment. An indolent
          reading of the word without faith—without desire—without
          application—or with a taste vitiated by contact—with the things of
          sense—deadens the palate, &quot;The full soul loathes an honeycomb:
          but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how melancholy is the thought of the multitudes, that hear, read,
          understand the word, and yet have never tasted its sweetness! Like
          Barzillai, they have no sense to &quot;discern between good and
          evil.&quot; Full of the world, or of their own conceits—feeding on the
          delusive enjoyments of creature-comforts—nourishing some baneful
          corruption in their bosoms—or cankered with a spirit of formality—they
          have no palate for the things of God; they are &quot;dead in
          trespasses and sins.&quot; But how sweet is the word to the hungering
          and thirsting taste! We eat, and are not satisfied. We drink, and long
          to drink again. &quot;If so be we have tasted that the Lord is
          gracious, as new-born babes&quot; we shall &quot;desire the sincere
          milk of the word, that we may grow thereby.&quot; We shall take heed
          of any indulgence of the flesh, which may hinder the spiritual
          enjoyment, and cause us to &quot;loathe&quot; even &quot;angels&#x27;
          food&quot; as &quot;light bread.&quot; Instead of resting in our
          present experience of its sweetness, we shall be daily aspiring after
          higher relish for the heavenly blessing. And will not this experience
          be a &quot;witness in ourselves&quot; of the heavenly origin of the
          word? For what arguments could ever persuade us that honey is bitter,
          at the moment when we are tasting its sweetness? Or who could convince
          us that this is the word of man, or the imposture of deceit, when its
          blessed influence has imparted peace, holiness, joy, support, and
          rest, infinitely beyond the power of man to bestow? But let this
          enjoyment—as the spiritual barometer—the pulse of the soul—accurately
          mark our progress or decline in the Divine life. With our advancement
          in spiritual health, the word will be increasingly sweet to our taste:
          while our declension will be marked by a corresponding abatement in
          our desires, love, and perception of its delights.
        </p>
        <p>
          104. Through Your precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every
          false way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist having spoken of the pleasure, now speaks of the
          profit—of the word—the teaching connected with its sweetness. Before,
          he had mentioned the avoiding of sin in order to profit—now, as the
          fruit of profit. So closely are they linked together. Man&#x27;s
          teaching conveys no understanding—God&#x27;s teaching not only opens
          the Scriptures, but &quot;opens the understanding to understand
          them,&quot; and the heart to feel their heavenly warmth of life. Thus
          having learned &quot;the principles of the doctrine of Christ,&quot;
          we shall &quot;go on to perfection&quot; &quot;growing in grace, in
          the knowledge of Christ.&quot; Many inconsistencies belong to the
          young and half—instructed Christian. But when through the precepts he
          gets understanding, he learns to walk more uniformly and steadily,
          abiding in the light. In this spirit and atmosphere springs up a
          constant and irreconcilable hatred of every false way; as contrary to
          the God he loves. These ways will include a thousand devious paths—all
          meeting in one fearful end—often discovered too late. In doctrine can
          we too much turn away from the thought of putting anything—the Church,
          ordinances, repentance, prayers—in the place of Jesus—another
          &quot;foundation&quot; in the stead of that which God Himself
          &quot;laid in Zion?&quot; Oh, for spiritual understanding to hate this
          false way with a deadly hatred! What think we of the ways of the
          sinful world—so long trusted to for happiness—yet so delusive? The
          sinner thinks that he has found a treasure, but it proves to be
          glittering trash—burdensome instead of enriching—only leaving him to
          the pain of disappointed hope. Rightly are such ways called false
          ways; and of those that tread in them, it is well said, &quot;This
          their way is their folly.&quot; Strewed they may be with the flowery
          &quot;pleasures of sin.&quot; But they are &quot;hard&quot; in their
          walk, and ruinous in their end. Inquire of those, whose past
          wanderings justly give weight and authority to their
          verdict—&#x27;What is your retrospective view of these ways?&#x27;
          Unprofitableness. &#x27;What is your present view of them?&#x27;
          Shame. &#x27;What prospect for eternity would the continuance in them
          assure to you?&#x27; &quot;Death.&quot; Let them then be not only
          avoided and forsaken, but abhorred; and let every deviation into them
          from the straight path, however pleasing, be &quot;resisted&quot; even
          &quot;unto blood.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let me ask myself, Have I detected the false ways of my own heart?
          Little is done in spiritual religion, until my besetting sins are
          searched out. And let me not be satisfied with forbearance from the
          outward act. Sin may be restrained, yet not mortified; nor is it
          enough that I leave it for the present, but I must renounce it
          forever. Let me not part with it as with a beloved friend, with the
          hope and purpose of renewing my familiarity with it at a &quot;more
          convenient season:&quot; but let me shake it from me, as Paul shook
          off the viper into the fire, with determination and abhorrence. What!
          can I wish to hold it? If through the precepts of God I have got
          understanding, must not I listen to that solemn, pleading voice,
          &quot;Oh! do not this abominable thing that I hate?&quot; No, Lord:
          let me &quot;pluck it out&quot; of my heart, &quot;and cast it from
          me.&quot; Oh, for the high blessing of a tender conscience! such as
          shrinks from the approach, and &quot;abstains from all appearance of
          evil;&quot; not venturing to tamper with any self-pleasing way; but
          hating it as false, defiling, destructive! I have noticed the apple of
          my eye—that tenderest particle of my frame—that it is not only
          offended by a blow or a wound; but that, if so much as an atom of dust
          find an entrance, it would smart, until it had wept it out. Now such
          may my conscience be—sensitive of the slightest touch of sin—not only
          fearful of resisting, rebelling, or &quot;quenching the Spirit,&quot;
          but grieving for every thought of sin that grieves that blessed
          Comforter—that tender Friend! To hate every false way, so as to flee
          from it, is the highest proof of Christian courage. For never am I
          better prepared to &quot;endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
          Christ,&quot; than when my conscience is thus set against sin. Would
          not I then submit to the greatest suffering, rather than be convicted
          of unfaithfulness to my God?
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord! turn my eyes, my heart, my feet, my ways, more and more to Your
          blessed self. Shed abroad Your love in my heart, that sin may be the
          daily matter of my watchfulness, grief, resistance, and crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>105. Your word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</p>
        <p>
          The nightly journeys of Israel were guided by a pillar of
          fire—directing not only their course, but every step and movement.
          Thus is our passage in a dark and perilous way irradiated by the lamp
          and light of the word. But except the lamp be lighted—except the
          teaching of the Spirit accompany the word, all is darkness—thick
          darkness. Let us not then be content to read the word without
          obtaining some light from it in our understanding—in our experience—in
          our providential path. Did we more habitually wait to receive, and
          watch to improve the light, we should not so often complain of the
          perplexity of our path. It would generally determine our steps under
          infallible guidance: while in the presumptuous neglect of it—like
          Israel of old—we are sure to come into trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet it may sometimes be difficult to trace our light to this heavenly
          source. A promise may seem to be applied to my mind, as I conceive,
          suitable to my present need. But how may I determine, whether it is
          the lamp of the word; or some delusive light from him, who can at any
          time, for the accomplishment of his own purpose, transform himself
          &quot;into an angel of light?&quot; Or if a threatening be impressed
          upon my conscience, how can I accurately distinguish between the voice
          of &quot;the accuser of the brethren,&quot; and the warning of my
          heavenly guide? Let me mark the state of my own mind. If I am living
          in the indulgence of any known sin, or in the neglect of any known
          duty—if my spirit is careless, or my walk unsteady; a consoling
          promise, being unsuitable to my case, even though it awakened some
          excitement of joy, would be of doubtful application. The lamp of God
          under the circumstances supposed, would rather reflect the light of
          conviction than of consolation. For, though God as a Sovereign may
          speak comfort when and where He pleases; yet we can only expect Him to
          deal with us according to the prescribed rules of His own covenant;
          chastening, not comforting, His backsliding people. In a spirit of
          contrition, however, I should not hesitate to receive a word of
          encouragement, as the lamp of God to direct and cheer my progress;
          being conscious of that state of feeling, in which the Lord has
          expressly promised to restore and guide His people. Let me also
          inquire into the terms and character of the promise. When He
          &quot;that dwells in the high and holy place,&quot; engages to dwell
          &quot;with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit;&quot; any
          symptoms of tenderness and humility would naturally lead me to
          consider this word of promise, as sent by my kind and watchful Father,
          to be a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again—a distinct and experimental view of the Savior in His promises,
          endearing Him to me, and encouraging my trust in His faithfulness and
          love—this is manifestly light from above. Or if the purpose of the
          promise answers any proper end—to excite or to encourage to any
          present duty connected with the promise; I cannot doubt, but the lamp
          of the Lord is directing my path.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example—when the promise was given to Joshua, &quot;I will not
          fail you, nor forsake you;&quot; he could not misconstrue &quot;a
          word&quot; so &quot;fitly spoken&quot; &quot;in a time of need.&quot;
          And when the same promise was subsequently given to the Church, the
          application was equally clear, as a dissuasive from inordinate
          attachment to the things of time and sense, and an encouragement to
          entire dependence upon the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further—The practical influence of the word will also enable me
          clearly to distinguish the light of heaven from any illusion of fancy
          or presumption. The effect of an unconditional promise of deliverance
          given to the Apostle in a moment of extremity, was exhibited in a
          diligent use of all the appointed means of safety. An absolute promise
          of prolonged life given to Hezekiah when lying at the point of death,
          produced the same practical result, in a scrupulous attention to the
          means for his recovery. Upon the warrant of a general promise of
          Divine protection, Ezra and the Jews &quot;fasted, and besought their
          God for this.&quot; Now in these and other instances, the power of the
          word, working diligence, simplicity, and prayer, evidently proved its
          sacred origin. An assurance of safety proceeding from another source,
          would have produced sloth, carelessness, and presumption; and
          therefore may I not presume the quickening word in darkness and
          perplexity, to be the Lord&#x27;s lamp unto my feet, and light unto my
          path, &quot;to guide my feet into the way of peace?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me apply the same test to the threatenings of the word. Their
          influence, meeting me in a watchful and humble walk with God, I should
          at once consider as the suggestion of the great enemy of the soul,
          ever ready to whisper distrust and despondency to the child of God.
          But in a self-confident, self-indulgent state, I should have as little
          hesitation in marking an alarming word to be the light of the word of
          God. It would be well for me at such a time to be exercised with fear;
          not as arguing any insecurity in my state; but as leading me to
          &quot;great searchings of heart,&quot; to increasing watchfulness,
          humiliation, and prayer. &quot;The commandment is a lamp, and the law
          is a light: and reproofs of instruction are the ways of life.&quot;
          Oh, that I may be enabled to make use of this lamp to direct every
          step of my heavenly way!
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence then—it may be asked—the various tracks even of the sincere
          servants of God? Though there is clear light in the word, yet there is
          remaining darkness in the most enlightened heart. There is no eye
          without a speck, no eye with perfect singleness of vision—consequently
          without some liability to error. There is light for the teachable—not
          for the curious;—light to satisfy faith—not caviling. Add to this the
          office of the ministry—the Lord&#x27;s gracious ordinance for
          Christian instruction and establishment; not to enslave, but to direct
          the judgment in the light of the word. To honor this ordinance is
          therefore the path of light. To neglect it, is the exposure to all the
          evils of a wayward will and undisciplined judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord! as every action of the day is a step to heaven, or hell—Oh! save
          me from ever turning my face away from the path, into which Your word
          would guide me. Enable me to avail myself of its light, in the
          constant exercise of faith, prudence, and simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          106. I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep Your
          righteous judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blessing of the guidance of the Lord&#x27;s word naturally
          strengthens our resolution to walk in its path. And as if a simple
          resolution would prove too weak, the Psalmist strengthens it with an
          oath. No more, as if an oath was hardly sufficient security, be
          seconds it again with a firm resolution—I have sworn, and I will
          perform it. &#x27;There shall be but one will between me and my God;
          and that will shall be His, not mine.&#x27; Some timid Christians,
          under a morbid sense of their own weakness, would shrink from this
          solemn engagement. And some, perhaps, may have burdened their
          consciences with unadvised or self-dependent obligations. Still,
          however, when it is a free-will offering, it is a delightful service,
          well-pleasing to God. Such it was in the days of Asa, when &quot;all
          Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart,
          and sought Him with their whole desire; and He was found of
          them.&quot; Vows under the law were both binding and acceptable. Nor
          are they less so—in their spirit at least—under &quot;the perfect law
          of liberty.&quot; A holy promise originating in serious consideration,
          and established by a more solemn obligation, so far from being
          repugnant to the liberty of the gospel, appears to have been enjoined
          by God Himself; no, His people are described as animating each other
          to it, as to a most joyous privilege; as a renewed act of faith and
          daily dedication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet we would warn the inconsiderate Christian not to entangle his
          conscience by multiplied vows (as if they were—like prayer—a component
          part of our daily religion); nor by perpetual obligation—whether of
          restraint or of extraordinary exercises; nor by connecting them with
          trifles—thus weakening the deep solemnity of the purpose. Christian
          simplicity must be their principle. Our engagements to God must be
          grounded on His engagements to us. His faithfulness—not ours—must be
          our confidence. There is no innate power in these obligations; and
          except they be made in self-renouncing dedication, they will only
          issue in despondency and deeper captivity in sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the inconsiderateness of the unwary is no legitimate argument
          against their importance. If Jephthah was entangled in a rash and
          heedless vow, David manifestly enjoyed the &quot;perfect freedom&quot;
          of the &quot;service&quot; of his God, when &quot;binding his soul
          with a bond&quot; equally fixed, but more advised, in its obligation.
          And have we; with &quot;the vows of God upon us,&quot; baptismal
          vows—perhaps also confirmation or sacramental vows—found our souls
          brought into bondage by these solemn engagements? Does not a humbling
          sense of forgetfulness suggest sometimes the need of a more solemn
          engagement? And may we not thus secure our duty without being ensnared
          by it? Have not covenanting seasons often restrained our feet from
          devious paths, and quickened our souls in His service? Daily, indeed,
          do we need &quot;the blood of sprinkling&quot; to pardon our
          innumerable failures, and the Spirit of grace to strengthen us for a
          more devoted obligation. But yet in dependence upon the work and
          Spirit of Christ, often have these holy transactions realized to us a
          peace and joy, that leads us to look back upon such times and seasons
          of favored enjoyment. &quot;If,&quot; therefore, &quot;we sin&quot; in
          a &quot;perpetual backsliding&quot; from these engagements, it is
          still our privilege without presumption to believe, that &quot;we have
          an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and He is the
          propitiation for our sins.&quot; And as for necessary grace, there is
          One who has said, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you;&quot; and that
          One has given no less a proof of His interest in us, than by dying for
          us. May we not therefore trust, that He will &quot;perfect that which
          concerns us;&quot; that He will &quot;work all our works in us&quot;
          &quot;to will and to do of His good pleasure?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps however &quot;a messenger of Satan &quot;may &quot;buffet
          us.&quot; &quot;You have broken your bond; now will it be worse with
          you than before.&quot; But did not Jesus die for sins of infirmity,
          and even of presumption? Does every failing annul the marriage
          covenant? So neither does every infirmity or backsliding dissolve our
          covenant with God. Was our faithfulness the basis of this covenant?
          Rather, does not &quot;the blood of this covenant&quot; make constant
          provision for our foreseen unfaithfulness? And does not our gracious
          God overrule even our backsliding to establish a more simple reliance
          upon Himself, and a more circumspect and tender walk before Him?
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us take a case of conscience. A Christian has been drawn away
          from a set season of extraordinary devotion by some unforeseen present
          duty, or some unlooked-for opportunity of actively glorifying God. Has
          he then broken his obligation? Certainly not. It was, or ought to have
          been, formed with an implied subserviency to paramount duty. It
          cannot, therefore, be impaired by any such providential interference.
          Yet let it not be a light matter to remove a free-will offering from
          the altar. Let godly care be exercised to discover the subtle
          indulgence of the flesh in the service of God. Let double diligence
          redeem the lost privilege of more immediate and solemn
          self-dedication. In guarding against legal bondage, let us not mistake
          the liberty of the flesh for the liberty of the Gospel. Let us be
          simple and ready for self-denying service; and the Lord our God will
          not fail to give &quot;some token for good.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Come&quot; then, my fellow-Christian, &quot;and let us join
          ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant, never to be
          forgotten&quot; by God: never to be forsaken by us. Let each of us
          renew our surrender, &quot;O Lord, truly I am Your servant;&quot; I
          offer myself to You: &quot;You have loosed my bonds;&quot; oh! bind me
          to Yourself with fresh bonds of love, that may never be loosed. Glad
          am I that I am anything—though the lowest of all; that I have
          anything—poor and vile as it is—capable of being employed in Your
          service. I yield myself to You with my full bent of heart and will,
          entirely and forever; asking only, that I may be &quot;a vessel for
          the Master&#x27;s use.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          107. I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O Lord, according to Your
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would seem, that this holy saint&#x27;s covenanting season was a
          time of deep affliction: while his determined resolution to keep
          God&#x27;s word of obedience, gave boldness to his pleading, that God
          would perform His word of promise—Quicken me, O Lord, according to
          Your word. And this is our high privilege, that we are permitted to
          pour our troubles into the ear of One, who is able perfectly to enter
          into, and to sympathize with us in them; &quot;who knows our
          frame,&quot; who has Himself laid the affliction upon us: yes, more
          than all, who in &quot;all our affliction is&quot; Himself
          &quot;afflicted;&quot; and who &quot;suffered being tempted, that He
          might be able to support them that are tempted.&quot; There are
          none—not even those most dear to us—to whom we can unbosom ourselves,
          as we do to our heavenly Friend. Our wants, griefs, burdens of every
          kind—we roll them all upon Him, with special relief in the hour of
          affliction. An affecting contrast to those who are indeed afflicted
          very much; whose souls, &quot;drawing near unto death,&quot; and
          knowing no refuge, are ready to burst with their own sorrows,
          &quot;the sorrow of the world&quot;—unmitigated—unrelieved,
          &quot;working death!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a &quot;needs-be&quot; for the afflictions of the Lord&#x27;s
          people. The stones of the spiritual temple cannot be polished or
          fitted to their place without the strokes of the hammer. The gold
          cannot be purified without the furnace. The vine must be pruned for
          greater fruitfulness. The measure of discipline varies indefinitely.
          But such is the inveteracy of fleshly lusts, that very much affliction
          may often be the needful regimen. Yet will it be tempered by one, who
          knows the precise measure, who can make no mistakes in our
          constitutions, and whose fatherly pity will chasten &quot;not for His
          pleasure, but for our profit.&quot; And need we speak of the
          alleviations of our trials, that they are infinitely disproportioned
          to our deserts—that they are &quot;light, and but for a moment,&quot;
          compared with eternity—that greater comfort is given in the endurance
          of them, than we even ventured to anticipate from their removal—that
          the fruit at the end more than balances the trials themselves? Need we
          say—how richly they ought to be prized, as conforming us to the image
          of our suffering Lord; how clearly we shall one day read in them our
          Father&#x27;s commission, as messengers of love; and how certainly
          &quot;the end of the Lord&quot; will be &quot;that the Lord is very
          pitiful and of tender mercy?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps affliction—at least very much affliction—may not be our
          present lot. Yet it is our duty, and wisdom, as the good soldier in
          the time of truce, to burnish our armor for the fight. &quot;Let not
          him that girds on his harness boast himself as he who puts it off.
          Because the wicked have no changes, therefore they fear not God.&quot;
          The continual changes in Christian experience may well remind us of
          the necessity of &quot;walking humbly with God,&quot; that we may not,
          by an unprepared spirit, lose the blessing of the sanctified cross.
          How many of the Lord&#x27;s dear children may bear Ephraim&#x27;s
          name, &quot;For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my
          affliction!&quot; Sometimes they are so conscious of the present good,
          that they dread affliction leaving them, more, probably, than the
          inexperienced professor dreads its coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          But great affliction is as hard to bear as great prosperity. Some
          whose Christian profession had drawn out the esteem of others—perhaps
          also their own complacency—have shown by &quot;faintness in the day of
          adversity their strength to be small,&quot; and themselves to be
          almost untaught in this school of discipline—shaken, confused, broken.
          Special need indeed have we under the smart of the rod, of quickening
          grace to preserve us from stout-heartedness or dejection. We think we
          could bear the stroke, did we know it to be paternal, not judicial.
          Have we, then, &quot;forgotten the exhortation, which speaks unto us
          as unto children?&quot; Do &quot;we despise the chastening of the
          Lord?&quot; &#x27;Quicken me, Lord, that I may be preserved in a
          humble, wakeful, listening posture, to hear and improve the message of
          Your blessing of the sanctified cross.&#x27; Do we &quot;faint, when
          we are rebuked of Him?&quot; &quot;Quicken me, O Lord,&quot; that I
          sink not under the &quot;blow of Your hand.&quot; Thus will this
          Divine influence save us from the horrible sin of being offended with
          God in our fretting spirit. We shall receive His chastisement with
          humility without despondency, and with reverence without distrust;
          hearkening to the voice that speaks, while we tremble under the rod
          that strikes: yet so mingling fear with confidence, that we may at the
          same moment adore the hand which we feel, and rest in mercy that is
          promised. Our best support in the depths of affliction is, prayer for
          quickening according to Your word! and which of the exercised children
          of God has ever found one jot, or one tittle of it to fail?
          &quot;Patience working experience, and experience hope, and hope
          making not ashamed,&quot; in the sense of &quot;the love of God shed
          abroad upon the heart by the Holy Spirit which is given unto
          us&quot;—all this is the abundant answer to our prayer, &quot;You who
          have shown me great and sore troubles, shall quicken me again, and
          shall bring me up again from the depths of the earth. You shall
          increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.&quot; Nothing
          will bear looking back to with comfort, like those trials, which
          though painful to the flesh, have tended to break our spirit, mold our
          will, and strengthen the simplicity of our walk with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          108. Accept, I beseech You, the free-will offerings of my mouth, O
          Lord: and teach me Your judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the first-fruits of his entire self-devotion to the Lord; as the
          only sacrifice he could render in his affliction; and as an
          acknowledgment of his answered prayer for quickening grace, behold
          this faithful servant of God presenting the free-will offerings of his
          mouth for acceptance. Such he knew to be an acceptable service. For
          the sacrifices of the Old Testament were not only typical of the One
          sacrifice for sin, but of the spiritual worship of the people of God.
          To those who are interested in the atonement of Jesus, there needs
          &quot;no more sacrifice for sin.&quot; That which is now required of
          us, and in which we would delight, is to &quot;take with us words, and
          turn to Him, and say unto Him—Take away all iniquity, and receive us
          graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips.&quot;

          No offering but a free-will offering is accepted. Such was the service
          under the law: such must it be under the gospel. Yet neither can this
          offering be accepted, until the offerer himself has found acceptance
          with his God. &quot;The Lord had respect,&quot; first to the person of
          &quot;Abel,&quot; then &quot;to his offering.&quot; But if our persons
          are covered with the robe of acceptance—if the &quot;offering up of
          the body of Jesus Christ once for all&quot; has &quot;perfected&quot;
          us before God: however defiled our services may be, however mixed with
          infirmity, and in every way most unworthy; even a God of ineffable
          holiness &quot;beholds no iniquity&quot; in them. No offering is so
          pure as to obtain acceptance in any other way; no offering so sinful
          as to fail of acceptance in this way. Most abundant, indeed, and
          satisfactory is the provision made in heaven for the continual and
          everlasting acceptance of our polluted and distracted services,
          &quot;Another angel came, and stood at the altar, having a golden
          censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should
          offer it, with the prayers of all saints, upon the golden altar which
          was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, which came with
          the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the
          angel&#x27;s hand.&quot; With such a High Priest and Intercessor, not
          only is unworthiness dismissed, but boldness and assurance of faith is
          encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, as we remarked, it was a free-will offering that we here
          presented—the overflowings of a heart filled with love. No constraint
          was necessary. Prayer was delightful. He was not forced upon his
          knees. Let me seek fellowship with Him in presenting my free offering
          before my God. Does not He love it? Does not His free love to me
          deserve it? Did not my beloved Savior give a free-will offering of
          delight and of joy? And shall not His free-flowing love be my pattern
          and my principle? Shall His offering be free for me, and mine, be
          reluctant for Him? Shall He be ready with His blood for me, and I be
          backward with my mouth for Him? O my God, work Your own Almighty
          work—make me not only living, but &quot;willing in the day of Your
          power.&quot; Let the stream flow in the full tide of affectionate
          devotedness. Blessed Jesus! I would be Yours, and none other&#x27;s. I
          would tell the world, that I am captivated by Your love, and
          consecrated to Your service. Oh, let me &quot;rejoice for that I
          offered willingly.&quot; Great grace is it, that He is willing to
          accept my service. For what have I to offer, that is not already
          &quot;his own?&quot; But let me not forget to supplicate for further
          instruction—&#x27;Teach me Your judgments, that I may be directed to
          present a purer offering; that by more distinct and accurate knowledge
          of Your ways, my love may be enlarged, and my obedience more entire,
          until I &quot;stand perfect and complete in all the will of
          God.&quot;&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          109. My soul is continually in my hand, yet do I not forget Your law.
          110. The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from Your
          precepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Precarious health, or familiarity with dangers, may give peculiar
          emphasis to the phrase—My soul is continually in my hand. David, in
          his early public life, was in constant apprehension from the open
          violence and the secret machinations of his bitter enemy. Hunted down
          &quot;as a partridge in the mountains,&quot; and often scarcely
          escaping the snare which the wicked laid for him; at one time he could
          not but acknowledge, &quot;there is but a step between me and
          death;&quot; at another time he was tempted to say, &quot;I shall now
          perish one day by the hand of Saul.&quot; Subsequently the hand of his
          own son was aimed at his throne and his life. Yet could no peril shake
          his undaunted adherence to the law and precepts of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was the life of Jesus upon earth? Through the enmity of
          foes—various, opposite, yet combined—his soul was continually in his
          hand. Yet how wonderful was his calmness and serenity of mind, when
          surrounded by them all, like &quot;lions&quot; in power,
          &quot;dogs&quot; in cruelty, wolves in malice! A measure of this
          spirit belongs to every faithful disciple—not natural courage, but
          &quot;the spirit of power,&quot; as the gift of God, enabling him in
          the path of the precepts &quot;to withstand in the evil day, and
          having done all, to stand.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us again mark this confidence, illustrated in the open trials of
          the servants of God. Mark the Apostle, when &quot;the Holy Spirit
          witnessed to him in every city, that bonds and imprisonment awaited
          him. None of these things&quot;—said he, &quot;move me. I am ready not
          to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the
          Lord Jesus.&quot; He could look &quot;tribulation, or persecution, or
          peril, or sword,&quot; in the face; and, while he carried his soul
          continually in his hand, in true Christian heroism, in the most
          exalted triumph of faith, he could say in the name of himself and his
          companions in tribulation, &quot;No, in all these things we are more
          than conquerors.&quot; Nothing could make him flinch. Nothing could
          turn him back. Nothing could wring the love of the service of his God
          out of his heart. His principle was found invincible in the hour of
          trial—not, however, as a native energy of his heart, but &quot;through
          Him that loved him.&quot; Did he not speak and live in the spirit of
          this fearless confidence—Yet do I not forget Your law? Daniel&#x27;s
          history again shows the utter impotency of secret devices to produce
          apostasy in the children of God. When the wicked, after many an
          ineffectual attempt to &quot;find occasion or fault,&quot; were driven
          to lay a snare for him in &quot;the law of his God,&quot; this noble
          confessor of the faith continued to &quot;kneel upon his knees three
          times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did
          afore-time.&quot; The den of lions was far less fearful in his eyes
          than one devious step from the straight and narrow path. Sin was
          dreaded as worse than a thousand deaths. He surely then could have
          said—Yet I erred not from Your precepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how striking must it have been to David, in his imminent peril, to
          have seen the &quot;counsel of Ahithophel&quot;—regarded as oracular,
          when employed in the cause of God—now, when directed against the
          church, &quot;turned to foolishness!&quot;—an instance, only &quot;one
          of a thousand,&quot; of the ever-watchful keeping of the Great Head
          and Guardian of His Church. Thus does He over-rule the devices of the
          enemy for the establishment of His people&#x27;s dependence upon
          Himself. &quot;The wrath of man praises Him,&quot; and He &quot;takes
          the wise in his own craftiness.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the day of difficulty is a &quot;perilous time&quot; in the
          church. &quot;Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried.&quot;
          Have we been able to sustain the shock in a steady adherence to the
          law and precepts of God? This is indeed the time, when genuine faith
          will be found of inestimable value. In such a time, David experienced
          the present blessing of having chosen the Lord for his God. When
          clouds began to gather blackness, and surrounding circumstances to the
          eye of sense engendered despondency—faith realized All-sufficient
          support; and &quot;David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.&quot;
          And is not David&#x27;s God &quot;our God, the health of our
          countenance,&quot; the guide of our path, the God of our salvation?
          Oh, let us not rest, until his confidence becomes ours, &quot;What
          time I am afraid, I will trust in You.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the cross, which proves and establishes the Christian, sifts the
          unsound professor as chaff. Nothing but this solid principle of faith
          can resist either the persecution or the snare. Many desire conformity
          to Christ and His people in everything but in their cross. They would
          attain their honor without the steps that led them to it. Dread this
          flinching spirit. Reject it—as did our Lord—with indignation. It
          &quot;savors not of God.&quot; It is the voice of Satan, who would
          promise a pillow of carnal ease under our heads—a path of roses under
          our feet—but a path of slumber, of delusion, and of ruin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The time of special need is at hand with us all, when we shall need
          substance and reality for our support—the true confidence of a living
          faith. Those who have never felt the nearness of eternity, can have
          but a faint idea of what we shall need in the hour when &quot;flesh
          and heart fail,&quot; to fix a sure unshaken foot upon &quot;the Rock
          of ages.&quot; &quot;Watch, therefore,&quot; for you know not how soon
          you may be ready to say, My soul is in my hand, quivering on the eve
          of departure to the Judge. &quot;Let your loins be girded about, and
          your lights burning! and you yourselves like men that wait for the
          Lord, when He will return from the wedding; that when He comes and
          knocks, they may open unto Him immediately. Blessed are those
          servants, whom the Lord, when He comes, shall find watching; verily I
          say unto you, that He shall gird Himself, and make them to sit down to
          meat, and will come forth and serve them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          111. Your testimonies have I taken as an heritage forever, for they
          are the rejoicing of my heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#x27;Precious Bible: what a treasure!&#x27; The testimonies of
          God—the declaration of his will in doctrine—obligation—and privilege!
          David had felt their value, as the stay of his soul in shaking and
          sifting trial. But how did he claim his interest in them? Not by
          purchase, or by merit, it was his heritage. As a child of Abraham, he
          was an &quot;heir according to promise.&quot; They—all that is
          contained in them, &quot;the Lord Himself,&quot; the sum and substance
          of all, &quot;was the portion of his inheritance.&quot; Man looks at
          his heritage. &#x27;This land—this estate—or this kingdom is
          mine.&#x27; The child of God looks round on the universe—on both
          worlds—on God Himself with His infinite perfections—and says,
          &quot;All things are mine.&quot; My title is more sure than to any
          earthly heritage. Every promise is sprinkled with &quot;the blood of
          the everlasting covenant,&quot; as the seal of its blessings, and the
          pledge of their performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But not only are they my heritage;—by my own intelligent choice I have
          taken them to be so. A blessing is it to have them. But the blessing
          of blessings is to have them made good—applied—sealed—made my own; so
          that, like the minor come to age, I take possession of my heritage, I
          live on it, I live in it, it is my treasure, my portion. If a man is
          known by his heritage, let me be known by mine. Let it &quot;be known
          and read of all men,&quot; that I count not the world my happiness,
          but that I take my Bible, &#x27;Here is my heritage. Here I can live
          royally—richer upon bare promises than all the treasures of earth
          could make me. My resources never fail when all besides fail. When all
          earthly heritage shall have passed away, mine endures forever.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me not then entertain a low estimate of this precious heritage.
          &quot;Heirs of promise&quot; are entitled to &quot;strong
          consolation.&quot; What belongs to a &quot;joint-heir with
          Christ,&quot; interested in the unchanging love of Jehovah from
          eternity, but the language of triumphant exultation? The first view,
          as it passed before my eyes, was the rejoicing of my heart; and never
          could I be satisfied, until I had taken it as my soul-satisfying and
          eternal portion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Need we then entreat you, believer, to show to the world, that the
          promises of your heritage are not an empty sound—that they impart a
          Divine reality of support and enjoyment—and that an interest in them
          habitually realized is a blessed, a heavenly portion? Should your
          heart, however, at any time be captivated by the transient prospect
          before your eyes: should you be led to imagine some substantial value
          in this world&#x27;s treasures—you will have forgotten the peculiar
          preeminence of your heritage—its enduring character. But what are the
          gaudy follies—the glittering emptiness of this passing scene, in
          comparison with your heavenly prospects, or even of your present
          sources of enjoyment!
        </p>
        <p>
          We can readily account for the affecting indifference with which
          &quot;the men of the world&quot; barter away these treasures, as Esau
          did his birthright, for very trifles. They have no present interest in
          them. &quot;They have their portion in this life. They have received
          their consolation.&quot; But, oh! how soon, having spent their all,
          will they &quot;begin to be in&quot; infinite, eternal
          &quot;want!&quot; Yet, having no interest in this heavenly heritage,
          they can have no pleasure in surveying it. If, therefore, conscience
          imposes upon them the drudgery of casting their careless eye over it,
          what wonder if they should find nothing to enliven their hopes, or to
          attract their hearts? What communion can worldly hearts hold with this
          heavenly treasure? What spiritual light, as the source of heavenly
          comfort, can penetrate this dark recess? As well might the inhabitant
          of the subterraneous cavern expect the cheerful light of the sun, as
          the man, whose eyes and heart are in the center of the earth, enjoy
          the spiritual perception of an interest in the heritage of the people
          of God. If, however, the darkness and difficulties of the word are
          pleaded in excuse for ignorance; let those indolent triflers confess,
          how small a portion of that persevering devotedness, which has been
          employed in gathering together the perishing stores of this world, has
          been given to search into this hidden mine of unsearchable riches!
        </p>
        <p>
          O my soul, if I can lay claim to this blessed heritage, I envy not the
          miser his gold! Rather would I adore that grace, which has &quot;made
          me to differ&quot; from him; and given me a far happier and far richer
          heritage. But let me be daily enriching myself from this imperishable
          store; so that, poor as I am in myself, and seeming to &quot;have
          nothing,&quot; I may in reality be &quot;possessing all things.&quot;
          Let the recollection of the rich heritage of light, comfort, peace,
          and strength, furnished in the word, be my abundant joy: and bind my
          heart to a closer adherence to its obligations, and to a more habitual
          apprehension of its privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
          112. I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes always, even to
          the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist had just been rejoicing in his privileges. He now binds
          himself to his obligations—and that not for a day—but even to the end.
          Observe where he begins his work—not with the eye—the ear—the
          tongue—but with the heart, &quot;for out of the heart are the issues
          of life.&quot; And yet this inclining of the heart to the Lord&#x27;s
          statutes is as much the work of God as to create a world; and as soon
          could &quot;the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his
          spots,&quot; as we could &quot;do good, who are accustomed to do
          evil.&quot; David was very far from meaning, that any act of his own
          power could turn the channel of his affections out of their natural
          course. But prayer, such as he had often poured out, sets every
          principle of the soul in action, and, in dependence upon the Holy
          Spirit, he inclines his heart. Thus we do what we do; but God enables
          us, &#x27;preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working
          with us, when we have that good will&#x27; (Are. X.)—not working
          without or against us, but in us—through us—with us—by us. His
          preventing grace makes the first impressions, and His assisting grace
          enables us to follow. Weak indeed are our purposes, and fading our
          resolutions, unsupported by Divine grace. Yet renewing strength is
          given to the &quot;waiting&quot; Christian, even to &quot;mount up on
          eagles&#x27; wings, to run without weariness, and to walk without
          fainting.&quot; Conscious as we are, that &quot;without Christ we can
          do nothing,&quot; it is no less true, that we &quot;can do all things
          through Christ which strengthens us.&quot; Let us exercise, then, the
          grace already given, in dependence upon a continued supply; and
          turning to Him with freedom and delight, we shall incline our hearts
          with full purpose to perform His statutes always, even unto the end.
          This is God&#x27;s way of quickening the dead soul to life and motion;
          alluring it by an inexpressible sweetness, and at the same moment, by
          an invincible power, drawing it to Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every step indeed to the end will be a conflict with indwelling sin,
          in the form of remaining enmity, sloth, or unbelief. But how
          encouraging is it to trace every tender prayer, every contrite groan,
          every spiritual desire, to the assisting, upholding influence of the
          &quot;free spirit of God!&quot; The continual drawing of the Spirit
          will be the principle to perseverance. The same hand that gave the new
          bias for a heavenward motion will be put forth to quicken that motion
          even unto the end. &#x27;I can hardly hold on,&#x27;—the believer
          might say—&#x27;from one step to another.&#x27; How can I then dare to
          hope, that I shall hold on a constant course—a daily conflict to the
          end? But was it not Almighty power that supported the first step in
          your course? And is not the same Divine help pledged to every
          successive step of difficulty? Doubt not, then, that &quot;He is
          faithful that has promised:&quot; dare to be &quot;confident of this
          very thing, that He which has begun a good work in you, will perform
          it until the day of Jesus Christ.&quot; And in this confidence go on
          to &quot;work out your salvation with fear and trembling; for it is
          God which works in you both to will and to do of His good
          pleasure.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>113. I hate vain thoughts, but Your law do I love.</p>
        <p>
          The fall of man has misplaced his affections. Love was originally made
          for God and His law;—hatred, for sin. Now man loves what he ought to
          hate, and hates what he ought to love. The work of Divine grace is to
          restore the disordered affections to their proper center, and to
          bestow them on their right object;—hating vain thoughts, and loving
          the law of God. Few think of the responsibility of their thoughts; as
          if they were too trifling to be connected with any solemn account. The
          enlightened soul, however, learns to make a conscience of his
          thoughts. Here is the seminal principle of sin. How must a radical
          remedy be applied?
        </p>
        <p>
          Vain thoughts are the natural produce of the unrenewed heart, and of
          the yet unrenewed part of the believer&#x27;s heart. Who that
          &quot;knows the plague of his own heart,&quot; and the spirituality of
          the Christian walk with God, does not constantly complain of their
          baneful influence? The child of God longs that his &quot;every thought
          may be brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.&quot; But he
          &quot;sees another law in his members, warring against the law of his
          mind;&quot; so that &quot;when he would do good, evil is present with
          him.&quot; When he would &quot;attend upon the Lord without
          distraction;&quot; many times, even in a single exercise, does he
          forget his sacred employment. Sin seems to enter into every pore of
          his soul; and a cloud of vain thoughts darkens every avenue to
          communion with God. He would gladly say, &quot;My heart is fixed, my
          heart is fixed;&quot; but he finds his affections wandering, as
          &quot;the eyes of the fool, in the ends of the earth,&quot; as if
          there were no object of Divine attraction to his soul. We do not hear
          the worldling, or indeed the servant of God in his worldly
          employments, complaining of this burden. He can bring to deep,
          important, and anxious concerns of this world, all that intensity and
          fixedness of attention which the emergency may demand. Indeed, the
          wily adversary would rather assist than hinder this concentration of
          mind, as diverting the soul from the far more momentous and
          interesting subjects of eternity. But never do the &quot;sons of God
          come to present themselves before the Lord,&quot; except &quot;Satan
          comes also among them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Vain thoughts are his ceaseless hindrances to our spiritual communion
          with God. Are we aware of the subtlety, and therefore the peculiar
          danger, of this temptation? We should instinctively start from an
          enticement to open transgression. The incursion of defiling or
          blasphemous thoughts would be such a burden, that we should &quot;have
          no rest in our spirit,&quot; while they remain undisturbed within us.
          But perhaps neither of these temptations are so formidable as the
          crowd of thoughts of every kind, incessantly running to and fro in the
          mind; the indulgence of which, though not actually sinful in itself,
          yet as effectually restrains the soul from communion with God, as the
          most hateful injections. These are &quot;the little foxes, that spoil
          the tender grapes.&quot; No—the thoughts may be even spiritual in
          their nature, and yet vain in their tendency; because unsuitable to
          the present frame, and calculated, and indeed intended by the great
          enemy, to divert the mind from some positive duty. Who has not felt a
          serious thought upon an unseasonable subject, and an unseasonable
          time, to be in its consequences a vain thought—the secret impulse of
          the false &quot;angel of light,&quot; dividing the attention between
          two things, so that neither of them may be wholly done, done to any
          purpose, done at all? If at any time &quot;iniquity has been regarded
          in the heart;&quot; if the world in any of its thousand forms has
          regained a temporary ascendancy; or if lusting imaginations are not
          constantly &quot;held in&quot; as &quot;with bit and bridle;&quot;
          these vain thoughts, ever ready to force their entrance, will at such
          seasons &quot;get an advantage of us.&quot; Restless in their
          workings, they keep no sabbaths: and can only be successfully met by a
          watchful and unceasing warfare.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may indeed be sometimes difficult, in the midst of this continual
          trial, to maintain a clear sense of adoption. But this is the
          distinctive mark of Christian sincerity:—Do we cordially hate them, as
          exceedingly sinful in the sight of God, hurtful to our own souls and
          contrary to our new nature? If we cannot altogether prevent their
          entrance, or eject them from their settlement, are we careful not to
          invite them, not to entertain them, not to suffer them to &quot;lodge
          within us?&quot; This active hatred is a satisfactory proof that they
          are not so much the natural suggestion of the heart, as the injections
          of the enemy of our peace. They are at least so directly opposed to
          our better will and dominant bias, that we may say, &quot;If I do that
          I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in
          me.&quot; Our affliction and conflict with them prove that they dwell
          with us—not as welcome guests, or as the family of the house—but as
          &quot;thieves and robbers.&quot; Their indulgence constitutes our sin.
          Their indwelling may be considered only as our temptation. They
          supply, indeed, continual matter for watchfulness, humiliation, and
          resistance; yet so far as they are abhorred and resisted, they are
          rather our infirmities than our iniquities, and leave no stain of
          actual guilt upon the conscience. An increasing sense of the
          sinfulness of sin, and of the extent of duty, will indeed show their
          deeper aggravations and more persevering opposition. Still, however,
          even while we groan under their defiling, distracting influence, in
          our best services, we may assure our confidence in Him, who
          &quot;spares us, as a man spares his own son that serves him,&quot;
          and who will gather up the broken parts of our prayers with merciful
          acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the subjugation of this evil—even though we be secured from its
          condemnation—is a matter of the deepest concern. Forget not—oh, may
          the impression be indelible!—that it was for these vain thoughts that
          the Savior was nailed to the cross. Here lies the ground of
          self-loathing—the quickening principle of conflict and exertion. Let
          the heart—the seat of this evil disease—be continually washed in the
          cleansing blood of Calvary; for until the corrupt fountain be
          cleansed, it must ever &quot;send forth bitter waters.&quot; Let it be
          diligently &quot;kept,&quot; and carefully filled, so that it may be a
          &quot;good treasure bringing forth good things.&quot; Let there be the
          continued exercise of that &quot;watchfulness&quot; &quot;which is
          unto prayer,&quot; combined with an unflinching adherence to plain and
          obvious duty. Let the temptation to desist awhile from services so
          polluted, that they appear rather to mock God than to worship Him, be
          met on the onset with the most determined opposition. Once admit this
          suggestion, and our active enemy will pour in successive incursions of
          vain thoughts into our perplexed and yielding minds, to turn us back
          step by step in our attempts to approach God. If, therefore, we cannot
          advance as we could wish, let us advance as we can. If a connected
          train of thought or expression fails us, let us only change—not
          surrender—our posture of resistance; substituting sighs, desires,
          tears, and &quot;groanings&quot;—for words, and casting ourselves upon
          our God in the simple confidence of faith, &quot;Lord, all my desire
          is before You, and my groaning is not hid from You. You tell my
          wanderings: put my tears into Your bottle: are they not in Your
          book?&quot; It is far better to wander in duty than from it. For if
          any duty be neglected on account of the defilement that is mingled
          with it, for the same reason we must neglect every other duty, and, as
          the final consequence, the worship of God would be abolished from the
          earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much of our successful warfare, however, depends upon an accurate and
          well-digested acquaintance with our own hearts—upon a discovery of the
          bias of the mind in our unoccupied moments, and of the peculiar
          seasons and circumstances that give most power to temptation. This
          once known, set a double watch against those doors, by which the enemy
          has been accustomed to find his most convenient and unobstructed
          entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must not forget the effective means suggested by David&#x27;s
          experience—the love of God&#x27;s law. Here rises the native enmity
          against God—not as the Creator, but the Law-giver—and therefore
          against His law as the dictate of His will. Here, then, is the power
          of grace subduing this enmity. Not only I fear, and therefore through
          fear I keep, but I love Your law. And &#x27;He who loves a holy
          law&#x27;—remarks an excellent old writer—&#x27;cannot but hate a vain
          thought.&#x27; For if the law be the transcript of the image of God,
          the thoughts affectionately drawn out towards him must naturally fix
          the image of the beloved friend upon the mind, and by a sweet
          constraint fasten down the thoughts to Divine contemplation. Are we
          then ever winged with an elevating love to the Savior? And do we not
          find our hearts start out from their worldly employments with frequent
          glances and flights towards the object of our desire? And will not
          this communion of love gradually mold the soul into a fixed delight,
          exciting our hatred, and strengthening our resistance of every sinful
          affection? Thus, as love to the law stirs up the powers of the renewed
          man, &quot;spiritual wickedness&quot; will be abhorred, conflicted
          with, and overcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet these defilements will remain to die with the last breathings of
          the old man; which, though crucified indeed and expiring, will
          struggle with fearful strength and unabated enmity to the end. And let
          them remain, as humbling mementos of our unclean nature, &quot;shaped
          in iniquity, and conceived in sin;&quot; and as enlivening our
          anticipations of that blessed place, where &quot;shall in no wise
          enter anything that defiles;&quot; where vain thoughts, and whatever
          beside might &quot;separate between us and our God,&quot; will be
          unknown forever. Meanwhile let them endear to us the free
          justification of the Gospel; let them lead us daily and hourly to
          &quot;the fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness;&quot; and
          enhance in our view that heavenly intercession, which provides for the
          perfect cleansing and accepting of services even such as ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed contemplation! Jesus prays not for us, as we do for ourselves.
          His intercession is without distraction—without interruption. If we
          are then so dead, that we cannot, and so guilty, that we dare not,
          pray, and so wandering in our vain thoughts, that our prayers appear
          to be scattered to the winds, rather than to ascend to heaven—if on
          these accounts combined, we &quot;are so troubled, that we cannot
          speak:&quot; yet always is there One to speak for us, of whom &quot;a
          voice from heaven&quot; testified for our encouragement,
          &quot;saying—This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&quot;
          With such hopes, motives, and encouragements, let us &quot;continue
          instant in prayer,&quot; until we pray, and that we may pray. Let us
          supplicate our Lord with restless importunity, that His omnipotent
          love would take hold of these hearts, which every moment sin and Satan
          seem ready to seize. At the same time, conscious of our hatred of
          every interruption to His service, and of the simplicity of our
          affection to His holy law, let us hold fast that confidence before
          Him, which will issue in perfect peace and established consolation.
        </p>
        <p>114. You are my hiding place, and my shield; I hope in Your word.</p>
        <p>
          We have seen the unremitting vigilance of the enemy pursuing the man
          of God in his secret retirement with painful distraction. See how he
          runs to his hiding-place. Here is our main principle of safety—not our
          strivings or our watchfulness, but our faith. Flee instantly to Jesus.
          He is the sinner&#x27;s hiding-place, &quot;the man,&quot;—that
          wondrous man, &quot;in whom dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead
          bodily.&quot; Yes, Jesus exposed Himself to the fury of &quot;the
          tempest,&quot; that He might become a hiding-place, for us. The broken
          law pursued with its relentless curse—&#x27;The sinner ought to
          die&#x27;—But You are my hiding-place, who has &quot;redeemed me from
          the curse of the law, being made a curse for me.&quot; &quot;The fiery
          darts&quot; pour in on every side: but the recollection of past
          security awakens my song of acknowledgment, &quot;You have been a
          strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a
          refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of
          &#x27;the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.&quot; Our
          hiding-place covers us from the power of the world. &quot;In
          Me&quot;—says our Savior, &quot;you shall have peace. Be of good
          cheer! I have overcome the world.&quot; Helpless to resist the great
          enemy, our Lord brings us to His wounded side, and hides us there. We
          &quot;overcome him by the blood of the Lamb.&quot; To all accusations
          from every quarter, our challenge is ready, &quot;Who shall lay
          anything to the charge of God&#x27;s elect?&quot; From the fear of
          death, our hiding-place still covers us. &quot;Jesus through death has
          destroyed him that had the power of death.&quot; Against the sting of
          this last enemy, a song of thanksgiving is put into our mouth, &quot;O
          death! where is your sting? O grave! where is your victory? Thanks be
          to God, which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus
          Christ.&quot; Thus is &quot;the smoking flax,&quot; which the malice
          of Satan strives to extinguish, not &quot;quenched;&quot; nor is
          &quot;the bruised reed,&quot; which seems beyond the hope of
          restoration, &quot;broken.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the completeness of our security is graphically portrayed—You are
          my hiding-place, to cover from danger—my shield, also to protect me in
          it. Either I shall be kept from trouble, that it shall not come; or in
          trouble, that it shall not hurt me. The hiding-place alone would be
          imperfect security, as being limited to one place. But my shield is
          moveable, wherever be the point of danger or assault. I can
          &quot;quench the dart&quot; that is aimed at my soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a hiding-place implies also secrecy. And truly the believer&#x27;s
          is &quot;a hidden life,&quot; beyond the comprehension of the world.
          He mixes with them in the common communion of life. But while seen of
          man, he is dwelling &quot;in the secret of the Lord&#x27;s
          tabernacle,&quot; safe in the midst of surrounding danger, guarded by
          invincible strength. Often, indeed, must the world be surprised at his
          constancy, amid all their varied efforts to shake his steadfastness.
          They know not &quot;the secret of the Lord, which is with them that
          fear Him.&quot; And never could he have had a just conception of the
          all-sufficiency of his God, until he finds it above him, around him,
          underneath him, in all the fullness of everlasting love—his
          hiding-place, and his shield. Thus in the heart of the enemy&#x27;s
          country &quot;he dwells on high, and his place of defense is the
          munitions of rocks.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But are we acquainted with this hiding-place? How have we discovered
          it? Are we found in it, and careful to abide in it? Within its walls
          &quot;that wicked one touches us not.&quot; Yet never shall we venture
          outside the walls unprotected, but his assault will give us some
          painful remembrance of our unwatchfulness. And then do we prize our
          shield, and run behind it for constant security. Remember, every other
          hiding-place &quot;the waters will overflow.&quot; Every other shield
          is a powerless defense. Surely then the word which has discovered this
          security to us, is a firm warrant for our hope. And, therefore, every
          sinner, enclosed in the covert of love, will be ready to declare—I
          hope in Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          115. Depart from me, you evil-doers; for I will keep the commandments
          of my God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safe and quiet in his hiding-place, and behind his shield, David
          deprecates all attempts to disturb his peace—Depart from me, you
          evil-doers. He had found them to be opposed to his best interests; and
          he dreaded their influence in shaking his resolution for his God.
          Indeed such society must always hinder alike the enjoyment and the
          service of God. &quot;Can two walk together, except they be
          agreed?&quot; And can we be &quot;agreed,&quot; and walk in fellowship
          with God, except we be at variance with the principles, the standard,
          and conduct of a world that is &quot;enmity against Him?&quot; Not
          more needful was the exhortation to the first Christians than to
          ourselves, &quot;Save yourselves from this untoward generation.&quot;
          True fellowship with God implies therefore a resolute separation from
          the ungodly. Secure in the hiding-place, and covered with the shield
          of our covenant God, let us meet their malice, and resist their
          enticements, with the undaunted front of &quot;a good soldier of Jesus
          Christ.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Not that we would indulge morose or ascetic seclusion. We are
          expressly enjoined to courtesy and kindness; to that wise and
          considerate &quot;walk towards them that are without,&quot; which
          &quot;adorns the doctrine of God our Savior,&quot; and indeed in some
          instances has been more powerful even than the word itself, to
          &quot;win souls to Christ.&quot; But when they would tempt us to a
          devious or backsliding step—when our connection with them entices us
          to a single act of conformity to their standard, dishonorable to God,
          and inconsistent with our profession—then must we take a bold and
          unflinching stand—Depart from me, you evil-doers for I will keep the
          commandments of my God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This resolution gives no countenance to the self-delusive notion of
          maintaining an intimate connection with professed evil-doers, for the
          kind purpose of recommending our religion to their acceptance—a
          scheme, which requires a rare degree of caution and simplicity to
          attempt without entangling the conscience; and which, for the most
          part at least, it is to be feared, is only a specious covering for the
          indulgence of a worldly spirit. If the men of the world are to be met,
          and their society invited, for the accomplishment of this benevolent
          intention, it must be upon the principle of the Lord&#x27;s command to
          his prophet, &quot;Let them return unto You: but return not You to
          them.&quot; The amiable desire to &quot;please our neighbor&quot; is
          limited to the single end, that it should be &quot;for his good to
          edification.&quot; And whenever this end and restriction has been
          overlooked, it is sufficiently evident that self-gratification has
          been the moving principle: and that the distinctive mark of the
          Christian character—bearing the cross, and confessing the name of our
          Divine Master—has been obscured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, however, in the struggle of conscience, an apprehension of
          danger is not altogether forgotten, and the question is asked, with
          some trembling of spirit, &quot;How far may I conform to the world,
          without endangering the loss of my religion?&quot; But, not to speak
          of the insincerity and self-deception of such a question, it would be
          better answered by substituting another in its place, &quot;How far
          may I be separate from the world, and yet be destitute of the vital
          principle?&quot; Scrutinize, in every advancing step toward the world,
          the workings of your own heart. Suspect its reasonings. Listen to the
          first awakened conviction of conscience. Though it be only a whisper,
          or a hint, it is probably the indication of the Divine will. And never
          forget, that this experiment of worldly conformity, often as it has
          been tried, has never answered the desired end. However this
          compromise may have recommended ourselves, no progress has been made
          in recommending our Master; since His name—whether from unwatchfulness
          or cowardice on our part, or from the overpowering flow of the world
          on the other side—has probably in such society scarcely passed over
          our lips with any refreshment or attentiveness. Indeed, so far from
          commending our religion by this accommodation, we have succeeded in
          ingratiating ourselves in their favor, only so far as we have been
          content to keep it out of sight; while at the same time, our yielding
          conformity to their taste, and habits, and conversation, has virtually
          sanctioned their erroneous standard of conduct; and tended to deceive
          them with the self-complacent conviction, that it approaches as near
          to the Scriptural elevation, as is absolutely required. The final
          result, therefore, of this attempt to recommend the Gospel to those
          who have no &quot;heart for it,&quot; is—that our own consciences have
          been ensnared, while they retain all their principles unaltered.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must surely be obvious, that such a course is plainly opposed to
          the revealed declarations of Scripture, and bears the decisive
          character of unfaithfulness to our Great Master. We might also ask,
          whether our love to the Lord can be in fervent exercise, while we
          &quot;love them that hate Him?&quot;—whether our hatred of sin can be
          active and powerful, while we can find pleasure in the society of
          those, whose life &quot;without God in the world,&quot; is an
          habitual, willful course of rebellion against Him?—whether we can have
          any deep or experimental sense of our own weakness, when thus
          venturing into temptation?—whether by unnecessary contact with the
          world, we can expect to &quot;go upon hot coals,&quot; and our
          &quot;feet not be burned?&quot;—or, in fact, whether we are not
          forgetting the dictates of common prudence in forsaking the path of
          safety for a slippery, but more congenial path? Is no harm to be
          anticipated from a willful, self-pleasing association? Is it likely to
          be less dangerous to us than it was to an Apostle? or, because we
          conceive ourselves to have more strength, shall we use less
          watchfulness, and show more presumption?
        </p>
        <p>
          But, supposing Scripture not to determine the path of duty with
          infallible certainty; let this line of conduct be subjected to the
          impartial scrutiny of our own hearts, and of the effects, whether
          neutral or positively detrimental, which have resulted from it to
          ourselves, or to the church. Have we not felt this fellowship with
          evil-doers to be an hindrance in keeping the commandments of our God?
          If it has not always ended in open conformity to their maxims; or if,
          contrary to our apprehensions, it does not appear to sanction their
          principles, yet have we realized no deadening unfavorable influence?
          Has the spirit of prayer sustained no injury in this atmosphere? Have
          we never felt the danger of imbibing their taste—the spirit of their
          conversation and general conduct; which, without fixing any blot upon
          our external profession, must insensibly estrange our best affections
          from God! And have we never considered the injury of this worldly
          association to the Gospel in weakening by an apparent want of decision
          &quot;on the Lord&#x27;s side,&quot; the sacred cause which we are
          pledged to support; and obscuring the spiritual character of the
          people of God as a distinct and separate people? In a providential
          connection with evil-doers, we go safely in the spirit of humility,
          watchfulness, and prayer; and this connection, felt to be a cross, is
          not likely to prove a snare. But does not union of spirit with them,
          to whom David says, with holy determination—Depart from me—and to whom
          David&#x27;s Lord will one day say, &quot;Depart!&quot;—prove a want
          of fellowship with his spirit, and an essential unfitness for
          communion with the society of heaven? The children of this world can
          have no more real communion with the children of light, than darkness
          has with light. As great is the difference between the Christian and
          the world, as between heaven and hell—as between the sounds,
          &quot;Come, you blessed,&quot; and, &quot;Depart, you cursed.&quot;
          The difference, which at that solemn day will be made for eternity,
          must, therefore, be visibly made now. They must depart from us, or we
          from God. We cannot walk with them both. &#x27;Defilement&#x27;—as Mr.
          Cecil remarks—&#x27;is inseparable from the world.&#x27; We cannot
          hold communion with God, in the spirit of the world; and, therefore,
          separation from the world, or separation from God, is the alternative.
          Which way—which company—is most congenial to our taste? Fellowship
          will be a component part of our heavenly happiness. Shall we not then
          walk on earth with those, with whom we hope to spend our eternity,
          that our removal hence may be a change of place only, not of company?
          May we have grace to listen to our Father&#x27;s voice of love,
          &quot;Therefore, come out from among them, and be separate, says the
          Lord; and touch not the unclean thing: and I will receive you, and
          will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says
          the Lord Almighty.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          116. Uphold me according unto Your word, that I may live: and let me
          not be ashamed of my hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lest the Psalmist should seem to have been self-confident in his
          rejection of the society of the ungodly, and his determination to
          adhere to his God; here, as on former occasions, mindful of his own
          weakness, he commits himself to the upholding grace of God. He does
          not content himself with commanding the evil-doer to depart. He pleads
          for his God to come to him. He wants not only the hindrances to be
          removed, but the vouchsafement of present supporting grace. Such is
          our urgent continual need! Every circumstance has its temptation.
          Every change of condition is specially trying—and what is he in
          himself? unstable as water! Indeed the highest Archangel before the
          throne stands only as he is upheld by the Lord, and may unite with the
          weakest child in the Lord&#x27;s family in the acknowledgment,
          &quot;By the grace of God I am what I am.&quot; Much more, therefore,
          must I, pressed on every side with daily conflict and temptation, and
          conscious of my own weakness and liability to fall, &quot;come to the
          throne of grace,&quot; for &quot;grace to help in time of need.&quot;
          My plea is the word of promise—according to Your word, &quot;as your
          days, so shall your strength be.&quot; &quot;Fear not&quot;—is the
          language of my upholding God, &quot;for I am with you; be not
          dismayed, for I am your God: I will strengthen you: yes, I will help
          you: yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of My
          righteousness.&quot; Blessed be the goodness that made the promise,
          and that guides the hand of my faith, as it were, to fasten upon it!
        </p>
        <p>
          But why do I need the promise? why do I plead it? but that I may
          live—that I may know that life, which is found and enjoyed &quot;in
          the favor&quot; of God? Nothing seems worth a serious thought besides;
          nothing else deserves the name. And therefore new life, &quot;life
          more abundantly&quot;—let it be the burden of every prayer—the cry of
          every moment. Thus upheld by the Lord&#x27;s grace, and living in His
          presence, I hope to feel the increasing support of my Christian hope.
          Though I have just before expressed it in God&#x27;s word—though I
          have &quot;made my boast in the Lord,&quot; as my hiding-place and my
          shield, yet conscious helplessness leads me earnestly to pray—Let me
          not be ashamed of my hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes—Jesus is the sinner&#x27;s hope, &quot;the hope set before&quot;
          His people, to which they &quot;flee for the refuge&quot; of their
          souls. And well may our &quot;hope&quot; in Him be called &quot;an
          anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast.&quot; How does the distressed
          church plead with the hope of Israel, and put her God in remembrance
          of this His own name, that she might not be ashamed of her hope! And
          how does she—with every member of her body—eventually learn by this
          pleading, to say in the confidence of faith, &quot;I know whom I have
          believed!&quot; And is there not a solid ground for this confidence?
          Is not the &quot;stone that is laid in Zion for a foundation,&quot; a
          &quot;tried stone?&quot; Has it not been tried by thousands and
          millions of sinners—no, more, tried by God Himself, and found to be
          &quot;a sure foundation?&quot; Yet still, that I may &quot;hold fast
          the beginning of my confidence,&quot; and &quot;the rejoicing of my
          hope, firm unto the end,&quot; I must persevere in prayer—Uphold me
          according unto Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          David, when left to his own weakness, was ashamed of his hope:,
          &quot;I said in my haste, I am cut off from before Your eyes.&quot; At
          another time, when upheld in a season of accumulated trial, &quot;he
          encouraged himself in the Lord his God.&quot; Thus I see &quot;wherein
          my great strength lies,&quot; and how impotent I am, when left to
          myself. What a mercy, that my salvation will never for a single moment
          be in my own keeping! what need have I to pray to be saved from
          myself! How delightful is the exercise of faith in going to the Strong
          for strength! The issue of my spiritual conflicts is certain. He who
          is the author, will ever be the upholder, of the &quot;hidden
          life&quot; in His people. It is a part of His own life, and therefore
          can never perish. The Tempter himself will flee, when he marks the
          poor, feeble, fainting soul, upheld according to the word of his God,
          and placed in safety beyond the reach of his malice. Not, however,
          that, as I once supposed, my weakness will ever be made strong; but
          that I shall daily grow more sensible of it, shall, stay myself more
          simply upon infinite everlasting strength; and &quot;most gladly shall
          I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon
          me.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          117. Hold me up, and I shall be safe; and I will have respect unto
          Your statutes continually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such is my sense of need and peril, that my only refuge lies in
          &quot;continuing instant in prayer.&quot; I must send up one cry after
          another into my Father&#x27;s ear for the support of His upholding
          grace. For not only the consciousness of my weakness, but the danger
          of the slippery path before me, reminds me, that the safety of every
          moment depends upon my upholding faithful God. The ways of temptation
          are so many and imperceptible—the influence of it so appalling—the
          entrance into it so deceitful, so specious, so insensible—my own
          weakness and unwatchfulness so unspeakable—that I can do nothing but
          go on my way, praying at every step—Hold me up, and I shall be safe.
          Often, indeed, can I remember, when &quot;my feet were almost gone, my
          steps had well-near slipped:&quot; that I have been enabled to record,
          &quot;Your mercy, O Lord, held me up.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          How beautiful is the picture given of the church of old! &quot;Who is
          this that comes up from the wilderness, leaning upon her
          Beloved?&quot; This state of dependence was familiar to the Psalmist,
          and aptly delineates his affectionate, though conflicting, confidence.
          &quot;My soul follows hard after You: Your right hand upholds
          me.&quot; The recollection of the care of his God, from his earliest
          life, supplied encouragement for his present faith, and matter for
          unceasing praise, &quot;By You have I been held up from the womb; You
          are He who took me out of my mother&#x27;s affections: my praise shall
          be continually of You.&quot; We cannot wonder, then, that this
          confidence should sustain his soul in the contemplation of the
          remaining steps of his pilgrimage, and his prospects for eternity.
          &quot;Nevertheless&quot;—says he, &quot;I am continually with You: You
          have holden me by Your right hand. You shall guide me with Your
          counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.&quot; And, indeed, the
          more lively my spiritual apprehensions are, the more I shall realize
          the Lord by the operations of His grace as well as of His providence,
          &quot;compassing my path and my lying down;&quot; lest any hurt me,
          keeping me night and day.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it inquired—how the Lord holds up His people in this slippery path?
          &quot;Of the fullness of Jesus they all receive, and grace for
          grace;&quot; so that &quot;the life which they now live in the flesh,
          they live by the faith of the Son of God.&quot; And, therefore, if I
          am upheld, it is by the indwelling of the Spirit, who supplies from
          His infinite fountain of life all the strength and support I need
          throughout my dangerous way. By His Divine influence the dispensations
          of Providence also become the appointed means of drawing and keeping
          me near to my God. If, therefore, prosperity is endangering my soul,
          and strengthening my worldly bonds, may I not trust to the
          ever-watchful kindness of the Lord, to keep me low, and not to permit
          me to be at ease in my forgetfulness? If the pleasures of sense, if
          the esteem of the world, or the good report of the church, are
          bringing a bewitching snare upon my soul, my God will lead me into the
          pathway of the cross—in the &quot;valley of humiliation.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, is the secret of an unsteady walk—the neglect of leaning
          upon an Almighty arm! How fearfully is the danger of self-confidence
          unveiled! Standing by my own strength, very soon shall I be made to
          feel, that I cannot stand at all. No &quot;mountain&quot; seemed to
          &quot;stand stronger&quot; than Solomon&#x27;s: yet when he became the
          very &quot;fool&quot; that he describes, &quot;trusting in his own
          heart&quot;—how quickly was it removed!
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter thought in the foolishness of his heart, that he could have
          walked upon the water unsupported by the arm of his Lord: but a
          moment&#x27;s sense of weakness and danger brought him to his right
          mind: &quot;and, beginning to sink, he cried, saying—Lord! save
          me!&quot; Well would it have been for him, if his deliverance at that
          moment of peril had effectually rebuked his presumption. We should not
          then have heard from the same lips that language of most unwarranted
          self-confidence: &quot;Although all shall be offended, yet will not
          I:—if I should die with You, I will not deny You in any wise.&quot;
          Poor deluded disciple! You are on the brink of a grievous fall! Yet
          was he held up from utterly sinking. &quot;I have prayed for
          you&quot;—said the gracious Savior, &quot;that your faith fail
          not.&quot; And thus held up by the same faithful intercession of my
          powerful friend (whose prayers are not weak as mine, &quot;nor will He
          fail or be discouraged&quot; by my continual backslidings),
          &quot;I&quot; too—though in the atmosphere of danger, in the slippery
          path of temptation, shall be safe—safe from an ensnaring world—safe
          from a treacherous heart—safe in life—safe in death—safe in eternity.
          Thus does an interest in the covenant encourage—not presumption—but
          faith, in all its exercises of humility, watchfulness, diligence, and
          prayer; in this appointed way does the Lord securely &quot;keep the
          feet of His saints.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me not, then, forget, either my continual liability to fall if
          left to myself, or the faithful engagements of my covenant God, to
          &quot;keep me from falling.&quot; While I recollect for my comfort,
          that I &quot;stand by faith,&quot; still is the exhortation most
          needful, &quot;Be not high-minded, but fear.&quot; &quot;By faith I
          stand,&quot; as it concerns God; by fear as it regards myself. As
          light is composed of neither brilliant nor somber rays, but of the
          combination of both in simultaneous action, so is every Christian
          grace combined with its opposite, &quot;that it may be perfect and
          entire, wanting nothing.&quot; Hope, therefore, combined with fear,
          issues in that genuine, evangelical confidence, in which alone I can
          walk safely and closely with God. Let, then, the self-confident learn
          to distrust themselves, and the fearful be encouraged to trust their
          Savior; and in each let the recollection of grace and help given
          &quot;in time of need,&quot; lead to the steadfast resolution—I will
          have respect unto Your statutes continually. However self-denying they
          may be in their requirements: however opposed in their tendency to
          &quot;the desires of the flesh and of the mind,&quot; I take my God as
          the surety of my performance of them; and I desire to love them as the
          rule of my daily conduct, and the very element of heavenly happiness
          to my soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          118. You have trodden down all them that err from Your statutes: for
          their deceit is falsehood. 119. You put away all the wicked of the
          earth like dross; therefore I love Your testimonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist&#x27;s determination to keep the statutes of God was
          strengthened by marking His judgments on those that erred from them.
          And thus the Lord expects us to learn at their cost. The cheerful,
          grateful respect to His statutes marks also a difference of character
          indicative of a difference of state. &quot;His saints are in His hand,
          or sitting down at His feet;&quot; His enemies are trodden down under
          His feet in full conquest, and disgraceful punishment. His own people
          He has exalted to be &quot;heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
          Christ.&quot; Even now &quot;he has made them to sit together in
          heavenly places in Christ Jesus;&quot; and shortly will they &quot;be
          a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the
          hand of their God;&quot; while the ungodly are put away like dross
          from the precious gold. &quot;Reprobate silver shall men call them,
          because the Lord has rejected them.&quot; The same difference He makes
          even in chastening—upholding His own children under the scourging rod,
          lest they faint; but &quot;breaking the wicked with a rod of iron, and
          dashing them in pieces.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This separation has been from the beginning; in His conduct to the
          first two children of men; and in His selection of Enoch, Noah, and
          Abraham, from the world of the ungodly, &quot;as vessels of honor,
          meet for the Master&#x27;s use.&quot; In after ages, He made Egypt
          &quot;know, that He put a difference between the Egyptians and
          Israel.&quot; They were His own &quot;people, that should dwell
          alone,&quot; and not &quot;be reckoned among the nations&quot;—a
          people, whom He had &quot;formed for Himself, that they should show
          forth His praise.&quot; And the same difference He has made ever
          since, between His people and the world—in their character—their
          way—their exercises of mind—their services—their privileges—and their
          prospects. At the day of judgment, the separation will be
          complete—final—everlasting. &quot;&#x27;When the Son of Man shall come
          in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon
          the throne of His glory; and before Him shall be gathered all nations;
          and He shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his
          sheep from the goats. And He shall set the sheep on His right hand,
          but the goats on the left; and these shall go away into everlasting
          punishment; but the righteous into life eternal.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But mark the character—They err from God&#x27;s statutes—not in their
          minds, through ignorance; but &quot;in their hearts&quot; through
          obstinacy. They do not say, &#x27;Lord, we know not,&#x27; but,
          &quot;We desire not the knowledge of Your ways.&quot; It is not
          frailty, but unbelief; not want of knowledge, but love of sin—willful,
          damnable. Justly, therefore, are they stamped as the wicked of the
          earth, and marked out as objects of the Lord&#x27;s eternal
          frown—expectants of the &quot;vengeance of eternal fire.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And is not this a solemn warning to those &quot;that forget
          God&quot;—that &quot;they shall be turned into hell;&quot; to
          &quot;the proud&quot;—that in &quot;the day that shall burn as an
          oven, they shall be as stubble;&quot;—to the worldly—that in some
          &quot;night&quot; of forgetfulness, their &quot;souls will be required
          of them;&quot;—to the &quot;hypocrites in heart&quot;—that they
          &quot;are heaping up wrath?&quot; Thus does the eye of faith discern
          through the apparent disorder of a world in ruins, the just, holy, and
          wise government of God. &quot;Clouds and darkness are round about Him;
          righteousness and judgment are the habitation of His throne.&quot; If
          the wicked seem to triumph, and the righteous to be trodden down under
          their feet, it shall not be always so. &quot;The end&quot; and
          &quot;wages of sin is death.&quot; &quot;The ungodly shall not stand
          in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the
          righteous.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          How awful, then, and almost desperate their condition! Their deceit is
          falsehood; &quot;deceiving and being deceived&quot;—perhaps given up
          to believe their own lie—perhaps one or another &quot;blessing
          themselves in their own heart,&quot; saying, &#x27;I shall have peace,
          though I walk in the imagination of my own heart, to add drunkenness
          to thirst.&#x27; What, then, is our duty? Carnal selfishness says,
          &#x27;Be quiet—let them alone&#x27;—that is, &quot;Destroy them by
          our&quot; indolence and unfaithfulness, &quot;for whom Christ
          died.&quot; But what does Scripture, conscience, no more—what does
          common humanity say? &quot;Cry aloud, spare not.&quot; Awake the
          sleepers—sound the alarm, &quot;Now is the accepted time—the day of
          salvation!&quot; the moment to lift up the prayer, and stretch forth
          the hand for plucking the brands out of the fire. Tomorrow, the door
          may be shut, never to be opened more.
        </p>
        <p>
          How awful the judgment of being put away like dross! Look at Saul,
          when put away—going out, to harden himself in the sullen pride of
          despondency. Hear the fearful doom of Israel, &quot;Son of man, the
          house of Israel is to me become dross; all they are brass, and tin,
          and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the
          dross of silver. Therefore says the Lord God—Because you are all
          become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of
          Jerusalem, as they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and
          tin into the midst of the furnaces to blow the fire upon it, to melt
          it; so will I gather you in My anger and in My fury; and I will leave
          you there, and melt you.&quot; But how should this justice of the
          Lord&#x27;s proceedings endear His statutes to us! It is such a
          sensible demonstration of His truth, bringing with it such a close
          conviction of sovereign mercy to ourselves—not less guilty than they!
          Add to this—If He were less observant of sin—less strict in its
          punishment as a transgression of His word—we should lose that awful
          display of the holiness of the word, which commends it supremely to
          our love, &quot;Your word is very pure; therefore Your servant loves
          it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          120. My flesh trembles for fear of You; and I am afraid of Your
          judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The justice of God is a tremendously awful subject of contemplation,
          even to those who are safely shielded from its terrors. The believer,
          in the act of witnessing its righteous stroke upon the wicked of the
          earth, cannot forbear to cry out—My flesh trembles for fear of You.
          Thus did the holy men of old tremble, even with a frame approaching
          horror, in the presence of the Divine judgments. David trembled at the
          stroke of Uzzah, as if it came very near to himself. &quot;Destruction
          from God&quot;—says holy Job, &quot;was a terror to me: and by reason
          of His highness I could not endure.&quot; Such also was the
          Prophet&#x27;s strong sensation, &quot;When I heard, my belly
          trembled; my lips quivered at Your voice: rottenness entered into my
          bones.&quot; And thus, when God comes to tread down and put away His
          enemies for the display of the holiness of His character, and to
          excite the love of His people—those that stand by, secure under the
          covert of their hiding-place—cannot but &quot;take up their parable
          and say—Alas! who shall live, when God does this!&quot; The children
          of God reverence their Father&#x27;s anger. They cannot see it without
          an awful fear; and this trembling at His judgments upon the ungodly
          covers them from the heavy stroke. Those that refuse to tremble shall
          be made to feel, while those that are afraid of His judgments shall be
          secure. &quot;Only with Your eyes shall you behold, and see the reward
          of the wicked.&quot; &quot;I trembled in myself,&quot; said the
          prophet, &quot;that I might rest in the day of trouble.&quot; Even the
          manifestations of His coming &quot;for the salvation of His
          people&quot; are attended with all the marks of the most fearful
          terror—as if His voice would shake the earth to its very foundation,
          &quot;You caused judgment to be heard from heaven—the earth feared and
          was still: when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the
          earth.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          To mark this trembling as the character of the child of God, we need
          only contrast it with the ungodly scoffing, &quot;Where is the God of
          judgment? Where is the promise of His coming? The Lord will not do
          good, neither will He do evil.&quot; Thus do men dare to &quot;run
          upon the thick bosses of His bucklers;&quot; instead of trembling for
          fear of Him! This &quot;stoutness against the Lord,&quot; excites the
          astonishment of the hosts of heaven; so discordant is it to their
          notes of humble praise, &quot;Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and
          glorify Your name; for Your judgments are made manifest!&quot; Such is
          the special acceptance of this trembling spirit, that some shadow of
          it obtained a respite even for wicked Ahab, and a pardon for the
          penitent Ninevites; while its genuine &quot;tenderness of heart&quot;
          screened Josiah from the doom of his people, and will ever be regarded
          with the tokens of the favor of this terrible God. &quot;To this
          man,&quot; says he, &quot;will I look, even to him that is poor, and
          of a contrite spirit, and that trembles at My word.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Believers in Christ! rejoice in your deliverance from that &quot;fear
          which has torment.&quot; Yet cherish that holy reverential fear of the
          character and judgments of God, which will form your most effectual
          safeguard &quot;from presumptuous sins.&quot; The very supposition,
          that, if God had not engaged Himself to you by an unchangeable
          covenant, His fearful judgments would have been your eternal portion,
          is of itself sufficient to mingle the wholesome ingredient of fear
          with the most established assurance. What! can you look down into the
          burning bottomless gulf beneath your feet, without the recollection—If
          I were not immovably fastened to the &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; by the
          strong chain of everlasting love, this must have been my abode through
          the countless ages of eternity. If I had not been thus upheld by the
          grace, as well as by the providence, of God, I might have dropped out
          of His hand, as one and another not more rebellious than I have
          fallen, into this intolerable perdition! O God! my flesh trembles for
          fear of You; and I am afraid of Your judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the dread of the judgments of God is not necessarily of a slavish
          and tormenting character. &quot;His saints&quot; are called to
          &quot;fear Him;&quot; and their fear, so far from &quot;gendering unto
          bondage,&quot; is consistent with the strongest assurance; no, even is
          its fruit and effect. It is at once the principle of present
          obedience, and of final perseverance. It is the confession of
          weakness, unworthiness, and sinfulness, laying us low before our God.
          It is our most valuable discipline. It is the &quot;bit and
          bridle&quot; that curbs the frowardness of the flesh, and enables us
          to &quot;serve God acceptably,&quot; in the remembrance, that, though
          in love He is a reconciled Father, yet in holiness He is &quot;a
          consuming fire.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if we are under the influence of this reverential awe and
          seriousness of spirit, we shall learn to attach a supreme authority
          and consideration to the least of His commands. We shall dread the
          thought of wilfully offending Him. The fear of grieving Him will be
          far more operative now, than was the fear of hell in our unconverted
          state. Those who presume upon their gospel liberty, will not,
          probably, understand this language. But the humble believer well knows
          how intimately &quot;the fear of the Lord&quot; is connected with
          &quot;the comfort of the Holy Spirit,&quot; and with his own steady
          progress in holiness, and preparation for heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          121. I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to my oppressors.
          122. Be surety for Your servant for good: let not the proud oppress
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is something very solemn in the reflection, that God has set up
          a Viceregent in the heart—an internal Judge, who takes cognizance of
          every thought, every emotion, every act—determining its character, and
          pronouncing its sentence. This tribunal tries every cause without
          respect to persons, time, place, or any circumstances, that might seem
          to separate it from other cases under the same jurisdiction. No
          criminal can escape detection from defect of evidence. No earthly
          power can hinder the immediate execution of the sentence. The sentence
          then, of this awful Judge, whether &quot;accusing or excusing,&quot;
          is of infinite moment. The ignorant expression—&#x27;Thank God, I have
          a clear conscience!&#x27; is used alike by the self-righteous and the
          careless. The awakened sinner, however, pleads guilty to its
          accusations, and knows not how to answer them. Blessed be God for the
          revelation of His gospel, which proclaims the blood of
          Jesus—sprinkling the conscience—silencing its charges—and setting
          before the sinner the way of peace! And now through Jesus, &quot;the
          new and living way&quot; of access to God, conscience, sitting on the
          throne—speaks peace and acceptance; and though sins of infirmity will
          remain, defiling every thought, desire, and act; yet, like the motes
          on the face of the sun in the clearest day, they have little or no
          influence to obstruct the shining of the cheerful light upon the
          heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clearing of conscience is however connected with Christian
          integrity. &quot;If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
          toward God.&quot; This &quot;testimony of conscience&quot; has often
          been &quot;the rejoicing&quot; of the Lord&#x27;s people, when
          suffering under unremitted reproach or proud oppression. They have
          been enabled to plead it without offence in the presence of their
          holy, heart-searching God—no, even when in the near prospect of the
          great and final account, they might have been supposed to shrink from
          the strict and unerring scrutiny of their Omniscient Judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          But observe the influence of this testimony upon our spiritual
          comfort. David was at this time under persecution—no new trial to a
          child of God and one that will never cease, so long as Satan has
          instruments at his command. But see the blessing which conscious
          uprightness gave to his prayers: I have done judgment and justice:
          leave me not to my oppressors. Can my heart and conscience respond to
          this appeal? Then may I plead my cause before God, Leave me not to my
          oppressors. Let not the proud oppress me. Plead my cause with them.
          Let my righteousness be made known. Let it be seen, that You
          &quot;will not leave me in their hand, nor condemn me when I am
          judged. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me: for I wait on
          You.&quot; But if any deviation from the exact rule of righteousness
          between man and man has been allowed—if the world charge me as
          ungodly, because they have proved me unrighteous—then let me not
          wonder, that &quot;the consolations of God shall be small with
          me;&quot; nor let me expect a return of the Lord&#x27;s cheering
          manifestation, until the Achan has been removed from the camp, and by
          confession to God, and reparation to man, I have &quot;given glory to
          the Lord God of Israel.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let not this appeal be thought to savor of Pharisaical pride. He
          pleads not merit. He only asserts his innocence—the righteousness of
          his cause—not of his person. Though upright before man, he ever felt
          himself a sinner before God. The highest tone of conscious integrity
          is therefore consistent with the deepest prostration of evangelical
          humility. The difference is infinite between the proud Pharisee and
          the upright believer. The Pharisee makes the appeal with undisturbed
          self-delight and self-righteous pleading. The believer would ever
          accompany it with the Tax-collector&#x27;s prayer for mercy.
          Instantly—in a deep conviction of need—he appends the supplication—Be
          surety for Your servant for good. The keen eye of the world may
          possibly not be able to affix any blot upon my outward profession;
          but, &quot;if you, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
          stand?&quot; The debt is continually accumulating, and the prospect of
          payment as distant as ever. I might well expect to be left to my
          oppressors, until I should pay all that was due unto my Lord. But
          behold! &quot;Where is the fury of the oppressor?&quot; The surety is
          found—the debt is paid—the ransom is accepted—the sinner is free!
          There was a voice heard in heaven, &quot;Deliver him from going down
          to the pit: I have found a ransom.&quot; Yes, the Son of God Himself
          became &quot;surety for a stranger,&quot; and &quot;smarted for
          it.&quot; At an infinite cost—the cost of His own precious blood—He
          delivered me from my oppressors—sin—Satan—the world—death—hell.
          &quot;It was exacted: and he answered.&quot; As Judah in the place of
          Benjamin, he was ready to stand in my stead before his Father, &quot;I
          will be surety of him: of my hand shall you require him.&quot; As Paul
          in the stead of Onesimus, he was ready to plead, before the same
          tribunal, &quot;If he has wronged you, or owes you anything, put that
          on my account; I will repay it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let this subject be ever present to my mind. Well indeed was it for
          me, that Jesus did not &quot;hate suretyship.&quot; Had He refused the
          vast undertaking, how could I have answered before the bar of God? Or
          had He undertaken only for those who loved Him, again should I have
          been left without a plea. But when as my surety He has brought me
          under His yoke, and made me His servant, I can plead with acceptance
          before His throne, Be surety for Your servant for good—for the good,
          which You know me to need—my present and eternal deliverance from my
          proud oppressors. And do not I need such a surety every moment? And
          need I be told how fully He has performed the Surety&#x27;s part? So
          that I may boldly say, &quot;Who is he who condemns? it is Christ that
          died. It is Christ that lives. There is therefore now no condemnation
          to them that are in Christ Jesus.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          123. My eyes fail for Your salvation, and for the word of Your
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And do your eyes, tried believer, begin to fail? So did your
          Redeemer&#x27;s before you. He, whom you have been recollecting as
          your Surety, when He stood in your place, burdened with the
          intolerable load of your sin—bearing the weighty strokes of Infinite
          justice upon His soul—He too was constrained to cry out, &quot;My eyes
          fail, while I wait for my God.&quot; Listen, then, to your deserted
          Savior counseling His deserted people; &quot;gifted with the tongue of
          the learned, that he should know how to speak a word in season to you
          that are weary&quot; &quot;Who is among you that fears the Lord, that
          obeys the voice of His servant; that walks in darkness, and has no
          light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his
          God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          That our Surety will plead for our good, doubt not. Yet &quot;the
          vision is for an appointed time.&quot; &quot;But shall not God avenge
          His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long
          with them?&quot; Salvation—a gift of such comprehensive and enduring
          blessing—is it not worth the waiting trial? Wonderful is that
          arrangement, by which the word of grace is made the word of
          righteousness! God has bound Himself to us by His promises of grace,
          which are not, Yes and no, but &quot;Yes and amen&quot;—under His own
          hand and seal. Who that has tried them, but will &quot;set to his seal
          that God is true?&quot; Cheering indeed is the thought, that, amid the
          incessant changes in Christian experience, our hope is unchangeably
          fixed. We may not indeed always enjoy it; but our salvation does not
          depend upon our present enjoyment of its consolation. Is not the
          blessing as certain—yes—is not our assurance of an interest in it as
          clear, when we are brought to the dust under a sense of sin, as if we
          were &quot;caught up into the third heaven&quot; in a vision of glory?
        </p>
        <p>
          In a season of desertion, therefore, while we maintain a godly
          jealousy over our own hearts, let us beware of a mistrustful jealousy
          of God. Distrust will not cure our wound, or quicken us to prayer, or
          recommend us to the favor of God, or prepare us for the mercy of the
          Gospel. Complaining is not humility. Prayer without waiting is not
          faith. The path is plain as noon-day. Continue to believe as you can.
          Wait on the Lord. This is the act of faith, depending on Him—the act
          of hope, looking for Him—the act of patience, waiting His time—the act
          of submission, resigned even if He should not come. Like your Savior,
          in His &quot;agony&quot; of desertion, &quot;pray more
          earnestly.&quot; Condemn yourself for the sins of which you are asking
          forgiveness. Bless Him for His past mercy, even if you should never
          taste it again. Can He frown you from His presence? Can He belie His
          promise to His waiting people? Impossible! No! while He has taken away
          the sensible apprehensions of His love, and in its room has kindled
          longing desires for the lost blessing; is not this to show Himself—if
          He be &quot;verily a God that hides Himself&quot;—yet still &quot;the
          God of Israel, the Savior?&quot; Though He delays His promise, and
          holds us as it were in suspense; yet He would have us know, that He
          has not forgotten the word of His righteousness. But this is His wise
          and effectual mode of trying His own gift of faith. And it is this
          &quot;trial of faith&quot;—and not faith untried—that will be
          &quot;found to praise, and honor, and glory at the appearing of Jesus
          Christ.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The full consolation of the Gospel is therefore the fruit of patient,
          humble waiting for the Lord, and of earnest desire, conflicting with
          impatience and unbelief, and at length issuing in a state of
          child-like submission and dependence. The man who was here expressing
          his longing expectation for God&#x27;s salvation, was evidently,
          though unconsciously, in possession of the promise. Nor would he at
          this moment have exchanged his hope, clouded as it was to his own
          view, for all &quot;the pleasures of sin,&quot; or the riches of the
          world. Although at this moment he appeared to be under the partial
          hidings of his Father&#x27;s countenance, yet it is important to
          observe, that he was not satisfied, as an indolent professor, to
          &quot;lie upon his face&quot; in this sad condition. His &quot;eyes
          failed with looking upward&quot;—stretched up with earnest expectation
          to catch the first rising rays of the beaming Sun of Righteousness. He
          knew, what all Christians know, who walk closely with God, that his
          perseverance in waiting upon God, would issue in the eventual
          fulfillment of every desire of his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          But can we assuredly plead the word of His righteousness for the
          anticipation of the object of our desire? Have we always an express
          promise answering to our expectations, &quot;putting God in
          remembrance&quot; of His word? Possibly we may have been asking not
          &quot;according to His will,&quot; and therefore may have
          &quot;charged God foolishly,&quot; as if He had been unfaithful to His
          word, when no engagement had been pledged: when we had no warrant to
          build upon from the word of His righteousness. If, however, our
          petition should be found to be agreeable to His word of promise, and
          faith and patience hold on in submission to His will, we must not, we
          cannot, suppose, that one tittle that we have asked will fail. Whether
          the Lord deliver us or not, prayer and waiting will not be lost. It is
          a blessed posture for Him to find us in, such as will not fail to
          ensure His acceptance, even though our request should be denied. An
          enlivening view of the Savior is in reserve for us; and the word of
          righteousness will yet speak, &quot;This is the rest, with which you
          may cause the weary to rest: and this is the refreshing.&quot; To
          every passing doubt and rising fear, oppose this word of His
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let me bring my own heart to the test. Am I longing for the
          manifestation of God? Surely if I am content with what I already know,
          I know but very little of the unsearchable depths of the love of
          Christ; and I have abundant need to pray for more enlarged desires,
          and a more tender enjoyment of His Divine presence. If faith is not
          dead, yet it may have lost its conquering and quickening vigor. Let me
          then exercise my soul in diligent, careful, patient waiting upon God,
          equally removed from sloth and frowardness—and I shall yet find the
          truth of that consoling word of His righteousness, &quot;Light is sown
          for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          124. Deal with Your servant according unto Your mercy, and teach me
          Your statutes. 125. I am Your servant; give me understanding, that I
          may know Your testimonies.

          A sense of mercy, and the privilege of Divine teaching, were the
          earnest of the Lord&#x27;s salvation, for which the eyes of his
          servant were failing, and for which he was waiting in dependence upon
          the sure word of His righteousness. And indeed these two wants daily
          press upon every servant of God as matter for earnest supplication.
          Both are intimately connected. A deeper sense of mercy will bind us
          more strongly to His statutes; while a more spiritual teaching in the
          statutes will humble us in a sense of sin, and consequent need of
          mercy. As it respects the first—if there is a sinner upon the earth,
          who needs the special mercy of God, it is His own servant. For as the
          Lord sees abundantly more excellence in his feeblest desire, than in
          the professor&#x27;s most splendid external duties; so He sees far
          more sinfulness and provocation in the workings of his sin, than in
          the palpably defective services of professors, or in the open
          transgression of the wicked of the earth. Let him scrutinize his
          motives, thoughts, and affections, even in his moments of nearest and
          happiest approach unto his God; and he will find such defilement
          cleaving to every offering, with all the aggravations of mercy, light,
          and knowledge, given, that the confession of his soul, when comparing
          himself with his fellow-sinners, will be, &quot;Of whom I am
          chief.&quot; And therefore, as a servant of God, I can only come
          before Him upon the ground of mercy. For my best performances I need
          an immeasurable world of mercy—pardoning—saving—everlasting mercy; and
          yet by the blood of Jesus I dare to plead—Deal with Your servant
          according unto Your mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then I am ignorant as well as guilty; and yet I dare not pray for
          teaching—much and hourly as I need it, until I have afresh obtained
          mercy. These two blessings lead me at once to the foundation of the
          gospel—in the work of Christ, and the work of the Spirit—mercy flowing
          from the blood of the Son—teaching from the office of the Spirit.
          Mercy is the first blessing, not only in point of importance, but in
          point of order. I must know the Lord as a Savior, before I can go to
          Him with any confidence to be my teacher. But when once I have found
          acceptance for my petition—Deal with Your servant according to Your
          mercy—my way will be opened to enlarge my petition—yes, once and again
          to repeat it—Teach me Your statutes. Give me understanding, that I may
          know Your testimonies—that I may know with intelligent conviction;
          walk, yes, &quot;run in the way of Your commandments&quot; with
          &quot;an enlarged heart.&quot; For let me never forget, that I am
          &quot;redeemed from the curse&quot; only—not from the service &quot;of
          the law&quot;—yes, redeemed from its curse, that I may be bound to its
          service. And does not my especial relation to my God as His servant,
          furnish me with a plea for His acceptance? For when this &quot;earth
          is full of His mercy&quot;—much more may I, as belonging to His house,
          plead for the special mercy of His teaching—His own covenant
          promise—so needful for His servant, who desires to know, that he may
          do, His will.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if I am the Lord&#x27;s servant, how did I become so? Time was
          (let me be ashamed and confounded at the remembrance of it) when I was
          engaged for another master, and in another service. But His sovereign
          grace called me from the dominion of sin—from the chains of Satan—from
          the bondage of the world, and drew me to Himself. &quot;His I am—and
          Him I serve.&quot; His service is my highest privilege: His reward of
          grace is my glorious hope. &quot;If any man serve Me,&quot; says my
          Master, &quot;let him follow Me: and where I am, there shall also My
          servant be. If any man serve Me, him will My Father honor.&quot; As
          His servant, therefore, I cast myself with confidence upon His mercy,
          and expect to be dealt with according to that mercy. No—I shall be
          denied nothing that I &quot;ask according to His will.&quot; For He
          has condescended to call me—not His servant, but &quot;his
          friend&quot;—yes more, to call himself &quot;my brother.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord! You have showed me this great favor and grace, to make me Your
          servant. I would be Yours forever. I love Your service too well to
          wish to change it; yet must I mourn over my dullness, my backwardness
          in doing Your will, and walking in Your way. Oh! teach me Your
          statutes more clearly, more experimentally! Give me understanding to
          discern their heavenly sweetness and their holy liberty, that I may
          live in a more simple and devoted obedience to them, until I come to
          see Your face, and to be Your servant in Your heavenly temple,
          &quot;no more to go out.&quot;
