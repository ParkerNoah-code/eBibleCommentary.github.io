        <h2>119:1-25</h2>
        <p>
          1. Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          This most interesting and instructive Psalm, like the Psalter itself,
          &quot;opens with a Beatitude for our comfort and encouragement,
          directing us immediately to that happiness, which all mankind in
          different ways are seeking and inquiring after. All would secure
          themselves from the incursions of misery; but all do not consider that
          misery is the offspring of sin, from which therefore it is necessary
          to be delivered and preserved, in order to become happy or
          blessed.&quot; (Bishop Horne)
        </p>
        <p>
          The undefiled character described in this verse marks, in an
          evangelical sense, &quot;an Israelite indeed, in whom is no
          deceit&quot;, not one who is without sin, but one who in the sincerity
          of his heart can say, &quot;I do not understand what I do. For what I
          want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          As his way is, so is his &quot;walk&quot;, &quot;in the law of the
          Lord.&quot; He is &quot;strengthened in the Lord, and he walks up and
          down in His name;&quot; his &quot;ears hearing a word behind him,
          saying, This is the way—walk in it&quot;—when he is &quot;turning to
          the right hand or to the left.&quot; And if the pardon of sin,
          imputation of righteousness, the communion of saints, and a sense of
          acceptance with God; if protection in providence and grace;
          and—finally and forever, the beatific vision, are the sealed
          privileges of His upright people, then there can be no doubt, that
          &quot;blessed are the undefiled in the way.&quot; And if temporal
          prosperity, spiritual renovation and fruitfulness, increasing
          illumination, fellowship with the Savior, peace within, and—throughout
          eternity—a right to the tree of life, are privileges of incalculable
          value; then surely &quot;the walk in the law of the Lord&quot; is
          &quot;the path of pleasantness and peace.&quot;
          &quot;Truly&quot;—indeed may we say, &quot;God is good to Israel, even
          to such as are of a clean heart.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let each of us ask—What is the &quot;way&quot; of my heart with
          God? Is it always an &quot;undefiled way?&quot; Is
          &quot;iniquity&quot; never &quot;regarded in the heart?&quot; Is all
          that God hates habitually lamented, abhorred, forsaken? &quot;Search
          me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts; and see if
          there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
          everlasting.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Again—What is my &quot;walk?&quot; Is it from the living principle of
          union with Christ? This is the direct—the only source of spiritual
          life. We are first quickened in Him. Then we walk in Him and after
          Him. Oh! that this my walk may be steady, consistent, advancing! Oh!
          that I may be ever listening to my Father&#x27;s voice, &quot;I am the
          Almighty God; walk before me, and be perfect!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there not enough of defilement in the most &quot;undefiled
          way,&quot; and enough of inconsistency in the most consistent
          &quot;walk&quot; to endear to us the gracious declaration of the
          gospel, &quot;If any man sins, we have an advocate with the Father,
          Jesus Christ the Righteous?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Blessed are those who keep His testimonies, and who seek Him with
          the whole heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;testimony,&quot; in the singular number, usually denotes the
          whole canon of the inspired writings—the revelation of the will of God
          to mankind—the standard of their faith. &quot;Testimonies&quot;
          appear, chiefly, to mark the preceptive part of Scripture; that part,
          in which this man of God always found his spiritual delight and
          perfect freedom. Mark his language: &quot;I have rejoiced in the way
          of Your testimonies, as much us in all riches. Your testimonies have I
          taken as a heritage forever; for they are the rejoicing of my
          heart.&quot; Not, however, that this blessedness belongs to the mere
          outward act of obedience; but rather to that practical habit of mind,
          which seeks to know the will of God in order to &quot;keep&quot; it.
          This habit is under the influence of the promise of God, &quot;I will
          put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and
          you shall keep my judgments, and do them.&quot; And in thus
          &quot;keeping the testimonies of God,&quot; the believer maintains the
          character of one, that &quot;seeks Him with the whole heart.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! how many seek, and seek in vain, for no other reason, than because
          they do not &quot;seek Him with the whole heart!&quot; The
          worldling&#x27;s &quot;heart is divided; now shall he be found
          faulty.&quot; The professor &quot;with his mouth shows much love; but
          his heart goes after his covetousness.&quot; The backslider &quot;has
          not turned unto Me with his whole heart, but feignedly, says the
          Lord.&quot; The faithful, upright believer alone brings his heart, his
          whole heart, to the Lord: &quot;When You said, Seek my face, my heart
          said unto You, Your face, Lord, will I seek.&quot; For he alone has
          found an object, that attracts and fills his whole heart, and, if he
          had a thousand hearts, would attract and fill them all. He has found
          his way to God by faith in Jesus. In that way he continues to seek.
          His whole heart is engaged to know and love more and more. Here alone
          the blessing is enjoyed, and the promise made good: &quot;You shall
          seek Me, and find Me, when you shall search for Me with all your
          heart.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let me not shrink from the question, Do I &quot;keep His
          testimonies&quot; from constraint, or from love? Surely when I
          consider my own natural aversion and enmity to the law of God, and the
          danger of self-deception in the external service of the Lord, I have
          much need to pray, &quot;Incline my heart to Your testimonies. Give me
          understanding—save me, and I shall keep Your testimonies.&quot; And if
          they are blessed, who seek the Lord with their whole heart, how am I
          seeking Him? Alas! with how much distraction! with how little
          heart-work! Oh! let me &quot;seek His strength&quot; in order to
          &quot;seek His face.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord! search—teach—incline—uphold me. Help me to plead Your gracious
          promise, &quot;I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the
          Lord; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they
          shall return unto Me with their whole heart.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>3. They also do no iniquity; they walk in His ways.</p>
        <p>
          This was not their character from their birth. Once they were doing
          nothing but iniquity. It was iniquity without mixture, without
          cessation—from the fountain-head. Now it is written of them,
          &quot;they do no iniquity.&quot; Once they walked, even as others, in
          the way of their own hearts, &quot;enemies to God by wicked
          works.&quot; Now &quot;they walk in His ways.&quot; They are &quot;new
          creatures in Christ; old things are passed away; behold! all things
          are become new.&quot; This is their highly-privileged state, &quot;Sin
          shall have no dominion over them: for they are not under the law, but
          under grace.&quot; They are &quot;born of God, and they cannot
          practice sin: for his seed remains in them, and they cannot sin,
          because they are born of God.&quot; Their hatred and resistance to sin
          are therefore now as instinctive, as was their former enmity and
          opposition to God. Not, indeed, that the people of God are as
          &quot;the saints made perfect,&quot; who &quot;do no iniquity.&quot;
          This is a dream of perfection—unscriptural and self-deluding. The
          unceasing advocacy of their Heavenly Friend evidently supposes the
          indwelling power of sin, to the termination of our earthly pilgrimage.
          The supplication, also, in the prayer of our Lord teaches them to ask
          for daily pardon and deliverance from &quot;temptation,&quot; as for
          &quot;daily bread.&quot; Yes—to our shame be it spoken—we are sinners
          still; yet—praised be God!—not &quot;walking after the course,&quot;
          not &quot;fulfilling the desires,&quot; of sin. The acting of sin is
          now like the motion of a stone upward, violent and unnatural. If sin
          is not cast out, it is dethroned. We are not, as before, &quot;its
          willing people,&quot; but its reluctant, struggling captives. It is
          not &quot;the day of its power.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And here lies the holy liberty of the Gospel—not, as some have
          imagined—a liberty to &quot;continue in sin, that grace may
          abound&quot;; but a deliverance from the guilt and condemnation of
          abhorred, resisted, yet still indwelling, sin. When our better will
          has cast it off—when we can say in the sight of a heart-searching God,
          &quot;What we hate, that do we&quot;—the responsibility is not ours:
          &quot;It is not we who do it, but sin which dwells in us.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Still let us inquire, is the promise of deliverance from sin sweet to
          us? And does our successful resistance in the spiritual conflict
          realize the pledge of its complete fulfillment? Blessed Jesus! what
          do, we owe to Your cross for the present redemption from its guilt and
          curse, and much more for the blissful prospect of the glorified state,
          when this hated sin shall be an inhabitant no more forever! Oh, let us
          take the very print of Your death into our souls in the daily
          crucifixion of sin. Let us know the &quot;power of Your
          resurrection,&quot; in a habitual &quot;walk in newness of life.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>4. You have commanded us to keep Your precepts diligently.</p>
        <p>
          We have seen the character of the Man of God. Let us mark the
          authority of God, commanding him to a diligent obedience. The very
          sight of the command is enough for him. He obeys for the
          command&#x27;s sake, however contrary it may be to his own will. But
          has he any reason to complain of the yoke? Even under the
          dispensation, which &quot;genders unto bondage&quot; most encouraging
          were the obligations to obedience, &quot;that it may be well with
          them, and with their children forever.&quot; Much more, then, we,
          under a dispensation of love, can never lack a motive for obedience!
          Let the daily mercies of Providence stir up the question, &quot;What
          shall I render to the Lord?&quot; Let the far richer mercies of grace
          produce &quot;a living sacrifice&quot; to be &quot;presented to the
          Lord.&quot; Let &quot;the love of Christ constrain us.&quot; Let the
          recollection of the &quot;price with which we were bought,&quot;
          remind us of the Lord&#x27;s ownership in us, and of our obligations
          to &quot;glorify Him in our body, and in our spirit, which are
          His.&quot; Let us only &quot;behold the Lamb of God;&quot; let us hear
          His wrestling supplications, His deserted cry, His expiring
          agonies—the price of our redemption; and then let us ask ourselves—Can
          we lack a motive?
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is the scriptural character of evangelical obedience? It is
          the work of the Spirit, enabling us to &quot;obey the truth.&quot; It
          is the end of the purpose of God, who &quot;has chosen us in Christ
          before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without
          blame before Him in love.&quot; It is the only satisfactory test of
          our profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then let me begin my morning with the inquiry, &quot;Lord, what will
          You have me to do?&quot; &quot;Teach me Your way, O Lord; I will walk
          in Your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.&quot; Let me trade
          with all my talents for You: ever watchful, that I may be employed in
          Your work; setting a guard upon my thoughts, my lips, my tempers, my
          pursuits, that nothing may hinder, but rather everything may help me,
          in keeping Your precepts diligently.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why do I ever find the precepts to be &quot;grievous&quot; to me?
          Is it not that some indolence is indulged; or some &quot;iniquity
          regarded in my heart;&quot; or some principle of unfaithfulness
          divides my services with two masters, when I ought to be
          &quot;following the Lord fully?&quot; Oh! for the spirit of
          &quot;simplicity and godly sincerity&quot; in the precepts of God. Oh!
          for that warm and constant love, which is the main-spring of devoted
          diligence in the service of God. Oh! for a larger supply of that
          &quot;wisdom which is from above,&quot; and which is &quot;without
          partiality and without hypocrisy!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>5. Oh that my ways were directed to keep Your statutes!</p>
        <p>
          The Lord has indeed &quot;commanded us to keep His precepts.&quot;
          But, alas! where is our power? Satan would make the sense of our
          weakness an excuse for indolence. The Spirit of God convinces us of
          it, as an incitement to prayer, and an exercise of faith. If, Reader,
          your heart is right with God, you &quot;consent to the law that it is
          good;&quot; you &quot;delight in it after the inner man;&quot; you
          would not have one jot or tittle altered, mitigated, or repealed, that
          it might be more conformed to your own will, or allow you more liberty
          or self-indulgence in the ways of sin. But do you not sigh to think,
          that, when you aim at the perfect standard of holiness, you should, at
          your best moments, and in your highest attainments, fall so far below
          it; seeing indeed the way before you, but feeling yourself without
          ability to walk in it? Then let a sense of your helplessness for the
          work of the Lord lead you to the throne of grace, to pray, and watch,
          and wait, for the strengthening and refreshing influences of the
          Spirit of grace. Here let your faith realize at one and the same view
          your utter insufficiency, and your complete All-sufficiency. Here
          behold Him, who is ever presenting Himself before God as our glorious
          Head, receiving in Himself, according to the good pleasure of the
          Father, the full supply for this and every successive moment of
          inexpressible need. Our work is not therefore left upon our own hands,
          or wrought out at our &quot;own charges.&quot; So long as he has the
          &quot;Spirit of grace&quot; he will be found
          &quot;sufficient&quot;—Divine &quot;strength will be made perfect in
          weakness.&quot; &quot;Without Him we can do nothing;&quot;
          &quot;through Him, all things.&quot; Even the &quot;worm Jacob shall
          thresh the mountains,&quot; when the Lord says, &quot;Fear not, I will
          help you.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In connecting this verse with the preceding, how accurately is the
          middle path preserved, equally distant from the idea of
          self-sufficiency to &quot;keep the Lord&#x27;s statutes,&quot; and
          self justification in neglecting them! The first attempt to render
          spiritual obedience will quickly convince us of our utter
          helplessness. We might as soon create a world, as create in our hearts
          one pulse of spiritual life. And yet our inability does not cancel our
          obligation. Shall God lose His right, because sin has palsied our
          ability? Is not a drunken servant still under his master&#x27;s law?
          and is not the sin which prevents him from performing his duty, not
          his excuse, but his aggravation? Thus our weakness is that of a heart,
          which &quot;cannot be subject to the law of God,&quot; only because it
          is carnal, &quot;enmity against God.&quot; The obligation therefore
          remains in full force. Our inability is our sin, our guilt, and
          condemnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          What then remains for us, but to return the mandate to heaven,
          accompanied with an earnest prayer, that the Lord would write upon our
          hearts those statutes, to which He requires obedience in His word?,
          &quot;You have commanded us to keep Your statutes diligently.&quot; We
          acknowledge, Lord, our obligation; but we feel our impotency. Lord,
          help us: we look unto You. &quot;Oh that our ways were directed to
          keep Your statutes!&quot; &quot;Give what You command—and then command
          what You will.&quot; (Augustine.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as if to exhibit the fullness and suitableness of the promises of
          the gospel, the commands and prayers are returned back again from
          heaven with promises of quickening and directing grace. Thus does the
          Lord fully answer His end with us. He did not issue the commands,
          expecting that we could turn our own hearts to them; but that the
          conviction of our entire helplessness might cast us upon Him, who
          loves to be sought, and never will be thus sought in vain. And indeed
          this is a part of the &quot;mystery of godliness,&quot; that in
          proportion as we depend upon Him who is alike, &quot;the Lord our
          righteousness,&quot; and our strength; our desire after holiness will
          increase, and our prayers become more fervent. He who commands our
          duty, perfectly knows our weakness; and he who feels his own weakness
          is fully encouraged to depend upon the power of his Savior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith is then the principle of evangelical obedience, and the promises
          of His grace enable us for duty, at the very time that we are
          commanded to it. In this view are brought together the supreme
          authority of the Lawgiver, the total insufficiency of the creature,
          the full provisions of the Savior, and the all-sufficiency of
          &quot;the God of grace.&quot; We pray for what we lack; we are
          thankful for what we have; we trust for what is promised. Thus
          &quot;all is of God.&quot; Christ &quot;is the Alpha and the Omega,
          the beginning and the end, the first and the last.&quot; Thus
          &quot;grace reigns&quot; triumphant. The foundation is laid in grace,
          and the headstone will be brought forth with shoutings, crying,
          &quot;Grace, grace unto it!&quot; The Savior&#x27;s work is finished,
          and Jesus is crowned Lord of all forever.

          6. Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all Your
          commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord expects our obedience to be not only &quot;diligent,&quot;
          but universal. Willingly to dispense with the least of the
          commandments, proves that we have yet to learn the spirit of
          acceptable obedience. Grace is given and suited for all, no less than
          for one of them, &quot;that we might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
          pleasing.&quot; One lust &quot;regarded in the heart&quot; is
          sufficient to keep possession for the tyrant, however others may be
          restrained. Even Herod could &quot;do many things;&quot; and yet his
          adulterous wife cherished in his bosom, too plainly proved the
          sovereignty of sin to be undisturbed. Saul slew all the Amalekites but
          one; and that single exception to universal obedience marked his
          unsoundness, cost him the loss of his throne, and brought him under
          the awful displeasure of his God. And thus the one corrupt unmortified
          member brings the whole body to hell. Reserves are the canker upon
          godly sincerity. A secret indulgence, &quot;the rolling of the sweet
          morsel under the tongue,&quot; &quot;the part of the price kept
          back&quot;—stamps our service as a robbery, not as an offering. We may
          be free, sincere, and earnest in many parts of our prescribed duty;
          but this &quot;root of bitterness&quot; renders the whole an
          abomination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sincerity therefore must be the stamp of my Christian profession.
          Though utterly unable to render perfect obedience to the least of the
          commandments, yet my desire and purpose will have respect unto them
          all. I shall no more venture to break the least, than the greatest of
          them; much less shall I ever think of attempting to atone for the
          breach of one by the performance of the rest. They are indeed many
          commandments; yet—like links in a chain—they form but one law; and I
          know who has said, &quot;Whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet
          offend in one point, he is guilty of all.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          However the professor may confine his regard to the second table (as
          if the first were ceremonial, or obsolete, or the regulation of the
          outward man was the utmost extent of the requirement,) I would fix my
          eye with equal regard to both; yet specially marking any command in
          either of them; that may appear most directly opposed to my besetting
          corruptions. Thus &quot;walking in the fear of the Lord,&quot; I may
          hope to walk &quot;in the comfort of the Holy Spirit&quot; and
          &quot;hereby shall I know that I am of the truth, and shall assure my
          heart before God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But where, in my strictest walk, is my hope of acceptance, but in Him,
          whose obedience has &quot;fulfilled all righteousness&quot; in my
          stead, and whose death &quot;has redeemed me from the curse&quot; of
          my unrighteousness, when repentance, prayers, and tears, would have
          been of no avail? Yet it is only in the path of holiness that we can
          realize our acceptance. The heart occupied with this world&#x27;s
          pleasure knows nothing of this heavenly joy. Its brightness is
          dimmed—its freshness fades—its life withers—in the very breath of an
          unholy world. A godly assurance of the present favor of God must be
          weakened by self-indulgence, unwatchfulness, allowance of secret sins,
          or neglect of secret duties. &quot;If you return to the
          Almighty&quot;—said a wise man, &quot;you shall be built up, you shall
          put away iniquity far from yourself. Then shall you have your delight
          in the Almighty, and shall lift up your face unto God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us then carefully examine the character of our assurance. Does it
          rest simply and exclusively upon the testimony of the Gospel? Will it
          abide the test of the word of God? Is it productive of tenderness of
          conscience, watchfulness, and circumspection of conduct? Does it
          exercise our diligence in adding grace to grace, that we may
          &quot;make our calling and election sure,&quot; and that &quot;an
          entrance may be ministered to us abundantly into the everlasting
          kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?&quot; How boldly can we
          plead our Christian confidence in the path of godliness, &quot;I have
          stuck to Your testimonies; O Lord, put me not to shame. Let my heart
          be sound in Your statutes, that I be not ashamed.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          7. I will praise You with uprightness of heart, when I shall have
          learned Your righteous judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The righteous judgments of God include the whole revelation of His
          word—so called—as the rule by which He judges our present state, and
          will pronounce our final sentence. David&#x27;s attainments here
          seemed to be as nothing. So much remained unlearned and unknown, that
          he could only anticipate the time, when he shall have learned them.
          &quot;Your commandment&quot;—he exclaims, &quot;is exceedingly
          broad.&quot; When the Apostle, after twenty years&#x27; acquaintance
          with the gospel, expressed it as the one desire of his heart,
          &quot;That I may know Christ;&quot; evidently he entertained the same
          humbling views of his high attainments, and the same exalted
          apprehensions of the value of treasures yet unexplored, and
          progressively opening before him. Thus the wisest saints are only
          students in the Divine School. Yet whatever their learning be, it
          casts them into the mold and spirit of their doctrine. Conceit of
          one&#x27;s knowledge, is the greatest enemy to knowledge, and the
          strongest proof of ignorance; so that, &quot;if any man thinks that he
          knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.&quot;
          &quot;He deceives himself.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is the motive, that enlivens the believer in this holy
          learning? Is it that he may live upon the airy breath of human
          applause? No, rather that he may &quot;praise his God with uprightness
          of heart.&quot; When our mind is dark, our lips are sealed. But when
          &quot;He opens our understandings&quot; to &quot;learn His
          judgments,&quot; He will next &quot;open our lips, and our mouth shall
          show forth His praise.&quot; And this indeed is the end for which
          &quot;His people are formed;&quot; for which they &quot;are called out
          of darkness into marvelous light.&quot; This is the daily frame, in
          which our God will be glorified. Yet must we live as well as sing His
          praise. &quot;The praise of the upright heart will be shown in the
          holy walk and conversation.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us watch, that our praise really flows &quot;out of the
          abundance&quot; of what our hearts have &quot;learned&quot; of His
          &quot;righteous judgments.&quot; For do we not sometimes speak of our
          Savior with a secret lurking after self-exaltation? May we not really
          be seeking and serving ourselves in the very act of seeming to serve
          and honor Him? Surely the very thought of the selfishness that defiles
          our holiest earthly praise, may well quicken our longings after that
          world of praise, where the flame burns active, bright, incessant;
          where we shall offer our sacrifices without defilement, without
          intermission, without weariness, without end!
        </p>
        <p>8. I will keep Your statutes: O forsake me not utterly.</p>
        <p>
          The resolution to &quot;keep the Lord&#x27;s statutes&quot; is the
          natural result of having &quot;learned His righteous judgments.&quot;
          But how happily does David combine &quot;simplicity&quot; of
          dependence with &quot;godly sincerity&quot; of obedience! Firm in his
          purpose, but distrustful of his strength, instantly upon forming his
          resolution, he recollects that the performance is beyond his power;
          and therefore the next moment, and almost the same moment, he follows
          it up with prayer, &quot;I will keep Your statutes: O forsake me not
          utterly.&quot; Oh! beware of self-confidence in the Christian course.
          We stumble or advance, as we lean upon an arm of flesh, or upon an
          Almighty Savior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temporary desertion may be the seasonable chastisement of spiritual
          wantonness. When grace has been given in answer to prayer, it was not
          duly prized, or diligently improved. The &quot;Beloved&quot;—in answer
          to solicitation, &quot;has come into His garden,&quot; He knocks at
          the door, but the spouse is &quot;asleep.&quot; The answer to prayer
          was not expected, not waited for, and therefore not enjoyed; and the
          sleeper awakes too late, and finds herself forsaken by the object of
          her desire. Again—when we have given place to temptation; when love
          for our Savior &quot;waxes cold,&quot; and our earnestness in seeking
          Him is fainting; we must not be surprised, if we are left for a time
          to the trial of a deserted state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet we sometimes speak of the hidings of God&#x27;s countenance, as if
          it were a sovereign act, calling for implicit submission; when the
          cause should at least be sought for, and will generally be found, in
          some &quot;secret thing&quot; of indulgence, unwatchfulness, or
          self-dependence. It was while David &quot;kept silence&quot; from the
          language of contrition, that he felt the pressure of the heavy hand of
          his frowning God. And may not the darkness, which has sometimes
          clouded our path, be the voice of our God, &quot;Your own wickedness
          shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you; know
          therefore and see, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have
          forsaken the Lord your God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But in the engagement of the Lord&#x27;s everlasting covenant, how
          clear is the warrant of faith!—how ample the encouragement for prayer,
          &quot;Forsake me not utterly!&quot; David knew and wrote of the
          Lord&#x27;s unchangeable faithfulness to His people; and while he
          dreaded even a temporary separation from his God more than any worldly
          affliction, he could plead that gracious declaration,
          &quot;Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from
          him, nor permit my faithfulness to fail.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          We would not indeed make the promises of grace an encouragement to
          carelessness: yet it is indispensable to our spiritual establishment
          that we receive them in their full, free, and sovereign declaration.
          How many fainting souls have been refreshed by the assurances,
          &quot;For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies
          will I gather you: with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you,
          says the Lord your Redeemer!&quot; &quot;My sheep shall never perish;
          neither shall any pluck them out of My hand.&quot; In a lowly,
          self-abased, and dependent spirit, we shall best, however, learn to
          &quot;make our boast in the Lord;&quot; &quot;confident of this very
          thing, that he who has begun a good work in us, will perform it until
          the day of Jesus Christ.&quot; And even if awhile destitute of
          sensible consolation, still our language will be, &quot;I will wait
          upon the Lord, who hides His face from the house of Jacob; and I will
          look for Him.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Great, indeed, is the danger and evil to the soul, if we apprehend the
          Lord to have forsaken us, because we are in darkness; or that we are
          out of the way, because we are in perplexity. These are the very
          hand-posts, that show us that we are in the way of His own promised
          leading—painful exercise—faithful keeping—eternal salvation: &quot;I
          will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in
          paths that they have not known; I will make darkness light before
          them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them,
          and not forsake them.&quot; Oh! the rest—the satisfaction of placing
          an implicit confidence in a covenant-keeping God!
        </p>
        <p>
          Forsaken we may be—but not utterly. David was forsaken, not like Saul.
          Peter was forsaken, not like Judas, utterly and forever. What
          foreboding have you of such desertion? Is your heart willing to
          forsake Him? Have you no mournings and thirstings for His return?
          &quot;If, indeed, you forsake Him, He will forsake you.&quot; But can
          you forsake Him? &#x27;Let Him do as seems good to Him (is the
          language of your heart); I will wait for Him, follow after Him, cleave
          to His word, cling to His cross.&#x27; Mark His dealings with you.
          Inquire into their reason. Submit to His dispensation. If He forsakes,
          beg His return: but trust your forsaking God. &quot;Though He slays
          me, yet will I trust in Him.&quot; Though my comfort is clouded, my
          hope remains unchanging, unchangeable—such as I would not resign for
          the glory of an earthly kingdom. What are these earnest
          breathings—this abiding confidence, but His own work in us? And can
          the Lord &quot;forsake the work of His own hands?&quot; Sooner should
          heaven and earth pass, than the faithful engagements of the gospel be
          thus broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. How shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto
          according to Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is the young man so especially called to cleanse his way? Because
          God justly claims the first and the best. And is it not a most
          affecting proof of the alienation of the heart from God, that the
          youth of man—the bloom and freshness of his mind, &quot;his first
          love&quot;—should naturally be devoted to the service of sin? Ever
          since fallen man &quot;begat a son in his own likeness,&quot;
          &quot;the imagination of man&#x27;s heart has been evil from his
          youth.&quot; For &quot;who can bring a clean thing out of an
          unclean?&quot; And never does the heart utter the cry, &quot;My
          Father! You are the guide of my youth,&quot; until the misery of
          wandering without a guide has been painfully felt. And even when
          Divine grace has awakened the desire to return homewards, the habit of
          wandering from God, and the long-cherished pollutions of sin, seem to
          form an almost invincible barrier to progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fearful power of &quot;youthful lusts,&quot; and the madness with
          which the heart is hurried into forbidden indulgences, give solemn
          weight to the inquiry, &quot;How shall a young man cleanse his
          way?&quot; And the answer is ready. Let him &quot;take heed thereto
          according to Your word.&quot; Thus did Joseph, and Daniel with his
          young companions, &quot;cleanse their way&quot; in the defilement of
          an heathen atmosphere. It was probably the recollection of this
          purifying efficacy of the word, that induced the venerable Beza to
          mention in his will, among his chief matters of thankfulness to
          God—the mercy of having been called to the knowledge of the truth at
          the age of sixteen; thus, during a course of more than seventy
          years&#x27; walk with God, &quot;escaping the pollutions of the world
          through lust.&quot; But the &quot;way can only be cleansed&quot; by
          the cleansing of the heart; for how can a corrupt fountain &quot;send
          forth&quot; other than &quot;bitter waters?&quot; &quot;Out of the
          heart are the issues of life.&quot; Hence the urgent need to cry,
          &quot;Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit
          within me.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          How precious, therefore, is the word of God, as the means of this
          cleansing operation! When our Savior had been setting forth Himself as
          &quot;the way, the truth, and the life,&quot; and exhibiting the high
          privilege of union with Himself, &quot;Now,&quot; He adds, &quot;you
          are clean, through the word which I have spoken unto you.&quot; This
          is &quot;the truth,&quot; which He pleaded with His Father as the
          means of our sanctification. This sets out our purifying hope. Here
          are the promises, by which we &quot;cleanse ourselves from all
          filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of
          God.&quot; Thus is restored to man that golden &quot;crown&quot;—the
          stamp of his Maker&#x27;s holiness—which &quot;fell from his head when
          he sinned.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But oh! how does the recollection force itself upon us, that our way
          needs daily cleansing! so defiled are our actions, our thoughts, our
          motives—no more, our prayers and services. Let us then &quot;take heed
          according to the word of God&quot;—specially thankful for its heavenly
          light, which guides us to the &quot;Fountain, that is opened for sin
          and for uncleanness.&quot; Let us also, under the same Divine light,
          seek for the daily sanctifying influence of the Spirit of God.
          &quot;Who can understand his errors? Cleanse me from secret
          faults.&quot; &quot;Cleanse the thoughts of my heart by the
          inspiration of Your Holy Spirit.&quot; (Prayer-Book.)
        </p>
        <p>
          10. With my whole heart have I sought You; O let me not wander from
          Your commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attention to the word, however important, can never be practically
          effective without earnest prayer. Indeed this is the character of the
          Lord&#x27;s people, &quot;a generation of seekers;&quot; and yet how
          much do we lose of the comfort of our religion, and obscure the glory
          of our profession, by neglecting to bring &quot;our whole heart&quot;
          to this work! When sin is vigorous, and our spiritual affections are
          dull, and various hindrances combine in prayer—at this crisis strong
          faith is needed to overcome and to persevere. But here the soul too
          commonly yields to the difficulty, and contents itself either with
          heartless complainings, or with just sufficient exertion to quiet the
          voice of conscience, and produce a delusive peace within. But the Lord
          will not be found thus. His promise is not to such seekers as these;
          and if we are satisfied with this state, we must look for a very
          scanty measure of spiritual success, accompanied with the total
          absence of spiritual enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a far different spirit David could appeal, &quot;With my whole
          heart have I sought You.&quot; And this assurance, instead of
          producing self-confidence, will, so far as it is genuine, invariably
          show itself in a prayerful acknowledgment of our weakness, &quot;O let
          me not wander from Your commandments.&quot; Yet the feeblest desire
          and attempt to seek the Lord is the Spirit&#x27;s rising beam in the
          heart, a &quot;day of small things&quot; not to be
          &quot;despised.&quot; It is distinguished from every other principle
          by the simplicity of its object, &quot;This one thing I do. One thing
          have I desired of the Lord; that will I seek after.&quot; My God! my
          Savior! with my whole heart have I sought You. &quot;The desire of my
          soul is to Your name, and to the remembrance of You. With my soul have
          I desired You in the night; yes, with my spirit within me will I seek
          You early.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          When the soul is thus conscious of &quot;following the Lord
          fully,&quot; there is a peculiar dread of wandering. In a careless or
          half-hearted state, wanderings are not watched, so long as they do not
          lead to any open declension. Secret prayer will be hurried over,
          worldly thoughts unresisted, waste of time in frivolous pursuits
          indulged, without much concern. Not so, when the heart is fully in
          pursuit of its object. There is a carefulness, lest wandering thoughts
          should become habitual. There is a resistance of the first step, that
          might lead into a devious path. The soul remembers the &quot;wormwood
          and the gall,&quot; &quot;the roaring lion,&quot; and the devouring
          wolf; and in the recollection of the misery of its former wandering,
          dreads any departure from the Shepherd&#x27;s fold.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blessed state of mind the flock of Christ should cherish with
          godly jealousy. Yet let it be remembered, that daily progress in the
          heavenly walk is not maintained by yesterday&#x27;s grace. Humble and
          dependent prayer must fetch in a fresh supply continually, &quot;O let
          me not wander from Your commandments.&quot; &#x27;Lord, I feel my
          heart so prone to wander. My affections are often scattered to the
          ends of the earth. &quot;Unite my heart to fear Your name.&quot;
          Concentrate every thought, every desire, in Yourself, as the one
          object of attraction.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Your word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against
          You.
        </p>
        <p>
          What an aggregate of guilt and misery is comprehended in this short
          word &quot;sin&quot;! Sin is the greatest curse that ever entered the
          universe of God, and the parent of every other curse! Its guilt is
          aggravated beyond the conception of thought. Injury to a Superior—a
          Father—a Sovereign! Its power is misery wherever it extends—in the
          family—in the world. In eternity its power is unrestrained. Sometimes
          the death-bed scene casts a fearful gleam of light upon &quot;the worm
          that never dies, and the fire that never shall be quenched.&quot; But
          experience alone, can develop its full-grown horrors.
        </p>
        <p>
          How supremely important therefore is the object of our preservation
          from sin! and how wisely adapted are the means to the end! That
          word—which the man of God had just before mentioned as the guide to
          the cleansing of the way—he hides within his heart—not for
          concealment, but for security, that it may be ready for constant use.
          It is not therefore a mere acquaintance with the word, that will avail
          us. There must be a cordial assent—a sound digestion—a constant
          respect. It must be to us the rule that we would not transgress—the
          treasure that we are afraid to lose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often indeed Satan shuts out its entrance. He &quot;catches away that
          which was sown.&quot; Too often, again, it is &quot;withered or
          choked&quot; in the soil. But &quot;the honest and good heart&quot;
          &quot;hides it, keeps it, and brings forth fruit with perseverance,
          unto perfection.&quot;Here it &quot;dwells richly in all wisdom,&quot;
          the storehouse, as occasion requires; a principle of holiness; a
          covering from sin. In this view it is recommended by one who had well
          acquainted himself with its valuable uses: &quot;My son, let them (the
          Divine precepts) not depart from your eyes; keep sound wisdom and
          discretion. So shall they be life to your soul, and grace to your
          neck. Then shall you walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not
          stumble.&quot; David also gives us the same experience: &quot;By the
          word of Your lips I have kept myself from the paths of the
          destroyer.&quot; And it was probably this recollection, combined with
          a sense of continual danger, that suggested the prayer, &quot;Order my
          steps in Your word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over
          me.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of the word is inestimable, as our means of walking with God
          in the hurry, business, and temptation of the day. The Psalms furnish
          precious materials for spontaneous prayer; the promises, food for
          comfort; the rules, such light in perplexity; the instruction, such
          solid matter for godly conference—all operating for one end—a
          preservation from sin. Being from the word—a manifestation of the
          Savior&#x27;s love—what a keeping of the heart! what a quickening
          motive! How seasonable in worldly temptation is the warning of the
          word hidden in the heart, &quot;No man, having put his hand to the
          plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God!&quot; So in
          the spiritual conflict, let this word, &quot;Him who comes to Me, I
          will never cast out,&quot; be hidden in the heart—what a preservation
          is it against unbelief!
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the word to the wavering believer, alarmed by ridicule or
          persecution, &quot;If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me
          before it hated you.&quot; Fearing that he shall never hold out to the
          end; &quot;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&quot; Trembling
          lest his sins should rise up to his condemnation, &quot;The blood of
          Jesus Christ the Son of God cleanses from all sin.&quot; And then as
          to duties: Let his Savior&#x27;s word rebuke his indolence and
          unwatchfulness, &quot;What! could you not watch with Me one hour?
          Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation.&quot; Hide in the
          heart the sorrowful story of His agony in the garden, and His death on
          the cross, that &quot;sin may appear yet more exceedingly
          sinful.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how is the word to gain entrance into hearts like ours? How shall
          it be &quot;hid&quot; in so unkindly a soil? No power of man surely
          can plant it there. The Holy Spirit&#x27;s Almighty agency must be
          diligently sought; for in proportion as we are filled with His
          gracious influence shall we be armed, as was our Master, for the
          effectual resistance of our spiritual temptations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, connected with this subject, mark the Christian&#x27;s
          character, &quot;In whose heart is my law.&quot; His security,
          &quot;None of his steps shall slide.&quot; His happiness, &quot;O how
          I love Your law.&quot; His victory, &quot;The word of God abides in
          him, and he has overcome the wicked one.&quot; All infallibly provided
          by the covenant promise, &quot;I will put My law in their inward
          parts, and write it in their hearts.&quot; Oh! let us not then shrink
          from a close contact with the word, though the cost may be the cutting
          off a right hand for the saving of the life. There is no better test
          of our security, than our willingness to come to the searching light
          of the word.
        </p>
        <p>12. Blessed are You, O Lord: teach me Your statutes.</p>
        <p>
          &quot;Praise is lovely for the upright.&quot; It is at once their duty
          and their privilege. But what does highest exercise amount to, when
          placed on the ground of its own merit? We clothe our ideas with
          magnificence of language, and deck them out with all the richness of
          imagery; and perhaps we are pleased with our forms of praise. But what
          are they in His sight beyond the offering of a contemptible worm,
          spreading before its Maker its own mean and low notions of Divine
          Majesty? If a worm were to raise its head, and cry—&#x27;O sun! You
          are the source of light and heat to a widely-extended
          universe&#x27;—it would, in fact, render a higher praise to the sun,
          than we can ever give to our Maker. Between it and us there is some
          proportion—between us and God none. Yet, unworthy as the offering
          confessedly is, He will not despise it. No, more, instead of spurning
          it from His presence, He has revealed Himself as &quot;inhabiting the
          praises of Israel;&quot; thus intimating to us, that the service of
          praise is &quot;set forth in His sight as incense;&quot; and at the
          same time, that it should be the daily and unceasing exercise of one
          at his own home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The true character of praise, however, depends entirely upon the state
          of the heart. In the contemplative philosopher it is only cheerless,
          barren admiration: in the believer it becomes a principle of comfort
          and encouragement. For, can he forget the revelation, which his God
          has given of Himself in the gospel of His dear Son; how it divests
          every attribute of its terrors, and shines before us in all the glory
          of His faithfulness and love? The ascription of praise, &quot;Blessed
          are You, O Lord,&quot; frames itself therefore into the prophet&#x27;s
          song, &quot;Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity, and passes by
          the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retains not His
          anger forever, because He delights in mercy.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Truly then He is &quot;blessed&quot; in Himself, and delights to
          communicate His blessedness to His people. Hence we are emboldened to
          ask for continual &quot;teaching in His statutes,&quot; in the truths
          which He has revealed, and the precepts which He has enjoined; that we
          may &quot;be followers of Him, as dear children,&quot; and &quot;walk
          with Him in love.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The practical influence, however, of Divine light, constitutes its
          peculiar privilege. Man&#x27;s teaching puffs up—God&#x27;s teaching
          humbles. Man&#x27;s teaching may lead us into error as well as into
          truth—God&#x27;s teaching is &quot;the unction from the Holy One, by
          which we know all things.&quot; Man&#x27;s teaching may make us more
          learned—God&#x27;s teaching makes us more holy. It persuades, while it
          enlightens. It draws the heart, inclines the will, and carries out the
          soul to Christ. The tried character of God encourages us to look for
          His teaching, &quot;Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will He
          teach sinners in the way.&quot; Our warrant is especially confirmed in
          approaching Him as our covenant God, &quot;Lead me in Your truth, and
          teach me; for You are the God of my salvation. Teach me to do Your
          will: for You are my God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Reader! do you desire to praise your God? Then learn to frequent the
          new and living way, &quot;by which alone you can offer your sacrifice
          acceptably.&quot;And while engaged in this holy service, inquire,
          surrounded as you are with the means of instruction, what progress you
          are making in His statutes. Seek to have a deeper acquaintance with
          the character of God. Seek to be the vessels of honor and glory, into
          which He is pouring more and more continually, &quot;until they be
          filled with all the fullness of God.&quot; Value the unspeakable
          blessing of Divine teaching, by which you learn to live the life, and
          begin the blessedness of God.
        </p>
        <p>13. With my lips have I declared all the judgments of Your mouth.</p>
        <p>
          We have seen the word hid in the heart: now we see it poured forth
          from the lips. The Lord has taught us His statutes; now we declare
          these judgments of His mouth. But who can declare them with unction
          and power, except those who are taught of God? Now we are introduced
          to the high and honorable privilege of becoming a witness for our
          Savior! Our opportunities of service are our talents, and we trade
          with a large increase; for &quot;to everyone who has shall be given,
          and he shall have abundance.&quot; But, &quot;our lips are our
          own&quot;—is the proud language of the world. Blessed be God; &quot;we
          know that we are not our own.&quot; Most gladly do we acknowledge,
          that He, who fashioned our lips, has the best claim to their service.
          And when He has added to the claim of creation the right of purchase,
          what further constraining can we need, to induce the consecration of
          all that we are, and all that we have, to His glory!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a family obligation—to declare the judgments of God&#x27;s
          mouth. Thus did Abraham obtain a blessing for his children. Heavenly
          blessings are the gracious reward of thus honoring our God. This also
          is the material of our general conversation, fruitful in spiritual
          results. Thus did Andrew bring Peter, and the woman of Samaria her
          neighbors, to Jesus. What might we not do for our fellow-sinners, if
          our conversation with them was the overflowing of a heart full of
          love; guided by a single desire to glorify our Savior, and to edify
          His Church! Fearful, indeed, is the guilt of sinful silence; and
          those, who thus prove their unfaithfulness to God, may well tremble at
          His awful denunciations. And yet it is possible to be bold in speech
          for God, when in the closet, the family, or the world, our consciences
          justly convict us of insincerity: &quot;You who teach another, do you
          not teach yourself?&quot; Let us seek, therefore, to have our hearts
          &quot;filled with the Spirit&quot;; otherwise ours will be &quot;the
          talk of the lips, which tends only to poverty.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This subject illustrates the character of the Lord&#x27;s people,
          &quot;The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks
          of judgment;&quot; their resolution, &quot;My mouth shall show forth
          Your righteousness and Your salvation all the day; for I know not the
          numbers thereof;&quot; their prayer, &quot;O Lord, open my lips, and
          my mouth shall show forth Your praise;&quot; their blessing, &quot;The
          lips of the righteous feed many. A wholesome tongue is a tree of
          life.&quot; The example of the Savior, here as everywhere, is our
          perfect and encouraging pattern: &quot;I have preached righteousness
          in the great congregation; Lo! I have not refrained My lips, O Lord,
          You know.&quot; In this spirit of their Master, the Apostles awed
          their persecutors into forbearance: &quot;We cannot but speak the
          things which we have seen and heard.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          How sinful is it to employ our lips for any but the Lord! Yet not less
          sinful is our reluctance to employ them for Him! Surely the day, when
          perhaps we have been fluent in worldly conversation, and yet have
          neglected our opportunities of speaking a word for Him, must be
          considered a lost day! Is there not much cause for watchfulness,
          prayer, and self-denial; lest our silence should deny Him, whom by
          every obligation we are bound to confess? If our inability to bear a
          testimony for our Lord is not painful to us, must we not suspect, if
          not the sincerity, at least the strength, of our attachment to His
          precious name? and we can do no better than retire into our closets
          with the prayer of contrition, &quot;Enter not into judgment with Your
          servant, O Lord.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          14. I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, as much as in all
          riches.
        </p>
        <p>
          How natural is it to be speaking of that which is our delight! The man
          of God was always declaring the Lord&#x27;s judgments, because they
          were his rejoicing. There is indeed a real joy in despising earthly
          joys. &quot;How sweet&quot;—said Augustine, referring to the period of
          his conversion, &quot;was it in a moment to be free from those
          delightful vanities, to lose which had been my dread; to part with
          which was now my joy!&quot; More satisfying is the believer&#x27;s
          rejoicing in the way of God, than that of the miser in his untold
          riches. Here he may safely say to his soul, &quot;Soul, you have much
          goods laid up for many years; take your ease.&quot; And these are the
          only riches within the reach of all. If we are poor in this world, it
          is the Lord&#x27;s providence. If we are poor in grace, it is our own
          fault. It is because we have despised our Lord&#x27;s &quot;counsel to
          buy from Him gold tried in the fire, that we may be rich.&quot; And
          what is this enriching portion?, &quot;Things present or things to
          come;&quot; something enjoyed, and much more expected: the mercies of
          eternity added to the blessings of time; the riches of both worlds—all
          assured to him by the covenant of grace &quot;in the way of the
          Lord&#x27;s testimonies.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it not then most strange, that, with such treasure in possession
          and in prospect, the child of God should be so careless in increasing
          his store, and in confirming his own interest in it? But the riches of
          God&#x27;s testimonies have this peculiar property, that they cease to
          rejoice the heart, when they are not uppermost there. Have there not
          been times, when we have actually rejoiced in the accession of some
          worldly good, or the accomplishment of some worldly desire, more than
          in this heavenly treasure? What then do we count our riches? To thrive
          in grace, or in the world? To be rich towards God, or for our own
          indulgence?
        </p>
        <p>
          But though we would rejoice in the testimonies, and would not, for all
          this world can afford, lose a verse or a letter of our Bibles, yet we
          cannot be satisfied with a general interest. Many texts—doctrinal,
          practical, or experimental—have been specially sealed by the Divine
          Spirit upon our hearts. This or that promise—yes, all the land of
          promise, as much as I can set my foot upon—is mine. From these
          precious testimonies, shall we not increase our little stock, until we
          have apprehended the full enjoyment of the whole; if indeed the
          fullness of that which is called &quot;unsearchable&quot; can ever be,
          in this life at least, completely enjoyed?
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not so much in the Lord&#x27;s testimonies, as &quot;in the
          way of them,&quot; that David rejoiced—the way to God, of which they
          testify; &quot;the way of holiness,&quot; in which they lead—the
          narrow way of the cross—so contrary to our natural desires and
          inclinations, that none but the true sheep of Christ can ever enter,
          or continue in it. Who that walks in these ways will fail to find
          them, in duties no less than in privileges, &quot;paths of
          pleasantness and peace?&quot; Our happiness is not withered, but
          flourishing. &quot;Thus says the Lord, Stand in the ways, and see, and
          ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and
          you shall find rest for your souls.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          15. I will meditate in Your precepts, and have respect to Your ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our rejoicing in the testimonies of God will naturally flow in a
          habitual meditation in them. The thoughts follow the affections. The
          carnal man can never be brought to this resolution. Having no
          spiritual taste, he has no ability for spiritual meditation. Indeed
          many sincere Christians, through remaining weakness and depravity, are
          too often reluctant to it. They are content with indolent reading:
          and, with scarcely a struggle or a trial, yield themselves up to the
          persuasion, that they are unable sufficiently to abstract their minds
          for this blessed employment. But let the trial prove the work.
          Perseverance will accomplish the victory over mental instability, and
          the spiritual difficulty will give way to prayer, &quot;Lord! help
          me.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The fruitfulness of meditation will soon be manifest. Does it not
          &quot;stir up the gift of God that is in us,&quot; and keep the
          energies of the heart in a wakeful posture of conflict and resistance?
          Besides this, meditation is the digestive faculty of the soul, which
          converts the word into real and proper nourishment: so that this
          revolving of a single verse in our minds is often better than the mere
          reading of whole chapters. &quot;Your words were found, and I ate
          them; and Your word was to me the joy and the rejoicing of my
          heart.&quot; Thus the mind becomes the instrument of faith and love—of
          joy and strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this meditation not only includes the stated times of thought, but
          the train of holy thoughts, that pass through the mind during the busy
          hours of the day. This maintains a habitual flow of spiritual desires,
          and excites the flame of love within, until at length the
          Psalmist&#x27;s resolution becomes the inwrought habit of our minds,
          &quot;I will meditate in Your precepts.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Can we lack a subject for meditation, if indeed the salvation of Jesus
          has been made known to our souls? While musing upon the glorious
          theme, does not &quot;the fire burn&quot; within, as if our hearts
          were touched with a live coal from the altar of God? Chide then,
          believer, your dull and sluggish spirit, that permits the precious
          manna to lie ungathered upon the ground, that is slow to entertain
          these heavenly thoughts, or rather that heavenly guest, whose peculiar
          office it is to &quot;help our infirmities,&quot; and especially to
          &quot;take of Christ&#x27;s, and show it to us.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The exercise, however, of this, as of every other duty, may prove a
          barren form, that imparts neither pleasure nor profit. Let each of us
          then ask—&#x27;What distinct experimental benefit have I received from
          the word? Do I endeavor to read it with prayerful meditation, until I
          find my heart filled with it?&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          But this communing with the word is not for contemplation, but for
          practice. By meditating on God&#x27;s precepts, we learn to have
          respect unto His ways—carefully &quot;pondering the path of our
          feet,&quot; that we &quot;turn not aside.&quot; &quot;Your
          loving-kindness is before my eyes; and I have walked in Your
          truth.&quot; &quot;My foot,&quot; says Job, &quot;has held His steps;
          His ways have I kept, and not declined. Neither have I gone back from
          the commandment of His lips; I have esteemed the words of His mouth
          more than my necessary food.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          16. I will delight myself in Your statutes: I will not forget Your
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          As delight quickens to meditation, so does the practical habit of
          meditation strengthen the principle of delight. In the enjoyment of
          this delight, the Christian (however small his attainments may be)
          would rather live and die, than in the pursuit, and even in the
          possession, of the most satisfying pleasures of a vain and empty
          world. But if it be a real &quot;delight in the Lord&#x27;s
          statutes,&quot; it will be universal—when they probe the secret
          lurking-places within, and draw out to the full light the hidden
          indulgences of a heart that is yet carnal; when they call for the
          entire crucifixion of every corrupt inclination, and the unreserved
          surrender of all to the self-denying service of our God. This spirit
          is very different from the delight of the hypocrite, which is rather
          to &quot;know,&quot; than to do, the &quot;ways of his God;&quot; and,
          therefore, who is satisfied with outward conformity, with little or no
          desire to &quot;understand the errors&quot; of his heart, that he
          might be &quot;cleansed from secret faults.&quot; The spring of our
          obedience will therefore prove its sincerity; and the reality of our
          love will be manifested by its fruitfulness and active cheerfulness in
          our appointed sphere of duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also observe here an evidence of adoption. Obedience is not a
          burden, but a delight. The servant may perform the statutes of God;
          but it is only the son who &quot;delights in them.&quot; But what—we
          may ask—is the spring of adoption? It is &quot;the Spirit of the Son
          sent into our hearts, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.&quot; It is
          because we are at peace with God through Jesus Christ; because the
          statutes are the message of reconciliation through Him, that they
          become delightful to those, who are partakers of this great salvation.
          &quot;The spirit of adoption,&quot; therefore, as the principle of
          delight, is the spring of acceptable obedience in the Lord&#x27;s
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          And surely those who are serving Him in this happy filial walk, are
          not likely to &quot;forget His word.&quot; As the eye is continually
          turned to the object of its affection, so the eye of the soul, that
          has been fixed with delight on the ways of God, will be habitually
          resting upon them. As one of the wise heathens observed—&#x27;I never
          yet heard of a covetous old man, who had forgotten where he had buried
          his treasure.&#x27; The reason is abundantly evident. His heart is in
          it. And this explains the forgetfulness of the ungodly or the
          formalist. They have no delight in the statutes. And who is not glad
          to forget what is distasteful? But if we &quot;have tasted that the
          Lord is gracious&quot;—if we have found a treasure &quot;in the way of
          His testimonies&quot;—we cannot forget the sweetness of the
          experience, or where to go to refresh ourselves with the repetition of
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forgetfulness of the word is, however, to the Christian, a source of
          continual complaint, and sometimes also of most distressing
          temptation. Not that there is always a real charge of guilt upon the
          conscience. For, as Thomas Boston somewhat quaintly
          observes—&#x27;Grace makes a good heart-memory, even where there is no
          good head-memory.&#x27; But means must be used, and helps may be
          suggested. Watchfulness against the influence of the world is of the
          first importance. How much of the good seed is choked by the springing
          thorns! If our hearts are ever refreshed with spiritual delight, we
          should be as cautious of an uncalled-for advance into the world, as of
          exposing an invalid&#x27;s susceptible frame to a damp or an unhealthy
          atmosphere. Whatever warmth has been kindled in spiritual duties, may
          be chilled by one moment&#x27;s unwary rush into an unkindly climate.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would also recommend increasing attention to the word, as the means
          of its preservation—the exercise of &quot;faith,&quot; without which
          it will &quot;not profit&quot;—the active habit of love, bringing with
          it a more habitual interest in the statutes—all accompanied with
          unceasing prayer for the gift of the Holy Spirit, made the express
          subject of promise for this purpose. Under His heavenly teaching and
          recollection, what delight will be found in the statutes! what blessed
          remembrance of His word! And what a happy spirit is this delight and
          remembrance of the word—the affections glowing—the memory
          pondering—the presence and manifestation of truth keeping the heart in
          close communion with God! &quot;O Lord God, keep this forever in the
          imagination of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and prepare
          their hearts unto You.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          17. Deal bountifully with Your servant, that I may live, and keep Your
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prayer appears to have been much upon David&#x27;s heart, and in
          its substance and object it is again repeated. Nor does he fail to
          acknowledge the answer to it. The believer, like David, is a man of
          large expectations. As regards himself—his own daily provocations and
          backslidings—he cannot stand upon his own ground. But when he brings
          with him the name, the blood, the intercession of Jesus; as soon could
          God deny His own beloved Son, as resist the supplication of those who
          present this all-prevailing plea. Not only so, but—is He not His own
          gift to His children, as the pledge of every other gift? And what
          other pledge can they need, to encourage them to draw near with the
          largest desire, and the most heavenly expectation? We may, indeed, be
          too bold in our manner of approach to God; but we cannot be too bold
          in our expectations from Him. Standing as we do upon such high and
          sure ground, it is equally dishonorable to Him, and impoverishing to
          ourselves, to ask only a little of Him. Rather let us, according to
          His own command, &quot;open our mouths wide; and He will fill
          them.&quot; Rather let us expect that He will deal—not only
          favorably—but bountifully with His servants—that, as &quot;our God, He
          will supply all our need according to His riches in glory by Christ
          Jesus.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And, indeed, the most experienced believer cannot forget, that he is
          in himself still the same poor, weak, empty, helpless creature as at
          first. Nothing, therefore, short of a bountiful supply can answer his
          continual neediness. And such a supply is always at hand. The act of
          prayer increases the power to pray. The throne of grace is a well,
          which no power or malice of the Philistines can stop up. We need not
          say, &quot;We have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep.&quot;
          Faith will enable us &quot;with joy to draw out of this well of
          salvation.&quot; Let us bring our empty vessels, until &quot;there is
          not a vessel more.&quot; Yes—believer—there is indeed a bountiful
          supply of grace—of every kind—suited to every need—grace to
          pardon—grace to quicken—grace to bless. Oh! see, then, that you come
          not empty away. Remember—who it is that pleads before the throne.
          Remember—that the grace you need is in His hand. From eternity He
          foreknew your case. He laid your portion by. He has kept it for the
          time of need; and now He only waits for an empty vessel, into which to
          pour His supply. He is ready to show you, how infinitely His grace
          exceeds all thoughts—all prayers—all desires—all praises.
        </p>
        <p>
          And say—what has been the fruit of your pleading, waiting expectancy
          at &quot;the throne of grace?&quot; Have you not returned thence with
          a fresh spring of devotedness in His service, with every selfish
          thought forgotten in the desire, that you &quot;may live, and keep His
          word?&quot; Nothing touched or moved your reluctant heart, but the
          apprehension of bountiful redeeming love. This makes obedience
          easy—delightful—natural—in a manner unavoidable. It
          &quot;constrains&quot; to it. The man now lives—not the animal life of
          appetite—not the sensual life of vanity and pleasure—but the only life
          that deserves the name. He lives singly, supremely &quot;to Him who
          died for him, and rose again.&quot; He &quot;lives, and keeps His
          word.&quot; His motto and character now is, &quot;To me to live is
          Christ.&quot; He values life only by his opportunities of serving his
          God. The first archangel knows not a higher object of existence. And
          how encouraging the reflection, that in this glorious object the
          lowest servant in the household of God is an equal participant with
          the most blessed inhabitant of heaven!
        </p>
        <p>
          18. Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Your law.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to keep God&#x27;s word, must we not pray to understand it?
          What then is the prayer? Not—give me a plainer Bible—but open my eyes
          to know my Bible. Not—show me some new revelations beside the law—but
          make me behold the wonders of the law. David had acquired in the
          Divine school &quot;more understanding than all his teachers;&quot;
          yet he ever comes to his God under a deep sense of his blindness.
          Indeed those who have been best and longest taught, are always the
          most ready to &quot;sit at the feet of Jesus,&quot; as if they had
          everything to learn. It is an unspeakable mercy to know a little, and
          at the same time to feel that it is only a little. We shall then be
          longing to know more, and yet anxious to know nothing, except as we
          are taught of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are indeed in God&#x27;s law things so wondrous, that &quot;the
          angels desire to look into them.&quot; The exhibition of the scheme of
          redemption is in itself a world of wonders. The display of justice
          exercised in the way of mercy, and of mercy glorified in the exercise
          of justice, is a wonder, that must fill the intelligent universe of
          God with everlasting astonishment. And yet these &quot;wondrous
          things&quot; are hidden from multitudes, who should be most deeply
          interested in the knowledge of them. They are &quot;hidden,&quot; not
          only from the ignorant and unconcerned, but &quot;from the wise and
          prudent; and revealed&quot; only &quot;to babes&quot;—to those who
          practically acknowledge that important truth, that a man &quot;can
          receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.&quot; External
          knowledge is like the child spelling the letters without any
          apprehension of the meaning. It is like reading a large and clear
          print with a thick veil before our eyes. Oh! how needful then is the
          prayer—&#x27;Unveil;&#x27;, &quot;Open my eyes:&quot; let the veil be
          taken away from the law, that I may understand it; and from my heart,
          that I may receive it!
        </p>
        <p>
          But do not even Christians often find the word of God to be as a
          sealed book? They go through their accustomed portion, without gaining
          any increasing acquaintance with its light, life, and power, and
          without any distinct application of its contents to their hearts. And
          thus it must be, whenever reading has been unaccompanied with prayer
          for Divine influence. For we not only need to have our &quot;eyes
          opened to behold&quot; fresh wonders, but also to give a more
          spiritual and transforming perception of those wonders, which we have
          already beheld.
        </p>
        <p>
          But are we conscious of our blindness? Then let us hear the counsel of
          our Lord, that we &quot;anoint our eyes with eye-salve, that we may
          see.&quot; The recollection of the promises of Divine teaching is
          fraught with encouragement. The Spirit is freely and abundantly
          promised in this very character, as &quot;the Spirit of wisdom and
          revelation in the knowledge of God.&quot; If, therefore, we desire a
          clearer insight into these &quot;wondrous things&quot; of
          revelation—if we would behold the glorious beauty of our Immanuel—if
          we would comprehend something more of the immeasurable extent of that
          love, with which &quot;God so loved the world, as to give His
          only-begotten Son,&quot; and of that equally incomprehensible love,
          which moved that Son so cheerfully to undertake our cause—we must make
          daily, hourly use of this important petition, &quot;Open my
          eyes!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          19. I am a stranger in the earth: hide not Your commandments from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such is the condition of the child of God—a stranger in the earth!
          This confession, however, from a solitary wanderer would have had
          little comparative meaning. But in the mouth of one, who was probably
          surrounded with every sort of worldly enjoyment, it shows at once the
          vanity of &#x27;&#x27;earth&#x27;s best joys,&quot; and the heavenly
          tendency of the religion of the Bible. This has been ever the
          character, confession, and glory of the Lord&#x27;s people. We
          &quot;would not live always;&quot; and gladly do we hear the warning
          voice, that reminds us to &quot;arise and depart, for this is not our
          rest.&quot; And was not this especially the character, not of David
          only, but of David&#x27;s Lord? Born at an inn— &quot;having nowhere
          to lay His head&quot;—suffering hunger—subsisting upon alms—neglected
          by His own—He &quot;looked for some to take pity, but there was none,
          and for His comforters, but He found none&quot;—might He not justly
          take up the confession, &quot;I am a stranger in the earth?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This verse exhibits the Christian in many most interesting points of
          view; distant from his proper home—without a fixed residence—with no
          particular interest in the world—and submitting to all the
          inconveniences of a stranger on his journey homewards. Such is his
          state!
        </p>
        <p>
          And the word of God includes all that he needs—a guide, a guard, a
          companion—to direct, secure, and cheer his way. &quot;When you go, it
          shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall keep you; and when you awake,
          it shall talk with you.&quot; Most suitable then is the
          stranger&#x27;s prayer, &quot;hide not Your commandments from
          me.&quot; Acquaintance with the word of God supplies the place of
          friends and counselors. It furnishes light, joy, strength, food,
          armor, and whatever else he may need on his way homewards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pilgrim-spirit is the pulse of the soul. All of us are traveling
          to eternity. The worldling is at home in the earth—a pilgrim only by
          restraint. His heart would say, &quot;It is good for me to be here.
          Let God dispose of heaven at His pleasure. I am content to have my
          &quot;portion in this life.&quot; The child of God is a stranger in
          the earth. Heaven is the country of his birth. His kindred—his
          inheritance—his Savior—his hope—his home—all is there. He is &quot;a
          citizen of no insignificant city,&quot; of &quot;the heavenly
          Jerusalem.&quot; He is therefore a pilgrim in affection, no less than
          in character. How cheering is the thought, that &quot;here we have no
          continuing city,&quot; if in heart and soul we are &quot;seeking one
          to come!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          We know, indeed, that we cannot—we would not—call this world our home,
          and that it is far better to be without it, than to have our portion
          in it. But do we never feel at home in the earth, thus forgetting our
          proper character, and our eternal prospects? Do we always live, speak,
          and act as &quot;strangers in the earth;&quot; in the midst of earthly
          enjoyments, sitting loose to them, as if our treasure was in heaven?
          Does our conversation in the society of the world savor of the home,
          where we profess to be going? Is the world gaining ascendancy in our
          affection? Let the cross of Calvary be the object of our daily
          contemplation—the ground of our constant &quot;glorying;&quot; and the
          world will then be to us as a &quot;crucified&quot; object.
        </p>
        <p>
          And lastly, let us not forget, that we are looking forward, and making
          a progress towards a world, where none are strangers—where all are
          children of one family, dwelling in one eternal home. &quot;In our
          Father&#x27;s house,&quot; said our gracious Head, &quot;are many
          mansions: I go to prepare a place for you.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          20. My soul breaks for the longing that it has unto Your judgments at
          all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          This intense desire and affection is the Christian&#x27;s answer to
          his prayers—Open my eyes—Hide not Your commandments from me. For who
          that is conversant with this blessed revelation but longs to be filled
          with it? In contrasting this glow with the church of Laodicea, under a
          brighter dispensation, &quot;neither cold nor hot&quot; which state,
          we may ask, most nearly resembles our own? Observe also, not only the
          fervor, but the steady uniformity, of this religion. It was not a
          rapture, but a habit; constant and uniform; &quot;at all times.&quot;
          With us such enjoyments are too often favored seasons, happy moments;
          alas! only moments—why not days, and months, and years? The object of
          our desires is an inexhaustible spring. The longing of the soul can
          never over-reach its object. The cherished desire, therefore, will
          become the established habit—the element in which the child of God
          lives and thrives.
        </p>
        <p>
          This uniformity is the most satisfactory test of our profession. Often
          are the judgments prized in affliction, when all other resources fail:
          or under a pang of conscience when the terror of the Lord is frowning
          upon the sinner. But the excitement wears off, and the heart returns
          to its hardness. Often also the impulse of novelty gives a strong but
          temporary impression. This is very different from the Christian, whose
          study is stretching out its desires at all times; finding the
          judgments a cordial or a discipline, a support or a preservation, as
          his need may require.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not less important is this habit, as the test of the soul&#x27;s
          prosperity. We are not satisfied with occasional fellowship with a
          beloved friend. His society is the life of our life. We seek him in
          his own ways, where he is accustomed to resort. We feel the blank of
          his absence. We look out for his return with joyous anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, is this the picture of our soul&#x27;s longing for communion with
          Jesus? We may feel His loss, should the stated seasons of prayer fail
          in bringing Him near to us. But do we long for Him at all times? Do we
          &quot;wait for Him in the way of His judgments,&quot; where He is
          usually found? And when spiritual exercises are necessarily exchanged
          for the occupations of the world, do we seize the leisure moment to
          catch a word—a glimpse—a look? Is not the heart silent with shame in
          the recollection of the cold habit of external or occasional duty?
        </p>
        <p>
          But why this low ebbing of spiritual desire? Do we live near to the
          throne of grace? Have we not neglected prayer for the influence of the
          Spirit? Have we not indulged a light, vain, and worldly spirit, than
          which nothing more tends to wither the growth of vital religion? Or
          have not the workings of unbelief been too faintly resisted? This of
          itself will account for much of our dullness; since the rule of the
          kingdom of grace is, &quot;According to your faith be it unto
          you.&quot; Grace is, indeed, an insatiable principle. Enjoyment,
          instead of satisfying, only serves to sharpen the appetite. Yet if we
          are content to live at a low rate, there will be no sensible interest
          in the consolation of the Gospel. We know, desire, and are satisfied
          with little; and, therefore, we enjoy but little. We live as borderers
          on the land, instead of bearing our testimony: &quot;Surely it flows
          with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.&quot; This is not
          the thriving, the cheerfulness, the adorning of the Gospel. It is
          rather the obscuring of the glory of our Christian profession, and of
          the happiness of its attendant privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let not the fervor of desire here expressed be conceived to be out of
          reach; nor let it be expected in the way of some sudden manifestation
          or excitement. Rather let us look for it in a patient, humble, and
          persevering waiting upon the Lord. We may have still to complain of
          coldness and wanderings. Yet strength to wait will be imperceptibly
          given: faith will be sustained for the conflict; and thus &quot;our
          souls will make their boast in the Lord,&quot; even though an excited
          flow of enjoyment should be withheld. One desire will, however, tread
          upon another, increasing in fullness, as the grand object is nearer
          our grasp.
        </p>
        <p>
          At all events, let us beware of resting satisfied with the confession
          of our lukewarmness to our fellow-creatures, without &quot;pouring out
          our heart before the Lord.&quot; There is a fullness of grace in our
          glorious Head to &quot;strengthen the things which remain, which are
          ready to die,&quot; as well as at the beginning to &quot;quicken&quot;
          us when &quot;dead in trespasses and sins.&quot; Abundant, also—are
          the promises and encouragements to poor, dry, barren souls, &quot;I
          will heal their backslidings; I will be as the dew unto Israel: he
          shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.&quot; For
          what purpose are promises such as these given, but that they may be
          &quot;arguments,&quot; with which to &quot;fill our mouth,&quot; when
          in the contrition of faith we again venture to &quot;order our cause
          before God?&quot; And &quot;will He plead against us with His great
          power?&quot; No! but &quot;He will put His strength in us;&quot; and
          we shall yet again &quot;run the way of His commandments&quot; with an
          enlarged heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          21. You have rebuked the proud that are cursed, which err from Your
          commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the histories of Cain, Pharaoh, Haman, Nebuchadnezzar, and Herod,
          exhibit the proud under the rebuke and curse of God. He abhors their
          persons, and their offerings; He &quot;knows them afar off,&quot;
          &quot;He resists them;&quot; &quot;He scatters them in the
          imaginations of their hearts.&quot; Especially hateful are they in His
          sight, when cloaking themselves under a spiritual garb; &quot;They
          say, Stand by yourself, come not near me; for I am holier than you.
          These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.&quot;
          Most of all, is this sin an abomination in His own beloved people.
          David and Hezekiah are instructive beacons in the church, that they,
          least of all, must expect to escape His rebuke, &quot;You were a God
          who forgave them; though You took vengeance on their inventions.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the people of the world call the proud happy. But will they be
          counted so, when they shall be manifestly under the curse of God; when
          &quot;the day of the Lord shall be upon them to bring them low,&quot;
          yes, to &quot;burn them in the oven&quot; of &quot;His wrath?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Pride probably influences all, who &quot;err from the Lord&#x27;s
          commandments;&quot; yet doubtless &quot;the Righteous Judge&quot; will
          make an infinite difference between errors of infirmity and obstinate
          wilfulness. The confession of the man of God, &quot;I have gone astray
          like a lost sheep &quot;—is widely different in character from the
          subjects of this awful rebuke and curse. &quot;You have trodden down
          all those who err from Your statutes; for their deceit is
          falsehood.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          We wonder not at this expression of the mind of God concerning pride.
          There is no sin more abhorrent to His character. It is as if we were
          taking the crown from His head, and placing it upon our own. It is man
          making a God of himself—acting from himself, and for himself. Nor is
          this principle less destructive to our own happiness. And yet it is
          not only rooted, but it often rears its head and blossoms, and bears
          fruit, even in hearts which &quot;hate and abhor&quot; its influence.
          It is most like its father, the Devil, in serpentine deceitfulness. It
          is always active—always ready imperceptibly to mix itself up with
          everything. When it is mortified in one shape, it rises in another.
          When we have thought that it was gone, in some unexpected moment we
          find it here still. It can convert everything into nourishment, even
          God&#x27;s choicest gifts—yes, the graces of His Spirit. Let no saint,
          therefore, however near he may be living to God, however favored with
          the shinings of His countenance—consider himself beyond the reach of
          this temptation. Paul was most in danger, when he seemed to be most
          out of it; and nothing but an instant miracle of grace and power saved
          him from the &quot;snare of the Devil.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, the whole plan of salvation is intended to humble the pride of
          man, by exhibiting his restoration to the Divine favor, as a free gift
          through the atoning blood of the cross. How hateful, therefore, is
          proud man&#x27;s resistance to this humbling doctrine of the cross,
          and the humbling requisitions of the life of faith flowing from it!
          This makes the sure &quot;foundation&quot; of the believer&#x27;s
          hope, &quot;a stone of stumbling&quot; to the unbeliever&#x27;s ruin.
          As regards also the means of salvation—how can pride lift up his head
          in the view of the Son of God, &quot;taking upon Him the form of a
          servant,&quot; that He might bear the curse of man? &quot;Behold, the
          soul that is lifted up, is not upright in him.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But can a sinner—can a saint—be proud?—one who owes everything to free
          and sovereign grace—one who has wasted so much time—abused so much
          mercy—so grieved the Spirit of God—who has a heart so full of
          atheism—unbelief—selfishness? No, the very pride itself should be the
          matter of the deepest daily humiliation. Thus the remembrance of it
          may, under Divine grace, prove an effectual means of subduing it in
          our hearts. We shall overcome corruption by its own working, and meet
          our adversary with his own weapons. And if this cursed principle be
          not wholly destroyed, yet the very sight of its corruption, deepening
          our contrition, will be overruled for our spiritual advancement.
        </p>
        <p>
          O blessed end intended by the Lord&#x27;s dealings with us! to
          &quot;humble and to prove us&quot; &quot;to know,&quot; and to make us
          know &quot;what was in our heart, that He might do us good at the
          latter end!&quot; Let us not frustrate His gracious intentions, or
          build again the things which He would have destroyed. May we love to
          lie low—lower than ever—infinitely low before Him! Lord! teach us to
          remember, that &quot;that which is highly esteemed among men, is
          abomination in Your sight.&quot; Teach us to bless You, for even Your
          sharp and painful discipline which tends to subjugate this hateful
          pride of our hearts before our Savior&#x27;s cross!
        </p>
        <p>
          22. Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept Your
          testimonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proud under the rebuke of God are usually distinguished by their
          enmity to His people. They delight to pour upon them &quot;reproach
          and contempt,&quot; with no other provocation given, than that their
          keeping the testimonies of God condemns their own neglect. This must,
          however, be counted as the cost of a decided, separate, and consistent
          profession. Yet it is such a portion as Moses valued above all the
          treasures of the world; yet it is that reproach, which our Master
          Himself &quot;despised,&quot; as &quot;reckoning it not worthy to be
          compared with &quot;the joy that was set before Him.&quot; For did He
          bear His cross only on the way to Calvary? It was laid for every step
          in His path; it met Him in every form of suffering, of &quot;reproach
          and contempt.&quot; Look then at Him, as taking up His daily cross in
          breathing the atmosphere of a world of sin, and &quot;enduring the
          contradiction of sinners against Himself.&quot; Mark Him consummating
          His course of &quot;reproach and contempt,&quot; by suffering
          &quot;outside the gate;&quot; and can we hesitate to &quot;go forth
          unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The trial, however—especially if cast upon us by those whom we have
          loved and valued, or by those whom we wish to love and value us—proves
          most severe; and the spreading our case, after David&#x27;s example,
          before the Lord, is the only preservation from faintness, &quot;Remove
          from me reproach and contempt.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps &quot;contempt&quot; is more hard to bear than
          &quot;reproach.&quot; Even our enemies think of us so much better than
          we deserve, that it strikes with peculiar poignancy. Yet when the
          submissive prayer of deprecation is sent us; doubtless some answer—and
          that the right answer—will be given; and whether the
          &quot;reproach&quot; be removed, or &quot;grace&quot; given
          &quot;sufficient&quot; to endure it, the outcome will prove alike for
          the glory of God, and the prosperity of our own souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us beware of that &quot;way of escape&quot; in returning to
          the world, which the insincere are ever ready to pursue. They dare not
          act according to the full conviction of their consciences: they dare
          not confront their friends with the avowal of their full determination
          to form their conduct by the principles of the word of God. This is
          hard—this is impossible. They know not the &quot;victory which
          overcomes the world&quot;, and, therefore, cannot bear the mark upon
          their foreheads, &quot;These are those who follow the Lamb wherever He
          goes.&quot; Far better, however, will be the heaviest weight of
          &quot;reproach and contempt,&quot; than any such endeavor to remove it
          from ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The desire to escape the cross convicts the heart of unfaithfulness,
          and makes way for tenfold difficulties in our path. Every worldly
          compliance against the voice of God is a step into the by-path, which
          deviates wider and wider from the strait and narrow way, brings
          discredit upon our professions, proves a stumbling-block in the way of
          the weak, and will cause us, if not actually to come short, at least
          to &quot;seem to come short, of the promised rest.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But is the weight of the cross really &quot;above what we are able to
          bear?&quot; He who bore it for us will surely enable us to endure it
          for Him, and, upheld by Him, we cannot sink. It is a sweet exchange,
          by which the burden of sin is removed, and bound to His cross; and
          what remains to us is the lighter cross of &quot;reproach and
          contempt,&quot;—the badge of our discipleship. If, then, we have the
          testimony of our consciences, that in the midst of the persecuting
          world we &quot;have kept His testimonies,&quot; here is our evidence
          of adoption, of our Father&#x27;s special love, of the indwelling,
          comforting, supporting Spirit. Here, then, is our warrant of hope,
          that the overwhelming weight will be removed from us; and that we
          shall be able to testify to our Master&#x27;s praise in the Churches
          of God, that &quot;His yoke is easy, and His burden is light.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          23. Princes also did sit and speak against me; but Your servant did
          meditate in Your statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          David might well give his testimony to &quot;the words of the
          Lord,&quot; that they were &quot;tried words,&quot; for perhaps no one
          had ever tried them more than himself, and certainly no one had more
          experience of their faithfulness, sweetness, and support. Saul and his
          &quot;princes might indeed sit and speak against him;&quot; but he had
          a resource, of which they could never deprive him, &quot;Not as the
          world gives, give I unto you.&quot; As our blessed Master was employed
          in communion with His Father, and delighting in His work at the time
          when the &quot;princes did sit and speak against him;&quot; so, under
          similar circumstances of trial, this faithful servant of God, by
          meditation in the Lord&#x27;s statutes, extracted spiritual food for
          his support; and in this strength of his God he was enabled to
          &quot;suffer according to His will, and to commit the keeping of his
          soul to Him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The children of Israel in Egypt, Daniel in Babylon, and the disciples
          of Christ in the early ages of the Church, have each found &quot;this
          same affliction to be accomplished in themselves.&quot; that God is
          pleased to permit it, to show &quot;that his kingdom is not of this
          world,&quot; to wean His people from earthly dependencies, and to
          bring out before the world a more full testimony of His name.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other reason is suggested by this verse—to make His word more
          precious by the experience of its sustaining consolation in the
          conflict with the power of the world. Often, indeed, from a lack of a
          present application of the word—young Christians especially are in
          danger of being put to rebuke by the scorner&#x27;s sneer. The habit
          of scriptural meditation will realize to them a present God, speaking
          &quot;words of spirit and life&quot; to their souls. The importance,
          therefore, of an accurate and well-digested acquaintance with this
          precious book cannot be too highly estimated. In the Christian&#x27;s
          conflict it is &quot;the sword of the Spirit,&quot; which, if it be
          kept bright by constant use, will never be wielded without the victory
          of faith. Such powerful support does it give against fainting under
          persecution, that the good soldier may ever be ready to thank God, and
          to take courage. Christ has left it, indeed, as the portion of His
          people, &quot;In the world you shall have tribulation;&quot;
          counterbalanced, however, most abundantly, by the portion which they
          enjoy in Him, &quot;In Me you shall have peace.&quot; If, therefore,
          the one-half of this portion may seem hard, the whole legacy is such
          as no servant of Christ can refuse to accept, or indeed will receive
          without thankfulness.
        </p>
        <p>24. Your testimonies also are my delight, and my counselors.</p>
        <p>
          What could we want more in a time of difficulty than comfort and
          direction? David had both these blessings. As the fruit of his
          &quot;meditation in the Lord&#x27;s statutes,&quot; in his distress
          they were his &quot;delight;&quot; in his perplexity they were his
          &quot;counselors.&quot; He would not have exchanged his delight for
          the best joys of earth. And so wisely did his counselors direct his
          course, that, though &quot;princes sat and spoke against him,&quot;
          they &quot;could find no occasion nor fault.&quot; The testimonies of
          God were truly his &quot;counselors.&quot; He guided his own conduct
          by the rules laid before him in the book of God, as if he were having
          recourse to the most experienced counselors, or rather as if the
          prophets of his God were giving the word from His mouth. Thus the
          subject as well as the sovereign, had his counsel. On one side was
          Saul and his counselors—on the other side, David and the testimonies
          of his God. Which was better furnished with that &quot;wisdom which is
          profitable to direct?&quot; Subsequently as a king, David was
          constrained to make &quot;the testimonies of his God his
          counselors&quot;; and, probably, to his constant regard to their voice
          he owed much of his earthly prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such a dark world as this, beset with temptation at every turn, we
          preeminently need sound and wise counsel. But all of us carry an evil
          counselor within us, and it is our folly to listen to his voice. God
          has given us His word as a sure counselor, and &quot;he who hearkens
          to its counsel is wise.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, do we value the privilege of this heavenly counsel? Every
          improvement must increase our delight in it; a heartless interest
          shuts out this blessing. But those who make the word their delight
          will always find it their counselor. Yet a mere cursory reading will
          never realize to us its holy delight or counsel. It must be brought
          home to our own experience, and consulted on those trivial occasions
          of every day, when, unconscious of our need of Divine direction, we
          are too often inclined to lean to our own counsel. The Christian is a
          man of faith, every step of his way. And this habitual use and daily
          familiarity with the testimonies of God will show him the pillar and
          the cloud, in all the dark turns of his heavenly road. The word will
          be to him as the &quot;Urim and Thummin&quot;—an infallible counselor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, however, perplexity arises from the conflict, not between
          conscience and sinful indulgence (in which case Christian sincerity
          would always determine the path), but between duty and duty. When,
          however, acknowledged obligations seem to interfere with each other,
          the counsel of the word will mark their relative importance,
          connection, and dependence: the present path in providence: the
          guidance which has been given to the Lord&#x27;s people in similar
          emergencies; and the light which the daily life of our Great Exemplar
          exhibits before us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great concern, however, is to cultivate the habit of mind, which
          falls in most naturally with the counsel of the word. &quot;Walking in
          the fear of the Lord,&quot; in a simple spirit of dependence, and torn
          away from the idolatry of taking counsel from our own hearts, we
          cannot materially err; because there is here a suitableness between
          the disposition and the promise—a watchfulness against the impetuous
          bias of the flesh; a paramount regard to the glory of God, and a meek
          submission to His gracious appointment. If the counsel, however,
          should prove fallible, the fault is not in the word, but in the
          indistinctness of our own perception. We need not a clearer rule, or a
          surer guide, but a more single eye. And if, after all, it may not mark
          every precise act of duty (for to do this, even all the world
          &quot;could not contain the books that should be written&quot;), yet
          it determines the standard to which the most minute acting of the mind
          should be brought; and the disposition, which will reflect the light
          of the will of God upon our path.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let it be remembered, that any lack of sincerity in the heart—any
          allowance of self-dependence, will always close the avenues of this
          Divine light and counsel. We are often unconsciously &quot;walking in
          the light of our own fire, and in the sparks that we have
          kindled.&quot; Perhaps we sought, as we conceived, the guidance of the
          Lord&#x27;s counsel, and supposed that we were walking in it. But, in
          the act of seeking, and as the preparation for seeking, did we subject
          our motives and inclinations to a strict, cautious, self-suspecting
          scrutiny? Was the heart schooled to the discipline of the cross? Was
          &quot;every thought brought into captivity to the obedience of
          Christ?&quot; Or was not our heart possessed with the object, before
          counsel was sought at the mouth of God? Oh! how careful should we be
          to walk warily in those uncertain marks of heavenly counsel, that fall
          in with the bias of our own inclination! How many false steps in the
          record of past experience may be traced to the counsel of our own
          hearts, sought and followed to the neglect and counsel of God; while
          no circumstance of perplexity can befall us in the spirit of humility,
          simplicity, and sanctity, when the counsel of the Lord will fail!
        </p>
        <p>
          An undue dependence upon human counsel, whether of the living or the
          dead, greatly hinders the full influence of the counsel of the word.
          However valuable such counsel may be, and however closely it may agree
          with the word, we must not forget, that it is not the word—that it is
          fallible, and therefore must never be resorted to in the first place,
          or followed with that full reliance, which we are warranted to place
          on the revelation of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, what is it to have God&#x27;s word as our
          &quot;Counselor?&quot; Is it not to have Himself, &quot;the only wise
          God?&quot; When our Bibles, in seasons of difficulty, are searched in
          a humble, prayerful, teachable spirit, we are as much depending upon
          the Lord Himself for counsel, as if we were listening to an immediate
          revelation from heaven. We need not a new revelation, or a sensible
          voice from above, for every fresh emergency. It is enough, that our
          Father has given us this blessed &quot;word as a light to our feet,
          and a lamp to our path.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me then inquire—What is the counsel of God, that speaks directly
          to myself? If I am an unawakened sinner, it warns me to turn from sin;
          it invites me to the Savior; it directs me to wait upon God. If I am a
          professor, slumbering in the form of godliness, it shows me my real
          condition; it instructs me in the all-sufficiency of Christ, and
          cautions me of the danger of hypocrisy. If through grace I am made a
          child of God, still do I need my Father&#x27;s counsel to recover me
          from perpetual backsliding, to excite me to increased watchfulness,
          and to strengthen my confidence in the fullness of His grace, and the
          faithfulness of His love. Ever shall I have reason for the grateful
          acknowledgment, &quot;I will bless the Lord, who has given me
          counsel.&quot; And every step of my way would I advance, glorifying my
          God and Father by confiding in His counsel unto the end: &quot;You
          shall guide me with Your counsel, and afterwards receive me to
          glory.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          25. My soul cleaves to the dust; quicken me according to Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sin is no trifle to a child of God. It is his heaviest sorrow. Thus
          David—thus the Great Apostle found it. And where is the believer who
          has not full sympathy with their complaints? To have a soul cleaving
          to the dust, and not to feel the trouble, is the black mark of a
          sinner, dead in sins—dead to God. To &quot;know the plague of our own
          heart,&quot; to feel our misery, to believe and to apply the remedy,
          is the satisfactory evidence of a child of God. Dust is the portion of
          the world, and they wish for no better. But that the soul of the man
          of God should continually cleave to the dust, is most strange and
          humbling. And yet such is the influence of his evil nature—such the
          power of self-will and self-indulgence—such the regard to human
          praise, and cherishing of self-admiration, that were it not that he
          &quot;abhors himself&quot; for the very dust that cleaves to him, he
          would question the existence of a renewing change. He knows what he
          ought to be. He has tasted the blessedness of &quot;mounting upward on
          eagles&#x27; wings.&quot; But every attempt to rise is hindered by the
          clogging weight that keeps him down.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is, however, the cleaving of his soul that is so painful—not
          occasional, but constant—not like the bird of the morning that
          descends for a moment, and then soars his upward flight; but it seems
          as if, like the &quot;serpent—dust was to be his food;&quot; as if the
          spiritual, heaven-born soul was to sink and grovel below. And then, as
          the dust of the summer-road blinds the eye, and obscures the view—how
          does this earthliness of soul darken the view of the Savior, dim the
          eye of faith, and hide the glorious prospects which, when beheld in
          the clear horizon, enliven the weary pilgrim on his way!
        </p>
        <p>
          But this complaint is the language of conflict and humiliation—not of
          despondency. Observe the believer carrying it to the Lord—&#x27;Here I
          lie in the dust, without life or power. Oh! Savior, who &quot;came
          that I might have life, and that I might have it more
          abundantly&quot;—Quicken me: Breathe into me Your own life, that I may
          rise from the dust, and cleave to You.&#x27; This cry for quickening
          grace is the exercise of faith. We have a covenant to plead. Faith is
          the hand that takes hold of the promise, &quot;according to Your
          word.&quot; Can this word fail? &quot;Sooner shall heaven and earth
          pass away, than one jot or one tittle pass&quot; from the engagements
          of a covenant-keeping God. &quot;He is faithful who promised.&quot;
          The man who takes hold of this plea, is &quot;a Prince who has power
          with God, and prevails.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how different is the character of the mere professor! ready
          probably to make the same confession, yet without humiliation, without
          prayer, without faith. Nothing is more common than to hear the
          complaint—&quot;My soul cleaves to the dust.&quot; The world has such
          power over us—we are so cold—so dead to spiritual things:&#x27; while,
          perhaps, the complaint is never once brought with wrestling
          supplication, but rather urged in indolent self-delight, as an
          evidence of the good state of the heart before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet it is not the complaint of sickness, but an application to the
          physician, which advances the recovery of the patient. We do not
          usually expect to better our condition, by mourning over its badness,
          or merely wishing for its improvement. Nor is it the confession of
          sin, but the application to the Great Physician, that marks genuine
          contrition before God. That confession which evaporates in heartless
          complaints, belongs not to the tenderness of a renewed heart. But the
          utterance of genuine prayer is the voice of God&#x27;s own
          &quot;Spirit making intercession for us;&quot; and then, indeed, how
          cheering the encouragement, that He &quot;who searches the hearts,
          knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He makes intercession
          for the saints according to the will of God!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Some are ready to give up or delay their duty, when they have been
          unable to bring their heart to it. Thus does &quot;Satan get advantage
          of us&quot; by our &quot;ignorance of his devices.&quot; Quickening
          grace is not the ground or warrant for duty. Indisposition to duty is
          not our weakness, but our sin—not therefore to be indulged, but
          resisted. We must mourn over the dullness which hinders us, and
          diligently wait for the &#x27;help we every moment need.&#x27; God
          keeps the grace in His own hands, and gives it at His pleasure, to
          exercise our daily dependence upon Him. The acting of grace
          strengthens the habit. Praying helps to pray. If the door is closed,
          &quot;Knock, and it shall be opened.&quot; Assuredly it will not long
          be shut to him, who has faith and patience to wait until it be opened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let me sift the character of my profession. Is it a habitual,
          persevering, overcoming conflict with sin? Do I not sometimes indulge
          in fruitless bemoanings of my state, when I had far better be
          exercising myself in vigorous actings of grace? If I find &quot;my
          soul cleaving to the dust,&quot; am I not sometimes &quot;lying on my
          face,&quot; when I ought to be &quot;taking heaven by violence,&quot;
          by importunate petitions for quickening grace? Are my prayers
          invigorated by confidence in the word of God? Oh! let me remember that
          &quot;those who wait upon the Lord&quot; shall shake off the dust to
          which they have cleaved so long, and &quot;shall mount with wings like
          eagles,&quot; to take possession of their heavenly home.
        </p>
        <p>
          O Lord, make me more deeply ashamed, that &quot;my soul should cleave
          to the dust.&quot; Breathe upon me fresh influence from Your
          quickening Spirit. Help me to plead Your word of promise; and oh! may
          every fresh view of my sinfulness, while it prostrates me in
          self-abasement before You, be overruled to make the Savior daily and
          hourly more precious to my soul. For defiled as I am in myself, in
          every service of my heart, what but the unceasing application of His
          blood, and the uninterrupted prevalence of His intercession, give me a
          moment&#x27;s confidence before You, or prevent the very sins that
          mingle with my prayers from sealing my condemnation? Blessed Savior!
          it is nothing but Your everlasting merit, covering my person, and
          honoring my sacrifice, which satisfies the justice of an offended God,
          and restrains it from breaking forth as a devouring fire—to consume me
          upon my very knees.
