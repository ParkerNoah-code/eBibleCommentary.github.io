        <h2>119:26-50</h2>
        <p>
          26. I have declared my ways, and You heard me; teach me Your statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A beautiful description of the &quot;simplicity and godly
          sincerity&quot; of the believer&#x27;s &quot;walk with God!&quot; He
          spreads his whole case before his God, &quot;declaring his ways&quot;
          of sinfulness, of difficulty, and of conduct. And, indeed, it is our
          privilege to acquaint our Father with all our care and need, that we
          may be pitied by His love, and guided by His counsel, and confirmed by
          His strength. Who would not find relief by unbosoming himself to his
          Father? This showing of ourselves to God—declaring our ways of sin
          before Him without deceit—is the short and sure way of rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;You heard me.&quot; &quot;When I kept silence, my bones waxed
          old through my roaring all the day long.&quot; While the voice of
          ingenuous confession was suppressed, cries and lamentations were
          disregarded. It was not the voice of the penitent child; and,
          therefore, &quot;where was the sounding of his father&#x27;s
          affections, and of his mercies towards him?&quot; But now, on the
          first utterance of confession from his lips, or rather on the first
          purpose of contrition formed in his heart; &quot;while he is yet
          speaking,&quot; the full and free pardon, which had been signed in
          heaven, comes down with royal parental love to his soul, &quot;I said,
          I will confess my transgression to the Lord; and You forgave the
          iniquity of my sin.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! what cannot he testify of the more than parental tenderness, with
          which &quot;his transgression is forgiven, and his sin covered!&quot;
          And yet, how necessary to the free declaration of our ways is an
          acquaintance with the way of forgiveness! Had not our great &quot;High
          Priest passed into the heavens,&quot; how awful would have been the
          thought, that all things were &quot;naked and opened unto the eyes of
          Him with whom we have to do!&quot; We could only then have
          &quot;covered our transgressions as Adam, by hiding our iniquity in
          our bosom.&quot; But now, even though &quot;our ways&quot; are so
          defiled, so crooked that we cannot but &quot;abhor ourselves,&quot; on
          account of them, we are yet encouraged &quot;boldly&quot; to
          &quot;declare&quot; them all before God, with the assurance of finding
          present acceptance, and seasonable grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, having found the happy fruit of this sincere and child-like
          spirit, then follows the obligation of walking worthy of this mercy.
          Hence our need of the prayer for continual teaching. The same heavenly
          guidance, that brought us into the way of return, we need for every
          successive step to the end, &quot;Teach me Your way, O Lord: I will
          walk in Your truth.&quot; &quot;I have declared my&quot; ignorance, my
          sinfulness, and my whole experience before You, looking for Your
          pardoning mercy, Your teaching Spirit, and assisting grace, &quot;And
          You have heard me.&quot; O continue to me what You have been, and
          teach me more of Yourself!
        </p>
        <p>
          The hypocrite may pray after this manner. But he never thus opens his
          heart, and &quot;declares his ways&quot; beneath his God. And are we
          sincere in our dealings with Him? How often do we treat our Almighty
          Friend as if we were weary of dealing with Him! And even when we do
          &quot;declare our ways&quot; before Him, are we not often content to
          leave the result as a matter of uncertainty? We do not watch for the
          answer to our prayer. It will come in the diligent exercise of faith,
          but not perhaps in our way. We may have asked for temporal blessings,
          and we receive spiritual. We may have &quot;besought&quot; deliverance
          from trial, and we receive &quot;grace sufficient&quot; to bear it.
          But this is the Lord&#x27;s wise and gracious answer—You heard me. And
          how sweet are those mercies, which come to us manifestly marked with
          this inscription, &quot;Received by prayer!&quot; They are such
          encouragement to pray again. It is not our inevitable weakness, nor
          our lamented dullness, nor our abhorred wanderings, nor our opposed
          distractions, nor our mistaken unbelief; it is not any—no, nor all
          these—that can shut out prayer. If &quot;iniquity&quot; is not
          &quot;regarded in our heart,&quot; we may always hear our
          Savior&#x27;s voice, &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatever
          you shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it you. Hitherto
          have you asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you shall receive, that
          your joy may be full.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          27. Make me to understand the way of Your precepts; so shall I talk of
          Your wondrous works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the reiterated cries of the man of God for heavenly light,
          Teach me Your statutes—make me to understand the way of Your precepts.
          The need and the encouragement for these cries is equally manifest.
          Who has ever been known to understand the way of himself? And to
          whom—walking in a well-ordered conversation—has the Lord ever failed
          to show it? A man, untaught by the Spirit of God, may be able to
          criticize, and even clearly to expound, much of the word of God. But
          such a prayer as this has never ascended from the heart; the necessity
          of it has never been felt. And, doubtless, from this neglect of prayer
          have arisen those floating fancies and false and unscriptural
          doctrines, which crude, unexercised minds have too hastily embraced.
          Instead of humbly and simply asking, &quot;Make me to
          understand&quot;—men too often &quot;lean to their own
          understanding,&quot; and are &quot;vainly puffed up&quot; by their
          fleshly mind, &quot;not holding the Head.&quot; Such men may obtain
          loose fragments of spiritual knowledge; but they will not be in the
          faith, &quot;grounded and settled.&quot; They never know when they are
          upon safe ground; and being &quot;unlearned and unstable, they wrest
          the Scriptures&quot;—except the sovereign grace of God interpose,
          &quot;unto their own destruction.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Never must we forget, that teaching from above is indispensable to a
          right knowledge of the most simple truths. Ignorance and prejudice
          pervert the understanding. &quot;Spiritual things can only be
          spiritually discerned.&quot; Divine doctrines can only be apprehended
          by Divine light. But under heavenly teaching, the deeper and more
          mysterious truths (so far as they are needful to be understood) are
          manifested with the same clearness, as the more elementary doctrines:
          &quot;Eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart
          of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love Him. But
          God has revealed them to us by His Spirit. Now we have received—not
          the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might
          know the things that are freely given to us of God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Wondrous, indeed, is the spiritual revelation in the knowledge of
          Himself; including &quot;the hope of His calling;—the riches of the
          glory of His inheritance in His saints;—the exceeding greatness of His
          power&quot; manifested to, and wrought in, His people;—no other or
          less than that &quot;which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him
          from the dead.&quot; In the understanding of the way, we would be
          progressing until the new man &quot;grows up into the measure of the
          stature of the fullness of Christ.&quot; The smallest attainment in
          this knowledge is (as the great day will fully declare) of infinitely
          greater value than the highest intelligence in the field of earthly
          science.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how important is it to grow in this knowledge! Theoretical
          attainment is at a stand. Spiritual and practical knowledge is always
          advancing. Little, indeed, comparatively, is necessary for salvation.
          But much for comfort and steadfastness—much also for the clear
          discernment of that narrow way of the precepts so difficult to trace,
          and when traced so difficult to maintain. Not less important is it to
          keep the object in constant view. Why do I desire to understand that
          way? That I may commend it to others—that I may talk of Your wondrous
          works. Abhorred be the thought of indulging in a self-complacent view
          of my attainments! But oh! let my God be more admired by me, and
          glorified in me. And may I advance both myself and others in His
          obedience and praise!
        </p>
        <p>
          Often do we complain of restraint in religious conversation. But the
          prayer—Make me to understand while I talk—will bring &quot;a live coal
          to our lips&quot; from the altar of God, &quot;Our mouths will then
          speak out of the abundance of the heart,&quot; and &quot;minister
          grace to the hearers.&quot; Humility, teachableness, simplicity, will
          bring light into the understanding, influence the heart, &quot;open
          the lips,&quot; and unite every member that we have in the service and
          praise of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          28. My soul melts for heaviness; strengthen me according to Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is this David, &quot;whose heart is as the heart of a lion, here
          utterly melting?&quot; But the sorrows, as the joys of the spiritual
          man—dealing immediately with the Infinite and Eternal God—are beyond
          conception. Ordinary courage may support under the trials of this
          life; but when &quot;the arrows of the Almighty are within us, the
          poison thereof drinks up our spirit.&quot; How, then, can the
          Christian&#x27;s lot be so enviable, when their souls thus melt for
          heaviness? But this, be it remembered, is only &quot;for a
          season.&quot; There is a &quot;needs-be&quot; for it, while it
          remains: and in the end it &quot;will be found unto praise, and honor,
          and glory.&quot; Never, perhaps, are their graces more lively, or the
          ground of their assurance more clear, than in these seasons of sorrow.
          They complain, indeed, of the diversified power of indwelling sin. But
          their very complaints are the evidence of the mighty working of
          indwelling grace. For what is it but the principle of faith, that
          makes unbelief their burden? What but hope, that struggles with their
          tears? What but love, that makes their coldness a grief? What but
          humility, that causes them to loathe their pride? What but the secret
          spring of thankfulness, that shows them their unthankfulness, and
          shames them for it? And, therefore, the very depth of &quot;that
          heaviness which melts their souls&quot; away, is the exhibition of the
          strength of God&#x27;s work within, upholding them in perseverance of
          conflict to the end. Would not the believer then, when eyeing in his
          heaviest moments the most prosperous condition of the ungodly, say,
          &quot;Let me not eat of their dainties?&quot; Far better, and, we may
          add, far happier, is godly sorrow than worldly joy. In the midst of
          his misery, the Christian would not exchange his hope in the
          gospel—though often obscured by unbelief, and clouded by fear—for all
          &quot;the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.&quot; &quot;If
          the heart knows his own bitterness, a stranger does not intermeddle
          with his joy.&quot; Yet the bitterness is keenly felt. Sin displeases
          a tender and gracious Father. It has &quot;pierced&quot; the heart
          that loves him; and shed the blood that saves him. It grieves the
          indwelling Comforter of his soul. God expects to see him a mourner;
          and he feels he has reason enough to mourn, &quot;My soul melts for
          heaviness.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But this cry of distress is sometimes that of the child under his
          Father&#x27;s needful chastisement. The world is dethroned, but not
          extirpated, in the heart. Much dross is yet to be removed. The sources
          of the too attractive earthly joy must be embittered: and now it is
          that the discipline of the cross forces the cry, &quot;My soul melts
          for heaviness.&quot; Yet in the midst of heaviness, the child of God
          cannot forget that he is loved—that he is saved; and the recollection
          of this sovereign mercy makes his tears of godly sorrow, tears of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this melting heaviness has not wrought its work, until it has
          bowed us before the throne of grace with the pleading cry of
          faith—Strengthen me! For do we stand by the strength of our own
          resolutions or habits of grace? Unless the Lord renew His supply from
          moment to moment, all is frail and withering. But what burden or
          difficulty is too great for Almighty strength? &quot;Fear not, you
          worm Jacob; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small.&quot;
          And especially is our success assured, when the plea is drawn, as it
          is repeatedly in this Psalm—according to Your word. For what does that
          word assure us?, &quot;As Your days, so shall Your strength be.&quot;
          &quot;Will He plead against me&quot;—said Job, &quot;with His great
          power? No! but He will put strength in me.&quot; Thus David found it
          in his own case: &quot;In the day when I cried, You answered me, and
          strengthened me with strength in my soul.&quot; Thus also to the
          Apostle was the promise given and fulfilled: &quot;My grace is
          sufficient for you; for My strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot;
          And is not &quot;the God of Israel&quot; still &quot;he who gives
          strength and power to His people?&quot; still the same &quot;faithful
          God, who will not suffer them to be tempted above that they are able,
          but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that they may
          be able to bear it?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          When we are most sensible of our utter helplessness, and most simple
          in our reliance upon Divine strength, then it is, that the &quot;soul
          melting for heaviness,&quot; is most especially upheld and
          established. &quot;Heaviness in the heart of man makes it stoop; but a
          good word makes it glad.&quot; And how reviving is that &quot;good
          word&quot; of the Gospel, which proclaims the Savior anointed to
          &quot;give the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness,&quot;
          and gifted with &quot;the tongue of the learned, that he might know
          how to speak a word in season unto him that is weary!&quot; And no
          less encouraging is it to view Him &quot;melting for heaviness&quot;
          &quot;sore amazed, and very heavy&quot; under the accumulated weight
          of imputed guilt; learning by this bitter discipline, &quot;in that He
          Himself suffered being tempted, to support them that are
          tempted.&quot; Yet was He, like His faithful servant, strengthened
          according to His Father&#x27;s word, in the moment of his bitterest
          agony, by the agency of His own creation. And this faithful support,
          given to the Head, is the seal and pledge of what every member in
          every trouble will most assuredly enjoy. &quot;As the sufferings of
          Christ abound in His people, so their consolation also abounds by
          Christ.&quot; The blessed word will supply all their need—life for
          their quickening, light for their direction, comfort for their
          enjoyment, strength for their support, &quot;Strengthen me according
          to Your word.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord, may I ever be kept from despondency—regarding it as sinful in
          itself, dishonorable to Your name, and weakening to my soul; and
          though I must &quot;needs be sometime in heaviness through manifold
          temptations,&quot; yet let the power of faith be in constant exercise,
          that I may be able to expostulate with my soul, &quot;Why are you cast
          down, O my soul? and why are you disturbed within me? hope in God: for
          I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my countenance, and my
          God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          29. Remove from me the way of lying; and grant me Your law graciously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every deviation in principle and conduct from the strait and narrow
          path, is a way of lying. Every traveler in the way &quot;feeds on the
          ashes&quot; of his own delusion. Does it seem a marvel, that the man
          of God should deprecate so earnestly the influence of gross sin?
          &quot;The brand plucked out of the fire&quot; retains a susceptibility
          of the fire. The oldest Christian in the family of God might at any
          moment of unwatchfulness be captivated by the chain of his former
          sins. Might not the recollection of past compliances with this
          shameful sin naturally have suggested the prayer—Remove from me the
          way of lying? But even in the profession of the Gospel, should we
          &quot;be removed from Him that called us into the grace of Christ unto
          another gospel;&quot; should erroneous doctrines find a place in our
          system; and—as the natural consequence of doctrinal errors—should any
          inconsistency be marked in our practice; should there be any allowed
          principles of sinful indulgence, self-righteousness, conformity to the
          world, or shrinking from the daily cross—then, indeed, will the prayer
          naturally flow from our hearts—Remove from me the way of lying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most justly are ways such as these called &quot;ways of lying.&quot;
          They promise what it is impossible, in the nature of things, that they
          can ever perform: and prove to their deluded followers, that
          &quot;those who observe lying vanities, forsake their own mercy.&quot;
          We can be at no loss to trace these &quot;ways,&quot; to their proper
          source;—to him, who, &quot;when he speaks a lie, speaks of his own for
          he is a liar, and the father of it.&quot; A lie was his first—alas!
          too successful—instrument of temptation, by which he &quot;beguiled
          Eve through his subtlety,&quot; and still does he pursue the same
          deadly work throughout the world lying under his sway, beguiling the
          blinded &quot;children of disobedience,&quot; into the awful deception
          of mistaking their God, and into the blind choice of preferring
          &quot;broken cisterns&quot; to &quot;the fountain of living
          waters.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The gracious knowledge of the law is the only means of the removal of
          this evil way. David, as a king, had it written by him. He wished it
          written on him—not the book only before his eyes, but stamped on the
          heart. The external knowledge is the common benefit of all. The
          gracious knowledge is the covenant-blessing of the Lord&#x27;s
          people—the only effective principle of holiness. The law is still what
          it was—an enemy to the ungodly—forcing a hateful light upon their
          conscience; but a delight to the servant of God—framing his will, and
          directing his conduct. Thus truth extirpates lying. Christ reigns
          instead of Belial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus also we are enabled to &quot;keep our hearts&quot;—those leading
          wanderers, that mislead the rest. For wherever we see wandering eyes,
          wandering feet, and a wandering tongue, all flow from a heart, that
          has taken its own liberty in wandering from God. But with the law as
          our rule, and the Spirit as our guide, we shall be directed and kept
          in a safe and happy path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grant me Your law graciously. Grant me a clearer perception of its
          holy character—a more sensitive shrinking from transgressing it—a more
          cordial approval of its spirit—a more entire conformity to its
          directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          30. I have chosen the way of truth: Your judgments have I laid before
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only two ways lie before us for our choice, &quot;the way of
          lying,&quot; and &quot;the way of truth.&quot; God by the light of His
          word guides us into one—Satan by his temptations allures us into the
          other. The way of lying is the natural choice of man. The choice of
          the way of truth is the Lord&#x27;s work in the hearts of His
          people—the seal of His special eternal love. His teaching shows us the
          way; and His grace enables us to &quot;choose&quot; it . And who in
          his subsequent course has ever found reason to alter his first
          determination? Does Mary regret her &quot;choice of the good
          part?&quot; One whose solid and reflecting judgment was not likely to
          make a rash or hasty choice, tells us, of the outset of his course,
          &quot;What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for
          Christ.&quot; The experience of twenty years—instead of bringing
          matter for repentance—only confirmed him in his choice: and he repeats
          his determination with increasing energy of expression; &quot;Yes,
          doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the
          knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.&quot; In the same spirit one of the
          ancient fathers expresses himself: &quot;If I have any possessions,
          health, credit, learning—this is all the contentment I have of
          them—that I may have something to despise for Christ, who comprises in
          His own person all and everything that is most desirable.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The connection of this verse with the preceding well illustrates the
          bias of the believer&#x27;s heart. His experience of the deceitfulness
          of sin, Satan, and his own heart, stirs up the prayer, &quot;Remove
          from me the way of lying.&quot; But his choice is expressed in this
          verse, &quot;I have chosen the way of truth.&quot; The sincere desire
          to have &quot;the way of lying removed from us,&quot; is a clear
          evidence, that we have already &quot;chosen the way of truth:&quot;
          that &quot;the spirit of truth has guided us to Him,&quot; who is
          indeed &quot;the way of truth&quot;—the true and only &quot;way to
          God!&quot; And of all ways that could be set before the Christian,
          this is the way he would &quot;choose&quot;—as bringing most glory to
          his God, exalting the Savior, honoring the Spirit of God, and securing
          the salvation of his own soul. Whatever becomes of me—the Christian
          would feel—&#x27;I would have no other way than this. Yes, though I
          should perish, I would abide in it. So transcendent is the discovery
          of the glory of God—scarcely less clear than the glory of heaven
          itself!&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          The practical pathway, however, is often rugged—always narrow. We may
          have to encounter not only the reviling of an ungodly world, but even
          the suspicions of our brethren, who may not always understand our
          motives. Yet if our heart is upright with God, &quot;none of these
          things will move us. Our choice is made, and we are prepared to abide
          the cost.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But that our choice may be daily established, let us not forget the
          treasury of our life, light, and grace. Let us lay the &quot;judgments
          of God before us.&quot; For we have always some new lesson to
          learn—some new duty to perform—some new snare to avoid. We must
          therefore walk by rule—as under the eye of a jealous God, who
          enlightens and cheers our path—under the eye of the ungodly, who
          &quot;watch for our halting&quot;—under the eye of weak Christians,
          who might be stumbled by our unsteady walk—under the eye of
          established Christians, who will be yet further established by the
          testimony of our consistent profession. The Gospel affords all the
          material for this strict and accurate walk. All is given that is
          needed. The obedience that is enjoined is secured. &quot;God working
          in us,&quot; enables us to work for Him; and while we are humbly
          looking for further supplies, and diligently improving what has been
          already bestowed, He is pledged by promise to assist, as we are bound
          by duty to obey.
        </p>
        <p>
          What then—let me inquire—is the choice which I have made? I would
          remember that it is for eternity. And if, through the grace that has
          first chosen me, &quot;I have chosen the way of truth,&quot;—is the
          effect of this choice daily visible in a life and conversation well
          ordered according to the word of God? If it is good to &quot;hide that
          word in my heart,&quot; as a safeguard against sin; it is good also
          &quot;to lay it before&quot; my eyes, as the chart to guide my
          course—the model to direct my work—the support to uphold my weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
          31. I have stuck to Your testimonies; O Lord, put me not to shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have just seen the choice of the man of God, and the rule by which
          he acted upon it. Now we see his perseverance—first choosing the
          way—then sticking to it. While he complained of &quot;his soul
          cleaving to the dust,&quot; he would yet say—I have stuck to Your
          testimonies. Thus did he illustrate the apostle&#x27;s delineation of
          the Christian&#x27;s two hearts (as a converted African expressed it),
          &quot;I delight in the law of God after the inward man; but I see
          another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and
          bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, which is in my members.
          So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the
          flesh the law of sin.&quot; In the midst, however, of the most painful
          conflicts, the child of God holds fast his confidence. He feels that
          he hates the sin that he commits, and loves the Savior, whom, in spite
          of himself, he dishonors; so that, with all his sins and unworthiness,
          he fears not to put in his claim among the family of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, reader, seriously ask yourself—How did you become a Christian?
          Was it by birth and education, or by choice? If indeed by grace you
          have been enabled to &quot;choose the way of truth,&quot; then be sure
          you firmly stick to it; or better, far better, that you had not made
          choice of it at all. &quot;No man having put his hand to the plough,
          and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.—If you continue in My
          word, then are you My disciples indeed. It had been better for you not
          to have known the way of righteousness, than, after you had known it,
          to turn from the holy commandment delivered to you.&quot; Yet, praised
          be God for the security of perseverance! He who enabled you to
          &quot;put your hand to the plough&quot; will keep it there in the
          habit of faith, firm and steadfast. &quot;The Lord will perfect that
          which concerns you.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet this &quot;cleaving to the Lord,&quot; can only be maintained by
          unceasing conflict. The length and weariness of the way, and the
          slowness of your progress, are sources of constant and harassing
          trial. Revert, then, to the ground of your original choice. Was it
          made under the Lord&#x27;s light and direction? This reason may well
          bind you to &quot;stick to&quot; it. For are not the ways of God as
          pleasant—is not Christ as lovely—is not heaven as desirable—as at the
          beginning? No—have you not even more reason to adhere to your choice,
          than you had to make it? It was formed before at least you could fully
          know for yourself. Now &quot;you have tasted&quot;—you have the seal
          of experience. Is not the crown more joyous in the nearer prospect?
        </p>
        <p>
          Backslider! &quot;has God been to you a wilderness, and a land of
          darkness,&quot; that you virtually give your testimony after
          trial—&#x27;Satan is the better master, and I will return to
          him?&#x27; The world is the happiest path; and I will walk in it. This
          is, indeed, choosing a murderer in the stead of a Father,
          &quot;forsaking the fountain&quot; for the &quot;broken cistern.&quot;
          Oh! must there not be repentance in this path? May that repentance
          come before it be too late! Ponder who it was, that befriended you in
          the moment of a dreadful extremity, and snatched you as &quot;a brand
          from the burning.&quot; Ponder the endearing proofs of His
          love—condescending to become a man, &quot;a man of sorrows,&quot; and
          to die in the agony of the cross, bearing for you the eternal curse of
          God. And does not gratitude remind you, what returns of faithful
          service are due from a creature so infinitely indebted to Him? Surely
          the steadfast perseverance with which His heart cleaved to His costly
          work, may serve to put to shame your unsteadiness in &quot;sticking to
          His testimonies.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Believer! you are determined to abide by your choice—but not in your
          own strength. Remember him, who one hour declared, that he would
          sooner die with Christ than deny Him; and the next hour denied Him
          with oaths and curses. Learn, then, to follow up your resolution with
          instant prayer, &quot;O Lord, put me not to shame.&quot; Leave me not
          to myself, lest I become a shame to myself, and an offence to Your
          Church. &quot;I will keep Your statutes. O forsake me not
          utterly.&quot; Dependence upon the Lord, in a deep sense of our
          weakness, is the principle of perseverance. Never will he shut out the
          prayer of His faithful servant. He has promised, &quot;My people shall
          never be ashamed;&quot; and therefore, taking firm hold of His
          promise, you may &quot;go on your way rejoicing.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          32. I will run the way of Your commandments, when You shall enlarge my
          heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          A glowing picture of the Christian&#x27;s delight in the ways of God!
          If we &quot;have chosen the way of God&#x27;s commandments,&quot; and
          have been able to &quot;stick to&quot; this way, surely we shall wish
          to &quot;run in it&quot; with constancy and cheerfulness. We shall
          want to mend our pace. If we walk, we shall long to &quot;run.&quot;
          There is always the same reason for progress, that there was for
          setting out. Necessity, advantage, enjoyment, spur us on to the end.
          Whatever progress we have made, we shall desire to make more; we shall
          go on praying and walking, and praying that we may walk with a swifter
          motion; we shall be dissatisfied, yet not discouraged, &quot;faint,
          yet pursuing.&quot; Now this is as it should be. This is after the
          pattern of the holy Apostle:, &quot;Brethren, I count not myself to
          have apprehended: but this one thing I do; forgetting those things
          which are behind, and reaching forth unto those which are before, I
          press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
          Christ Jesus.&quot; But the secret as well as the pattern of Christian
          progress is—looking beyond the Apostle, and the &quot;so great cloud
          of witnesses, with which we are encompassed&quot;—and &quot;looking
          unto Jesus.&quot; Faith is the principle of life, and supplies the
          daily motion of life;—directing our eye to Him as &quot;the
          Author,&quot; until He &quot;becomes the Finisher,&quot; of our faith.
          This is at once our duty, our privilege, our happiness, and our
          strength. This is the point, at which we begin to run; and we &quot;so
          run, that we may obtain.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us more distinctly mark the medium through which this
          spiritual energy flows—an enlarged heart. Without this influence how
          could we run this way of God&#x27;s commandments? Such is the extent
          and latitude of the course, that a straitened heart is utterly
          inadequate to carry us through. There must be large treasures of
          knowledge, in order that from a rich &quot;treasure-house the good
          things&quot; may pour out abundantly. For indeed spiritual
          &quot;knowledge&quot; is the principle of &quot;multiplied
          grace.&quot; Scriptural truths, divinely fixed in the understanding,
          powerfully influence the heart. Christian privilege also greatly
          advances this important end. In seasons of depression we are &quot;so
          troubled, that we cannot speak.&quot; We cannot pour out our hearts,
          as at other times, with a large measure of spirit and life. But when
          &quot;we joy in God, having received the atonement,&quot; the spirit
          is invigorated, as with oil on the wheels, or as &quot;with wings to
          mount&quot; on high in the service of praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Very different, however, is this enlargement of heart from enlargement
          of gifts. Fluency of utterance is too often fearfully separated from
          the spiritual life, and utterly unconnected with delight in the way of
          God&#x27;s commandments. It is expression, not feeling—counterfeit
          grace—public, not secret or personal, religion. The yoke of sin is not
          broken, and the self-deceiver will be found at last among the deluded
          throng of gifted hypocrites, &quot;punished with everlasting
          destruction from the presence of the Lord.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed the spiritual principle is far too little realized. At the
          commencement of the course, conscious guilt straitens the approach to
          the throne of grace. Unbelief imprisons the soul. And even when the
          deliverer is known, who &quot;sets at liberty them that are
          bruised,&quot; still the body of death with all its clogging burden
          and confinement presses down the soul. Unbelief also continues to
          work, to narrow the conceptions of the gospel, and by the painful
          recollections of the past, to bring in distrust, distance, and
          bondage. And most painful is this restraint. For the soul, which is
          but beginning to see how desirable is the favor of God, feels also an
          earnest desire to honor Him. And to him who—having fully &quot;tasted
          that the Lord is gracious&quot;—asks, &quot;What shall I render unto
          the Lord?&quot; this remaining influence of &quot;the spirit of
          bondage&quot; is more afflicting, than perhaps was a greater measure
          of it in a less enlightened stage of his way. Still, however, this
          legal spirit pursues him. His comforts, ebbing and flowing, according
          as he is dissatisfied or satisfied with his Christian progress,
          clearly evince a secret &quot;confidence in the flesh,&quot; greatly
          hindering that &quot;rejoicing in Christ Jesus,&quot; which so
          enlarges the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus by the shackles of sin, unbelief, and self-righteousness, we are
          indeed &#x27;sore let and hindered in running the race set before
          us.&#x27; (Collect for Advent.) The light is obscured. Faith loses
          sight of its object. What otherwise would be a delight becomes a
          weariness. Obedience is irksome; self-denial intolerable; the cross
          heavy. The heart is, as it were, &quot;shut up, and it cannot get
          forth.&quot; Faith is so low: desires are so faint; hopes so narrow,
          that it seems impossible to make progress. Frequent defeats induce
          despondency. The world is resorted to. Sin ensnares and captivates.
          Thus &quot;we did run well; but we have been hindered.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This sad evil naturally leads us to inquire for the remedy. The case
          is backsliding, not apostasy. The remedy therefore is in that
          engagement, which embraces a wider expanse of light, and a more full
          confidence of love. We find that we have not been
          &quot;straitened&quot; in God, but &quot;in our own affections.&quot;
          If then the rich fool thought of enlarging his barns, when his stores
          had increased upon him, much more should we &quot;enlarge the place of
          our tent,&quot; that we may make more room for God, encourage larger
          expectations, if we would have more full manifestations of Him. Let
          not the vessels fail, before the oil stays. Continually let the
          petition be sent up, &quot;Oh that You would bless me indeed, and
          enlarge my coast!&quot; Whatever cause we have to cry out, &quot;My
          leanness, my leanness!&quot;—still let us, in the exercise of faith
          and prayer, be waiting for a more cheerful ability to love, serve, and
          praise. Let us be restless, until the prison-doors are again opened,
          and the command is issued to the prisoners, &quot;Go forth: and to
          them that are in darkness—Show yourselves. They shall feed in the
          ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.&quot; Who knows
          but the Lord will once more shine upon us; once more unloose our
          fetters, and renew our strength?
        </p>
        <p>
          But again and again must we be reminded that every motion must begin
          with God. I will run—but how? not in my own strength, but by &quot;the
          good hand of my God upon me,&quot; delivering and enlarging my heart.
          He does not say—I will make no efforts, unless You work for me; but if
          You will enlarge—I will run. Weakness is not the plea for indolence,
          but for quickening grace. &quot;Draw me&quot;—says the Church,
          &quot;we will run after You.&quot; Effectual calling will issue in
          running.&quot; Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
          liberty.&quot; The secret of Christian energy and success is a heart
          enlarged in the love of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me then begin betimes—make haste—keep straight on—fix my eye on
          the mark, &quot;endure unto the end.&quot; I may yet expect in the joy
          of blessed surprise to exclaim, &quot;Or ever I was aware, my soul
          made me like the chariots of Ammi-nadib.&quot; Godly sorrow had made
          me serious. Now let holy joy make me active. &quot;The joy of the Lord
          is my strength;&quot; and I am ready, under the power of constraining
          love, to work and to toil—to run without weariness—to &quot;march
          onward&quot; without fainting; not measuring my pace by my own
          strength, but looking to Him who &quot;strengthens with all might by
          His Spirit in the inner man.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy fruit of wrestling prayer and diligent waiting on God! Joy in
          God, and strength to walk with Him, with increasing knowledge of Him,
          increasing communion with Him, and increasing confidence in Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          33. Teach me, O Lord, the way of Your statutes; and I shall keep it
          unto the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need no instruction in the way of sin. That has been our way, ever
          since Adam &quot;sought out his own invention.&quot; The ungodly
          &quot;desire no knowledge of the way of God&#x27;s statutes.&quot; The
          heart leads the judgment, and &quot;their heart is enmity to the law
          of God.&quot; But for a child of God, this is a prayer for constant
          use. The outward revelation is of no avail without the inward
          teaching. The Divine Instructor must interpret and apply His own rule.
          However plain the word may be, the darkness must be removed from the
          understanding. Light will not show an object, except the faculty of
          sight be given. A blind man cannot see at noonday. We know nothing
          spiritually, except as we are taught of God. The more we are taught,
          the more we feel our need of teaching, and the more pressing will be
          our cries for this invaluable blessing. The blind man must be led in
          the plainest and most direct, as well as in the more difficult and
          rugged paths. And thus do we need the shining of light from above—not
          only in the &quot;deep things of God&quot;—but for the reception of
          the most elementary truths. And yet we want not this knowledge for its
          own sake—to feed pride or speculation—but for its practical influence.
          For of what avail is the discovery even of important truth, if we be
          not molded into its likeness, and constrained &quot;into the obedience
          of faith?&quot; The connection of every thought with Christian
          practice, here directed to its proper end, is a most striking proof of
          the Divine origin of the statutes. The most clear instructions for the
          regulation of our conduct flow from single sentences or expressions in
          these &quot;statutes;&quot; and this clearly proves an infinite wisdom
          in their distribution, a reference in the eternal mind to every detail
          of practical duty, and a Divine power and unction, applying the word
          to the several circumstances of daily conduct. For, indeed, what mind
          but the mind of God could have comprehended in so small a compass such
          a vast system of instruction? In this view, therefore, the Lord&#x27;s
          teaching becomes the spring of obedience. For how can we
          &quot;keep&quot; a way, which we do not understand? And who was ever
          &quot;taught the way of the Lord&#x27;s statutes,&quot; who had not
          his heart constrained and directed by their spiritual beauty and
          sweetness? In this path we realize union with the Savior; &quot;the
          love of God is perfected in us;&quot; and our confidence is
          established before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The object nearest to the believer&#x27;s heart, and which causes him
          many an anxious—and too often many an unbelieving thought—is the grace
          of perseverance. Now the Lord&#x27;s teaching is the principle of
          perseverance. It is &quot;the light of life,&quot; enlightening the
          mind, and quickening the heart. Under this influence, therefore, we
          live—we endure—we cannot fail of keeping the way unto the end. Thus
          the end crowns the work. For with this blessing of perseverance, is
          sealed to us the hope of victory over our spiritual enemies, and the
          participation of our Savior&#x27;s glory. Confidence, indeed, without
          prayer and dependence upon our glorious Head, is most daring
          presumption. But that &quot;well-ordered and sure covenant,&quot;
          which &quot;is all our salvation, and all our desire,&quot; engages
          for our continuance in &quot;the way of the Lord&#x27;s
          statutes.&quot; &quot;I will put My fear in their hearts, that they
          shall not depart from Me. I will put My law in their inward parts, and
          write it in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they shall be
          My people.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          34. Give me understanding, and I shall keep Your law; yes, I shall
          observe it with my whole heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#x27;He who is his own teacher&#x27;—says Bernard—and one greater
          than Bernard, &#x27;has a fool for his master.&#x27; Man cannot teach
          what he does not know; and of God, and of His law, he knows nothing.
          Therefore the beginning of wisdom is a consciousness of ignorance, a
          distrust of our own understanding, and the heartfelt prayer,
          &quot;Give me understanding.&quot; The spiritual understanding is the
          gift of Jesus Christ. He directs us to Himself, as its fountain,
          &quot;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall not walk in
          darkness, but shall have the light of life.&quot; This understanding
          differs from mere intellectual discernment or speculative knowledge.
          It is the spring of spiritual activity in our walk with God; so that
          our obedience is not outward and reluctant, but filial delight and
          wholeness of heart:—we desire not only to keep the law of God to the
          end, but every day to the end, &quot;with our whole heart.&quot;—Such
          are our obligations towards Him, that we ought to study very
          accurately the character of our walk with Him; always remembering that
          service without the heart—the whole heart—is hateful in His sight; and
          that what is now wilfully withheld, will gradually draw away the rest
          in apostasy from Him. Now are we seeking more &quot;engagedness of
          heart&quot; for Him? Then will this prayer be a suitable expression of
          our need, and the utterance of a humble, resolute petitioner. It is
          not, however, enough, that we have once received, unless we are
          constantly receiving. We must ask, that we may receive; but after we
          have received, we must ask again. Yet is this prayer never offered up,
          until the soul has in part received what it is here seeking for. The
          natural man is &quot;wise in his own conceit,&quot; and has therefore
          no idea of his need of Divine teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must not be satisfied with even a clear apprehension of the
          doctrines of the Bible, and of the &quot;truth as it is in
          Jesus.&quot; &quot;Give me understanding&quot;—&#x27;not only that I
          may believe these doctrines, but that I may keep and observe
          them.&#x27; In every path of duty, this cry is repeated, with an
          importunity that is never wearisome to the ears of our gracious
          Father. And in how many unnoticed instances has the answer been given,
          when some clear and heavenly ray has darted unexpectedly into the
          mind, or some providential concurrence of unforeseen circumstances has
          disentangled a path before intricate and involved, and marked it
          before us with the light of a sunbeam! How many whispers of
          conscience! how many seasonable suggestions in moments of darkness and
          perplexity, may the observant child of God record, as the answer to
          this needful prayer! &quot;Whoever is wise, and will observe these
          things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the
          Lord.&quot; Nor will our growth in spiritual understanding fail to
          evidence itself in the steady consistency of a well-ordered
          conversation! &quot;Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among
          you? Let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness
          of wisdom.&quot; If then knowledge is valuable according to its
          usefulness, one ray of this practical knowledge—the result of prayer
          for heavenly teaching—is more to be prized than the highest
          attainments of speculative religion—flowing from mere human
          instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          35. Make me to go in the path of Your commandments; for therein do I
          delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are equally ignorant of the path of God&#x27;s commandments, and
          impotent to go in it. We need therefore double assistance. Our mind
          must be enlightened; our hearts constrained; else our knowledge of
          this humbling path would make us shrink from it. But under the
          complete influence of Divine grace, when understanding has been given
          to discern the beauty of it, the soul&#x27;s warmest desire is fixed
          upon it. Conscious helplessness looks upward—Make me to go: and He who
          said to the paralytic, &quot;Arise, take up your bed, and go to your
          house,&quot; speaks the same word of quickening life and power to the
          soul &quot;giving heed,&quot; &quot;expecting to receive something of
          Him.&quot; It is delightful to acknowledge of this work, that
          &quot;all is of God&quot;—that &quot;it is He who works in us both to
          will and to do of His good pleasure.&quot; To him only can it belong.
          For since the natural inclination &quot;is not subject to the law of
          God, neither indeed can be,&quot; Almighty power must introduce a new
          and active bias, &quot;Turn me, and I shall be turned.&quot;
          &quot;Make me to go in the path of Your commandments.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But even when brought into this path, still we need accelerated motion
          to run with increasing alacrity. We need to take &quot;the Lord God
          for our strength; and He shall make our feet like hinds&#x27; feet,
          and He shall make us to walk upon the high places.&quot; The path,
          indeed, is uninviting to the eye of sense. This distorted vision
          brings all its difficulties into full view; hiding all its
          counter-balancing enjoyments. Let us, however, exercise that
          &quot;faith,&quot; which is &quot;the substance of things hoped for,
          the evidence of things not seen.&quot; Let us exhibit our proper
          character, &quot;walking by faith, and not by sight,&quot; and our
          discernment of unseen things will be more clear, and our enjoyment of
          them more permanent. The prayer will then be with increasing
          earnestness, &quot;Make me to go in the path of Your
          commandments.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must not be content with walking in this way; we must seek to
          &quot;delight in it.&quot; Delight is the marrow of religion.
          &quot;God loves a cheerful giver,&quot; and accepts obedience, only
          when it is given, not when it is forced. He loves the service of that
          man, who considers it his highest privilege to render it, and whose
          heart rejoices in the way, &quot;as a giant to run his race.&quot;
          Fervent prayer and cheerful obedience mark the experience of the
          thriving Christian. As a true &quot;child of Zion, he is joyful in his
          king;&quot; he loves His service, and counts it &quot;perfect
          freedom&quot;—the rule of love, mercy, and grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          But is the self-condemned penitent distressed by this description of a
          child of God? He cannot find the same marks in himself; and he too
          hastily concludes, that he does not belong to the heavenly family; not
          considering, that his very grief is caused by his love to, and
          &quot;delight in&quot; that way in which he is so hindered, and in
          which he daily prays, &quot;Make me to go.&quot; It was, probably, the
          same sense of weakness and inability, &quot;to go in the path of
          God&#x27;s commandments,&quot; which urged David&#x27;s prayer; and if
          it urges yours, poor trembling penitent—if it sends you to a throne of
          grace, you will, before long, receive an answer of peace, and &quot;go
          on your way rejoicing.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This delight in the path is not only following the &quot;man after
          God&#x27;s own heart;&quot; but it is the image of David&#x27;s Lord,
          and our forerunner in this path. He could testify to His Father,
          &quot;I delight to do Your will, O My God;&quot; and to His disciples,
          &quot;I have meat to eat that you know not of. My meat is to do the
          will of Him that sent Me, and to finish His work.&quot; And as a proof
          of the intenseness of His delight he could, to their great amazement,
          &quot;go before them&quot; to Jerusalem, unappalled by the
          &quot;baptism&quot; of blood which awaited Him; yes, even
          &quot;straitened&quot; with the unquenchable ardor of His love,
          &quot;until it was accomplished.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          36. Incline my heart to Your testimonies, and not to covetousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what &quot;makes us to go in the path of God&#x27;s
          commandments?&quot; The force of His Almighty love effectually
          inclines the will, as with a Divine touch. The day of His power, in
          which He makes us willing, is a time of love. &quot;I drew
          them&quot;—says he, &quot;with cords of a man, and with bands of
          love.&quot; Every man, who is conscious of the counteracting bias
          within, will deeply feel the need of this prayer, &quot;Incline my
          heart.&quot; The native principle of man draws him to his own self—to
          his own indulgence—pleasure—covetousness—assuming a thousand forms of
          gratifying self, at the expense of love to God. Few but are ready to
          condemn this principle in others, while perhaps it may be their own
          &quot;easily-besetting sin.&quot; When the mind is grasping after the
          world, as if it were our portion, we have the greatest reason to
          &quot;take heed&quot; to our Lord&#x27;s admonition, and beware of
          &quot;covetousness.&quot; When we invest earthly gratifications with
          any inherent excellency—virtually putting them in the place of
          God—then will be a season for special supplication—Incline my heart to
          Your testimonies, and not to covetousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is probably no principle so opposed to the Lord&#x27;s
          testimonies. It casts out the principle of obedience, since the love
          of God cannot co-exist with the love of the world; and the very desire
          to serve Mammon is a proof of unfaithfulness to God. We mark the
          deadly influence in direct breaches of the law of God. Balaam, in the
          indulgence of this propensity, set his will in mad contradiction to
          God; Ahab was tempted to murder; David, to murder and adultery; Achan,
          to steal; Judas, both to steal from his fellows, and to betray his
          Master; Gehazi and Ananias to lying. And besides—what is the matter of
          common but painful observation—how much of the good seed of the
          kingdom, that was springing up with the promise of a plentiful
          harvest, has this weed of rank luxuriance &quot;choked, that it has
          become unfruitful!&quot; Our Lord&#x27;s parables, therefore—His
          providence—His promises—His terms of discipleship—His counsels—His own
          example of poverty and renunciation of this world&#x27;s comfort—all
          are directed against this destructive principle. The power of the love
          of Christ delivered Matthew and Zaccheus from its influence, and
          &quot;inclined their hearts to the testimonies of God.&quot; And has
          not faith still the same power to turn the heart from the world, from
          sin, from self, to Christ? Learn, then, to rest upon the promise of
          His love, and to delight in His testimonies. Earthly cares will be
          cast upon him, and earthly prospects will lose their splendor. This
          life of faith—living in union with a heavenly Savior, involves the
          only effective principle of resistance. Those who are risen with
          Christ will be temperate in earthly things, &quot;setting their
          affections on things above.&quot; Such—such alone—will &quot;mortify
          the members that are upon the earth—evil concupiscence, and
          covetousness, which is idolatry.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          We desire to sit loose to our earthly comforts. Are we enabled to
          check our natural discontent with the Lord&#x27;s dealings with us,
          and to restrain our eagerness to &quot;seek great things for
          ourselves,&quot; by the recollection of His word, &quot;Seek them
          not?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us not forget, that the inclination—even if it is not brought into
          active and perceptible motion, is fatally destructive of the life of
          religion. &quot;Those who will be rich fall into temptation and a
          snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in
          destruction and perdition.&quot; Awful warning to professors!,
          &quot;The love of money is the root of all evil; which while some have
          coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves
          through with many sorrows.&quot; A most important exhortation to the
          people of God!&quot; But you, O man of God, flee these things, and
          follow after righteousness.&quot; If the Lord loves you, He will not
          indeed lose you; but unless you &quot;take heed, and beware of
          covetousness,&quot; He will not spare you. In the midst, therefore, of
          temptation without, and a world of sin within, go onwards, with the
          pilgrim&#x27;s prayer indelibly fixed on your heart, &quot;Incline my
          heart to Your testimonies, and not to covetousness.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          37. Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken me in Your
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          So strongly does the man of God deprecate temptation to
          self-indulgence, that he prays to be kept at the greatest possible
          distance from it. That his heart may not be inclined to it: he desires
          that his eyes may be turned away from beholding it. Keeping the eye is
          a grand means of &quot;keeping the heart.&quot; Satan has so infused
          his poison into all the objects around us, that all furnish fuel for
          temptation: and the heart—naturally inclined to evil, and hankering
          after vanity—is stolen away in a moment. Vanity includes &quot;all
          that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and
          the pride of life.&quot; All is sin, &quot;because it is not of the
          Father, but is of the world.&quot; Of all that belongs to earth,
          &quot;the preacher, the son of David&quot;—standing on the
          vantage-ground, and having taken within his view the widest horizon of
          this world&#x27;s excellency, has pronounced his judgment,
          &quot;Vanity of vanities, says the preacher, vanity of vanities! all
          is vanity.&quot; We have just mentioned &quot;the lusts of other
          things choking&quot; many a promising profession. Our Lord&#x27;s
          solemn caution to His own disciples implies their injury to a sincere
          profession, &quot;Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your
          hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of
          this life; and so that day come upon you unawares.&quot; Some, indeed,
          seem to walk, as if they were proof against temptation. They venture
          to the very edge of the precipice, under a vain assurance that no
          danger is to be apprehended. But such a confidence is upon the brink
          of a grievous fall. The tender-hearted child of God, trusting in the
          promise, that &quot;Sin shall not have dominion over him,&quot; knows
          that he can only enjoy the security of it, while he is shrinking from
          every occasion of sin. He &quot;hates even the garment spotted by the
          flesh;&quot; and, remembering how often his outward senses have
          ministered to the workings of his weak and treacherous heart, he
          continues in prayer, &quot;Turn away my eyes from beholding
          vanity!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably the recollection of the circumstance of his own sin, would to
          the end of his life remind David of his special need of this prayer.
          Yet who that is conscious of his own weakness and corruption, will
          find the prayer unsuitable to his circumstances of daily temptation?
          But we must watch as well as pray. For as watchfulness without prayer
          is presumption, so prayer without watchfulness is self-delusion. To
          pray that &quot;our eyes&quot; may be &quot;turned from vanity,&quot;
          without &quot;making a covenant with our eyes,&quot; that they should
          not behold it, is like &quot;taking fire in our bosoms,&quot; and
          expecting &quot;not to be burnt,&quot; because we have prayed that we
          might not be burnt. If we pray not to be &quot;led into
          temptation,&quot; we must &quot;watch that we enter not into it.&quot;
          The sincerity of our prayer will be proved by the watchfully avoiding
          the circumstances and occasions of temptation. The fear of sin will
          manifest itself by a fear of temptation to sin. &quot;The knife will
          be put to the throat, if we be given to appetite.&quot; We shall be
          afraid of the wine sparkling in the glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          But where is the harm of beholding vanity, if we do not follow it?
          When Eve beheld the forbidden fruit, perhaps she did not think of
          taking it: and when she took it, she did not think of eating it: but
          the beginning of sin &quot;is as the letting out of water,&quot; whose
          progress once opened, beats down all before it. And who, after our
          &quot;beguiled mother,&quot; has not found the eye an inlet to sin?
          When Bunyan&#x27;s pilgrims were obliged to pass through Vanity Fair,
          beset on every side with temptations and allurements, they stopped
          their eyes and ears, and quickening their pace, cried, &quot;Turn away
          my eyes from beholding vanity!&quot; A striking reproof to us, who too
          often loiter and gaze, until we begin to covet those vanities, to
          which, as Christians, we &quot;are dead!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it asked—What will most effectually &quot;turn my eyes from
          vanity?&quot; Not the seclusion of contemplative retirement—not the
          relinquishment of our lawful connection with the world; but the
          transcendent beauty of Jesus unveiled to our eyes, and fixing our
          hearts. This will &quot;turn our eyes from vanity&quot; in its most
          glittering forms. The sight of the &quot;pearl of great price&quot;
          dims the luster of the &quot;goodliest pearls&quot; of earth; at once
          deadens us to the enticements of the world, and urges us forward in
          the pursuit of the prize. And is not this our object? It is not
          enough, that through special mercy I am preserved from temptations. I
          want to be quickened to more life, energy, delight, and devotedness in
          the way of my God. The secret of Christian progress is simplicity and
          diligence. &quot;This one thing I do—forgetting the things that are
          behind, and reaching forth to those things that are before; I press
          towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
          Jesus.&quot; The Spirit leaves no wish in the heart for beholding
          vanity. The world with all its flowery paths, is a dreary wilderness;
          and Christ and heaven are the only objects of desire, &quot;He who
          shuts his eyes from seeing evil, he shall dwell on high; his place of
          defense shall be the munitions of rocks; bread shall be given him, his
          water shall be sure. Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty: they
          shall behold the land that is very far off.&quot; Precious promises to
          those, that flee from temptation, and desire to walk in the ways of
          God!
        </p>
        <p>
          38. Establish Your word to Your servant, who is devoted to Your fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often—instead of being quickened in the way—I am fainting under the
          pressure of unbelief. What then is my resource? Only the word of
          promise. Lord! seal—establish Your word to Your servant—devoted as I
          am—as I would be—to Your fear. If &quot;the fear of the Lord is the
          beginning of wisdom&quot;—a &quot;treasure&quot;—a &quot;strong
          confidence&quot; &quot;a fountain of life&quot;—how wise—how rich—how
          safe—how happy—is he who &quot;is devoted to&quot; it!
          &quot;Blessed&quot; indeed is he—with the favor of his God, the secret
          of His love, the teaching of His grace, and the mercy of His covenant.
          The promises of the Old Testament are generally connected with the
          fear of God, as in the New Testament they are linked with faith. But
          in truth, so identified are these two principles in their operation,
          that the faith, by which we apprehend the forgiveness of God, and the
          privileges of His kingdom, issues in a godly, reverential, filial
          fear. To be devoted to this fear, completes the character of a servant
          of God—the highest honor in the universe—the substantial joy of heaven
          itself. It is an obedience of choice, of reverence, and of love.
          &quot;Joining himself to the Lord, to serve Him, and to love the name
          of the Lord—to be His servant.&quot; &#x27;Yes, gracious Lord, I had
          rather be bound than loosed.&#x27; I only wish to be loosed from the
          bonds of sin, that I might be bound to You forever. My heart is
          treacherous; lay Your own bonds upon me. &quot;O Lord, truly I am Your
          servant: You have loosed my bonds;&quot; I am &quot;devoted to Your
          fear.&quot; Is this my desire, my mind, my determination, my
          character? Then let me plead my title to an interest in the promises
          of the word—rich and free, &quot;exceeding great and
          precious,&quot;—all mine, &quot;yes and amen in Christ Jesus;&quot;
          let me plead, that every word may be &quot;established&quot; in my
          victory over sin, advancing knowledge of Christ, experience of His
          love, conformity to His image, and, finally, in my preservation in Him
          unto eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how far has the fear of God operated with me as a safeguard from
          sin, and an habitual rule of conduct? David&#x27;s confidence in the
          promises of God, far from lessening his jealousy over himself, only
          made him more &quot;devoted to the fear&quot; of God. And if my
          assurance be well grounded, it will ever be accompanied with holy
          fear; the influence will be known by &quot;standing more in awe of
          God&#x27;s word;&quot; having a more steady abhorrence of sin, and a
          dread of &quot;grieving the Holy Spirit of God.&quot; Thus this filial
          fear produces a holy confidence; while confidence serves to strengthen
          fear: and their mutual influence quickens devotedness to the work of
          the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is interesting to remark, that the Christian privilege of assurance
          is not confined to the New Testament dispensation. David&#x27;s
          pleading to have the &quot;word of his God established unto him,&quot;
          was grounded upon the tried foundations of faith. And this direct act
          of faith, as it regards God in Christ, His engagements and His
          promises, cannot be too confident. The promises are made to the whole
          Church, that we might each look for our part and interest in them. God
          loves to have His own seal and hand-writing brought before Him.
          &quot;Put Me in remembrance&quot;—He says: &quot;let us plead
          together.&quot; &quot;He cannot deny Himself.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Very cheering is it to mark, how the Lord establishes His word in our
          own experience. Every day He is fulfilling some promise, and a word
          made good at one time encourages our confidence for another. The word
          performed in part is an earnest of the whole, assuring us of the time,
          when we shall acknowledge His faithfulness, &quot;who performs all
          things for us.&quot; Thus, as the word is eternally established on the
          foundation of the Divine engagements, its certainty is sealed to our
          own conviction. Our confidence is established, that if He has spoken a
          word, He may be trusted for that word.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, is the exercise and the power of faith. I bring wants. I
          bring Your word of promise. Establish Your word to Your servant. You
          have bought me with a precious price; You have made me Yours: You have
          subdued my heart to Yourself, so that it is now &quot;devoted to Your
          fear.&quot; Whatever, therefore, Your covenant has provided for my
          sanctification, my humiliation, my chastisement, my present and
          everlasting consolation, &quot;Establish this word:&quot; let it be
          fulfilled in me; for I am &quot;Your servant, devoted to Your
          fear.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          39. Turn away my reproach which I fear: for Your judgments are good.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a reproach, which we have no cause to fear, but rather to
          glory in. It is one of the chief privileges of the Gospel—the
          honorable badge of our profession. But it was the &quot;reproach&quot;
          of bringing dishonor upon the name of his God, that David feared, and
          deprecated with most anxious, importunate prayer. The fear of this
          reproach is a practical principle of tender watchfulness and
          circumspection, and of habitual dependence upon an Almighty upholding
          power. &quot;Hold me up, and I shall be safe,&quot;—will be the
          constant supplication of one, that fears the Lord, and fears himself.
          We do not, perhaps, sufficiently consider the active malice of the
          enemies of the gospel, &quot;watching for our halting;&quot; else
          should we be more careful to remove all occasions of
          &quot;reproach&quot; on account of inconsistency of temper or
          conversation. None, therefore, that feel their own weakness, the
          continual apprehension of danger, the tendency of their heart to
          backslide from God, and to disgrace &quot;that worthy name by which
          they are called,&quot; will think this prayer unseasonable or
          unnecessary, &quot;Turn away my reproach which I fear.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps also the conflicting Christian may find this a suitable
          prayer. Sometimes Satan has succeeded in beguiling him into some
          worldly compliance, or weakened his confidence, by tempting him to
          look to himself for some warrant of acceptance (in all which
          suggestions he is aided and abetted by his treacherous heart): and
          then will this &quot;accuser of the brethren&quot; turn back upon him,
          and change himself &quot;into an angel of light,&quot; presenting
          before him a black catalogue of those very falls, into which he had
          successfully led him. Bunyan does not fail to enumerate these
          &quot;reproaches,&quot; as among the most harassing assaults of
          Apollyon. In his desperate conflict with Christian, he taunts him with
          his fall in the Slough of Despond, and every successive deviation from
          his path, as blotting out his warrant of present favor with the King,
          and blasting all hopes of reaching the celestial city. Christian does
          not attempt to conceal or palliate the charge. He knows it is all
          true, and much more besides! but he knows that this is true also,
          &quot;Where sin abounded, grace has much more abounded.&quot;
          &quot;The blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God cleanses from all
          sin.&quot; Believers! In the heat of your conflict remember the only
          effective covering. &quot;Above all, taking the shield of faith, with
          which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the
          wicked.&quot; Do you not hate the sins, with which you have been
          overtaken? Are you not earnestly longing for deliverance from their
          power? Then, even while the recollections of their guilt and
          defilement humble you before the Lord, take fresh hold of the gospel,
          and you shall &quot;overcome by the blood of the Lamb.&quot; Victory
          must come from the cross. And the soul that is directing its eye there
          for pardon, strength, and consolation, may sigh out the prayer with
          acceptance, &quot;Turn away my reproach which I fear.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how deeply is the guilt of apostasy or backsliding aggravated by
          the acknowledgment, which all are constrained to make, &quot;Your
          judgments are good!&quot; How affecting is the Lord&#x27;s admonition
          with us!, &quot;What iniquity have your fathers found in Me, that they
          are gone far from Me, and have walked after vanity, and are become
          vain? O My people! what have I done to you, and how have I wearied
          you? testify against Me. I have not caused you to serve with an
          offering, nor wearied you with incense.&quot; No, surely we have
          nothing to complain of our Master, of His work, or of His wages: but
          much, very much, to complain of ourselves, of our unwatchfulness,
          neglect, backsliding; and to humble ourselves on account of the
          consequent reproach upon our profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never, however, let us cease to cry, that all the reproach which we
          fear on account of our allowed inconsistencies of profession, may, for
          the Church&#x27;s sake, be &quot;turned away from us.&quot; Meanwhile,
          &quot;let us accept it as the punishment of our iniquity;&quot; and,
          in the recollection of the goodness of the Lord&#x27;s judgments,
          still venture to hope and look for the best things to come out of it
          from our gracious Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          40. Behold, I have longed after Your precepts; quicken me in Your
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behold! An appeal to the heart-searching God, &quot;You know that I
          love&quot; Your precepts! The heartfelt acknowledgment of their
          goodness naturally leads us to long after them. The professor longs
          after the promises, and too often builds a delusive—because an
          unsanctifying—hope upon them. The believer feels it to be his
          privilege and safety to have an equal regard to both—to obey the
          precepts of God in dependence on His promises, and to expect the
          accomplishment of the promises, in the way of obedience to the
          precepts. The utmost extent of the professor&#x27;s service is the
          heavy yoke of outward conformity. He knows nothing of an &quot;inward
          delight and longing after them.&quot; Of many of them his heart
          complains, &quot;This is a hard saying: who can hear it?&quot; The
          Christian can give a good reason for his delight even in the most
          difficult and painful precepts. The moments of deepest repentance are
          his times of sweetest &quot;refreshing from the presence of the
          Lord.&quot; Whatever be the pleasure of indulgence in sin, far greater
          is the ultimate enjoyment arising out of the mortification of it. Most
          fruitful is our Savior&#x27;s precept, which inculcates on His
          followers self-denial and the daily cross. For by this wholesome
          discipline we lose our own perverse will; the power of sin is
          restrained, the pride of the heart humbled; and our real happiness
          fixed upon a solid and permanent basis. So that, whatever dispensation
          some might desire for breaking the precept without forfeiting the
          promise, the Christian blesses God for the strictness, that binds him
          to a steady obedience to it. To him it is grievous, not to keep it,
          but to break it. A longing therefore after the precepts, marks the
          character of the child of God: and may be considered as the pulse of
          the soul. It forms our fitness and ripeness for heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are indeed times, when the violence of temptation, or the
          paralyzing effect of indolence, hides the movements of the
          &quot;hidden man of the heart.&quot; And yet even in these gloomy
          hours, when the mouth is shut, and the heart dumb, before God,
          &quot;so troubled, that it cannot speak&quot;—even then, acceptable
          incense is ascending before the throne of God. We have a powerful
          intercessor &quot;helping our infirmities&quot;—interpreting our
          desires, and crying from within, &quot;with groanings that cannot be
          uttered;&quot; yet such as, being indited by our Advocate within, and
          presented by our Advocate above, are cheering pledges of their
          fulfillment. &quot;He will fulfill the desire of them that fear Him:
          He also will hear their cry, and will save them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          These longings might seem to betoken a vigorous exercise of grace. But
          shall I be satisfied, while the most fervent desires are so
          disproportioned to their grand object—so overborne by the corruption
          of the flesh—and while a heartless state is so hateful to my Savior?
          Idle confessions and complaints are unseemly and unfruitful. Let me
          rather besiege the mercy-seat with incessant importunity—&#x27;Quicken
          me in Your righteousness.&#x27; &#x27;I plead Your righteousness—Your
          righteous promise for the reviving of my spiritual life. I long for
          more lively apprehensions of Your spotless righteousness. Oh! let it
          invigorate my delight, my obedience, my secret communion, my Christian
          walk and conversation.&#x27; Such longings, poured out before the Lord
          for a fresh supply of quickening grace, are far different from
          &quot;the desire of the slothful, which kills him,&quot; and will not
          be forgotten before God. &quot;Delight yourself in the Lord; and He
          shall give you the desires of your heart.&quot; O for a more enlarged
          expectation, and a more abundant vouchsafement of blessing; that we
          may burst forth and break out, as from a living fountain within, in
          more ardent longings for the Lord&#x27;s precepts!
        </p>
        <p>
          But it may be asked—What weariness in, and reluctance to duties, may
          consist with the principle and exercise of grace? Where it is only in
          the members, not in the mind—where it is only partial, not
          prevalent—where it is only occasional, not habitual—where it is
          lamented and resisted, and not allowed—and where, in spite of its
          influence, the Christian still holds on in the way of duty,
          &quot;grace reigns&quot; in the midst of conflict, and will ultimately
          and gloriously triumph over all hindrance and opposition. But in the
          midst of the humbling views of sin that present themselves on every
          side, let me diligently inquire—Have I an habitual &quot;hungering and
          thirsting after righteousness?&quot; And since, at the best, I do but
          get my longings increased, and not satisfied; let the full
          satisfaction of heaven be much in my heart. &quot;As for me, I will
          behold Your face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake,
          with Your likeness.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And what an expectation is this to pretend lo! To think what the
          infinitely and eternally blessed God is—and what &quot;man is at his
          best estate,&quot; then to conceive of man—the worm of the dust—the
          child of sin and wrath—transformed into the likeness of God—how
          weighty is the sound of this hope! What then must its substantiation
          be? If the initial privilege be glorious, what will the fullness be!
          Glory revealed to us! transfused through us! becoming our very being!
          To have the soul filled—not with evanescent shadows—but with massive,
          weighty, eternal glory! Worlds are mere empty bubbles, compared with
          this, our sure, satisfying, unfading inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          41. Let Your mercies come also to me, O Lord; even Your salvation,
          according to Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          A prayer of deep anxiety—large desire—simple faith! It is a
          sinner—feeling his need of mercy—yes, mercies—abundant mercy—mercies
          for every moment—looking for them only in the Lord&#x27;s salvation—to
          be dispensed according to His word. Out of Christ we know only a God,
          of justice and holiness. In Christ we behold &quot;a just God, and yet
          a Savior;&quot; and in &quot;His salvation mercy and truth are met
          together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.&quot;
          Therefore general notions of mercy without a distinct apprehension of
          salvation have their origin in presumption, not in warranted faith.
          For can there be any communication of mercy from an unknown God? Can
          there be any communion with an angry God? &quot;Acquaint now yourself
          with Him, and be at peace; thereby good shall come to you&quot;
          &quot;The Lord&#x27;s mercies, even His salvation.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Can we conceive the moment, when this prayer is not suited to us? How
          can we be at any moment safe or happy without the spirit of it? To
          walk as a saved sinner, &quot;accepted in the Beloved,&quot; conformed
          to His image, devoted to His service, sealed for His kingdom—this is,
          or should be, the sunshine of every day. Let this prayer live in the
          heart. Carry continually to the Lord the cry for all His
          mercies—specially for that, which is the seal and crown of them
          all—His salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prayer, however, is peculiarly suitable to the believer, longing
          to realize that which sometimes is clouded to his view—his personal
          interest in the Lord&#x27;s salvation! It must come to me; or I shall
          never come to it. I want not a general apprehension—I am not satisfied
          with the description of it. Let it come to me—Let Your mercies be
          applied, so that I can claim them, and rejoice in them! I see Your
          salvation come to others. Who needs it more than I? Let it come also
          to me. &quot;Look upon me, and be merciful to me, as You do to those
          that love Your name. Remember me, O Lord, with the favor that You bear
          to Your people; O visit me with Your salvation; that I may see the
          felicity of Your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your
          nation, that I may glory with Your inheritance.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, are we seeking the assurance of this salvation? Are we waiting to
          realize its present power, saving us from sin—Satan—the
          world—ourselves—and &quot;blessing us with all spiritual blessings in
          Christ Jesus?&quot; Should a trial of faith and patience be ordained
          for us, yet in the end we shall find an enriching store of experience
          from His wise dispensations. That He has kept us from turning our
          backs upon His ways, when we had no comfort in them; that He has
          upheld us with His secret supplies of strength—is not this the work of
          His own Spirit within, and the pledge of the completion of the work?
          That He has enabled us, against all discouragements, to &quot;continue
          instant in prayer,&quot; is surely an answer to that prayer, which in
          our apprehensions of it, had been cast out. That in waiting upon Him,
          we have found no rest in worldly consolation, is an assurance, that
          the Lord Himself will be our soul-satisfying and eternal portion. And
          who is there now in the sensible enjoyment of His love, who does not
          bless that Divine wisdom, which took the same course with them that
          has been taken with us, to bring them to these joys? When did a
          weeping seed-time fail of bringing a joyful harvest?
        </p>
        <p>
          But let not the ground of faith be forgotten—According to Your
          word—that it shall come fully—freely—eternally—to him who waits for
          it. &quot;You meet him that rejoices and works righteousness; those
          that remember You in Your ways.&quot; Many, indeed, are satisfied with
          far too low a standard of spiritual enjoyments. It is comfortless to
          live at a distance from our Father&#x27;s house, when we might be
          dwelling in the secret of His presence, and rejoicing in the smiles of
          His love. But let us not charge this dishonorable state upon the
          sovereignty of the Divine dispensations. Let us rather trace it to its
          true source—lack of desire—lack of faith—lack of prayer—lack of
          diligence. What infinite need have we of heavenly influence! What
          gracious encouragement to seek it! The way was blocked up—mercy has
          cleared the path, opened our access, &quot;The golden scepter is
          always held out.&quot; Earnest prayer will bring a sure answer. The
          blessing is unspeakable. Let Your mercies—Your salvation, come to me,
          O Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          42. So shall I have with which to answer him who reproaches me; for I
          trust in Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is the salvation which he had just been speaking of? The whole
          gift of the mercy of God—redemption from sin, death, and hell—pardon,
          peace, and acceptance with a reconciled God—constant communication of
          spiritual blessings—all that God can give, or we can want; all that we
          are able to receive here, or heaven can perfect hereafter. Now if this
          comes to us—comes to our hearts—surely it will furnish us at all times
          with an answer to him who reproaches us. The world casts upon us the
          reproach of the cross. &quot;What profit is there that we have walked
          mournfully before the Lord of Hosts?&quot; What is there to
          counterbalance the relinquishment of pleasure, esteem, and worldly
          comfort? The mere professor can give no answer. He has heard of it,
          but it has never come to Him. The believer is ready with his answer,
          &#x27;I have found in the Lord&#x27;s salvation pardon and peace,
          &quot;not as the world gives&quot;—and such as the world cannot take
          away. Here, therefore, do I abide, finding it my happiness not to live
          without the cross, and testifying in the midst of abounding
          tribulation, that there are no comforts like Christ&#x27;s
          comforts.&#x27; This was David&#x27;s answer, when family trials were
          probably an occasion of reproach. &quot;Although my house be not so
          with God, yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in
          all things and sure: for this is all my salvation and all my
          desire.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is a far heavier reproach than that of the world—when the
          grand accuser injects hard thoughts of God—when he throws our guilt
          and unworthiness—our helplessness and difficulties, in our face. And
          how severe is this exercise in a season of spiritual desertion! Except
          the believer can stay his soul upon &quot;a God who hides Himself, as
          still the God of Israel, the Savior,&quot; he is unprepared with an
          answer to him who reproaches him. Such appears to have been Job&#x27;s
          condition, and Heman&#x27;s, not to speak of many of the Lord&#x27;s
          most favored people, at different stages of their Christian life. Most
          important, therefore, is it for us to pray for a realizing sense of
          the Lord&#x27;s mercies—even of His salvation—not only as necessary
          for our peace and comfort—but to garrison us against every assault,
          and to enable us to throw down the challenge, &quot;Rejoice not
          against me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in
          darkness, the Lord shall be a light to me.&quot; Free grace has saved
          me—an unspotted righteousness covers me—an Almighty arm sustains
          me—eternal glory awaits me. Who shall condemn? &quot;Who shall
          separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
          Lord?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, for this bold front to our enemies, nothing is wanted beyond the
          reach of the weakest child of God. No extraordinary holiness—no
          Christian establishment in experience—nothing but simple, humble
          faith—For I trust in Your word. Faith makes this salvation ours, in
          all its fullness and almighty power: and, therefore, our confidence in
          the word will make us &quot;ready always to give an answer to everyone
          who asks us a reason of the hope that is in us, with meekness and
          fear.&quot; &quot;No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper;
          and every tongue that rises against you in judgment, you shall
          condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord; and their
          righteousness is of Me, says the Lord.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how often is our Christian boldness paralyzed by our feeble
          apprehensions of the salvation of God! Clear and full evangelical
          views are indispensable for the effective exercise of our weighty
          obligations. Any indistinctness here, from its necessary mixture of
          self-righteousness and unbelief, obscures the warrant of our personal
          interest, and therefore hinders the firm grasp of Almighty strength.
          Coldness and formality also deaden the power of Christian boldness.
          Much need, therefore, have we to pray for a realized perception of the
          freeness, fullness, holiness, and privileges of the Gospel. Much need
          have we to use our speedy diligence, without delay; our painful
          diligence, without indulgence: our continual diligence, without
          weariness; that we be not satisfied with remaining on the skirts of
          the kingdom; that it be not a matter of doubt, whether we belong to it
          or not; but that, grace being added to grace, &quot;so an entrance may
          be ministered to us abundantly, into&quot; all its rich consolations
          and everlasting joys.
        </p>
        <p>
          43. And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have
          hoped in Your judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the sake of the church and of the world, no less than for our own
          sakes, let us &quot;give diligence&quot; to clear up our interest in
          the Gospel. The want of personal assurance is not only a loss in our
          own souls, but a hindrance to our Christian usefulness. Hence our
          efforts are often powerless in parrying off the attack of him that
          reproaches us, as well as to &quot;strengthen the weak hands, and
          confirm the feeble knees&quot; of our brethren. The charge of
          hypocrisy, or the want of the &quot;constraining&quot; principle of
          &quot;the love of Christ,&quot; stops the utterance of the word of
          truth, and obscures our character as a &quot;saint of God,&quot; and
          &quot;a witness&quot; for His name. Justly, indeed, might He punish
          our unfaithfulness, by forbidding us any more to speak in His name.
          And therefore the dread of this grievous judgment, and the mourning
          over precious lost opportunities, stirs up the prayer—&#x27;Take not
          the word of truth utterly out of my mouth—Not only take it not out of
          my heart; but let it be ready in my mouth for the confession of my
          Master.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          This valuable prayer may preserve us from denying Christ. Too apt are
          we to allow worldly communion, habits, and conversation without a word
          of restraint. Let the whole weight of Christian responsibility be
          deeply felt—faith in the heart, and confession with the mouth—the
          active principle, and the practical exercise. Should we be content
          with the dormant principle, where would be the Church—the witness for
          God in the world? Shall we shrink from the bold confession of Him, who
          &quot;despised the shame of the cross&quot; for us? Would not this
          imply distrust of our own testimony—the word of truth?
        </p>
        <p>
          It does indeed need wisdom to know when, as well as what, to speak.
          There is &quot;a time to keep silence,&quot; and &quot;the prudent
          shall keep silence in that time.&quot; But is it our cross to be
          &quot;dumb with silence?&quot; And when we &quot;hold our peace, even
          from good,&quot; is our &quot;sorrow stirred—our hearts hot within
          us—the fire burning&quot;? No—is not the plea of bashfulness or
          judicious caution often a self-deluding cover for the real cause of
          restraint—the lack of the personal apprehension of the Lord&#x27;s
          mercy? &quot;I believed, and therefore have I spoken.&quot; Oh! let
          not the word of truth be taken utterly out of our mouth. A stammering
          confession is better than silence. If we cannot say all we want of, or
          for our Savior, let us say what we can. &#x27;God&#x27;s servants are
          very sensible of the infinite value of the least atom of what belongs
          to Him.&#x27; And a word spoken in weakness may be a word of Almighty
          power, and a present help to some fainting spirit. In our connection
          with the world, many occasions will unexpectedly occur, if the heart
          be but wakeful and active to improve them. The common topics of
          earthly conversation often furnish a channel for heavenly communion,
          so that our communications with the world may be like Jacob&#x27;s
          ladder, whose bottom rested upon the earth, but the top reached unto
          the heavens. And oh! what a relief is it to the burdened conscience,
          to stammer out, if it be but a few words for God, even though there be
          no sensible refreshings of His presence! Yet if we would speak for Him
          with power and acceptance, it must be out of the &quot;good treasure
          and abundance of the heart.&quot; For it is only when &quot;the heart
          is inditing a good matter, speaking of the things touching the King,
          that the tongue is as the pen of a ready writer.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us take up this petition as the expression of the
          Christian&#x27;s exercises with his God. &#x27;That word
          utterly&#x27;—observes an eminently-tried believer—&#x27;though it
          seems to be beneath the notice of the mind, when one has got very low,
          is in reality one of the most blessed words in this most blessed book.
          How often, when I have formerly been upon the brink of giving up all
          for lost, and of saying, &quot;Evil, be my good&quot;—the thought has
          perhaps struck me, that, while I am struggling between despondency and
          rebellion, and too hard, too cold, too discouraged to look up to Him,
          the blessed Redeemer is pitying the struggle of my soul; and it has
          kept me where I was, led me to put off despair at least until
          tomorrow; and then before tomorrow I have seen something of the grace
          and glory of the Gospel.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          What then is the advice, which this man of God gives from his own
          experience? &#x27;When you are most deeply deploring your sins, never
          fail to thank the Lord, or at least to think how you would thank Him,
          if you dared lift up a face overwhelmed with shame and defeat, that He
          has not taken away His truth UTTERLY; that He has left you clinging to
          some twig of hope, instead of leaving you to end—what thousands who
          look outwardly very calm—have found—the depth of the precipice of
          despair.&#x27; (Nottidge)
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist&#x27;s prayer here is the same confidence of faith, that
          was expressed in the preceding verse—For I have hoped in Your
          judgments, an acceptable spirit of approach to God, and an earnest of
          the revival of life and comfort in the Lord&#x27;s best time and way.
        </p>
        <p>44. So shall I keep Your law continually forever and ever.</p>
        <p>
          The heaping up of so many words in this short verse, appears to be the
          struggle of the soul to express the vehemency of its longings to
          glorify its Savior. And, indeed, the Lord&#x27;s return to us,
          unsealing the lips of the dumb, and putting His word again into their
          mouth, brings with it a fresh sense of constraining obligation. This
          fresh occupation in His praise and service is not only our present
          privilege, but an foretaste of our heavenly employment, when the word
          will never more be taken out of our mouth, but we shall &quot;talk of
          His wondrous works&quot; &quot;forever and ever.&quot; The defects in
          the constancy and extent of our obedience (as far as our hearts are
          alive to the honor of God) must ever be our grief and burden; and the
          prospect of its completeness in a better world, is that, which renders
          the anticipation of heaven so delightful. There we shall be blessed
          with suitable feelings, and therefore be enabled to render suitable
          obedience—even one unbroken consecration of all our powers to His
          work. Then &quot;shall we keep His law continually forever and
          ever.&quot; Once admitted to the &quot;throne of God,&quot; we
          &quot;shall serve Him day and night in His temple&quot;—without
          sin—without inconstancy—without weariness—without end! We speak of
          heaven; but oh! to be there! To be engaged throughout eternity in the
          service of love to a God of love! In one day&#x27;s continuance in the
          path of obedience even here, in the midst of the defilement which
          stains our holiest services, how sweetly do the moments roll away! But
          to be ever employed for Him, in that place, where &quot;there shall in
          no wise enter anything that defiles&quot;—this gives an emphasis and a
          dignity to the heavenly joy, which may well stamp it as
          &quot;unspeakable and full of glory.&quot; May we not then encourage
          the hope, that the Lord is making us meet for heaven, by the strength
          and constancy of our desires to keep the laws of God? And is it not
          evident, that heaven itself can afford no real delight to one, who
          feels the service of God on earth to be irksome? He stands
          self-excluded by the constitution of his nature, by the necessity of
          the case. He has no heart for heaven, no taste for heaven, no capacity
          for enjoyment of heaven, &quot;He that is unjust, let him be unjust
          still; and he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he who is
          righteous, let him be righteous still; and he who is holy, let him be
          holy still.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Heavenly, gracious Father! who and what are we, that our hearts should
          be made the unworthy recipients of Your grace? that our will should be
          subdued into &quot;the obedience of faith?&quot; and that we should be
          permitted to anticipate that blessed period, when we shall &quot;keep
          Your law continually, forever and ever?&quot; May this prospect
          realize the happiness of our present obedience! May He, who has
          &quot;bought us with a price&quot; for His glory, reign in our hearts,
          and live upon our lips; that each of us may have His mark upon our
          foreheads—the seal of His property in us, and of our obligation to
          Him, &quot;Whose I am, and whom I serve!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>45. And I will walk at liberty: for I seek Your precepts.</p>
        <p>
          Not only perseverance but liberty, is the fruit of the Lord&#x27;s
          mercy to our souls—not the liberty of sin—to do what we please—but of
          holiness—to do what we ought; the one, the iron bondage of our own
          will; the other, the easy yoke of a God of love. It was a fine
          expression of a heathen, &quot;To serve God is to reign.&quot;
          Certainly in this service David found the liberty of a king. The
          precepts of God were not forced upon him; for he sought them.
          &quot;More to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold; sweeter
          also than honey, and the honey-comb.&quot; The way of the Lord, which
          to the ungodly is beset with thorns and briers, is the king&#x27;s
          highway of liberty. The child of God walks here in the gladness of his
          heart and the rejoicing of his conscience. Even in &quot;seeking these
          precepts,&quot; there is &quot;liberty&quot; and enlargement of heart;
          a natural motion, like that of the sun in its course, &quot;going
          forth as a bridegroom, and rejoicing as a strong man to run a
          race.&quot; What must it be then, to walk in the full enjoyment of the
          precepts! &quot;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
          liberty.&quot; &quot;They shall sing in the ways of the
          Lord,&quot;—for &quot;how great is His goodness; how great is His
          beauty!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Are we then obeying the precepts as our duty, or &quot;seeking&quot;
          them as our privilege? Do we complain of the strictness of the law, or
          of the corruption of the flesh? Are the precepts of our own hearts our
          burden? Is sin or holiness our bondage? The only way to make religion
          easy, is to be always in it. The glow of spiritual activity, and the
          healthfulness of Christian liberty, are only to be found in the
          persevering and self-denying pursuit of every track of the ways of
          God, &quot;If you continue in My word, then are you My disciples
          indeed: and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
          free. If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, you shall be free
          indeed.&quot; To have the whole stream of all our thoughts, actions,
          motives, desires, affections, carried in one undivided current towards
          God, is the complete and unrestrained influence of His love upon our
          hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let but our eyes be opened, our judgments clearly exercised, our
          consciences suffered to speak; and this point is clear—Sin is
          slavery—Holiness is liberty. The sinner may live in bonds with as much
          delight as if he was in his element. He may seem even to himself to be
          at large, while in fact he is &quot;shut up, and cannot come
          forth.&quot; For such is the tyranny under which he is bound, that he
          cannot help himself; and (to use the confession of a heathen) while
          &#x27;he sees and approves better things, he follows the worse.&#x27;
          Every sin is a fresh chain of bondage, under the check of a cruel
          master. On the other hand—the Lord&#x27;s commands—as He Himself
          declares, and all His servants testify—are &quot;for our good
          always.&quot; His &#x27;service is perfect freedom.&#x27; (Liturgy.)
          The life of liberty is to be under the bonds of holy love and duty.
          Let the trial be made of two Masters; conviction must follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          True it is, that the corrupt and rebellious inclinations will
          &quot;lust&quot; to the end. But as long as indulgence is denied,
          conflict excited, and the constant endeavor maintained to &quot;bring
          every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ,&quot; our
          liberty is established, even where it is not always enjoyed. Every
          fresh chain, by which we bind ourselves to the Lord, makes us more
          free. While, then, those who &quot;promise us liberty are themselves
          the servants of corruption,&quot; let us live as the children of
          God—the heirs of the kingdom—grateful—free—blood-bought
          souls—remembering the infinite cost at which our liberty was
          purchased, and the moment of extreme peril when we were saved. When
          the flesh was weak, and the &quot;law weak through the flesh,&quot;
          and no resolution of ours could break us from the yoke of sin—then it
          was that &quot;Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that He might
          be the Lord both of the dead and living,&quot; &quot;delivering us
          from the hand of our enemies, that we might serve Him without
          fear.&quot; And then indeed do we &quot;walk at liberty,&quot; when we
          &quot;break the bands&quot; of all other lords &quot;asunder,&quot;
          and consecrate ourselves entirely to His precepts. &quot;O Lord our
          God, other lords beside You have had dominion over us; but by You only
          will we make mention of Your name.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          46. I will speak of Your testimonies also before kings, and will not
          be ashamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Liberty in walking&quot; in the Lord&#x27;s ways will naturally
          produce boldness in speaking of them. Compare the conduct of the three
          unshaken witnesses for the truth before the Babylonish monarch. Mark
          the difference of the spirit displayed by the Apostles, and especially
          by Peter, before and after the day of Pentecost. Look at Stephen
          before the council, and Paul before Felix, Festus, and Agrippa.
          &quot;God had not given to them the spirit of fear; but of power, and
          of love, and of a sound mind.&quot; Hear the great Apostle testifying
          of himself, &quot;I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at
          Rome also&quot;—at the metropolis of the world, in the face of all
          opposition and contempt, and at the imminent hazard of my life,
          &quot;For&quot;—says he, &quot;I am not ashamed of the gospel of
          Christ.&quot; In the same determination of soul, he exhorts his dear
          son in the faith, &quot;Be not ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
          nor of me His prisoner.&quot; To how many does &quot;the fear of man
          bring a snare?&quot; Many a good soldier has faced the cannon&#x27;s
          mouth with undaunted front, and yet shrunk away with a coward&#x27;s
          heart from the reproach of the cross, and been put to blush even by
          the mention of the Savior&#x27;s name. Far better—the Son of Man
          &quot;strengthening you&quot;—to brave the fiery furnace, or the den
          of lions in His service, than like Jonah, by flinching from the cross,
          to incur the sting of conscience and the frown of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Professing Christians! Are we ready to bear our testimony for Jesus,
          against the sneer and ridicule of the ungodly? We are not likely to
          &quot;be brought before kings and rulers for the Son of Man&#x27;s
          sake.&quot; Yet no less do we need Divine help and strong faith in
          withstanding the enmity of a prejudiced relative or scornful neighbor.
          Young people! you are perhaps in especial danger of being ashamed of
          your Bible, your religion, your Savior. You may be brought under the
          snare of the &quot;fear of man,&quot; and be tempted to compromise
          your religion, and to sacrifice your everlasting all from a dread of
          &quot;the reproach of Christ.&quot; But remember Him, who for your
          sake &quot;before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;&quot;
          and shall the dread of a name restrain you from sharing His reproach,
          and banish the obligations of love and gratitude from your hearts?
          Have you forgotten, that you once owned the service of Satan? and will
          you not be as bold for Christ, as you were for him? Were you once
          &quot;glorying in your shame;&quot; and will you now be ashamed of
          your glory? Oh! remember who has said, &quot;Whoever shall be ashamed
          of Me and of My words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, of
          him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when He comes in the glory
          of His Father with the holy angels.&quot; Think much and often of this
          word. Think on this day. Think on the station of &quot;the fearful and
          unbelieving&quot; on the left hand on that day. Think on their eternal
          doom. What is a prison, compared to hell? What need to pray and
          tremble! If you are sincere in your determination, and simple in your
          dependence, then will the &quot;love of Christ constrain you,&quot;
          not to a cold, calculating, reluctant service; but to a confession of
          your Savior, bold, unfettered, and &quot;faithful even unto
          death.&quot; Every deviation from the straight path bears the
          character of being ashamed of Christ. How much have you to speak in
          behalf of His testimonies, His ways, His love! When in danger of the
          influence of &quot;the fear of man,&quot; look to Him for strength. He
          will give to you, as He gave to Stephen, &quot;a mouth and wisdom,
          which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay or
          resist.&quot; Thus will you, like them, be strengthened &quot;to
          profess a good profession before many witnesses.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          47. And I will delight myself in Your commandments, which I have
          loved.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is but poor comfort to the believer to be able to talk well to
          others upon the ways of God, and even to &quot;bear the reproach&quot;
          of His people, when his own heart is cold, insensible, and dull. But
          why does he not rouse himself to the active exercise of faith, &quot;I
          will delight myself in Your commandments?&quot; That which is the
          burden of the carnal heart is the delight of the renewed soul. The
          former &quot;is enmity against God: and therefore is not, and cannot
          be, subject to His law.&quot; The latter can delight in nothing else.
          If the gospel separates the heart from sinful delights, it is only to
          make room for delights of a more elevated, satisfying, and enduring
          nature. Satan, indeed, generally baits his temptations with that
          seductive witchery, which the world calls pleasure. But has he
          engrossed all pleasure into his service? Are there no pleasures
          besides &quot;the pleasures of sin?&quot; Do the ways of the Lord
          promise nothing but difficulty and trial? What means then the
          experience of him, who could &quot;rejoice in them, as much as in all
          riches,&quot; and who &quot;loved them above gold, yes, above fine
          gold?&quot; The &quot;fatted calf&quot; of our Father&#x27;s house is
          surely a most gainful exchange for &quot;the husks&quot; of the
          &quot;far country.&quot; The delights of holiness go deeper than
          sensual pleasures. The joy of the saint is not that false, polluted,
          deadly joy, which is all that the worldling knows, and all that he has
          to look for: but it flows spontaneously from the fountain of living
          waters, through the pure channel of &quot;the word of God, which lives
          and abides forever.&quot; No, so independent is it of any earthly
          spring, that it never flourishes more than in the desolate wilderness,
          or the sick-bed solitude; so that, &quot;although the fig-tree shall
          not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines, yet we will rejoice
          in the Lord, we will joy in the God of our salvation.&quot; Men of the
          world see what religion takes away, but they see little of what it
          gives; else would they reproach—not our folly—but their own blindness.
          &quot;Thus says the Lord God, Behold, My servants shall eat, but you
          shall be hungry; behold, My servants shall drink, but you shall be
          thirsty; behold, My servants shall rejoice, but you shall be ashamed;
          behold, My servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for
          sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.&quot; The love
          and delight of the soul first fixes on the commandments. Then how
          natural is the flow of delight in them! even at the very time that we
          are &quot;abhorring ourselves in dust and ashes&quot; for our neglect
          of them; and God never has our hearts, until something of this delight
          is felt and enjoyed. But do we complain of the dullness of our hearts,
          that restrains this pleasure? Let us seek for a deeper impression of
          redeeming love. This will be the spring of grateful obedience and holy
          delight. Let us turn our complaints into prayers, and the Lord will
          quickly turn them into praises. Let us watch against everything, that
          would intercept our communion with Jesus. Distance from Him must be
          accompanied with poverty of spiritual enjoyment., &quot;They shall be
          abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Your house: and You shall
          make them drink of the river of Your pleasures. For with You is the
          fountain of life: and in Your light shall we see light.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          48. My hands also will I lift up unto Your commandments, which I have
          loved: and I will meditate in Your statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          David seems at a loss for expressions adequately to set forth the
          fervency of his love and delight in the ways and word of God. Here we
          find him lifting up his hands with the gesture of one, who is longing
          to embrace the object of his desire with both hands and his whole
          heart. Perhaps also in lifting up his hands unto the commandments, he
          might mean to express his looking upward for assistance to keep them,
          and to live in them. But how humbling this comparison with ourselves!
          Alas! how often from the neglect of this influence of the Spirit of
          God, do our &quot;hands hang down,&quot; instead of being lifted up,
          in these holy ways! We are too often content with a scanty measure of
          love: without any sensible &quot;hungering and thirsting after
          righteousness;&quot; neither able to pray with life and power, nor to
          hear with comfort and profit, nor to &quot;do good and
          communicate&quot; with cheerfulness, nor to meditate with spiritual
          delight, nor to live for God with zeal and interest, nor to anticipate
          the endurance of the cross with unflinching resolution—the soul being
          equally disabled for heavenly communion and active devotedness. Shall
          we look for ease under the power of this deadening malady? Let us
          rather struggle and cry for deliverance from it. Let us subscribe
          ourselves before God as wretched, helpless, and guilty. He can look
          upon us, and revive us. Let us then &quot;take hold upon His
          covenant,&quot; and plead that He will look upon us. Let us &quot;put
          Him in remembrance&quot; of the glory of His name, which is much more
          concerned in delivering us out of this frame, by His quickening grace,
          than in leaving us, stupid, corrupt, and carnal in it. Professor!
          awake: or beg of the Lord to awaken you! For if your cold sleeping
          heart is contented with the prospect of a heaven hereafter, without
          seeking for a present foretaste of its joy, it may be a very
          questionable matter whether heaven will ever be yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delight, however, will exercise itself in an habitual meditation in
          the statutes. The breathing of the heart will be, &quot;Oh, how love I
          Your law! it is my meditation all the day.&quot; It is in holy
          meditation on the word of God, that all the graces of the Spirit are
          manifested. What is the principle of faith, but the reliance of the
          soul upon the promises of the word? What is the sensation of godly
          fear, but the soul trembling before the threatenings of God? What is
          the object of hope, but the apprehended glory of God? What is the
          excitement of desire or love, but longing, endearing contemplations of
          the Savior, and of His unspeakable blessings? Hence we can scarcely
          conceive of the influence of grace separated from spiritual meditation
          on the word. It is this which, under Divine teaching, draws out its
          hidden contents, and exhibits them to the soul, as the objects upon
          which the principles and affections of the Divine life are habitually
          exercised. Not that any benefit can be expected from meditation, even
          upon the word of God, as an abstract duty. If not deeply imbued with
          prayer, it will degenerate into dry speculative study. Without some
          distinct practical application, it will be unedifying in itself, and
          unsatisfactory for its important ends—the discerning of the mind of
          God, and feeding upon the rich provision of the Gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why then is the Bible read only—not meditated on? Because it is not
          loved. We do not go to it, as the hungry man to his food, as the miser
          to his treasure. The loss is incalculable. Our superficial knowledge
          has no practical influence. It is only as we &quot;search,&quot; that
          we &quot;know it for our good.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it then be a matter of daily inquiry. Does my reading of the word
          of God furnish food for my soul, matter for prayer, direction for
          conduct? Scriptural study, when entered upon in a prayerful spirit,
          will never, like many other studies, be unproductive. The mind that is
          engaged in it, is fitly set for bearing fruit; it will &quot;bring
          forth fruit in due season.&quot; Meditation kindles love, as it is the
          effect of love, &quot;While I was musing, the fire burned.&quot;
          &quot;Whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues in
          it, this man is blessed in his deed.&quot; But let us take heed, that
          the root of religion in the soul is not cankered by the indulgence of
          secret sin. The largest supply of Christian ordinances will fail to
          refresh us, except the heart be kept right with God in simplicity of
          faith, love, and diligence in the service of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come then, Christian, let us set our hearts to a vigorous, delighting
          devotedness to the statutes of our God. &quot;It is not a vain thing
          for us; because it is our life.&quot; But to regard some of the words
          only would be to obey our own will, not God&#x27;s. Let us lift up our
          hands to them all. How shadowy is the joy of speculative
          contemplation, if it does not draw the heart to practical exercise!
          Let faith return our obligations in the full apprehension of the
          Lord&#x27;s mercy. And then will love constrain us to nothing less
          than &quot;a living sacrifice&quot; to His service. If the professor
          sleeps in notional godliness, let us employ our active meditation in
          searching for the mine that lies not on the surface, but which never
          fails to enrich diligent, patient, persevering labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          49. Remember the word unto Your servant, upon which You have caused me
          to hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is faith? It is hope upon God&#x27;s word. The warrant of faith
          is therefore the word. The object of faith is He who causes us to
          hope. He has not forgotten—He cannot forget, His word. But He
          permits—no, commands His servants to remind Him of it in order to
          exercise their faith, diligence, and patience. Often, indeed,
          &quot;hope deferred makes the heart sick.&quot; But it is not needless
          delay—not ignorance of the fittest time—not forgetfulness—not
          changeableness—not weakness. Meanwhile, however, constantly plead the
          promise—Remember the word unto Your servant. This is the proper use of
          the promises, as &quot;arguments with which to fill our mouths, when
          we order our cause before God.&quot; When thus pleaded with the
          earnestness and humility of faith, they will be found to be the
          blessed realities of unchanging love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now—have not circumstances of Providence, or the distinct application
          of the Spirit, made some words of God especially precious to your
          soul? Such words are thus made your own, to be laid up against some
          future time of trial, when you may &quot;put your God in
          remembrance&quot; of them. Apply this exercise of faith to such a word
          as this, &quot;Him who comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out.&quot;
          Then plead your interest in it as a coming sinner, &quot;Lord, I hope
          in this Your word.&quot; &quot;You have caused me to hope&quot; in it.
          &quot;Remember this word unto Your servant.&quot; Thus is prayer
          grounded upon the promise, which it forms into a prevailing argument,
          and sends back to heaven; nothing doubting, but that it will be
          verified in God&#x27;s best time and way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take another case; God has engaged Himself to be the God of the seed
          of believers. His sacramental ordinance is the seal of this promise.
          The believer brings his child to this ordinance, as the exercise of
          his faith upon the faithfulness of God. Let him daily put his finger
          upon this promise, Remember the word unto Your servant, upon which You
          have caused me to hope. This is, as Augustine said of his mother,
          &#x27;bringing before God His own handwriting.&#x27; Will He not
          remember His word? Faith may be tried, perhaps long tried. &quot;But
          He abides faithful. He cannot deny Himself.&quot; Faith trusts—not
          what the eye sees, but what the word promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again—Have we ever found God&#x27;s word hoped on, a covering and
          strength against besetting sin? This will surely be an encouragement
          to cry under the same temptation—Remember Your word. &quot;He who has
          delivered, does deliver, and will even to the end deliver.&quot; He
          &quot;has done great things for us.&quot; And is not this an earnest
          of continued mercy? &quot;Because You have been my help, therefore
          under the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice.&quot; Thus may we
          confidently receive a promise as the distinct message to our soul,
          when we are conscious of a readiness to receive the whole word as the
          rule of our life. And does it not set an edge upon prayer, to eye a
          promising God, and to consider His promises—not as hanging in the air,
          without any definite direction or meaning, but as individually spoken
          and belonging to myself as a child and servant of God? This is the
          experience and comfort of the life of faith. This unfolds the true
          secret of living to God; ending at last with the honorable death-bed
          testimony, &quot;Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth:
          and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one
          thing has failed of all the good things, which the Lord your God spoke
          concerning you; all have come to pass to you; and not one thing has
          failed thereof.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          50. This is my comfort in my affliction; for Your word has quickened
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          David was encouraged to plead the word of promise in prayer, from the
          recollection of its comfort in his affliction. For the man of God is
          not exempted from affliction, but he is comforted in it with
          God&#x27;s comforts, flowing from the fountain-head. And truly no
          comforts are like God&#x27;s comforts, and there are none beside His.
          They are indeed strong consolations, both in their foundation and
          their influence; supporting—not only in the prospect, but under the
          actual pressure of trouble, and fully proportioned to the need of the
          most sinking calamity. Never therefore are we left unsupported in such
          a time, or called to drink a cup of unmingled tribulation. In the
          moments of our bitterest sorrow, how are we compelled to stand amazed
          at the tenderness, which is daily and hourly exercised towards us! We
          have always some word exactly suited to our affliction, and which we
          could not have understood without it; and &quot;a word&quot; thus
          &quot;spoken in due season, how good is it!&quot; One word of God,
          sealed to the heart, infuses more sensible relief, than ten thousand
          words of man. When therefore the word assures of the presence of God
          in affliction; of His continued pity and sympathy in His most severe
          dispensations; and of their certain issue to our everlasting good;
          must not we say of it, This is our comfort in our affliction? How does
          the Savior&#x27;s love stream forth from this channel on every side;
          imparting life, refreshment, strength to those, who but for this
          comfort would have &quot;fainted,&quot; and &quot;perished in their
          affliction!&quot; This indeed was the end, for which the Scriptures
          were written; and such power of consolation have they sometimes
          administered to the afflicted saint, that tribulation has almost
          ceased to be a trial, and the retrospect has been the source of
          thankful recollection.
        </p>
        <p>
          But first the word becomes life—then comfort. And those only, who have
          felt the quickening power of the word, can realize its consolations.
          Be thankful, then, Reader, if, when dead in sins, it &quot;quickened
          you;&quot; and, when sunk in trouble, once and again it has revived
          you. Yet do not think, that it is any innate power of its own, that
          works so graciously for you. No. The exhibition of the Savior is the
          spring of life and consolation. It is because it &quot;testifies of
          Him,&quot; &quot;the consolation of Israel&quot; &quot;afflicted in
          all our afflictions&quot;—and never failing to uphold with &quot;grace
          sufficient for us.&quot; It is not, however, the word without the
          Spirit, nor the Spirit generally without the word; but the Spirit by
          the word—first putting life into the word, and then by the word
          quickening the soul. The word then is only the instrument. The Spirit
          is the Almighty agent. Thus the work is the Lord&#x27;s; and nothing
          is left for us, but self-renunciation and praise.
