        <h2>119:51-75</h2>
        <p>
          51. The proud have had me greatly in derision; yet have I not declined
          from Your law.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scorn of an ungodly world is one of the afflictions, which realize
          to us the comfort of the word. And this is a trial, from which no
          exemption is to be expected, &quot;All that will live godly in Christ
          Jesus shall suffer persecution.&quot; Not even David—though a king—a
          man of wisdom and prudence, and therefore not likely to give
          unnecessary offence; and whose character and rank might be expected to
          command respect—not even was he shielded from the derision of the
          proud on account of the profession and service of his God. Thus it
          ever was and ever will be. Faith in the doctrine of Christ, and
          conformity to the strict commandments of the gospel, must expose us to
          the taunts of the unbeliever and the worldling. Yet, where the heart
          is right with God, the derision of the proud, instead of forcing us to
          decline from the law of God, will strengthen our adherence to it.
          David answered the bitter derision of Michal with a stronger
          resolution to abide by his God, &quot;I will yet be more vile than
          thus.&quot; He counted it his glory, his duty, his joy. None, however,
          but a believer knows what it is to bear this cross: and none but a
          real believer can bear it. It is one of the touchstones of sincerity,
          the application of which has often been the means of &quot;separating
          the precious from the vile,&quot; and has unmasked the self-confident
          professor to his own confusion. Oh! how many make a fair profession,
          and appear &quot;good soldiers of Jesus Christ,&quot; until the hour
          of danger proves them deserters, and they reap only the fruits of
          their self-confidence in their own confusion!
        </p>
        <p>
          It is, therefore, of great importance to those who are just setting
          out in the warfare, to be well armed with the word of God. It kept
          David steadfast amid the derision of the proud; and it will keep young
          Christians from being frightened or overcome by the sneer of an
          ungodly world. But that it may &quot;dwell in us richly in all
          wisdom,&quot; and be suited to our own case, it will be well, under
          circumstances of reproach, to acquaint ourselves with the supporting
          promises and encouragements to suffer for righteousness&#x27; sake.
          Above all, the contemplation of the great sufferer Himself—meeting
          this poignant trial in meekness, compassion, and prayer—will exhibit
          &quot;a refuge from the storm, and a shadow from the heat, when the
          blast of the terrible ones is as the storm against the wall.&quot; The
          mere professor knows not this refuge; he possesses not this armor; so
          that when &quot;affliction or persecution arises for the word&#x27;s
          sake, immediately he is offended.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian! be satisfied with the approbation of your God. Has He not
          adopted you into His family, stamped you with His image, assured you
          by His Spirit, sealed you for His kingdom? And is not this &quot;honor
          that comes from God only&quot; enough—far more than enough—to
          counterbalance the derision of the proud? Think of the day, when
          &quot;the rebuke of the people shall be taken away from off all the
          earth,&quot; when &quot;he will confess their name before His Father,
          and before His angels,&quot; when &quot;the saints shall judge the
          world,&quot; when &quot;the upright shall have dominion over them in
          the morning.&quot; Can we be Christians, if this sure prospect does
          not infinitely more than compensate for all &quot;the hard speeches,
          which ungodly sinners have spoken against us?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus—blessed be God—the weapons of our warfare are drawn from the
          Divine armory; and therefore depending on the grace, and following the
          example, of Jesus, we suffer, as the way to victory—the road to an
          everlasting crown.
        </p>
        <p>
          52. I remembered Your judgments of old, O Lord; and have comforted
          myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord&#x27;s dealings with His people were a frequent subject of
          meditation to the Psalmist, and now were they his present support
          under &quot;the scourge of the tongue.&quot; Evidently they are put
          upon record for the encouragement of future generations. We are ready
          to imagine something peculiar in our own case, and to &quot;think it
          strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try us, as though some
          strange thing happened unto us.&quot; But when we remember the
          Lord&#x27;s judgments of old, with His people, we comfort ourselves in
          the assurance, that &quot;the same afflictions are accomplished in our
          brethren, that have been in the world;&quot; and that &quot;as the
          sufferings of Christ have abounded in them, so their consolation also
          abounded by Christ.&quot; They also encountered the same derision of
          the proud, and always experienced the same support from the
          faithfulness of their God. We do not sufficiently consider the mercy
          and gracious wisdom of God, in occupying so much of His written word
          with the records of His judgments of old. One class will pay a
          prominent attention to the preceptive, another to the doctrinal, parts
          of revelation—each forgetting that the historical records comprise a
          full and striking illustration of both, and have always proved most
          supporting grounds of consolation to the Lord&#x27;s people. The
          important design in casting so large a portion of the small volume of
          Revelation into an historical form, is every way worthy of its author.
          &quot;Whatever things were written before, were written for our
          learning; that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might
          have hope;&quot; and how admirably adapted the means are to the end,
          the diligent student in the Scripture field will bear ample witness.
          Willfully, therefore, to neglect the historical portion of the sacred
          volume, from the idea of confining our attention to what we deem the
          more spiritual parts of scripture—would show a sad deficiency of
          spiritual apprehension, and deprive ourselves of the most valuable
          instruction, and most abundant comfort. This neglect would exclude us
          from one eminent means of increasing &quot;patience,&quot; in the
          example of those &quot;who through faith and patience inherit the
          promises;&quot; of receiving &quot;comfort,&quot; in the experience of
          the faithfulness of God manifested in every age to His people: and of
          enlivening our &quot;hope,&quot; in marking the happy issue of the
          &quot;patience of the saints,&quot; and the heavenly support
          administered unto them. So far, therefore, are we from being little
          interested in the Scriptural records of past ages, that it is evident
          that the sacred historians, as well as the prophets, &quot;ministered
          not unto themselves, but unto us the things which are now
          reported.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us select one or two instances as illustrative of this subject.
          Why were the records of the deluge, and of the overthrow of the cities
          of the plain, preserved, but as exhibitions to the church, that
          &quot;the Lord&quot;—the Savior of Noah, the eighth person, and the
          deliverer of just Lot, &quot;knows how to deliver the godly out of
          temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be
          punished?&quot; What a source of comfort then to the tempted people of
          God is the remembrance of these judgments of old! Take again the
          wonderful history of the overthrow of the Egyptians, and the
          consequent deliverance of God&#x27;s ancient people. How often does
          the church recollect this interposition as a ground of assurance, that
          under similar circumstances of trial, the same illustrious displays of
          Divine faithfulness and love may be confidently expected! She looks
          back upon what the &quot;arm of the Lord has done in ancient days, and
          in the generation of old,&quot; as the pattern of what He ever would
          be, and ever would do, for His purchased people. Thus also God Himself
          recalls to our mind this overthrow and deliverance as a ground of
          present encouragement and support, &quot;According to the days of your
          coming out of the land of Egypt will I show unto him marvelous
          things&quot;—and the Church echoes back this remembrance in the
          expression of her faith, gratitude, and expectation for spiritual
          blessings: &quot;He will subdue our iniquities, and You will cast all
          their sins into the depths of the sea.&quot; Such is the interesting
          use that may be made of the historical parts of Scripture! Such is the
          comfort to be derived from the remembrance of the Lord&#x27;s
          judgments of old! And is not the recollection of His judgments of old
          with ourselves, productive of the same support? Does not the
          retrospect of His dealings with our own souls serve to convince us,
          that &quot;all His paths are mercy and truth?&quot; The assurance is
          therefore warranted alike by experience and by Scripture, &quot;We
          know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to
          them who are the called according to His purpose.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          53. Horror has taken hold upon me, because of the wicked that forsake
          Your law.
        </p>
        <p>
          The remembrance of the Lord&#x27;s judgments of old, while it brings
          comfort to His people as regards themselves, stirs up a poignancy of
          compassionate feeling for the ungodly. And indeed to a feeling and
          reflecting mind, the condition of the world must excite commiseration
          and concern! A &quot;whole world lying in wickedness!&quot; lying
          therefore in ruins! the image of God effaced! the presence of God
          departed! Horror has taken hold of me! to see the law of Him, who gave
          being to the world, so utterly forsaken! so much light and love
          shining from heaven in vain! The earthly heart cannot endure that any
          restraint should be imposed; much less that any constraint, even of
          love, should be employed to change its bias, and turn it back to its
          God. Are you then a believer? then you will be most tender of the
          honor of the law of God. Every stroke at His law you will feel as a
          stroke at your own heart. Are you a believer? then will you consider
          every man as your brother; and weep to see so many of them around you,
          crowding the broad road to destruction, and perishing as the miserable
          victims of their own deceivings. The prospect on every side is, as if
          God were cast down from His throne, and the creatures of His hand were
          murdering their own souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how invariably does a languor respecting our own eternal interest
          affect the tenderness of our regard for the honor of our God; so that
          we can look at the wicked that forsake God&#x27;s law, with
          comparative indifference! Awful indeed is the thought, that it ever
          can be with us a small matter, that multitudes are sinking! going down
          into perdition! with the name of Christ—under the seal of
          baptism—partakers of the means of gospel grace—yet perishing! Not,
          indeed, that we are to yield to such a feeling of horror, as would
          paralyze all exertion on their behalf. For do we owe them no duty—no
          prayer—no labor? Shall we look upon souls hurrying on with such
          dreadful haste to unutterable, everlasting torments; and permit them
          to rush on blinded, unawakened, unalarmed! If there is a horror to see
          a brand apparently fitting for the fire, will there not be a wrestling
          endeavor to pluck that brand out of the fire? Have we quite forgotten
          in our own case the fearful terrors of an unconverted state—the
          Almighty power of wrath and justice armed against us—the thunder of
          that voice, &quot;Vengeance belongs to Me, I will recompense, says the
          Lord?&quot; Oh! if the love of the Savior and the love of souls were
          reigning with more mighty influence in our hearts, how much more
          devoted should we be in our little spheres of labor! how much more
          enlarged in our supplications, until all the kingdom of Satan were
          subject to the obedience of the Son of God, and conquered by the force
          of His omnipotent love!
        </p>
        <p>
          But if the spirit of David, renewed but in part, was thus filled with
          horror in the contemplation of the wicked, what must have been the
          affliction—what the intensity of His sufferings, &quot;who was holy,
          harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners&quot;—yes, &quot;of purer
          eyes than to behold iniquity&quot;—during thirty-three years of
          continued contact with a world of sin! What shall we say of the
          condescension of His love, in wearing &quot;the likeness of sinful
          flesh&quot;—dwelling among sinners—yes, &quot;receiving sinners, and
          eating with them!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed Spirit! impart to us more of &quot;the mind that was in Christ
          Jesus,&quot; that the law of God may be increasingly precious in our
          eyes, and that we may be &quot;exceedingly jealous for the Lord God of
          Hosts!&quot; Help us by Your gracious influence to plead with sinners
          for God, and to plead for sinners with God!
        </p>
        <p>
          54. Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, Christian pilgrim, and beguile your wearisome journey heavenward
          by &quot;singing the Lord&#x27;s song in this strange land.&quot; With
          the statutes of God in your hand and in your heart, you are furnished
          with a song for every step of your way, &quot;The Lord is my shepherd;
          I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures: He leads
          me beside the still waters. He restores my soul: He leads me in the
          paths of righteousness for His name&#x27;s sake. Yes, though I walk
          through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil; for You
          are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a
          table before me in the presence of my enemies: You anoint my head with
          oil; my cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all
          the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord
          forever.&quot; How delightfully does this song bring before you Him,
          who having laid down His life for you, engages Himself as your
          Provider, your Keeper, your Guide, your faithful and unchangeable
          Friend! Such a song, therefore, will smooth your path, and reconcile
          you to the many inconveniences of the way; while the recollection that
          this is only the house of your pilgrimage and not your home; and that
          &quot;there remains a rest for the people of God,&quot; will support
          the exercise of faith and patience to the end. How striking the
          contrast between the wicked that forsake the law, and the Christian
          pilgrim, who makes it the subject of his daily song, and the source of
          his daily comfort! Yes, these same statutes, which are the yoke and
          burden of the ungodly, lead the true servant of the Lord from pleasure
          to pleasure; and, cherished by their vigorous influence, his way is
          made easy and prosperous. Evidently, therefore, our knowledge and
          delight in the Lord&#x27;s statutes will furnish a decisive test of
          our real state before Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is important to remember that our cheerful song is connected
          with a pilgrim-spirit. Never forget that we are not at home; only
          happy strangers on our passage homewards. Here we have no settled
          habitation—no rest. We are looking for a better country: and as we
          look, we are seeking for it. Our &quot;hearts are in the ways of
          it.&quot; Every day advances us nearer to it. In this spirit the
          statutes of the Lord will be our song. Here are the deeds of
          conveyance—our title made sure to an estate—not small, of little
          account, or of uncertain interest—but &quot;an inheritance&quot; of
          incalculable value, made over to us. Here we have sure direction—such
          as cannot mislead us—for the attainment of it. Here we are stimulated
          by the examples of our fellow-pilgrims, who have reached their home;
          and as we follow their track, many are the cordials by the way, and
          home brightens in the nearer prospect.
        </p>
        <p>
          What reason have we then every moment to guard against the debasing,
          stupifying influence of the world, which makes us forget the proper
          character of a pilgrim! And what an habitual conflict must be
          maintained with the sloth and aversion of a reluctant heart to
          maintain our progress in the journey towards Zion! Reader! have you
          entered upon a pilgrim&#x27;s life? Then what is your solace and
          refreshment on the road? It is dull, heavy, wearisome, to be a pilgrim
          without a song. And yet it is only the blessed experience of the
          Lord&#x27;s statutes, that will tune our song. &quot;If therefore you
          have tasted that the Lord is gracious;&quot; if He has thus &quot;put
          a new song into your mouth,&quot; oh! do not permit any carelessness
          or neglect to rob you of this heavenly anticipation. And that your
          lips be not found mute, seek to maintain a lively contemplation of the
          place where you are going—of Him who as your &quot;forerunner is for
          you entered&quot; there—and of the prospect, that, having
          &quot;prepared a place for you, He will come again, and take you to
          Himself; that where He is, there you may be also.&quot; In this
          spirit, and with these hopes before you, you may take up your song,
          &quot;O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise. I will
          bless the Lord at all times—His praise shall continually be in my
          mouth.&quot; Thus may you go on your pilgrimage &quot;singing in the
          ways of the Lord,&quot; and commencing a song below, which in the
          world of praise above, shall never, never cease.
        </p>
        <p>
          55. I have remembered Your name, O Lord, in the night, and have kept
          Your law.
        </p>
        <p>
          How did this man of God live in the statutes of God! In the day they
          were his pilgrim song—in the night his happy meditation. And, truly,
          if we can ever spend the waking moments of the night with God,
          &quot;the darkness is no darkness with us, but the night shines as the
          day.&quot; Many a tried believer has found this cordial for the
          restlessness of a wakeful night more restorative to the quiet and
          health of his earthly frame, than the most sovereign specifics of the
          medical world. &quot;So He gives His beloved sleep.&quot; And if in
          any night of affliction we feel the hand of the Lord grievous to us,
          do we not find in the remembrance of the Lord a never-failing support?
          What does our darkness arise from, but from our forgetfulness of God,
          blotting out for a while the lively impressions of His tender care,
          His unchanging faithfulness, and His mysterious methods of working His
          gracious will? And to bring up as it were from the grave, the
          remembrance of God&#x27;s name, as manifested in His promises, and in
          the dispensation of His love; this is indeed the &quot;light that is
          sown for the righteous,&quot; and which &quot;springs up out of
          darkness.&quot; It is to eye the character of the Lord as All-wise to
          appoint, Almighty to secure, All-compassionate to sympathize and
          support. It is to recollect Him as a &quot;father pitying his
          children;&quot; as a &quot;friend who loves at all times,&quot; and
          who &quot;sticks closer than a brother.&quot; And even in those
          seasons of depression, when unwatchfulness or indulgence of sin have
          brought the darkness of night upon the soul, though the remembrance of
          the name of the Lord may be grievous, yet it opens the way to
          consolation. It tells us, that there is a way made for our return;
          that &quot;the Lord waits, that He may be gracious;&quot; and that in
          the first step of our return to our Father, we shall find Him full of
          mercy to his backsliding children. Thus, though &quot;weeping may
          endure for a night, joy comes in the morning.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Study the Lord&#x27;s revelation of His own name; and what more full
          perception can we conceive of its support in the darkest midnight of
          tribulations? &quot;And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood
          with him (Moses), and proclaimed the name of the Lord. And the Lord
          passed by before him, and proclaimed—The Lord, the Lord God, merciful
          and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
          keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and
          sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.&quot; Can we wonder
          that such a name as this should be exhibited as a ground of trust?
          &quot;The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runs into
          it and is safe.&quot; &quot;Those who know Your name will put their
          trust in You.&quot; Even our suffering Lord appears to have derived
          support from the remembrance of the name of the Lord in the night of
          desertion, &quot;O my God, I cry in the daytime, and You do not hear;
          and in the night-season, and am not silent. But You are holy, O You
          who inhabits the praises of Israel!&quot; And from the experience of
          this source of consolation, we find the tempted Savior directing His
          tempted people to the same support, &quot;Who is among you who fears
          the Lord, who obeys the voice of His servant, who walks in darkness,
          and has no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon
          his God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The main principles of the Gospel are involved in this remembrance of
          the Lord&#x27;s name. Memory is the storehouse, in which the substance
          of our knowledge is treasured up. Recollections without faith are
          shadowy notions. But we have confidence that our God in Himself—and as
          engaged to us—is all that the Bible declares Him to be. How vast then
          are our obligations to His dear Son—the only medium, by which His name
          could be known or remembered, &quot;who has&quot; so &quot;declared
          Him!&quot; And here is the spring of practical religion. We shall keep
          His law when we remember His name. A sense of our obligations will
          impel us forward in diligence, heavenly-mindedness, and
          self-devotedness in our appointed sphere. Obedience will partake far
          more of the character of privilege than of duty, when an enlightened
          knowledge of God is the principle of action.
        </p>
        <p>56. This I had, because I kept Your precepts.</p>
        <p>
          How is it, believer, that you are enabled to sing of the Lord&#x27;s
          statutes—and to remember His name? This you have, because you keep His
          precepts. Thus you are able to tell the world, that in keeping His
          &quot;commandments there is great reward&quot;—that the &quot;work of
          righteousness is peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness,
          and assurance forever.&quot; Christian! let your testimony be clear
          and decided—that ten thousand worlds cannot bestow the happiness of
          one day&#x27;s devotedness to the service of your Lord. For is it not
          in this path that you realize fullness of joy in &quot;fellowship with
          the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ?&quot; &quot;He that has My
          commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and he who loves
          Me shall be loved of My Father; and I will love him, and will manifest
          Myself to him—My Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and
          make our abode with him.&quot; If you were walking more closely with
          God in &quot;the obedience of faith,&quot; the world would never dare
          to accuse religion as the source of melancholy and despondency. No man
          has any right to the hope of happiness in a world of tribulation, but
          he who seeks it in the favor of his God. Nor can any enjoy this favor,
          except as connected, in the exercise of faith, with conformity to the
          will, and delight in the law, of his God. Thus not only are the
          &quot;statutes of the Lord right,&quot; but they &quot;rejoice the
          heart.&quot; There is a sweetness and satisfaction in the work, as
          well as a good flowing out of it—a current as well as a consequent
          privilege—cheering the soul in the act of exercise, just as the senses
          are regaled at the very instant with the object of their
          gratification.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us remark how continually David was enriching his treasury of
          spiritual experience with some fresh view of the dealings of God with
          his soul: some answer to prayer, or some increase of consolation,
          which he records for his own encouragement, and for the use of the
          Church of God. Let us seek to imitate him in this respect; and we
          shall often be enabled to say as he does—This I had—this comfort I
          enjoyed—this support in trouble—this remarkable manifestation of His
          love—this confidence I was enabled to maintain—it was made my own,
          because I kept Your precepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This I had—not, this I hoped for. He speaks of &quot;the promise of
          the life that now is&quot;—that by which God clears away the charge,
          &quot;It is vain to serve Him; and what profit is it, that we have
          kept His ordinances?&quot; Nor is it any boasting of merit, but only
          an acknowledgment of the gracious dispensation of his God. Such a
          reward for such poor service, can only be undeserved
          &quot;mercy,&quot; having respect, not to the worthiness of the work,
          but to the faithfulness of the promise. Perfect keeping, according to
          the legal requirements, there cannot be. Evangelical perfection, in
          aiming at the mark, and constantly pressing onward towards it, there
          may be.
        </p>
        <p>
          How important therefore is it—in the absence of this Christian
          confidence—to examine, &quot;Is there not a cause?&quot; and what is
          the cause? Have not &quot;strangers devoured my strength; and I knew
          it not?&quot; Is the Lord &quot;with me as in months past?&quot;—with
          me in my closet?—with me in my family?—with me at my table?—with me in
          my daily employments and conversation with the world? When I hear the
          faithful people of God telling of His love, and saying—This I had;
          must I not, if unable to join their cheerful acknowledgment, trace it
          to my unfaithful walk, and say—This I had not, because I have failed
          in obedience to Your precepts; because I have been careless and
          self-indulgent; because I have slighted Your love; because I have
          &quot;grieved Your Holy Spirit,&quot; and forgotten to ask for the
          &quot;old paths, that I might walk therein, and find rest to my
          soul?&quot; O let this scrutiny and recollection of our ways realize
          the constant need of the finished work of Jesus, as our ground of
          acceptance, and source of strength. This will bring healing,
          restoration, increasing devotedness, tenderness of conscience,
          circumspection of walk, and a determination not to rest, until we can
          make this grateful acknowledgment our own. At the same time, instead
          of boasting that our own arm, our own diligence, or holiness,
          &quot;have gotten us&quot; into this favor, we shall cast all our
          attainments at the feet of Jesus, and crown Him Lord of all forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          57. You are my portion, O Lord; I have said that I would keep Your
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man, as a dependent being, must be possessed of some portion. He
          cannot live upon himself. It must, however, be not only good, but his
          own good—something that he may lay claim to as his own. It must also
          be a large portion, because the powers and capacities to be filled are
          large. If he has not a satisfying portion, he is a wretched empty
          creature. But where and how shall he find this portion? &quot;There be
          many that say, Who will show us any good? Lord! lift up the light of
          Your countenance upon us.&quot; And then the goodness of the Lord, in
          having offered Himself as the portion of an unworthy sinner! So that
          we can now lay claim to Him, as having wholly and fully made Himself
          over to us, and having engaged to employ His perfections for our
          happiness! &quot;I will be your God.&quot; Surely every good is
          centered in the chief good—the fountain of all blessings, temporal,
          spiritual, eternal. What, then, is the folly, madness, and guilt, of
          the sinner, in choosing his &quot;portion in this life:&quot; as if
          there were no God on the earth, no way of access to Him, or no
          happiness to be found in Him? That such madness should be found in the
          heart of man, is a most affecting illustration of his departure from
          God. But that God&#x27;s own &quot;people should commit these two
          evils—forsaking the fountain of living waters, and hewing out for
          themselves broken cisterns&quot;—this is the fearful astonishment of
          heaven itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we cannot know and enjoy God as our portion, except as He has
          manifested Himself in His dear Son. And in the knowledge and enjoyment
          of Him, can we envy those who &quot;in their lifetime receive their
          good things,&quot; and therefore have nothing more to expect? Never,
          indeed, does the poverty of the worldling&#x27;s portion appear more
          striking, than when contrasted with the enjoyment of the child of God,
          &quot;Soul&quot;—said the rich fool, &quot;you have much goods laid up
          for many years.&quot; But God said, &quot;This night your soul shall
          be required of you.&quot; Augustine&#x27;s prayer was, &quot;Lord,
          give me Yourself!&quot; And thus the believer exults, &quot;Whom have
          I in heaven but You? and there is none upon earth that I desire but
          You. Return unto your rest, O my soul. The Lord Himself is the portion
          of my inheritance and of my cup. You maintain my lot. The lines have
          fallen to me in pleasant places; yes, I have a goodly heritage. I will
          bless the Lord, who has given me counsel.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Elsewhere the believer makes this confession to himself, &quot;The
          Lord is my portion—says my soul.&quot; Here, as if to prove his
          sincerity, he &quot;lifts up his face unto God.&quot; &quot;You are my
          portion, O Lord.&quot; And surely the whole world cannot weigh against
          the comfort of this Christian confidence. For it is as impossible,
          that His own people should ever be impoverished, as that His own
          perfections should molder away. But a portion implies, not a source of
          ordinary pleasure, but of rest and satisfaction, such as leaves
          nothing else to be desired. Thus the Lord can never be enjoyed, even
          by His own children—except as a portion—not only above all, but in the
          place of all. Other objects indeed may be subordinately loved: but of
          none but Himself must we say, &quot;He is altogether
          lovely.&quot;&quot;In all things He must have the
          preeminence&quot;—one with the Father in our affections, as in His own
          subsistence. The moment that any rival is allowed to usurp the throne
          of the heart, we open the door to disappointment and unsatisfied
          desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if we take the Lord as our portion, we must take Him as our king.
          I have said—this is my deliberate resolution—that I would keep Your
          words. Here is the Christian complete—taking the Lord as his portion,
          and His word as his rule. And what energy for holy devotedness flows
          from the enjoyment of this our heavenly portion! Thus delighting
          ourselves in the Lord, He gives us our heart&#x27;s desire; and every
          desire identifies itself with His service. All that we are and all
          that we have, are His; cheerfully surrendered as His right, and
          willingly employed in his work. Thus do we evidence our interest in
          His salvation; for &quot;Christ became the author of eternal salvation
          unto all those who obey Him.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Reader! inquire—was my choice of this Divine portion considerate,
          free, unreserved? Am I resolved that it shall be steadfast and
          abiding? that death itself shall not separate me from the enjoyment of
          it? Am I ready to receive a Sovereign as well as a Savior? Oh! let me
          have a whole Christ for my portion! Oh! let Him have a whole heart for
          His possession. Oh! let me call nothing mine but Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#x27;The heart touched with the loadstone of Divine love: trembling
          with godly fear, yet still looking towards God by fixed
          believing—points at the love of election. He who loves may be sure he
          was loved first. He who chooses God in Christ for his delight and
          portion, may conclude confidently, that God has chosen him to enjoy
          Him, and be happy in Him forever.&#x27; (Leighton)

          58. I entreated Your favor with my whole heart; be merciful unto me
          according to Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delight in the Lord as our portion, naturally leads us to entreat His
          favor as &quot;life,&quot; and &quot;better than life,&quot; to our
          souls. And if we have said that we would keep His words, we shall
          still entreat His favor—to strengthen and encourage us in His way. We
          shall entreat it with our whole hearts, as though we felt our infinite
          need of it, and were determined to wrestle for it in Jacob&#x27;s
          spirit, &quot;I will not let You go, except You bless me.&quot; If we
          have known what unspeakable happiness it is to be brought into the
          favor of God &quot;by the blood of Christ;&quot; and if by &quot;Him
          also we have access unto that grace wherein we stand,&quot; how shall
          we prize the sense of Divine favor, the light of our Father&#x27;s
          countenance! We shall never be weary of this source of daily
          enjoyment. It is to us as the light of the sun, which shines every day
          with renewed and unabated pleasure. We &quot;joy in God, through our
          Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.&quot;
          Mercy, however, is the source of that favor which we entreat; and the
          word is the warrant of our expectation—Be merciful to us according to
          Your word. As sinners, we need this favor. As believers, we entreat it
          in the assurance that praying breath, as the breath of faith, will not
          be spent in vain. Any indulged indolence, or neglect, or
          unfaithfulness—relaxing our diligence, and keeping back the whole
          heart from God—will, indeed, never fail to remove the sunshine from
          the soul. But the blood of Christ still opens the way of return to the
          backslider, even though he may have wandered, as it were, to the ends
          of the earth. For &quot;if from thence you shall seek the Lord your
          God, you shall find Him, if you seek Him with all your heart and all
          your soul.&quot;&quot;A whole heart&quot; in seeking the Lord, is the
          seal of the Lord&#x27;s heart in returning to us, &quot;I will rejoice
          over them&quot;—says He, &quot;to do them good; and I will plant them
          in this land assuredly, with my whole heart, and with my whole
          soul.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Reader! if you are a child of God, the favor of God will be to you the
          &quot;one thing needful.&quot; In other things, you will not venture
          to choose for yourself; &quot;for who knows what is good for man in
          this life?&quot; But in this choice you will be decided. This grand,
          incomparable desire will fill your heart. This will be to you as the
          portion of ten thousand worlds. Nothing will satisfy besides.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may, indeed, be a child of God without the enjoyment of the
          blessing; but not so, if you be content to be without it. If the wise
          sovereignty of our God is pleased to withhold it, still the child in
          submission will entreat it. Much more, when it is withdrawn in
          righteous chastening of carelessness or folly, will the cry be
          reiterated upon the ground of the covenant—Be merciful to me according
          to Your word.
        </p>
        <p>59. I thought on my ways, and turned my feet to Your testimonies.</p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist&#x27;s determination, lately mentioned, to keep
          God&#x27;s word, was not a hasty impulse, but a considerate resolve,
          the result of much thinking on his former ways of sin and folly. How
          many, on the other hand, seem to pass through the world into eternity
          without a serious thought on their ways! Multitudes live for the
          world—forget God and die! This is their history. What their state is,
          is written as with a sunbeam in the word of truth, &quot;The wicked
          shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.&quot;
          When &quot;no man repents him of his wickedness, saying, What have I
          done?&quot;—this banishing of reflection is the character and ruin of
          an unthinking world. Perhaps one serious thought might be the new
          birth of the soul to God—the first step of the way to heaven. For when
          a man is arrested by the power of grace, he is as one awaking out of
          sleep, lost in solemn and serious thoughts—&#x27;What am I? where am
          I? what have I been? what have I been doing? I have a soul, which is
          my everlasting all—yet a soul without a Savior—lost—undone. What is my
          prospect for its happiness? Behind me is a world of vanity, an empty
          void. Before me a fearful unknown eternity. Within me an awakened
          conscience, to remind me of an angry God, and a devouring hell. If I
          stay here, I perish; if I go forward, I perish; if I return home to my
          offended Father, I can but perish.&#x27; The resolution is formed;
          &#x27;&quot;I will arise,&quot; and fight my way through all
          difficulties and discouragements to my Father&#x27;s house.&#x27; Thus
          does every prodigal child of God &quot;come to himself;&quot; and this
          his first step of return to his God involves the whole work of
          repentance. The wanderer thinks on his ways, and turns his feet to the
          testimonies of his God; witnessing, to his joyful surprise, every
          hindrance removed, the way marked with the blood of his Savior, and
          his Father&#x27;s smiles in this way welcoming his return homeward.
          This turn is the practical exercise of a genuine faith; and
          &quot;because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions
          that he has committed, he shall surely live—he shall not die.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But this considerate exercise is needed, not only upon the first
          entrance into the ways of God, but in every successive step of our
          path. It will form the habit of daily &quot;communion with our own
          heart;&quot; without which, disorder and confusion will bewilder our
          steps. Probably David did not know how far his feet had backslidden
          from the ways of his God, until this serious consideration of his
          state brought conviction to his soul—so imperceptible is the declining
          of the heart from God! Nor is it a few transient thoughts or
          resolutions, that will effect this turn of the heart to God. A man may
          maintain a fruitless struggle to return to God for many years in
          sincerity and earnestness; while the simple act of faith in the power
          and love of Jesus will at once bring him back. Thus, while
          &quot;thinking on his ways,&quot; let him walk in Christ as the way of
          return—and he will walk in the way of God&#x27;s testimonies with
          acceptance and delight. In this spirit of simplicity, he will listen
          to the first whisper of the convincing voice of the Spirit, which
          marks the early steps of return from secret declension from God. He
          will also thankfully accept the chastening rod, as the Lord&#x27;s
          appointed instrument of restoring His wandering children to Himself.
          For so prone are they to turn their feet away from the Lord—so
          continually are they &quot;turning aside like a deceitful
          bow.&quot;—and so deaf are they, from the constitution of their sinful
          nature, to the ordinary calls of God; that, in love and tender
          faithfulness to their souls, He is often constrained, by the stroke of
          His heavy hand, to arrest them in their career of thoughtlessness, and
          turn them back to Himself. Most suitable then for such a state is the
          prayer of Basil—&#x27;Give me any cross, that may bring me into
          subjection to Your cross; and save me in spite of myself!&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>60. I made haste, and delayed not, to keep Your commandments.</p>
        <p>
          A superficial conviction brings with it a sense of duty, without
          constraining to it. Men stand reasoning and doubting, instead of
          making haste. But a sound conviction sweeps away all excuses and
          delays. No time will be lost between making and performing
          resolutions. Indeed, in a matter of life and death—of eternal life and
          eternal death—the call is too clear for debate, and there is no room
          for delay. Many a precious soul has been lost by waiting for &quot;a
          more convenient season&quot;—a period, which probably never arrives,
          and which the willful neglect of present opportunity provokes God to
          put far away. Today is God&#x27;s time. Tomorrow ruins thousands.
          Tomorrow is another world. &quot;Today—while it is called today; if
          you will hear His voice&quot; &quot;make haste, and delay not.&quot;
          Resolutions, however sincere, and convictions, however serious,
          &quot;will pass away, as the morning cloud and as the early dew,&quot;
          unless they are carefully cherished, and instantly improved. The bonds
          of iniquity will soon prove too strong for the bonds of your own
          resolutions; and in the first hour of temptation, conviction left to
          chance to grow, will prove as powerless as the &quot;seven green
          withs&quot; to bind the giant Samson. If ever delays are dangerous,
          much more are they in this concern of eternity. If therefore
          convictions begin to work, instantly yield to their influence. If any
          worldly or sinful desire is touched, let this be the moment for its
          crucifixion. If any affection is kindled towards the Savior, give
          immediate expression to its voice. If any grace is reviving, let it be
          called forth into instant duty. This is the best—the only—expedient to
          fix and detain the motion of the Spirit now striving in the heart: and
          who knows but the improvement of the present advantage may be the
          moment of victory over difficulties hitherto found insuperable, and
          may open the path to heaven with less interruption, and more steady
          progress?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is from the neglect of this haste that convictions often
          alternately ebb and flow so long, before they settle in a sound
          conversion. Indeed the instant movement—making haste, and delaying
          not—marks the principle of the spiritual life. This was the
          prodigal&#x27;s resolution, no sooner formed than in action. He said,
          &quot;I will arise, and go to my father—and he arose, and came to his
          father.&quot; When Matthew heard the voice, &quot;Follow Me—he left
          all, rose up and followed Him.&quot; When Zaccheus was called from the
          top of the sycamore-tree, &quot;Make haste, and come down, for today I
          must abide at your house—he made haste, and came down, and received
          Him joyfully.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! as you prize a hope for eternity; as you wish to &quot;flee from
          the wrath to come,&quot; and to &quot;flee for refuge to the hope set
          before you&quot;—beware of smothering early convictions. They may
          prove the first dawn of eternal day upon the soul—the first visit of
          the quickening Spirit to the heart. Guard them with unceasing
          watchfulness. Nourish them with believing prayer. &quot;Exercise&quot;
          them unto practical &quot;godliness.&quot; &quot;Quench not the
          Spirit.&quot; Let not the spark be extinguished by opposition of the
          world. Let it not expire for lack of the fuel of grace. Let it not lie
          dormant or inactive. &quot;Stir up the gift of God which is in
          you.&quot; Every exercise, every motion, adds grace to grace, and
          increases its vigor, health, and fruitfulness. The more we do, the
          more we find we can do. The withered hand, whenever stretched forth in
          obedience to the Savior&#x27;s word, and in dependence on His grace,
          will never lack a supply of spiritual strength. Every successive act
          strengthens the disposition, until a continual succession has formed
          the ready and active habit of godliness. Thus the Lord works in
          setting us to work. Therefore think—determine—turn—make haste, and
          delay not; and we wish you God speed; &quot;we bless you in the name
          of the Lord.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Professor! did you realize eternity, would you hover as you do between
          heaven and hell? If you were truly alive and awake, no motion would be
          swift enough for your desire to &quot;flee from the wrath to
          come&quot;—to flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before
          you.&quot; If ever God should touch your heart to feel the heavenly
          sweetness of communion with Him, will there be no regret, that the
          privilege was not sooner sought and enjoyed? Had I betaken myself
          earlier to a hearty interest in the ways of God, how much more
          knowledge, experience, and comfort should I have attained! how much
          more honor should I have brought to God! how much more profit to my
          fellow-sinners! Remember, every day of carnal pleasure or lukewarm
          formality is a day lost to God—to your own happiness—to eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          A word to the believer—Have you any doubts to clear up, any peace to
          regain in the ways of the Lord? Make haste to set your heart to the
          work. Make haste to the blood of atonement. Be on the watch to
          &quot;hear the Shepherd&#x27;s voice,&quot; even if it be the voice of
          reproof. Promptness is a most important exercise of the habit of
          faith. Delay brings guilt to the conscience. The blessing of
          conviction—the comfortable sense of acceptance—the freedom of the
          Lord&#x27;s service—is sacrificed to sloth and procrastination. The
          work that is hard today will be harder still tomorrow, by the
          resistance of this day&#x27;s convictions. A greater cost of
          self-denial, a heavier burden of sorrow, and increasing unfitness for
          the service of God, will be the issue of delay. Be continually
          therefore looking for some beam of light to descend, and some
          influence of grace to flow in upon you from your exalted Head. A
          simple and vigorous faith will quickly enliven you with that love,
          delight, rejoicing in the Lord, readiness to work, and cheerfulness to
          suffer, which will once again make the ways of God &quot;pleasantness
          and peace&quot; to your soul.
        </p>

          61. The bands of the wicked have robbed me; but I have not forgotten
          Your law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are we not too apt to cull out the easy work of the Gospel, and to
          call this love to God? Whereas true love is supreme, and ready to be
          at some loss, and to part with near and dear objects, knowing that He
          &quot;is able to give us much more than&quot; we lose for Him. Our
          resolution to keep His commandments will soon be put to the test. Some
          trial to the flesh will prove whether we flinch from the cross, or
          study to prepare ourselves for it. Few of us, perhaps, have literally
          known this trial of David. But the lesson to be learned from his frame
          of mind under it, is of great importance to all who profess to have
          their &quot;treasure in heaven.&quot; It teaches us, that only
          exercised faith will sustain us in the time of trouble. This faith
          will enable us instantly to recollect our heavenly portion, and to
          assure our interest in it, in a remembrance of the law of our God. Had
          David forgotten God&#x27;s law, no other resource of comfort opened
          before him. But it was ready—substantiating to his mind &quot;the
          things that were not seen and eternal.&quot; Look again at the
          Apostle&#x27;s deliberate estimate of this very trial—not only bearing
          his loss, but absolutely forgetting it in the enjoyment of his better
          portion, &quot;Yes, doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
          excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have
          suffered the loss of all things; and do count them but dung, that I
          may win Christ.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The temper of mind under such trials as this, serves indeed most
          clearly to discover the real bent of the heart. If we are in
          possession of a spiritual and heavenly portion, we shall bear to be
          robbed by the bands of the wicked, and yet, &quot;hold fast our
          profession.&quot; David, under this calamity, &quot;encouraged himself
          in the Lord his God.&quot; Job, under the same visitation, &quot;fell
          upon the ground, and worshiped.&quot; The blessings, indeed, we lose,
          are but as a feather compared with the blessings which we retain. The
          Providence of God is an abundant support for His children. Their
          prospects (not to speak of their present privileges) effectually
          secure them from ultimate loss, even in the spoiling of their worldly
          all. Thus the early Christians permitted the bands of the wicked to
          rob them—no, &quot;they took joyfully the spoiling of their goods;
          knowing in themselves, that they had in heaven a better and an
          enduring substance.&quot; We have, indeed, little reason to be
          frightened from religion by the anticipation of its trials. The
          exchange of the world for God, and of the service of sin for the ways
          of heaven, leaves no room for regret in life, in death, or in
          eternity. The Christian&#x27;s darkest hour is ten thousand times
          brighter than the brightest day of the ungodly. The hope of the crown
          will enable us to bear the cross, and to realize its sanctifying
          support as a matter for unbounded praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how desolate are the poor votaries of the world in the hour of
          trouble! Ignorant of the all-sufficiency of the refuge of the gospel;
          instead of being driven to it by the gracious visitations of God, they
          would rather retreat into any hiding-place of their own, than direct
          their steps backward to Him. Their circumstances of distress are most
          intensely aggravated by the sullen rebellion of the heart, which
          refuses to listen to those breathings of the Savior&#x27;s love, that
          would guide them to Himself, as their sure, peaceful, and eternal
          rest! Would that we could persuade them to cast their souls in
          penitence and faith before His blessed cross! The burden of sin, as
          Bunyan&#x27;s pilgrim found, would then drop from their backs. And
          this burden once removed—other burdens, before intolerable, would be
          found comparatively light; no—all burdens would be removed in the
          enjoyment of the Christian privilege of casting all—sin—care—and
          trouble, upon Jesus. Contrast the state of destitution without Him,
          with the abundant resources of the people of God. We have a double
          heaven—a heaven on earth, and a heaven above—one in present
          sunshine—the other in &quot;the city, which has no need of the
          sun&quot;—where our joys will be immediate—unclouded—eternal. Thus our
          portion embraces both worlds. Our present &quot;joy no man takes from
          us;&quot; and we have &quot;laid up treasures in heaven,&quot; where
          the bands of the wicked can &quot;never break through, nor
          steal.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian! does not your faith realize a subsistence of things not
          seen? The only realities in the apprehension of the world are
          &quot;the things that are seen, and are temporal.&quot; Your realities
          are &quot;the things that are not seen, and are eternal.&quot; Then,
          remember—if you be robbed of your earthly all, your treasure is beyond
          the reach of harm. You can still say, &quot;I have all, and
          abound.&quot; You can live splendidly upon your God, though all is
          beggary around you. You confess the remembrance of the law of your God
          to be your unfailing stay, &quot;Unless Your law had been my delights,
          I should then have perished in my affliction.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          62. At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto You: because of Your
          righteous judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another exercise of sacred pleasure is the ways of the Lord! His
          portion was always satisfying to this holy man, and he was daily
          feeding upon it with fresh delight. There was no occasion for the
          painful restrictions and mortifications of a monastery to oblige him
          to self-denying observances. Much less was there any desire, by these
          extraordinary services, to work out a righteousness of his own, to
          recommend him to the favor of God. His diligence in this heavenly work
          was the spontaneous effusion of a heart &quot;filled with the
          Spirit.&quot; Presenting the morning and the evening service
          &quot;seven times a day,&quot; was not enough for him; but he must
          rise at midnight to continue his song of praise. These hours sometimes
          had been spent in overwhelming sorrow. Now they were given to the
          privileged employment of praise. Indeed it seems to have been his
          frequent custom to stir up his gratitude by a midnight review of the
          Lord&#x27;s daily manifestations of mercy. A most exciting
          example—especially for the child of sorrow, when &quot;wearisome
          nights are appointed to him,&quot; and he &quot;is full of tossings to
          and fro unto the dawning of the day!&quot; Thus &quot;let the saints
          be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds.&quot; We
          observe this Christian enjoyment under circumstances of outward trial.
          When &quot;at midnight—their feet made fast in the stocks—Paul and
          Silas prayed, and sang praises to God:&quot; they gave thanks, because
          of His righteous judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          We often complain of our lack of spirituality in the Divine life—how
          much our body hinders the ascent of the soul heavenwards—how often
          drowsiness overcomes our evening communion with our God; the
          &quot;weakness of the flesh&quot; overpowering the &quot;willingness
          of the Spirit.&quot; But, after making all due allowances for
          constitutional infirmity, how far are we &quot;instant in season and
          out of season&quot; in the mortification of the flesh? Do we earnestly
          seek for a heart delighting in heavenly things? The more the flesh is
          denied for the service of God, the more we shall be elevated for the
          enjoyment, and realize the privilege of the work; and instead of
          having so often to mourn that our &quot;souls cleave to the
          dust,&quot; we shall &quot;mount upwards with eagles&#x27;
          wings,&quot; and even now by anticipation, take our place before
          &quot;the throne of God and the Lamb.&quot; Such is the active
          influence of self-denial in exercising our graces, and promoting our
          comfort! Oh! how much more fervent would be our prayers— how much more
          fruitful in blessings—were they enlivened with more abundant delight
          in the &#x27;angelic work of praise!&#x27; (Baxter.) The theme is
          always before us. The subject of the heavenly song should constantly
          engage our songs on earth—Jesus and His love—the &quot;worthiness of
          the Lamb that was slain&quot;—His &quot;power, and riches, and wisdom,
          and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.&quot; Midnight
          wakefulness would be far sweeter than slumber; yes, night itself would
          be turned into day, did the judgments of God, as manifested in the
          glory of the Savior, thus occupy our hearts. Lord! tune my heart to
          Your praise, and then no time will be unseasonable for this blessed
          employment. Time thus redeemed from sleep will be an foretaste of the
          unwearied service of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          63. I am a companion of all who fear you, and of those who keep your
          precepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those that love the Lord&#x27;s service naturally associate with
          kindred spirits—with those that fear Him, and keep His precepts. These
          two features identify the same character: as cheerful obedience is
          always the fruit of filial fear. These then are the Lord&#x27;s
          people; and union with Him is in fact union with them. Sometimes the
          society of the refined and intelligent of this world may be more
          congenial to our natural taste. But ought there not to be a restraint
          here? Ought not the Christian to say, &quot;Surely the fear of God is
          not in this place?&quot; and &quot;should I love them that hate the
          Lord?&quot; Let those of us, who live in close, and to a certain
          degree necessary, contact with the world, subject their hearts to an
          evening scrutiny on this subject. &#x27;Has the society of this day
          refreshed my soul, or raised my heart to spiritual things? Has it
          promoted a watchful temper? Or has it not rather &quot;quenched the
          spirit&quot; of prayer, and restrained my communion with God? To meet
          the Christian in ordinary courtesy, not in unity of heart, is a sign
          of an unspiritual walk with God. Fellowship with God is &quot;walking
          in the light.&quot; &quot;Fellowship one with another&quot; is the
          natural flow. &quot;The communion of saints&quot; is the fruit and
          effect of communion with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The calls of duty, or the leadings of Providence, may indeed
          unavoidably connect us with those, who &quot;have no fear of God
          before their eyes.&quot; Nor should we repel them, by religiously
          affecting a sullen or uncourteous habit. But such men, whatever be
          their attractions, will not be the companions of our choice.
          Fellowship with them is to &quot;remove the ancient landmark;&quot; to
          forget the broad line of separation between us and them; and to
          venture into the most hazardous atmosphere. If indeed our hearts were
          ascending, like a flame of fire, with a natural motion heavenwards,
          and carrying with them all in their way, the choice of the companions
          of our pilgrimage would be a matter of little importance. But so
          deadening to our spirit is the conversation of the men of this world
          (however commanding their talents, or interesting their topics), that
          even if we have been just before enlivened by the high privilege of
          communion with God, the free and self-indulgent interchange of their
          society will benumb our spiritual powers, and quickly freeze them
          again. To underrate therefore the privileged association with them
          that fear God, is to incur—not only a most awful responsibility in the
          sight of God; but also a most serious hazard to our own souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          If then we are not ashamed to confess ourselves Christians, let us not
          shrink from walking in fellowship with Christians. Even if they should
          exhibit some repulsive features of character, they bear the image of
          Him, whom we profess to love inexpressibly and incomparably above all.
          They will be our companions in our eternal home; they ought therefore
          to be our brothers now. How sweet, and holy, and heavenly, is this
          near relation with them in our common Lord! Shall we not readily
          consent to his judgment, who pronounced &quot;the righteous to be more
          excellent than his neighbor?&quot; &quot;Iron sharpens iron.&quot; If
          then &quot;the iron be blunt,&quot; this will be one of the best means
          of &quot;whetting the edge.&quot; The most established servants of God
          gladly acknowledge the sensible refreshment of this union of heart. It
          is marked in the word of God, as the channel of the communication of
          heavenly wisdom—as a feature in the character of the citizens of
          Zion—and as that disposition, which is distinguished with manifest
          tokens of the Savior&#x27;s presence; and which the great day will
          crown with the special seal of His remembrance. &quot;They that feared
          the Lord spoke often one to another; and the Lord hearkened, and
          heard&quot; it; &quot;and a book of remembrance was written before Him
          for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name. And
          they shall be Mine, says the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up
          My jewels.&quot;

          64. The earth, O Lord, is full of Your mercy: teach me Your statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          What full provision is made for man&#x27;s happiness! The first
          creation was full of mercy. God knew that He had created a being full
          of want. Every faculty wanted some suitable object, as the source of
          enjoyment in the gratification—of suffering in the denial; and now has
          He charged Himself with making provision for them all—so perfect, that
          no want is left unprovided for.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what a picture does the earth now present on every side—a world of
          rebels! yet a world full of the mercy of the Lord! &quot;O Lord, how
          manifold are Your works! in wisdom have You made them all. The earth
          is full of Your riches. The eyes of all wait upon You, and You give
          them their meat in due season. You open Your hand, and satisfy the
          desire of every living thing.&quot; And how does the contemplation of
          the Lord&#x27;s mercy in providence encourage our faith, in the
          expectancy of spiritual privileges! &quot;O Lord! You preserve man and
          beast. How excellent is Your loving-kindness, O God! therefore the
          children of men put their trust under the shadow of Your wings. They
          shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Your house; and You
          shall make them drink of the river of Your pleasures.&quot; &#x27;As
          You largely bestow Your blessings upon all creatures according to
          their nature and condition, so I desire the spiritual blessings of the
          lively light of Your law and word, which are fitting and convenient
          for the being and happiness of my soul.&#x27; As an ignorant sinner,
          &quot;what I see not, teach me.&quot; Teach me Your statutes; that
          which You have appointed, as the way of duty, and the path to
          glory—that path which I am utterly unable to discover, or when
          discovered, to walk in, without the help of Your grace. And indeed the
          hearts of His people are the vessels, into which the Lord is
          continually pouring more and more of Himself, until they shall
          &quot;be filled with all the fullness of God.&quot; Every good,
          according to its character and degree, is diffusive. And thus the
          goodness or mercy of God pervades His whole
          universe—natural—plentiful—free—communicative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet none but a believer will understand how to use the plea which is
          here employed. The mercy that he sees on every side, is to him a
          pledge and earnest of that mercy, which his soul needs within. The
          world indeed in its present fallen state, when seen through the medium
          of pride and discontent, exhibits a picture of misery, not of mercy;
          and only ministers occasion for complaint against the Creator. But the
          believer—feeling the infinite and eternal desert of sin—cannot but
          know, that the lowest exercise of goodness in God is an act of free
          undeserved mercy. No wonder then that he sees mercy in everything—in
          every part of the universe of God—a world full of mercy. The very food
          we eat, our clothing, our habitations, the contrivances for our
          comfort, are not mere displays of goodness, but manifestations of
          mercy. Having forfeited all claim upon the smallest consideration of
          God, there could have been no just ground of complaint, had all these
          blessings been made occasions of suffering, instead of comfort and
          indulgence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed is it not a marvel, that when man—full of mercy—is lifting up
          his hand against his God—employing against him all the faculties,
          which His mercy gave and has preserved—that God should be so seldom
          provoked to strike by their aggravated provocations? What
          multitude—what weight—what variety of mercy does He still shower upon
          us! Even our hair, though seemingly so unimportant, the seat of
          loathsome, defiling, and even mortal disease—is the object of His
          special care. All the limbs of the body, all the faculties of the
          mind, all the affections of the heart, all the powers of the will:
          keeping us in health, and capable of acting for our own happiness—how
          does He restrain them from those exercises or movements which might be
          fatal to our happiness!
        </p>
        <p>
          And then the question naturally recurs—and to a spiritual mind will
          never weary by its recurrence—Whence flows all this mercy? Oh! it is
          delightful indeed to answer such an inquiry—delightful to contemplate
          Him, &quot;in whom&quot; we are not only &quot;blessed with all
          spiritual blessings;&quot; but who is also the medium, through which
          our temporal comforts are conveyed to us. How sweet to eye these
          mercies, as bought with the most precious blood that ever was known in
          the world, and to mark the print of the nails of our crucified Friend
          stamped upon the least of them! We allow it to add a relish to our
          enjoyments, that we can consider them as provided by some beloved
          friend; and should not our mercies be doubly sweet in remembrance of
          that munificent Friend, who purchased them for us so dearly; who
          bestows them upon us so richly; yes, who gives Himself with them all?
        </p>
        <p>
          Have we heard of this mercy of God? And do we feel the need of it for
          ourselves—for every moment? Then let us apply to the throne of grace
          in the free and open way of acceptance and access. Let us go to the
          King (as Benhadad&#x27;s servants to the king of Israel,) in the
          spirit of self-condemnation and faith. Our acceptance does not depend
          (as in the case referred to) upon a &quot;perhaps;&quot; but it rests
          upon the sure word of promise, &quot;Him who comes to Me, I will in no
          wise cast out.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          65. You have dealt well with Your servant, O Lord, according to Your
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a time for all things in the believer&#x27;s experience—for
          confession, prayer, and praise. This Psalm mostly expresses the
          confessions and prayers of the man of God—yet mingled with thankful
          acknowledgments of mercy. He had prayed, &quot;Deal bountifully with
          Your servant.&quot; Perhaps here is the acknowledgment of the answer
          to his prayer—You have dealt well with Your servant, O Lord, according
          to Your word. And who among us has not daily reason to make the same
          acknowledgment? Even in those trials, when we have indulged hard
          thoughts of God, a clearer view of His judgments, and a more simple
          dependence upon His faithfulness and love, will rebuke our impatience
          and unbelief, and encourage our trust. Subsequent experience altered
          Jacob&#x27;s hasty view of the Lord&#x27;s dealings with him. In a
          moment of peevishness, the recollection of the supposed death of a
          beloved son, and the threatened bereavement of another, tempted him to
          say, &quot;All these things are against me.&quot; At a brighter period
          of his day, when clouds were beginning to disperse, we hear that
          &quot;the spirit of Jacob revived: And Jacob said, It is enough;
          Joseph my son is yet alive, I will go and see him before I die.&quot;
          And when his evening sun was going down almost without a cloud, in the
          believing act of &quot;blessing the sons of&quot; his beloved
          &quot;Joseph,&quot; how clearly does he retract the language of his
          former sinful impatience!, &quot;God, before whom my fathers, Abraham
          and Isaac, did walk—the God which fed me all my life long to this
          day—the Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads!&quot;
          This surely was in the true spirit of the acknowledgment—You have
          dealt well with Your servant, O Lord, according to Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          And how is it that any of us have ever harbored a suspicion of
          unbelief? Has God in any one instance falsified His promise? Has
          &quot;the vision&quot; failed to come at the end? Has it ever
          &quot;lied?&quot; Has He not &quot;confirmed His promise by an
          oath,&quot; &quot;that we might have two immutable things&quot; as the
          ground of &quot;strong consolation?&quot; Any degree less than the
          full credit that He deserves, is admitting the false principle, that
          God is a man, that He should lie, and the son of man, that He should
          repent. It weakens the whole spiritual frame, shakes our grasp of the
          promise, destroys our present comfort, and brings foreboding
          apprehensions of the future. Whereas, if we have faith and patience to
          wait, &quot;in the mount the Lord shall be seen.&quot; &quot;All
          things&quot; may seem to be &quot;against us,&quot; while at the very
          moment, under the wonder-working hand of God, they are &quot;working
          together for our good.&quot; When therefore we &quot;are in heaviness
          through manifold temptations,&quot; and we discover a
          &quot;needs-be&quot; for it all; and &quot;the trial of faith is found
          unto praise and honor and glory&quot;—when we are thus reaping the
          fruitful discipline of our Father&#x27;s school, must we not put a
          fresh seal to our testimony—You have dealt well with Your servant, O
          Lord? But why should we delay our acknowledgment until we come out of
          our trial? Ought we not to give it even in the midst of our
          &quot;heaviness?&quot; Faith has enabled many, and would enable us, to
          &quot;glorify God in the fires;&quot; to &quot;trust&quot; Him, even
          when &quot;walking in darkness, and having no light;&quot; and, even
          while smarting under His chastening rod, to acknowledge, that He has
          dealt well with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if I doubt the reasonableness of this acknowledgment, then let me,
          while suffering under trials, endeavor to take up different language.
          &#x27;Lord, You have dealt ill with Your servant; You have not kept
          Your word.&#x27; If in a moment of unbelief my impatient heart, like
          Jacob&#x27;s, could harbor such a dishonorable suspicion, my
          conscience would soon smite me with conviction—&#x27;What! shall I,
          who am &quot;called out of darkness into marvelous light&quot;—shall
          I, who am rescued from slavery and death, and brought to a glorious
          state of liberty and life, complain? Shall I, who have been redeemed
          at so great a price, and who have a right to &quot;all the promises of
          God in Christ Jesus,&quot; and who am now an &quot;heir of God, and
          joint heir with Christ,&quot; murmur at my Father&#x27;s will? Alas,
          that my heart should prove so foolish, so weak, so ungrateful! Lord! I
          would acknowledge with thankfulness, and yet with humiliation, You
          have dealt well with Your servant, according to Your word.&#x27; But
          how sinfully do we neglect these honorable and cheering
          acknowledgments! Were we habitually to mark them for future
          remembrance, we should be surprised to see how their numbers would
          multiply. &quot;If we should count them, they are more in number than
          the sand.&quot; And truly such recollections—enhancing every common,
          as well as every special mercy—would come up as a sweet savor to God
          &quot;by Christ Jesus.&quot;&quot;Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all
          that is within me, bless His holy name; and do not forget all His
          benefits.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          66. Teach me good judgment and knowledge; for I have believed Your
          commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the perception of the Lord&#x27;s merciful dealings with my soul is
          obscure—Teach me good judgment and knowledge. Give me a clear and
          enlarged apprehension, that I may be ready with my acknowledgment,
          &quot;All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth.&quot; Or even
          with an enlightened assurance of His wise and faithful dispensations,
          still would I urge this petition before Him, as needful for every step
          of my path. Indeed this prayer illustrates the simplicity and
          intelligence of Christian faith—always desiring, asking, and expecting
          the most suitable blessings. For what blessings can be more suitable
          to an ignorant sinner, than good judgment and knowledge: knowledge of
          ourselves, of our Savior, of the way of obedience—and good judgment,
          to apply this knowledge to some valuable end? These two parts of our
          intellectual furniture have a most important connection and dependence
          upon each other. Knowledge is the speculative perception of general
          truth. Judgment is the practical application of it to the heart and
          conduct. No school, but the school of Christ—no teaching, but the
          teaching of the Spirit—can ever give this good judgment and knowledge.
          Solomon asks it for himself—Paul for his people. Both direct us to God
          as the sole fountain and author.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot fail to observe a very common defect in Christians;—warm
          affections connected with a blind or loose judgment. Hence, too often,
          a lightness in religion, equally unsteady in profession and in
          practice—easily satisfied with a narrow compass in the vast field of
          Scripture, instead of grasping a full survey of those truths, which
          are so intimately connected with our Christian establishment and
          privilege. Much perplexing doubt, discouragement, and fear; much
          mistaken apprehension of important truth, much coldness and
          backsliding of heart and conduct, arises from the want of an accurate
          and full apprehension of the scriptural system.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prayer has a special application to the tender and sensitive
          child of God. The disease of his constitution is too often a
          scrupulous conscience—one of the most active and successful enemies to
          his settled peace and quietness. The faculty of conscience partakes,
          with every other power of man, of the injury of the fall; and
          therefore, with all its intelligence, honesty, and power, it is liable
          to misconception. Like a defect of vision, it often displaces objects:
          and, in apparently conflicting duties, that which touches the feeling,
          or accords with the temper, is preferred to one, which, though more
          remotely viewed, really possessed a higher claim. Thus it pronounces
          its verdict from the predominance of feeling, rather than from the
          exercise of judgment—more from an indistinct perception of the subject
          presented to the mind, than from a simple immediate reference &quot;to
          the law and testimony.&quot; Again—matters of trivial moment are often
          insisted upon, to the neglect of important principles. External points
          of offence are more considered, than the habitual mortification of the
          inward principle. Conformity to the world in dress and appearance is
          more strongly censured than the general spirit of worldliness in the
          temper and conduct of outward non-conformists; while the spirit of
          separation from the world, is totally disregarded. Thus are
          non-essentials confounded with fundamentals—things indifferent with
          things unlawful, from a narrow misconception of what is directly
          forbidden and allowed. Conscience, therefore, must not be trusted
          without the light of the word of God; and most important is the
          prayer—Teach me good judgment and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exercises of this state of feeling are both endless and causeless.
          In the well-intended endeavor to guard against a devious track, the
          mind is constantly harassed with an over-anxious inquiry, whether the
          right path is accurately discovered; and thus at once the pleasure and
          the progress of the journey are materially hindered. The influence
          therefore of this morbid sensibility is strenuously to be resisted. It
          renders the strait way more strait. It retards the work of grace in
          the soul. It is usually connected with self-righteousness. It savors
          of, and tends to produce, hard thoughts of God. It damps our
          cheerfulness in His service, and unfits us for the duty of the present
          moment. What however is more than all to be deprecated, is, that it
          multiplies sin; or, to speak more clearly, it superinduces another
          species of sin, besides the actual transgression of the law of God.
          For opposition to the dictates of conscience in any particular is sin,
          even though the act itself may be allowed by the law of God. We may
          therefore sin in the act of doing good, or in obedience to the liberty
          and enjoyment of the gospel, as well as in the allowed transgression
          of the law. Indeed, under the bondage of a scrupulous conscience, we
          seem to be entangled in the sad necessity of sinning. The dictates of
          conscience, even when grounded upon misconception, are authoritative.
          Listening to its suggestions may be sinning against &quot;the liberty,
          with which Christ has made us free,&quot; and in which we are
          commanded to &quot;stand fast.&quot; No human authority can free from
          its bonds. Resistance to its voice is disobedience to God&#x27;s
          viceregent, and therefore, in a qualified sense at least, disobedience
          to God Himself. And thus it is sin, even when that which conscience
          condemns may be innocent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evil of a scrupulous conscience may often be traced to a diseased
          temperament of body, to a naturally weak or perverted understanding,
          to the unfavorable influence of early prejudice—to a lack of simple
          exercise of faith, or perception of the matters of faith. In these
          cases faith may be sincere, though weak; and the sin, such as it is,
          is a sin of infirmity, calling for our pity, forbearance, prayer, and
          help. In many instances however, willful ignorance, false shame that
          will not inquire, or a pertinacious adherence to deep-rooted opinion,
          is the source of the disease. Now such persons must be roused, even at
          the hazard of wounding the conscience of the more tenderly scrupulous.
          But as the one class decidedly sin, and the other too frequently
          indulge their infirmity, the excitement will probably be ultimately
          useful to both. Both need to have the conscience enlightened; and to
          obtain &quot;a right judgment in all things&quot;—by a more diligent
          &quot;search in the Scriptures&quot;—by &quot;seeking the law at the
          mouth of the priest&quot;—and, above all, by earnest prayer with the
          Psalmist—Teach me good judgment and knowledge. Thus they will discern
          between what is imperative, and what is indifferent; between what is
          lawful, and what is expedient. If &quot;whatever is not of faith is
          sin,&quot; then the only prospect of the removal of the doubt will be
          increase of faith—that is, a more full persuasion of the Divine
          warrant and instruction. &quot;Howbeit there is not in everyone this
          knowledge:&quot; yet the exhortation speaks alike to all, &quot;Grow
          in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
          Christ.&quot; Indeed the most favorable symptoms of scrupulosity
          (except where the disease originates in external causes) partake of
          the guilt of willful ignorance; because none can be said sincerely to
          ask for good judgment and knowledge, who do not diligently improve all
          means of obtaining it. If therefore, the scrupulous shrink from
          honestly seeking the resolution of their difficulties in private
          conferences (where they are to be had) with Ministers or experienced
          Christians, so far they must be considered as wilfully ignorant. We
          would indeed &quot;receive them,&quot; &quot;bear with their
          infirmities,&quot; and encourage them to expect relief from their hard
          bondage in the way of increasing diligence, humility, and prayer.
          While their minds are in doubt concerning the path of duty, their
          actions must be imperfect and unsatisfactory. Let them therefore wait,
          inquire, and pray, until their way be made plain. This done, let them
          act according to their conscience, allowing nothing that it condemns,
          neglecting nothing which it requires. The responsibility of error
          (should error be eventually detected) will not be—the too implicit
          following of the guidance of conscience—but the want of due care and
          diligence for its more clear illumination. Generally, however, the
          rule will apply, &quot;If your eye be single, your whole body shall be
          full of light.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But, besides the scrupulous conscience, the imperfectly enlightened
          conscience presents a case equally to be deprecated. Often does it
          charge to a sinful source those incessant variations of feelings,
          which originate in bodily indisposition, or accidental influence of
          temptation. Sins of infirmity are confounded with sins of indulgence:
          occasional with habitual transgressions of duty. Only a part of the
          character is brought under cognisance: and while short-comings or
          surprisals are justly condemned: yet the exercise of contrition,
          faith, love, and watchfulness, is passed by unnoticed. Thus the gospel
          becomes the very reverse of the appointment of its gracious Author. It
          brings ashes for beauty, mourning for the oil of joy, and the spirit
          of heaviness for the garment of praise. If this evil is &quot;not a
          sin unto death,&quot; it is &quot;a sore evil under the sun,&quot;
          which may often give occasion for the prayer—Teach me good judgment
          and knowledge; that, in the simplicity of faith, I may be blessed with
          a tender conscience, and be delivered from the bondage of a
          scrupulous, and from the perplexity of an unenlightened, conscience.
          Let my heart never condemn me where it ought not. Let it never fail to
          condemn me where it ought.

          But, alas! the perception of our need of this good judgment and
          knowledge, is far too indistinct and uninfluential. We need to cry for
          these valuable blessings with deeper earnestness, and more diligent
          and patient waiting upon God. Divine wisdom is a treasury, that does
          not spend by giving; and we may ask to be enriched to the utmost
          extent of our wants, &quot;in full assurance of faith.&quot; But this
          faith embraces the whole revelation of God—the commandments as well as
          the promises. And thus it becomes the principle of Christian
          obedience. For can we believe these commandments to be as they are
          represented, &quot;holy, just, and good,&quot; and not delight in
          them? &quot;In those is continuance&quot;—said the prophet, &quot;and
          we shall be saved.&quot; Convinced of their perfection, acknowledging
          their obligations, loving them, and living in them, we shall
          &quot;come to full age&quot; in the knowledge of the Gospel, and,
          &quot;by reason of use have our senses exercised to discern both good
          and evil.&quot;

          The teaching of good judgment and knowledge will lead us to deprecate,
          instead of desiring, a prosperous state. But should the Christian, by
          the appointment of God, be thrown into the seductive atmosphere, he
          will feel the prayer that is so often put into his lips, most
          peculiarly expressive of his need, &quot;In all time of our
          wealth—Good Lord, deliver us!&quot; (Litany.) A time of wealth is
          indeed a time of special need. It is hard to restrain the flesh, when
          so many are the baits for its indulgence. Such mighty power is here
          given to the enemy, while our perception of his power is fearfully
          weakened! Many and affecting instances are recorded of the hardening
          of the heart even of the Lord&#x27;s people, in the deadening
          influence of a proud and worldly spirit. But the fate of the ungodly
          is written as with a sunbeam for our warning, &quot;When Jeshurun
          waxed fat, he kicked—I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said,
          I will not hear.&quot; But how awful will be the period, when the
          question shall speak to the conscience with all the poignancy of
          self-conviction, &quot;What fruit had you then in those things whereof
          you are now ashamed?&quot; What is the end of this flowery path?
          &quot;Death!&quot; &quot;Surely You set them in slippery places: You
          cast them down into destruction. How are they brought into desolation
          as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors&quot; &quot;the
          prosperity of fools shall destroy them.&quot;

          Our Savior&#x27;s allotment for His people, &quot;In the world you
          shall have tribulation&quot;—marks not less His wisdom than His love.
          This is the gracious rod, by which He scourges back His prodigal
          children to Himself. This is the wise discipline, by which He
          preserves them from the poisoned sweetness of carnal allurements, and
          keeps their hearts in a simple direction towards Himself, as the
          well-spring of their everlasting joy. With all of them this one method
          has been pursued. All have been taught in one school. All have known
          the power of affliction in some of its varied forms of inward conflict
          or outward trouble. All have found a time of affliction a time of
          love. All have given proof, that the pains bestowed upon them have not
          been in vain. Thus did Manasseh in affliction beseech &quot;the Lord,
          and humble himself greatly before the Lord God of his fathers.&quot;
          Thus also in afflictions the Lord &quot;heard Ephraim bemoaning
          himself;&quot; and beheld Israel &quot;seeking Him early,&quot; and
          the forlorn wandering child casting a wishful, penitent look towards
          his Father&#x27;s house, as if the pleasures that had enticed his
          heart from home, were now embittered to the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus the Christian can give some account of the means, by which
          his Father is leading and preparing him for heaven. Perhaps he did not
          at first see the reason. It was matter of faith, not of consciousness.
          But in looking back, how clear the path, how valuable the benefit,
          Before I was afflicted, I went astray: but now have I kept Your word.
          &#x27;I never prized it before. I could indeed scarcely be said to
          know it. I never understood its comfort, until affliction expounded it
          to me. I never until now saw its suitableness to my case.&#x27; But
          what an heightened aggravation of guilt, when these especial mercies
          fail of their gracious end—when vanity, worldliness, and sin still
          reign with uncontrolled sway! Ah! when sinners are unhumbled
          &quot;under the mighty hand of God&quot;—when they are afflicted, and
          not purged by affliction—when it is said of them, &quot;They received
          not correction&quot;—it seems the forerunner of that tremendous
          judgment, &quot;Why should you be stricken any more?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Heavenly Father! keep Your poor, weak, erring child from this fearful
          doom. Let not that measure of prosperity, which You may be pleased to
          give, prove my curse. But especially let every cross, every affliction
          which You are pleased to mingle in my cup, conform me more to my
          Savior&#x27;s image, restrain my heart from its daily wanderings,
          endear Your holy ways and word to my soul, and give me sweeter
          anticipations of that blessed home, where I shall never wander more,
          but find my eternal happiness in keeping Your word.
        </p>
        <p>68. You are good, and do good: teach me Your statutes.</p>
        <p>
          The blessed effects of chastisement, as a special instance of the
          Lord&#x27;s goodness, might naturally lead to a general acknowledgment
          of the goodness of His character and dispensation. Judging in
          unbelieving haste, of His providential and gracious dealings, feeble
          sense imagines a frown, when the eye of faith discerns a smile, upon
          His face; and therefore in proportion as faith is exercised in the
          review of the past, and the experience of the present, we shall be
          prepared with the ascription of praise—You are good. This is indeed
          the expression—the confidence—the pleading—of faith. It is the sweet
          taste of experience—restraining the legality of the conscience, the
          many hard and dishonorable thoughts of God, and invigorating a lively
          enjoyment of Him. Indeed &#x27;this is the true and genuine character
          of God. He is good—He is goodness. Good in Himself—good in His
          essence—good in the highest degree. All the names of God are
          comprehended in this one of Good. All the acts of God are nothing else
          but the effluxes of His goodness distinguished by several names
          according to the object it is exercised about. When He confers
          happiness without merit, it is grace. When He bestows happiness
          against merit, it is mercy. When He bears with provoking rebels, it is
          patience. When He performs His promise, it is truth. When He
          commiserates a distressed person, it is pity. When He supplies an
          indigent person, it is bounty. When He supports an innocent person, it
          is righteousness. And when He pardons a penitent person, it is mercy.
          All summed up in this one name—Goodness. None so communicatively good
          as God. As the notion of God includes goodness, so the notion of
          goodness includes diffusiveness. Without goodness He would cease to be
          a Deity; and without diffusiveness He would cease to be good. The
          being good is necessary to the being God. For goodness is nothing else
          in the notion of it but a strong inclination to do good, either to
          find or to make an object, wherein to exercise itself, according to
          the propensity of its own nature; and it is an inclination of
          communicating itself, not for its own interest, but for the good of
          the object it pitches upon. Thus God is good by nature; and His nature
          is not without activity. He acts consistently with His own nature—You
          are good, and do good.&#x27; (Charnock)
        </p>
        <p>
          How easily is such an acknowledgment excited towards an earthly
          friend! Yet who has not daily cause to complain of the coldness of his
          affections towards his God? It would be a sweet morning&#x27;s
          reflection to recollect some of the innumerable instances, in which
          the goodness of God has been most distinctly marked, to trace them in
          their peculiar application to our own need; and above all to mark, not
          only the source from which they come, but the channel through which
          they flow. A view of covenant love does indeed make the goodness of
          God to shine with inexpressible brightness &quot;in the face of Jesus
          Christ;&quot; and often when the heart is conscious of backsliding,
          does the contemplation of this goodness under the influence of the
          Spirit, prove the Divinely appointed means of &quot;leading us to
          repentance.&quot; Let us therefore wait on, even when we see nothing.
          Soon we shall see, where we did not look for it. Soon we shall find
          goodness unmingled—joy unclouded, unspeakable, eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, though the diversified manifestations—the materials of our
          happiness, in all around us, be countless as the particles of sand,
          and the drops of dew; yet without heavenly teaching they only become
          occasions of our deeper misery and condemnation. It is not enough that
          the Lord gives—He must teach us His statutes. Divine truths can only
          be apprehended by Divine teaching. The scholar, who has been longest
          taught, realizes most his need of this teaching, and is most earnest
          in seeking it. Indeed, &quot;the earth is full of the goodness of the
          Lord,&quot; yet we may be utterly ignorant of it. The instances of
          goodness in the shape of a cross, we consider to be the reflection on
          it. Nothing is goodness in our eyes, that crosses our own inclination.
          We can hardly bear to hear of the cross, much less to take it up. We
          talk of goodness, but yield to discontent. We do not profess to
          dislike trial—only the trial now pressing upon us—any other cross than
          this; that is, my will and wisdom rather than God&#x27;s. Is there
          not, therefore, great need of this prayer for Divine teaching, that we
          may discern the Lord&#x27;s mercies so closely crowded together, and
          make the due improvement of each? Twice before had the Psalmist sent
          up this prayer and plea. Yet he seems to make the supplication ever
          new by the freshness and vehemency of his desires. And let me ever
          make it new by the remembrance of that one display of goodness, which
          casts every other manifestation into the shade, &quot;God so loved the
          world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This constitutes of itself a complete mirror of infinite and
          everlasting goodness—the only intelligent display of His goodness—the
          only manifestation, that prevents from abusing it. What can I say to
          this—but You are good, and do good? What may I not then expect from
          You! &#x27;&quot;Teach me Your statutes.&quot; Teach me the Revelation
          of Yourself—Teach me the knowledge of Your Son. For &quot;this is life
          eternal, that I might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ
          whom You have sent.&quot;&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          69. The proud have forged a lie against me; but I will keep Your
          precepts with my whole heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Lord does us good, we must expect Satan to do us evil. Acting
          in his own character, as a &quot;liar and the father of it,&quot; he
          readily puts it into the hearts of his children to forge lies against
          the children of God! But all is overruled by the ever-watchful care
          and providence of God, for the eventual good of His church. The cross
          frightens the insincere, and removes them out of the way; while the
          steadfastness of His own people marvelously displays to the world the
          power and triumph of faith. A most delightful source of encouragement
          in this fiery trial is, to take off the eye from the objects of sense,
          and to fix it upon Jesus as our pattern, no less than our life. For
          every trial, in which we are conformed to His suffering image,
          supplies to us equal direction and support. Do &quot;the proud forge
          lies against us?&quot; So did they against Him. &quot;The disciple is
          not above his master, nor the servant above his Lord. It is enough for
          the disciple, that he be as his master, and the servant as his Lord.
          If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more
          shall they call them of his household?&quot; &quot;Consider Him,
          therefore, that endured such contradiction of sinners against Himself,
          lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But is it always lies that are forged against us? Is there no
          worldliness, or pride, or inconsistency in temper and walk, that opens
          the mouths of the enemies of the gospel, and causes &quot;the way of
          truth to be evil spoken of?&quot; Do they not sometimes &quot;say all
          manner of evil&quot; against some of us, for Christ&#x27;s sake; yet
          alas! not altogether &quot;falsely?&quot; &quot;Woe unto the world,
          because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe
          to that man, by whom the offence comes!&quot; If, however, the
          reproach of the world be &quot;the reproach of Christ,&quot; &quot;let
          us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; for He is
          faithful that promised.&quot; Insincerity of heart can never support
          us to a consistent and persevering endurance of the cross. A heart
          divided between God and the world will ever be found faulty and
          backsliding. Wholeness of heart in the precepts of God adorns the
          Christian profession, awes the ungodly world, realizes the full extent
          of the Divine promises, and pours into the soul such a spring-tide of
          enjoyment, as more than counterbalances all the reproach, contempt,
          and falsehood, which the forge of the great enemy is employing against
          us with unceasing activity, and relentless hatred. Yet do not forget,
          believer, that these proofs of the malicious enmity of the proud must
          often be received as the gentle stroke of your Father&#x27;s
          chastisement. Let the fruits of it, then, be daily visible in the work
          of mortification—in the exercise of the suffering graces of the
          gospel—in your growing conformity to His image—and in a progressive
          fitness for the world of eternal uninterrupted love.

        <p>70. Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in Your law.</p>
        <p>
          A dreadful description of the hardened state of the proud forgers of
          lies! Yet not of their state only, but of every sinner, who stands out
          in willful rebellion against God. The tremendous blow of almighty
          justice has benumbed his heart, so that the pressure of mountains of
          sin and guilt is unfelt! The heart is left of God, &quot;seared with a
          hot iron,&quot; and therefore without tenderness; &quot;past
          feeling;&quot; unsoftened by the power of the word: unhumbled by the
          rod of providential dispensations, given up to the heaviest of all
          spiritual judgments! But it is of little avail to stifle the voice of
          conscience, unless the same power or device could annihilate hell. It
          will only &quot;awake out of sleep, like a giant refreshed with
          wine,&quot; and rage with ten-fold interminable fury in the eternal
          world, from the temporary restraint, which for a short moment had
          benumbed its energy. Willful resistance to the light of the gospel,
          and the strivings of the Spirit, constrained even from a God of love
          the message of judicial abandonment, &quot;Make the heart of this
          people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they
          see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with
          their heart, and convert, and be healed.&quot; Who then among us will
          not cry—From hardness of heart, and contempt of Your word and
          commandment, Good Lord! deliver us! (Litany.) Tenderness is the first
          mark of the touch of grace, when the heart becomes sensible of its own
          insensibility, and contrite on account of its own hardness.
          &#x27;Nothing&#x27;—said Jerome, in a letter to a friend—&#x27;makes
          my heart sadder, than that nothing makes it sad.&#x27; But when
          &quot;the plague of our own heart&quot; begins to be
          &quot;known,&quot; and becomes a matter of confession, humiliation,
          prayer; the promise of &quot;a new heart&quot; is as life from the
          dead. The subject of this promise delights in God&#x27;s law; and this
          amid the sometimes overwhelming power of natural corruption, gives a
          satisfactory witness of a change &quot;from death unto life.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian! can you daily witness the wretched condition of the
          ungodly, without the constraining recollection of humiliation and
          love? What sovereign grace, that the Lord of glory should have set His
          love upon one so vile! What mighty power, to have raised my insensible
          heart to that delight in His law, which conforms me to the image of
          His dear Son! Deeply would I &quot;abhor myself:&quot; and gladly
          would I acknowledge, that the service of ten thousand hearts would be
          a poor return for such unmerited love. What, oh, &quot;what shall I
          render to the Lord!&quot;—Prayer for them who are still lying in
          death—praise for myself quickened from death. But what can give the
          vital breath, pulse, feeling, and motion? &quot;Come, from the four
          winds, O breath; and breathe upon the slain, that they may live.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us apply, for the purpose of daily self-examination, this
          description of the heart, either as given up to its natural
          insensibility, or as cast into the new mold of delight in the law of
          God. Such an examination will prove to us, how much even renewed souls
          need the transforming, softening influences of grace. &quot;The
          deceitfulness of sin hardens the heart&quot; to its original
          character, as fat as grease, unfeeling, incapable of impression,
          without a Divine touch. O Lord, let not my heart be unvisited for one
          day, one hour, by that melting energy of love, which first made me
          feel, and constrained me to love.

          71. It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn
          Your statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I mark in myself any difference from the ungodly—if I can feel that
          my natural insensibility is yielding to the influence of grace—if I am
          enabled to &quot;delight in God&#x27;s law,&quot; which before I had
          neglected as a &quot;strange thing,&quot; if this softening
          transformation has been wrought in the school of affliction; let me
          thankfully acknowledge—It is good for me that I have been afflicted.
          None indeed but the Lord&#x27;s scholars can know the benefit of this
          school and this teaching. The first lessons are usually learned under
          the power of the word pricking and piercing the heart; yet issuing in
          joyous good. All special lessons afterward will probably be learned
          here. &#x27;I never&#x27;—said Luther—&#x27;knew the meaning of
          God&#x27;s word, until I came into affliction. I have always found it
          one of my best schoolmasters.&#x27; This teaching distinguishes the
          sanctified from the unsanctified cross, explaining many a hard text,
          and sealing many a precious promise—the rod expounding the word, and
          the Divine Teacher effectually applying both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, but for this discipline we should miss much of the meaning and
          spiritual blessing of the word. For how can we have any experimental
          acquaintance with the promises of God, except under those
          circumstances for which the promises are made? When, for example, but
          in the day of trouble, could we understand the full mercy of such a
          gracious word, as, &quot;Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I will
          deliver you, and you shall glorify Me?&quot; And how much more
          profitable is this experimental learning than mere human instruction!
          When, therefore, we pray for a clearer apprehension and interest in
          the blessed book, and for a deeper experience of its power upon our
          hearts; we are, in fact, often unconsciously supplicating for the
          chastening rod of our Father&#x27;s love. For it is the man &quot;whom
          the Lord chastens,&quot; that He &quot;teaches out of His law.&quot;
          Peter, indeed, when on the mount of transfiguration, said, &quot;It is
          good for us to be here. Let us build here three tabernacles.&quot;
          Here let us abide, in a state of comfort, indulgence, and sunshine.
          But well was it added by the sacred historian, &quot;Not knowing what
          he said.&quot; The judgment of David was far more correct, when he
          pronounced, that it was good for him that he had been afflicted. For
          so often are we convicted of inattention to the voice of the Lord—so
          often do we find ourselves looking back upon forsaken Sodom, or
          lingering in the plain, instead of pressing onward to Zoar, that the
          indulgence of our own liberty would shortly hurry us along the pathway
          of destruction. Alas! often do we feel the spirit of prayer to be
          quenched for a season by &quot;a heart overcharged with the cares of
          this life&quot;—or by the overprizing of some lawful comfort—or by a
          temper inconsistent with our Christian profession—or by an undue
          confidence in the flesh. And at such seasons of backsliding, we must
          count among our choicest mercies the gracious discipline, by which the
          Lord schools us with the cross, that we may learn His statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, however, this must be a paradox to the unenlightened man.
          He can only &quot;count it&quot; all grief—not &quot;all joy—when he
          falls into diverse temptations.&quot; His testimony is—It is evil—not
          it is good—for me that I have been afflicted. And even God&#x27;s
          children, as we have before remarked, do not always take up this word
          while smarting under the rod. The common picture of happiness is
          freedom from trouble, not, as Scripture describes it, the portion of
          trouble. Yet how true is God&#x27;s judgment, when it is the very end
          of affliction to remove the source of all trouble, and consequently to
          secure—not to destroy—solid happiness! We must however determine the
          standard of real good by its opposition—not its accordance—to our own
          fancy or indulgence. The promise of &quot;every good thing&quot; may
          be fulfilled by a plentiful cup of affliction. Present evil may be
          &quot;working together for&quot; ultimate &quot;good.&quot; Let God
          take His own way with us. Let us interpret His providences by His
          covenant—His means by His end—and instead of fainting under the
          sharpness of His rod, we shall earnestly desire the improvement of it.

          Are you, then, tried believer, disposed to regret the lessons you have
          already learned in this school? Or have you purchased them at too dear
          a cost? Do you grieve over the bleedings of a contrite heart, that
          have brought you under the care of the healing physician? Or could you
          by any other way have obtained so rich a knowledge of His love, or
          have been trained to such implicit obedience to His will? As Jesus,
          &quot;though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things
          which He suffered;&quot; so may we &quot;rejoice, inasmuch as we are
          partakers of His sufferings,&quot; and be thankful to learn the same
          obedience, as the evidence and fruit of our conformity to Him.

          lost! &quot;Be instructed, O Jerusalem, lest My soul depart from you;
          lest I make you desolate, a land not inhabited.&quot; &quot;He who
          being often reproved, hardens his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed,
          and that without remedy.&quot; A call to tremble and repent, to watch
          and pray, and &quot;turn to Him that smites us!&quot;

          Oh! is there one of that countless throng surrounding the everlasting
          throne, who has not sung, &quot;It is good for me that I have been
          afflicted?&quot; &quot;And one of the elders answered, saying unto me,
          What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?
          And I said unto him, Sir, you know. And he said unto me, These are
          they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes,
          and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&quot;

          72. The law of Your mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and
          silver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well might David acknowledge the benefit of affliction, since he had
          thus learned in God&#x27;s statutes something that was better to him
          than thousands of gold and silver. This was indeed an enlightened
          judgment for one to form, who had so small a part of the law of
          God&#x27;s mouth, and so large a portion of this world&#x27;s
          treasure. And yet, if we study only his book of Psalms to know the
          important uses and privileges of this law, and his son&#x27;s book of
          Ecclesiastes, to discover the real value of paltry gold and silver, we
          shall, under Divine teaching, be led to make the same estimate for
          ourselves. Yes, believer, with the same, or rather with far higher
          delight than the miser calculates his thousands of gold and silver, do
          you tell out the precious contents of the law of your God. After
          having endeavored in vain to count the thousands in your treasure, one
          single name sums up their value, &quot;the unsearchable riches of
          Christ.&quot; Would not the smallest spot of ground be estimated at
          thousands of gold and silver, were it known to conceal under its
          surface a mine of inexhaustible treasure? This it is that makes the
          word so inestimable. It is the field of the &quot;hidden
          treasure.&quot; &quot;The pearl of great price&quot; is known to be
          concealed here. You would not, therefore, part with one leaf of your
          Bible for all the thousands of gold and silver. You know yourself to
          be in possession of the substance—you have found all besides to be a
          shadow. &quot;I lead&quot;—says the Savior, &quot;in the way of
          righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment; that I may cause
          them that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their
          treasures.&quot; The grand motive, therefore, in &quot;searching the
          Scriptures,&quot; is because &quot;they testify of Christ.&quot; A
          sinner has but one want—a Savior. A believer has but one desire—to
          &quot;know and win Christ.&quot; With a &quot;single eye,&quot;
          therefore, intent upon one point, he studies this blessed book.
          &quot;With unveiled face he beholds in this glass the glory of the
          Lord:&quot; and no arithmetic can compute the price of that, which is
          now unspeakably better to him than the treasures of the earth.

        <p>
          Christian! bear your testimony to your supreme delight in the book of
          God. You have here opened the surface of much intellectual interest
          and solid instruction. But it is the joy that you have found in the
          revelation of the Savior, in His commands, in His promises, in His
          ways, that leads you to exclaim, &quot;More to be desired are they
          than gold, yes, than much fine gold!&quot; Yes, indeed—every promise—
          every declaration—centering in Him, is a pearl; and the word of God is
          full of these precious pearls. If then they be the richest who have
          the best and the largest treasure, those who have most of the word in
          their hearts, not those who have most of the world in their
          possession—are justly entitled to this preeminence. &quot;Let then the
          word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom.&quot; For those who
          are rich in this heavenly treasure are men of substance indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          True—this is a correct estimate of the worth of God&#x27;s law—better
          than this world&#x27;s treasure. But is it better to me? Is this my
          decided choice? How many will inconsiderately acknowledge its supreme
          value, while they yet hesitate to relinquish even a scanty morsel of
          earth for an interest in it! Do I then habitually prefer this law of
          God&#x27;s mouth to every worldly advantage? Am I ready to forego
          every selfish consideration, if it may only be the means of uniting my
          heart more closely to the Book of God? If this be not my practical
          conviction, I fear I have not yet opened the mine. But if I can assent
          to this declaration of the man of God, I have made a far more glorious
          discovery than Archimedes; and therefore may take up his expression of
          joyful surprise—&#x27;I have found it! I have found it!&#x27; What?
          That which the world could never have given me—that of which the world
          can never deprive me.
        </p>
        <p>
          And—Lord—help me to prize the law as coming from Your mouth. Let it be
          forever written upon my heart. Let me be daily exploring my hidden
          treasures. Let me be enriching myself and all around me with the
          present possession and interest in these heavenly blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet how affecting is it to see men poor in the midst of great riches!
          Often in the world we see the possessor of a large treasure—without a
          heart to enjoy it—virtually therefore a pauper. Oftener still in the
          Church do we see professors (may it not be so with some of us?) with
          their Bibles in their hands—yet poor even with the external interest
          in its &quot;unsearchable riches.&quot; Often also do we observe a
          want of value for the whole law or revelation of God&#x27;s mouth.
          Some parts are highly honored to the depreciation of the rest. But let
          it be remembered that the whole of Scripture &quot;is given by
          inspiration of God and is therefore profitable&quot; for its appointed
          end. Oh! beware of resting satisfied with a scanty treasure. Prayer
          and diligence will bring out not only &quot;things new,&quot; but the
          &quot;old&quot; also with a new and brighter glow. Scraping the
          surface is a barren exercise. Digging into the affections is a most
          enriching employ. No vein in this mine is yet exhausted. And rich
          indeed shall we be, if we gather only one atom of the gold each day in
          prayerful meditation. But as you value your progress and peace in the
          ways of God—as you have an eye to your Christian perfection—put away
          that ruinous thought—true as an encouragement to the weak, but false
          as an excuse to the slothful—that a little knowledge is sufficient to
          carry us to heaven.

          73. Your hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding,
          that I may learn Your commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the vast universe of wonder, man is the greatest wonder—the noblest
          work of God. A council of the Sacred Trinity was held respecting his
          creation, &quot;God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
          likeness.&quot; Every part of creation bears the impress of God.
          Man—man alone—bears His image, His likeness. Everywhere we see His
          track—His footsteps. Here we behold His face. What an amazing thought,
          that the three Eternal subsistents in the glorious Godhead, should
          have united in gracious design and operation towards the dust of the
          earth! But thus man was formed—thus was he raised out of his parent
          dust, from this low original, to be the living temple, and habitation
          of Divine glory—a Being full of God. The first moment that he opened
          his eyes to behold the light and beauty of the new-made world, the
          Lord separated him for His own service, to receive the continual
          supply of His own life. His body was fitted as a tabernacle for his
          soul, &quot;curiously wrought&quot; by the hand of God; and all its
          parts and &quot;members written in this book, which in continuance
          were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.&quot; Most
          naturally therefore does the contemplation of this &quot;perfection of
          beauty&quot; raise the adoring mind upward, &quot;I will praise You;
          for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are Your works; and
          that my soul knows right well.&quot; Your hands have made me and
          fashioned me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could we suppose that man was formed to eat, to sleep, and to
          die—that, after taking a few turns upon the grand walk of life, he was
          to descend into the world of eternal silence, we might well ask the
          question of God, &quot;Why have You made all men in vain?&quot; But
          the first awakening of man from his death-like sleep enlightens him in
          the right knowledge of the end of his creation. If I am conscious of
          being the workmanship of God, I shall feel my relationship to Him, and
          the responsibility of acting according to it. I would plead then this
          relation before Him in asking for light, life, and love. I cannot
          serve You as a creature, except I be made a new creature. Give me a
          spiritual being, without which my natural being cannot glorify You.
          You have indeed &quot;curiously wrought&quot; my frame; but sin has
          marred all. Make me Your spiritual &quot;workmanship, created in
          Christ Jesus.&quot; Give me understanding—spiritual knowledge, that I
          may learn Your commandments, &quot;Renew a right spirit within
          me.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the natural man feels no need of this prayer. No, he is puffed up
          in his own wisdom. He cannot receive the Divine testimony, which
          levels him, while he &quot;understands not,&quot; with &quot;the
          beasts that perish,&quot; and tells him, that he must &quot;become a
          fool, that he may be wise.&quot; But should he ever know his new state
          of existence, he will offer up this prayer eagerly and frequently; and
          every step of his way heavenward he will feel increasing need of
          Divine &quot;wisdom and spiritual understanding.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          How does the song of heaven remind us of this end of our creation!,
          &quot;You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power!
          for You have created all things; and for Your pleasure they are, and
          were created.&quot; In harmony with this song we must acknowledge,
          that the &quot;Lord has made all things for Himself&quot;—that He
          &quot;created all things for His glory.&quot; And the recollection
          that He &quot;created us by Jesus Christ,&quot; brings before us the
          grand work of redemption, and the work of the new creation consequent
          upon it. He who created us in His own image, when that image was lost,
          that He might not lose His property in us, put a fresh seal upon His
          natural right, and &quot;purchased us with His own blood.&quot; Oh!
          let us not be insensible to this constraining motive to learn His
          commandments. &quot;You are not your own, for you are bought with a
          price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which
          are God&#x27;s.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          74. Those who do fear You, will be glad when they see me: because I

        <p>
          How cheering is the sight of a man of God! How refreshing his
          converse! How satisfactory and enlivening is the exhibition of his
          faith! The goodness of God to one becomes thus the joy and comfort of
          all. What an excitement is this to close communion with our God, that
          the light which we thus receive will shine on those around us! What a
          comfort will it be even in our own hour of temptation, that the hope,
          which we may then be enabled to maintain in the word of God, shall
          prove the stay, not only of our own souls, but of the Lord&#x27;s
          people! Many a desponding Christian, oppressed with such fears as
          this, &quot;I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul&quot;—when he
          hears of one and another exercised in the same trials, and who have
          hoped in God&#x27;s word, and have not been disappointed, will be glad
          when he sees them. Thus David recorded his conflicts, that we may not
          despair of our own; and his triumphs, that &quot;in the name of our
          God we might set up our banners.&quot; &quot;I had fainted, unless I
          had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the
          living. Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and He shall strengthen
          your heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.&quot; Thus also, under
          affliction, he was comforted with the thought of comforting others
          with the history of his own experience, &quot;My soul shall make her
          boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. O
          praise the Lord with me, and let us magnify His name together. He has
          put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God. Many shall see it,
          and fear, and shall trust in the Lord. Bring my soul out of prison,
          that I may praise Your name; the righteous shall compass me about, for
          You shall deal bountifully with me.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In this view, the believer, who has been &quot;sifted in the
          sieve&quot; of temptation, without the least &quot;grain&quot; of
          faith or hope &quot;falling upon the earth,&quot; stands forth as a
          monument of the Lord&#x27;s faithfulness, to &quot;strengthen the weak
          hands, and confirm the feeble knees, and to say to them that are of
          fearful heart, Be strong, fear not.&quot; Those that are
          &quot;fearful, and of little faith,&quot; are glad when they see him.
          They &quot;thank God&quot; for him, and &quot;take courage&quot; for
          themselves. What a motive is this to keep us from despondency; that,
          instead of destroying by our unbelief, those who are already
          &quot;cast down,&quot; we may enjoy the privilege of upholding their
          confidence, and ministering to their comfort! And how should the weak
          and distressed seek for and prize the society of those, who have been
          instructed by the discipline of the Lord&#x27;s school!
        </p>
        <p>
          Believer! what have you to tell to your discouraged brethren of the
          faithfulness of your God? Cannot you put courage into their hearts, by
          declaring that you have never been &quot;ashamed of your hope?&quot;
          Cannot you tell them from your own experience, that Jesus &quot;is for
          a foundation-stone, a tried stone, a sure foundation?&quot; Cannot you
          show them, that, because He has borne the burden of their sins, He is
          able to &quot;bear their griefs, and to carry their sorrows?&quot;
          that you have tried Him, and that you have found Him so? Oh! be
          animated to know more of Christ yourself; let your hope in Him be
          strengthened, that you may cause gladness in the hearts of those that,
          see you; so that, &quot;whether you be afflicted, or whether you be
          comforted, it may be for their consolation and salvation.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But, O my God! how much cause have I for shame, that I impart so
          little of Your glorious light to those around me! Perhaps some poor
          trembling sinner has been glad when he saw me, hoping to hear
          something of the Savior from my lips, and has found me straitened, and
          cold, and dumb. Oh! that I may be so &quot;filled with the
          Spirit,&quot; so experienced in Your heavenly ways, that I may invite
          &quot;all that do not fear to come to me,&quot; that I may
          &quot;declare what You have done for my soul;&quot; so that,
          &quot;when men are cast down, they may say, There is lifting up.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          75. I know, O Lord, that Your judgments are right, and that You in
          faithfulness have afflicted me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the Christian&#x27;s acknowledgment—fully satisfied with the
          dispensation of God. This is his confidence—so invigorating to his own
          soul—so cheering to the church. The Lord&#x27;s dealings are called
          His judgments—not as having judicial curses, but as the acts of His
          justice in the chastening of sin. Perhaps also—as the administration
          of His wise judgments in their measure and application. But here is
          not only the confession of the Lord&#x27;s general judgment, but of
          His especial faithfulness to Himself. And this he knew—not from the
          dictates of the flesh (which would have given a contrary verdict), but
          from the testimony of the word, and the witness of his own experience.
          It could not be doubted—much less denied—&#x27;I know, O Lord, that
          Your rules of proceeding are agreeable to Your perfect justice and
          wisdom; and I am equally satisfied, that the afflictions that You have
          laid upon me from time to time, are only to fulfill Your gracious and
          faithful promise of making me eternally happy in Yourself.&#x27;
          Blessed fruit of affliction! when we can thus &quot;see the end of the
          Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy&quot;—that
          His &quot;thoughts towards us are thoughts of peace, and not of
          evil!&quot; &quot;The patience and faith of the saints&quot; teach
          this difficult but most consoling lesson, in deciphering the
          mysterious lines in God&#x27;s providence.

        <p>
          The child of God under the severest chastisement must acknowledge
          justice. Our gracious reward is always more—our &quot;punishment
          always less, than our iniquities deserve.&quot; &quot;Why should a
          living man complain?&quot; In trouble he is indeed—but not in hell. If
          he complain, let it be of none but himself, and his own wayward
          choice. I know, O Lord, that Your judgments are right—and who can
          doubt the wisdom? Who would charge the operator with cruelty, in
          cutting out the proud flesh, that was bringing death upon the man? Who
          would not acknowledge the right judgment of his piercing work? Thus,
          when the Lord&#x27;s painful work separates us from our sin, weans us
          from the world, and brings us nearer to Himself, what remains for us,
          but thankfully to acknowledge His righteousness and truth? Unbelief is
          put to rebuke; and we, if we have indulged suspicion &quot;that God
          has forgotten to be gracious,&quot; must confess, &quot;This is our
          infirmity.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This assurance of the Lord&#x27;s perfect justice, wisdom, and
          intimate knowledge of our respective cases, leads us to yield to His
          appointments in dutiful silence. Thus Aaron, under his most afflictive
          domestic calamity, &quot;held his peace.&quot; Job under a similar
          dispensation was enabled to say, &quot;The Lord gave, and the Lord has
          taken away: blessed be the name of the Lord!&quot; Eli&#x27;s language
          in the same trial was, &quot;It is the Lord; let Him do what seems Him
          good.&quot; David hushed his impatient spirit, &quot;I was dumb; I
          opened not my mouth, because You did it.&quot; And when Shimei cursed
          him, he said, &quot;Let him alone; let him curse; for the Lord has
          bidden him.&quot; The Shunammite, in the meek resignation of faith,
          acknowledged, &quot;It is well.&quot; Hezekiah kissed the rod, while
          it was smiting him to the dust, &quot;Good is the word of the Lord
          which You have spoken.&quot; Thus uniform is the language of the
          Lord&#x27;s people under chastisement—I know, O Lord, that Your
          judgments are right.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the confession of justice may be mere natural conviction. Faith
          goes further, and speaks of faithfulness. David not only acknowledges
          God&#x27;s right to deal with him as He saw fit, and even His wisdom
          in dealing with him as He actually had done, but His faithfulness in
          afflicting—not His faithfulness though He afflicted—but in afflicting
          him; not as if it were consistent with His love, but as the very fruit
          of His love. It is not enough to justify God. What abundant cause is
          there to praise Him! It is not enough to forbear to murmur. How
          exciting is the display of His faithfulness and love! Yes—the trials
          appointed for us are none else than the faithful performance of His
          everlasting engagements. And to this cause we may always trace (and it
          is our privilege to believe it, where we cannot visibly trace it) the
          reason of much that is painful to the flesh. Let us only mark its
          gracious effects in our restoration—instruction—healing of our
          backslidings, and the continual purging of sins—and then say—&#x27;Is
          not the faithfulness of God gloriously displayed?&#x27; The
          Philistines could not understand Samson&#x27;s riddle—how &quot;Meat
          could come out of the eater, and sweetness out of the strong.&quot; As
          little can the world comprehend the fruitfulness of the
          Christian&#x27;s trials; how his gracious Lord sweetens to him the
          bitter waters of Marah, and makes the cross not so much the punishment
          as the remedy of sin. He finds therefore no inclination, and he feels
          that he has no interest in having any change made in the Lord&#x27;s
          appointments, revolting as they may be to the flesh. He readily
          acknowledges that His merciful designs could not have been
          accomplished in any other way; while under trials many sweet tokens of
          love are given, which, under circumstances of outward prosperity,
          could not have been received with the same gratitude and delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          You that are living at ease in the indulgence of what this poor world
          can afford, how little does the Christian envy your portion! How
          surely in some future day will you be taught by experience to envy
          his! The world&#x27;s riches are daily becoming poorer, and its
          pleasures more tasteless; and what will they be, and how will they
          appear, when eternity is at hand! Whereas affliction is the special
          token of our Father&#x27;s love, conformity to the image of Jesus, and
          preparation for His service and kingdom. It is the only blessing that
          the Lord gives, without requiring us to ask for it. We receive it,
          therefore, as promised, not as threatened; and when the
          &quot;peaceable fruits of righteousness,&quot; which it works in
          God&#x27;s time and way, spring up in our hearts, humbly and
          gratefully will we acknowledge the righteousness of His judgments, and
          the faithfulness of His corrections.
