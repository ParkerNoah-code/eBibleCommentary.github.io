        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>
          This book, in the Hebrew copies of the Bible, and by the Jewish
          writers, is generally called Bereshith, which signifies "in the
          beginning", being the first word of it; as the other four books of
          Moses are also called from their initial words. In the Syriac and
          Arabic versions, the title of this book is "The Book of the Creation",
          because it begins with an account of the creation of all things; and
          is such an account, and so good an one, as is not to be met with
          anywhere else.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Greek version calls it Genesis, and so we and other versions from
          thence; and that because it treats of the generation of all things, of
          the heavens, and the earth, and all that are in them, and of the
          genealogy of men: it treats of the first men, of the patriarchs before
          the flood, and after it to the times of Joseph. It is called the
          "first" book of Moses, because there are four more that follow; the
          name the Jewish Rabbins give to the whole is "the five fifths of the
          law", to which the Greek word "pentateuch" answers; by which we
          commonly call these books, they being but one volume, consisting of
          five parts, of which this is the first.
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The design of which is to lead men into the knowledge and worship of
          the one true God, the Creator of all things, and of the origin of
          mankind, the fall of our first parents, and their posterity in them;
          and to point at the means and method of the recovery of man by the
          Messiah, the promised seed; and to give an account of the state and
          case of the church of God, in the times of the patriarchs, both before
          and after the flood, from Adam, in the line of Seth, to Noah; and from
          Noah to the times of Joseph, in whose death it ends.
        </p>

        <h2>Days of Creation</h2>
        <p>
          In the Hebrew Bible, "yôm" usually signifies a 24-hour day, though it
          can also mean an undefined time span or era. Exodus 20:11 reiterates
          the Genesis account using its same language, but Scripture does not
          give the length of time of the creation week anywhere. There are three
          primary views about the days of Genesis 1 that accept Genesis as
          history, describing events that happened:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The strictly literal interpretation is that of a creation period of
          six 24-hour days. A strictly literal interpretation of "day" is not
          inherently more spiritual or biblical, was not held by many different
          pre-scientific interpreters (e.g. Augustine), and has even been used
          to claim that Genesis is myth (e.g. James Barr). Features in the text
          of Genesis 1 like exalted prose, programmatic statements,
          dischronologization from Genesis 2:5, light before the luminaries,
          days before the sun, and a topically ordered week may point to the
          fact that a strickly literal account is not what the author intended
          to give.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Day-Age view interprets "day" as symbolic language of an
          arbitrary long period of time. This view may risk prioritizing
          scientific concordance over contextual language understanding (e.g.
          the phrase at the end of each day, "there was evening, and there was
          morning"). Moreover, even though the age of the earth on this view
          corresponds to current scientific theories, the description of
          creation during each age does not. For example, there would have to be
          a whole age in which vegetation was brought about before the sun,
          moon, and stars were even created.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Framework or Literary view of "day" focuses on the worldview
          that the Genesis creation week presents. A literary reading views the
          seven 24-hour days of creation as an analogy for God's historical act
          of creating rather than a strickly literal historical, chronological,
          or scientific account. Creation is portrayed in three parts,
          preparation days (1-3), population days (4-6), and God's day of rest
          (7). The narrative identifies God as the all-powerful Creator and
          Judge of everything who is actively involved in creation and
          established the work-rest pattern for the human workweek.
        </p>
        <h2>Age of the Universe</h2>
        <p>
          Scripture nowhere attemps to give an age of the universe or the earth.
          There are three primary views about the age of the earth:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Young Earth Creationism depends on adding up genealogical records
          given in Genesis to arrive at a relatievly recent date of creation.
          However, the biblical authors freely skip links in genealogies: Jesus
          is said to be the son of David and Abraham, Matthew in his genealogy
          skips Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah and says that Joram begot his
          great-great-grandson Uzziah to reach three tables of fourteen
          generations, so estimating a duration of time during the two tables of
          ten generations in Genesis 5 and 11 appears unjustified. Moreover, the
          fact that there is strong scientific evidence against this view from
          the dating of meteorites based on radioactive decay, the rate of the
          expansion of the universe traced backwards, massive numbers of craters
          on various moons, estimates based on the speed of light from the
          furthest stars, many layered rock sedimentation, and more should
          caution anyone against forcing this interpretation into the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Gap Theory suggests a temporal gap between the first two verses
          of Genesis. It proposes an initial perfect creation by God (1:1),
          followed by a catastrophic event leading to a formless and void Earth
          (1:2)—attributed to Satan's fall or a cosmic battle—resulting in a gap
          of undefined duration where geological and fossil records were formed.
          The subsequent verses are seen as God's re-creation or restoration of
          the Earth. However, the Hebrew waw-consecutive construction used here
          does not support a gap as it typically indicates a narrative sequence
          rather than a disjunctive or parenthetical statement. Instead of
          describing restoration, Genesis 1:3 and on appears to be describing
          creation which is good, not fallen. While the precense of Satan in
          Eden is not explained, reading a cosmic battle or Satan's fall into
          that gap seems unwarranted. The phrase "formless and void" (tohu
          wa-bohu), which some gap theorists use to suggest a post-catastrophe
          scenario (e.g. The Scofield Reference Bible), is instead likely
          describing an unfinished, uninhabited Earth in its primordial state.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Old Earth Creationism adherents generally follow the Gap Theory,
          the Day-Age view, or the Framework view. They do not hold that the
          biblical account provides any basis for determining that age, so the
          age of the universe in this view is based purely on a range of
          scientific evidence, including geological data, radiometric dating,
          and astronomical observations. This position does not demand adherence
          to a certain view of evolution, the non-historicity of Adam, or a
          mythic view of Genesis. Many faithful interpreters have held this view
          (e.g. Spurgeon, Bavinck, Warfield).
