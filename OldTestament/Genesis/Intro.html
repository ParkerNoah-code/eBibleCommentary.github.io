        <h2>Days of Creation</h2>
        <p>
          In the Hebrew Bible, "yôm" usually signifies a 24-hour day, though it
          can also mean an undefined time span or era. Exodus 20:11 reiterates
          the Genesis account using its same language, but Scripture does not
          give the length of time of the creation week anywhere. There are three
          primary views about the days of Genesis 1 that accept Genesis as
          history, describing events that happened:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The strictly literal interpretation is that of a creation period of
          six 24-hour days. A strictly literal interpretation of "day" is not
          inherently more spiritual or biblical, was not held by many different
          pre-scientific interpreters (e.g. Augustine), and has even been used
          to claim that Genesis is myth (e.g. James Barr). Features in the text
          of Genesis 1 like exalted prose, programmatic statements,
          dischronologization from Genesis 2:5, light before the luminaries,
          days before the sun, and a topically ordered week may point to the
          fact that a strickly literal account is not what the author intended
          to give.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Day-Age view interprets "day" as symbolic language of an
          arbitrary long period of time. This view may risk prioritizing
          scientific concordance over contextual language understanding (e.g.
          the phrase at the end of each day, "there was evening, and there was
          morning"). Moreover, even though the age of the earth on this view
          corresponds to current scientific theories, the description of
          creation during each age does not. For example, there would have to be
          a whole age in which vegetation was brought about before the sun,
          moon, and stars were even created.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The framework or literary view of "day" focuses on the worldview
          that the Genesis creation week presents. A literary reading views the
          seven 24-hour days of creation as an analogy for God's historical act
          of creating rather than a strickly literal historical, chronological,
          or scientific account. Creation is portrayed in three parts,
          preparation days (1-3), population days (4-6), and God's day of rest
          (7). The narrative identifies God as the all-powerful Creator and
          Judge of everything who is actively involved in creation and
          established the work-rest pattern for the human workweek.
        </p>
        <h2>Age of the Universe</h2>
        <p>
          Scripture nowhere attemps to give an age of the universe or the earth.
          There are three primary views about the age of the earth:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Young earth creationists depend on adding up genealogical records
          given in Genesis to arrive at a relatievly recent date of creation.
          However, the biblical authors freely skip links in genealogies, so the
          young earth view has no biblical support: Jesus is said to be the son
          of David and Abraham, Matthew in his genealogy skips Ahaziah, Joash,
          and Amaziah and says that Joram begot his great-great-grandson Uzziah
          to reach three tables of fourteen generations, and so estimating a
          duration of time during the two tables of ten generations in Genesis 5
          and 11 is completely unjustified. Moreover, the fact that there is
          strong scientific evidence against this view from the dating of
          meteorites based on radioactive decay, the rate of the expansion of
          the universe traced backwards, massive numbers of craters on various
          moons, estimates based on the speed of light from the furthest stars,
          many layered rock sedimentation, and more should caution anyone
          against forcing this interpretation into the Bible. Instead, it should
          be argued on scientific grounds.
