<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>The Tribe of REUBEN</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858<i><br/> <br/>    "Let Reuben live and not die—and let not his men be 
    few."</i> Deut. 33:6</p>
<p align="justify">Reuben was Jacob's firstborn. From him one section of the 
    Jewish nation sprang. One tribe called him their father. When these words 
    were uttered by Moses, the patriarch Jacob had long been numbered with the 
    dead. But his descendants had reached Canaan's border—a mighty portion of a 
    mighty people.</p>
<p align="justify">Let every father, who reads this, reflect <i>what 
    multitudes may flow from him. </i>He may be seed of a vast forest of 
    immortal plants. From him, as center, wide circles may expand. Children's 
    children may be a swelling stream. By prayer, then, let him bequeath to each 
    this Reuben-blessing. Let his lips often ask, that each may live, an heir of 
    grace—that none may die the death of never-ending woe.</p>
<p align="justify">Recall the day, when Moses thus spoke. His eager wings 
    were spread to fly from earth. His noble race was run. His valiant fight was 
    fought. His place—so profitably filled—must now be vacant. The 
    people—served so long—must see his face no more.</p>
<p align="justify">God in His providence calls faithful men to guide, and 
    teach, and rule His flock. When His designs are ripe, He brings them forth, 
    as the fit instruments. But their allotted course must have its end. Their 
    longest space is brevity. While they are spared, let their good help be 
    prized. Let them be honored—for honor is their due. Let them be loved—they 
    are entitled to affectionate requital. But they go hence. All flesh is 
    grass. God alone, never fails.</p>
<p align="justify">But of the men, who have done service in their day, where 
    can be found the peer of Moses? He has pre-eminence, which few have reached. 
    He has renown, which outshines every fame. His life was a grand blessing. 
    His parting words are blessing. Living and dying, he is a tree, whose 
    branches drop good fruit.</p>
<p align="justify">He long had toiled for Israel's welfare. And now his 
    closing eye looks with intense affection on each tribe. He sees by faith 
    their vast inheritance of mercies—and his last breath delights to draw the 
    chart.</p>
<p align="justify">In this we have the very spirit of Salvation's Captain. 
    Jesus left heaven—assumed our flesh—dwelt on this earth, that He might 
    bless. When the redeeming price was paid, He ascended in the attitude and 
    act of blessing. And from His throne, His glory-life is ever the self-same 
    employ. He is one eternal—unfathomable—ever-flowing blessing. As from the 
    sun light only streams, so from Him one flood of good descends.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, pause at this point, and meditate your high 
    distinction. You, too, are filled, that you may be enabled to dispense. You 
    are enriched, that you may help. Doubtless, exalted station and vast talents 
    enlarge the hands of usefulness. In this respect all may not stand on the 
    same vantage-ground. All are not called, as Moses, to rule tribes. But all 
    may strive to follow him by living a blessing life—by dying a blessing 
    death.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us draw nearer now to his amazing legacy of blessing. 
    The first view shows the last testament of Moses, as enumerating earthly 
    treasures of honor—excellence—pre-eminence—abundance.</p>
<p align="justify">The happy tribes are here endowed, as rich, renowned, and 
    mighty upon earth. Splendor and prowess are their promised crown. Their sons 
    are to surpass in arts and arms. Their fields shall wave with all 
    luxuriance. But beneath this outward mantle, faith sees the inner form of 
    better and more lasting gifts. The farewell words begin, indeed, with 
    time-estate; but they conclude not there. They are a ladder set on earth, 
    but mounting to the skies. These images have wide-spreading meaning. The 
    truth, which runs throughout, looks to eternal good. The real substance is 
    not of the earth, and earthly—it is of heaven, and heavenly.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus, of the eldest, it is said, "Let Reuben live and not 
    die—and let not his men be few." We instantly are led to remember this 
    tribe's exposed position. It stands a frontier-barrier. Thus it lies open to 
    the onset of invading foes. There is then danger, that it may soon be 
    trodden down—that hostile attack may lay it low—that it may dwindle and 
    become extinct. But let Reuben live—live a vast host. The blessing, at 
    first, seems a shield against diminishing catastrophe.</p>
<p align="justify">But this is only the first fold. As we unwrap the words, 
    the better portion is discerned. This is the surface; as we descend, a mine 
    of richer ore is found. This is the shell—a precious kernel is within. A 
    life is intimated longer than temporal—even reaching through eternal time. 
    A death is here deprecated, worse than the body mouldering in dust—even 
    soul-ruin. The multitudinous increase here mentioned foreshows the 
    innumerable throng around the throne of God and of the Lamb.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus the true significance of the Reuben-blessing unfolds 
    a threefold joy. <br/>    1. Life for evermore, and heaven won. <br/>    2. Death abolished, 
    and hell escaped. <br/>    3. The expansive circle of the countless congregation of 
    the saved.</p>
<p align="justify">Next we must banish far the narrow thought, that this 
    inheritance was limited to Reuben's tribe. It is no by-gone wish. Far 
    otherwise. It stands a wide-spreading oak, beneath which saints of every age 
    may happily repose. It flows a ceaseless stream, from which God's sons may 
    ever drink. Reuben's hand plucked the earliest produce, but still the flower 
    blooms, the fragrance sweetens, and the ripe fruit courts our touch.</p>
<p align="justify">Behold, then, here is the heart—the mind—the will of 
    God, to all the chosen seed. Here is no partial legacy only to the elders of 
    the house. Succeeding children may claim it too. We have this explanation 
    recorded by the Spirit's pen. The Gospel principle is, "If you are Christ's, 
    then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Gal. 3:29. 
    Faith here obtains a key—and by it enters the spiritual treasury of ancient 
    promise. The blessings are all free to all the family of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, now draw near. Hear Moses' voice, as if 
    addressed directly to yourself. It tells the blood-bought portion of all 
    Christ's family. It shows your vast inheritance—your golden wealth. To 
    every one the legacy is left, Let this man live, and not die. Of the 
    redeemed it is immutably decreed, Let not their men be few. </p>
<p align="justify">Come, then, and with appropriating faith review the 
    wondrous gifts. Life—soul life—first shows its head. "Let Reuben live." 
    How grand this mercy! <i>All men are spiritually dead-born. </i>Sin entered 
    with a murderous hand. It planted deep its dagger in the inner man. 
    Knowledge of God—love of His name—delight in holy communion—sweet 
    fellowship with heaven—the happy worship of unsullied praise—the blissful 
    gaze on the Creator's smile, and all the circle of pure joy, were buried in 
    a deep grave. The soul became a total wreck—a withered tree—a dried-up 
    stream—a wilderness of weeds—a starless night—a chaos of beclouded 
    thought—a rebel's camp—the shattered home of misery—the region in which 
    death reigned. The eyes were dim and saw not God. The face was turned away. 
    Each step led downward. The hands were lifted in defiance. The mouth was 
    opened to blaspheme. Man was a dying body holding a dead soul. He moved an 
    unmixed evil—a sin-spreading pest. All this is sad—but there are sadder 
    things behind. This is tremendous woe—but deeper woe comes on. This is dark 
    night—but darker shades will deepen yet. This is full wretchedness—but 
    still the cup may hold more drops.</p>
<p align="justify">This fleeting scene must end. The earthly mansion must be 
    left. Death comes. It drives poor sinners to their final home. And what is 
    that? Reader, shrink not—withdraw the darksome veil. Look down into the 
    dread abode. Ponder the lost in their low cells. Hell is their everlasting 
    doom. Do not think that hell is the mere phantom of a brain-sick thought. It 
    is no fable fondly framed to scare weak minds. It is a near reality. It is a 
    gigantic certainty. It is the sure conclusion of a godless life. It is the 
    gulf, to which transgressing streams rush hopelessly. And it is not far 
    away. It gapes before the feet. Another step may plunge the ruined into this 
    abyss. </p>
<p align="justify">But what is hell? Ah! reader, may you never know. It is 
    described by what is absent—what is present. </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>negative misery</i> declares, that God is not 
    there. It is "everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and 
    from the glory of His power." 2 Thess. 1:9. Where God is absent, there is no 
    light—no joy—no pure repose of heart. But in that darkness God is never 
    seen. Therefore all is one blank of dreary wretchedness.</p>
<p align="justify">The faithful word moreover brings to view mountains upon 
    mountains of <i>active torment</i>. From this immensity of agony let one 
    element be drawn. The tender Jesus thus describes the end. "The Son of Man 
    shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather, out of His kingdom all 
    things, that offend, and them, which do iniquity—and shall cast them into a 
    furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth." Matt. 13:41, 
    42. Fire shows pain's uttermost extreme. It has a pungent sting, maddening 
    with all that is most hotly fierce. Hence hell is agony in all its might. 
    Wailing denotes the bitter grief. Gnashing of teeth proclaims the deep 
    remorse. And, as the suffering proceeds, it swells. There is no distant ray 
    of possible relief. Forever will the smoke ascend. Forever will the anguish 
    burn. Forever will the misery endure.</p>
<p align="justify">Eternal is hell's night. Such is it to lack life. Such is 
    it to be heir of death.</p>
<p align="justify">But hearken, you, who through rich mercy yet inhabit 
    earth. A voice cries, "Let Reuben live and not die." There is a Savior, who 
    delivers from this death. There is a friend, who bestows heavenly life. 
    Jesus appears, and on the cross endures the death, and by His righteousness 
    brings in new life. The Father fully satisfied, says of each true Reuben, 
    "Deliver him from going down to the pit, for I have found a ransom." Let him 
    not die, but live.</p>
<p align="justify">But what is this life? Believer, you must enter heaven to 
    know. We read—we speak—we meditate—we hear of heaven; and bright and 
    lovely is the prospect. But what thoughts—what words can estimate the 
    actual bliss! Sin and temptation are outside forever. God and the God-man 
    are there clearly displayed. There is no cloud—no veil—no distance—no 
    separation—no departure. The ransomed, ever happy, ever hymning praise, 
    float on wide oceans of delight.</p>
<p align="justify">And are there <i>many</i> joying in this joy? "Let not 
    his men be few." The Father's love—the Savior's grace—the Spirit's 
    tenderness are large, and embrace many. A great multitude, whom no man can 
    number, shout hallelujahs round the throne.</p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, seek to inherit Reuben's blessing. Give up all 
    for heaven. It will immeasurably repay each sacrifice. The door is not yet 
    barred. Press to enter in. Take it by violence. Jesus is the way. Walk in 
    it. Jesus holds the key. Flee unto Him, and He will open wide the gates. He 
    has spoken, and it must be—"Him that comes to Me, I will in nowise cast 
    out." John 6:37. Many of Israel's true children there rejoice—will not you 
    be among them? Draw life and energy from the partriarchal promise, "Let 
    Reuben live and not die—and let not his men be few." Rest not, until you 
    can say, "Through grace, I live—through grace, I shall not die—through 
    grace, I have my lot among the sons, who are not few."</p>
