<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE PROPHET</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858<i><br/> <br/>    "The Lord your God will raise up for you a <b>prophet</b> 
    like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him."</i> Deut. 
    18:15</p>
<p align="justify">All fullness dwells in Christ. Reader, come 
    ponder—praise—admire—adore Him. Those who know Him, never can commend 
    enough. Ignorance alone neglects—despises—disesteems Him.</p>
<p align="justify">The neediest of needy sinners find all supply in Him. He 
    is salvation's overflowing well. He fills all vessels, so that they can hold 
    no more. He is a treasure-house, in which gold never fails.</p>
<p align="justify">Let the surface of this truth be touched. You are 
    sin-soiled. Here is a fountain of all-cleansing blood. Wash, and be whiter, 
    than the spotless snow. Satan, and SELF, and life-long trespasses condemn 
    you. Here is Jesus' wounded side, presenting an acquitting plea. Your best 
    obedience is a filthy rag. Here is the righteousness of God—a perfect 
    covering—a glorious robe. Your <i>heart</i> by nature is a lifeless stone. 
    Christ sends His Spirit, and the entrance is life. He is a PRIEST, offering 
    His blood—living to intercede—pouring down blessings. He is a KING—ruling 
    above—within—around. He is a <b>PROPHET</b>, giving all knowledge—leading 
    in wisdom's paths—diffusing floods of light—teaching salvation's lessons.</p>
<p align="justify">It is this latter office, which now claims special 
    thought. Let us approach it by enquiring, what man's state must be, unless 
    rays beam from heaven?</p>
<p align="justify">When sin invaded earth, knowledge of God was slain. That 
    lovely plant was blighted to the root. That beauteous column fell a 
    shattered ruin. The mind lost power to fly aloft. Its wings were clipped. 
    The eye was dim to pierce the skies. The wish and skill to find out God were 
    utterly extinct. Man's intellect—alert to grovel in the dust—could never 
    scale this height. Here mental shrewdness slobbered, as a fool. Witness the 
    silly failures of philosophy's most boasted efforts. </p>
<p align="justify">Unless, then, some revelation had been given, God and His 
    essence must have been shrouded in impenetrable night. Man could not dig 
    such a jewel out of his own quarry. He could not find it in his own empty 
    chambers. Along a brief career of blindness he must have gone down to that 
    deep prison-house, where darkness ever darkens, and God is never seen. The 
    world by wisdom knows not God.</p>
<p align="justify">The case of need, then, is most clear. But all is met by 
    Jesus. He undertakes to save, and undertakes to teach. The Church's Savior 
    is the Church's Prophet. He is not slow to enter on His work. In Eden's 
    garden, where the light expired, He strikes a new spark. There He is quick 
    to speak of <i>remedy</i> and <i>rescue</i>—of a woman-born Savior—and His 
    final triumphs. As time rolls on, He adds fresh light. By types, by 
    prophecies, by figures, and by signs, He pictures redemption. He raises holy 
    men, and puts His words into their mouths. He shakes a torch of truth in the 
    world's night. He shows His Calvary through vistas of long time—and so 
    guides many a benighted pilgrim in the path to heaven. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus the Prophet's voice is early heard—the Prophet's 
    school is early open. But in appointed time, the Prophet-God must come in 
    person. Moses thus states the fact. <i>"The Lord your God will raise up for 
    you a <b>prophet</b> like me from among your own brothers. You must listen 
    to him."</i> Let us now mark the marvelous fulfillment.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. Our Prophet shall be of our brethren—one of our 
    house.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here is considerate wisdom. If He were solely God, His 
    mission must be death, not life. Humanity must perish at the sight. If He 
    stooped only to angelic order, how could He mix with inhabitants of earth? 
    How could we hang upon His lips? But our Prophet truly is man. He dwelt here 
    as one of our family. He hid His glories in our tent of clay. He trod life's 
    walk, as our very brother. Therefore, with fearless love, we may approach. 
    We may sit down, with Mary, at His feet. We may recline, with John, upon His 
    breast. As the disciples on the way to Emmaus, we may cling to His side. We 
    may confidingly disclose the history of our souls. A brother will not scorn 
    a brother's tale. When we seek counsel, He will gladly—fully—tenderly 
    impart. As a near kinsman, He invites, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of 
    me, for I am meek and lowly in heart—and you shall find rest unto your 
    souls." Matt. 11:29.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>2. But more. The Prophet shall not be only man. </b>He shall 
    be man <i>marked with a wondrous sign. </i>He shall appear as ANOTHER MOSES. 
    Israel's leader shall revive in Him. As face to face, He shall respond to a 
    conspicuous type.</p>
<p align="justify">This similitude must now be traced. The search, amid a 
    mass of profit, distinctly proves, that an omniscient mind pervades all 
    revelation's story. No 'mere chance' could frame a close resemblance between 
    distant men. Infidelity cannot maintain such folly. Christ, then, <i>
    foreshown</i> as Moses, <i>coming</i> as Moses, stamps His commission with a 
    divine seal. In Him this type is realized—and in Him alone. For until He 
    appeared, there was no counterpart to Moses. Since He ascended, none such 
    has arisen. </p>
<p align="justify">See, how the pictures correspond. <b>Moses is</b> <b>born</b>. 
    No peaceful cradle rocks the child. No mother's arms securely clasp him. A 
    tyrant dooms him to immediate grave. He is cast to the Nile's waves. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Jesus is born.</b> He, too, reposes in no tranquil home. No 
    rapturous welcomes greet the heaven-sent babe. In Herod another Pharaoh 
    plots. Massacre casts a wide-spread net to catch Him. Thus He is Moses-like 
    in early persecution.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Moses at the appointed time goes forth from Egypt</p></b>. 
    Jesus is banished to the selfsame spot, that out of Egypt God may call His 
    Son. Hos. 11:1. Egypt sends out the human type. The heavenly antitype leaves 
    the same country.
<b>
<p align="justify">When Moses hastens to avenge his nation, what is his 
    welcome? </p></b>It is rejection. Derision scorns his claims. Jesus, the mighty 
    Savior, comes. There is deliverance in His heart and in His hand. But His 
    own receive Him not. He is despised and reviled. The cry pursues Him, 'Away 
    with Him, Away with Him!' Jesus and Moses are alike thrust out.
<b>
<p align="justify">Moses retires awhile.</p></b> The wilderness conceals him. At 
    last, as the sun issuing from a cloud, he breaks from darkness. Thus Jesus 
    passes many years in deep seclusion. Unknown in Nazareth the God-man toils. 
    Earthly obscurity could not be more obscure.
<b>
<p align="justify">When Moses shows himself again, astounding wonders prove 
    his high commission. </p></b>Nature at his command changes its course. Prodigies 
    attest, that God is with him. So Jesus moved as God on earth. He willed, and 
    the blind saw—the deaf heard—the dumb spoke—the dead lived—each form of 
    sickness fled—abundance fed the hungry crowds—the water turned to 
    wine—the sea became a pavement for His feet. In form He stood as man. In 
    power He worked as God.
<b>
<p align="justify">Moses must die before the people can pass Jordan's 
    waters.</p></b> He must endure a signal penalty for his offence. And must not 
    Jesus die, before His people can pass heaven's gates? Yes. Their vile sins 
    were all on Him, and on the cross due suffering must be paid. As Moses was 
    at birth—in life—in death—so Jesus at birth—in life—in death, 
    responded.
<b>
<p align="justify">Moses mediated between heaven and earth. </p></b>From the 
    mount he brought down God's commands. He offered Israel's prayers. He made 
    intercession and prevailed. Thus Jesus is our great intercessor. He 
    represents His children before God. He represents our God to us. He gives 
    the Gospel-law. He ever prays, and ever is He heard.
<b>
<p align="justify">Moses was favored with most close communion. </p></b>While 
    dreams and visions taught the other seers, God communed with Moses face to 
    face. Thus Jesus in counsel—purpose—will—ever was Jehovah's fellow. From 
    all eternity He was "by Him, as one brought up with Him, and He was daily 
    His delight, rejoicing always before Him." Prov. 8:30. All salvation's 
    scheme was spread as a chart before Him.
<p align="justify">Such is the resemblance. But the DIFFERENCE is infinite. 
    Moses is but a twilight gleam. Our Jesus is the midday splendor. Moses is a 
    tiny rill. Our Jesus is the shoreless ocean. Moses appears a little bud. 
    Jesus is the full fragrance of the opened flower.</p>
<p align="justify">From contemplation of these outward signs, let us now 
    enter within <b>THE PROPHET'S SCHOOL</b>—and drink in His amazing lessons. 
    What grand instructions meet us! Behold! His mighty hands draw back the 
    curtain, which hides God. He holds a text-book, bright with saving truth. 
    This text-book is His own cross. <b>Jehovah</b> is there displayed as loving 
    sinners, and yet hating sin—just, yet forgiving—righteous, yet 
    pardoning—holy, yet peopling heaven from unholy earth.</p>
<p align="justify">The Prophet leads onward to knowledge of <b>Himself</b>. 
    He bids faith come, and read His heart. There are the names of all His 
    chosen seed indelibly inscribed. There is love, preceding and out-living 
    time. He shows the virtue of His blood to obliterate the crimson dye—to 
    wash out deepest stains of guilt—so to pay debts, that Justice has no 
    further claim—so to acquit, that accusations cease. Wondrous lesson! It 
    calms the conscience into peace. It kindles the flame of love. It changes 
    the whole heart into devoted service.</p>
<p align="justify">He teaches the marvel of <b>His righteousness</b>—a robe 
    so bright, that God Himself cannot sufficiently admire—so pure, that angels 
    are unclean beside it. He assures, that His redeemed may take it—plead 
    it—wear it. He tells of His prevailing prayer—ever encircling the 
    mercy-seat. He teaches faith to hear its constant cry, Father forgive them, 
    for my blood is shed—spare them, for I have suffered—remember the 
    Covenant, and pour all blessings on them.</p>
<p align="justify">Lessons are added revealing the <b>Spirit's grace</b>. He 
    melts the stony heart. He turns the perverse will. He stills the 
    rebel-passions. He opens the blind eye to see that sight of sights—the 
    Christ of God. He opens the deaf ear to hear the music of that voice—Come 
    unto Me.</p>
<p align="justify">The Prophet teaches, too, <b>the righteous path, which 
    leads to Zion's rest.</b> He tells, how saints obey and please their God. He 
    imprints the truth, that holiness is evidence of faith—and that the living 
    tree must bear good fruit. Such is a scanty outline of the Prophet's 
    lessons.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, do you eagerly exclaim, I sincerely would be a 
    pupil! Then take up your Bible. Here Christ comes to teach. Throughout it 
    His voice sounds. He speaks in every verse. Make it your constant study. 
    Think every hour to be lost, in which you glean not from it. Draw near with 
    reverence, as to a speaking God. The ground is holy, let no proud thoughts 
    intrude. Approach with prayer, beseeching the Prophet to cause His Spirit to 
    illumine the page. Approach with faith, not doubting, that your soul will 
    thrive. Call on Him to fulfill His office. Tell Him your ignorance and 
    ardent thirst to learn. He will be true. He will instruct you unto profit. 
    All Zion's "children shall be taught of God." Join then the happy scholars 
    of this school. These lessons cast out every care. They are eternal life. 
    They work conformity to heavenly image. <i>As we imbibe His truth, our souls 
    put on His image.</i></p>

<p align="justify">You ministers, it is your work to propagate the lessons 
    of this school. Come then to Christ for every thought. Obtain from Him your 
    every word. Let your instructions always echo Him. Sad! when a teacher 
    stands before his flock to <i>un</i>say what the Lord has said—to 
    contradict His simple verities—to set some fiction in the place of 
    truth—to scatter base coin in the room of gold. Beware! beware! Let all 
    your sermons flow in the one channel, "Thus says the Lord." In every pulpit 
    let the great Prophet's voice be clearly heard.</p>
