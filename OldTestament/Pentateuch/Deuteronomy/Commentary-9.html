<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE LION TRIBES</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858<i><br/> <br/>    "Of Gad he said, Blessed be he, that enlarges Gad—he 
    dwells, as a lion." "And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp."</i> Deut. 
    33:20, 22.</p>
<p align="justify">Moses said this about the tribe of <b>Gad</b>: "Blessed 
    is the one who enlarges Gad's territory! Gad is poised there like a lion to 
    tear off an arm or a head.</p>
<p align="justify">Moses said this about the tribe of <b>Dan</b>: "Dan is a 
    lion's cub, leaping out from Bashan." Deut. 33:20, 22</p>
<p align="justify">Our God omits no mode to impress holy lessons on His 
    children's hearts. At one time <i>simple precepts</i> manifest His will—and 
    plain injunctions guide to duty's path. Now, nature's volume lends <i>
    similitudes</i>. We learn to avoid evil—to seek ornaments of grace—from 
    objects open to our sense.</p>
<p align="justify">There is much wisdom in this figurative teaching. It 
    speaks a language known in every climate. It introduces thoughts alike 
    familiar in the scholar's hall, and in the poor man's cottage. It strikes a 
    note, which every class, and state, and grade have ears to hear.</p>
<p align="justify">Examples throng the Bible-page. Thus <i>lambs</i>, which 
    innocently sport, are chosen, as fit emblems of meek humility and gentle 
    patience. The <i>serpent's</i> subtlety supplies the pattern of 
    intelligence—"Be wise, as serpents." The <i>dove</i> adjoins the model of 
    sweet inoffensiveness—"And harmless, as doves." The <i>eagle's</i> lofty 
    flight teaches, how faith should soar on high—"Those who wait on the Lord, 
    shall renew their strength—they shall mount up with wings, as eagles." Is. 
    40:31. To inculcate courage, and a noble front, the <i>Lion</i> shows its 
    form. And that the lesson should take deeper root, two Tribes illustrate it. 
    Gad "dwells, as a Lion." "Dan is a Lion's cub."</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, this picture has a voice—at all times 
    needed—and not least so in our compromising day. Hear it. And may the 
    mighty Spirit help you, while you listen, to put on strength, as a belt, and 
    courage, as a heroic panoply! The Lion is the forest's <b>KING</b>. He moves 
    pre-eminent above all beasts. He is as monarch among lower tribes. 
    Superiority is his conceded right.</p>
<p align="justify">Such is the Christian's stand among earth's sons. It is a 
    mighty word—"He has made us kings and priests unto God and His Father." 
    Rev. 1:6. It is a glorious title—"You are a chosen generation—a royal 
    priesthood." 1 Pet. 2:9.</p>
<p align="justify">The mass of human race reach not this rank. They raise 
    not this elevated brow. They show not this princely demeanor. Their tastes 
    are groveling and vile. They only care to sip the vulgar cup of time and 
    sense. Their sin-soiled garments and polluted feet prove, that they wallow 
    in defiling mire. Even liberty is unknown. The clash of heavy chains attests 
    their bondage. Satan drags them—and they must obey. The world gives 
    laws—they tremblingly submit. They crouch the slaves of many an insulting 
    tyrant.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, you only are the freedman of the Lord. You have 
    found liberty in Christ. "If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free 
    indeed." John 8:36. You serve a Prince, who calls His subjects to be kings. 
    You are a royal citizen of heaven. Then live as heir of glory. Walk 
    Lion-like in holy majesty of grace.</p>
<p align="justify">We thus are led to mark the glory of this kingly animal. 
    It is his strength and courage.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. Strength.</p></b> His sinews are as iron. His limbs are 
    braced with might. All, who resist him, fall an easy prey. To him to fight 
    is victory. Assailed, he vanquishes. Assailing, he subdues. Throughout the 
    plain—the forest—and the hill, there is no power, which can match with 
    his.
<p align="justify">Here, again, is the believer's image. He is endued with 
    inward prowess. But this is not poor nature's gift. All enter life 
    alike—feeble in heart, in spirit, in resolve. All are the victims of an 
    enervating sickness—sin. This plague weakens, as a palsy. It undermines the 
    total fabric. The inner man, under its touch, is worthless, as a tottering 
    reed—a broken bow—a quivering leaf—the empty chaff—the bubble's froth.</p>
<p align="justify">What has sin done? Ruin follows in its rear. Through it, 
    the vessel, once so noble, crumbles as a wreck—the tree, once so stately, 
    lies low—the fortress, once so strong, is robbed of gates—spoilers may 
    enter—none drives them back.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, I appeal to you. You alone are able to reply. 
    Are these dark colors darker than the truth? Look back. Let unregenerate 
    days tell their sad tale. What was your unconverted state? Had you ability 
    to vanquish evil? Did you present indomitable front against the enemy's 
    attacks? Did you stand firm, as adamantine rock, against the lashing surges 
    of iniquity? Conscious memory and downcast shame confess, no strength was in 
    you.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the common case throughout our race, until help 
    comes from heaven. How easy is the proof! How sad! Take any worldling. A 
    temptation meets him. A gilded bait allures. A sweet indulgence opens its 
    inviting arms. What follows? The silly moth is caught. Pleasure whispers, 
    'Come and partake'. Desire acquiesces. Nature surrenders. No godly principle 
    forbids. Conscience is mute. Thus yielding frailty proves, how frail is man. 
    Thus Satan leads his crowds down misery's downward slope. 
    Quickly—easily—they glide along. The rolling pebble has no power to stop. 
    The sinking vessel has no buoyancy to rise. The downhill torrent is 
    incapable of turning.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is the one reply to the inquiry—<i>'Why is this 
    world such a wide sea of evil? Why do earth's multitudes roll so easily to 
    hell?'</i> Satan assails and wins. The weak heart weakly yields. The 
    mind—the passions—lack firmness to resist. Thus the strong foe takes 
    strengthless man a captive at his will.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, I look again to you. Is such your present case? 
    I mark the grateful adoration of your soul. I hear your praises swelling to 
    the skies. I see your eye sparkling with thanksgiving love. You testify, 
    "Once I was feeble, as feebleness can be. Weakness is a weak description of 
    my nothingness of power. But now I am made strong, and all my strength is in 
    my Savior's arms, and by my Savior's side, and through my Savior's help, and 
    from my Savior's Spirit. He now works with me—in me—for me. And so I work 
    and prosper. He is my battle-axe—my bow—my spear—my sword. He nerves my 
    muscles. He fortifies my breast. He frames my armor, and He girds me with 
    it. He bids me to go forward, and He Himself precedes. Thus my poor 
    worm-like heart becomes in Christ a Lion. If I sink not—if I prevail—if I 
    subdue—the power is His—the grace is His—to Him I give the praise, and on 
    His brow I place my victory's crown."</p>
<p align="justify">But you deny not, that the fight continues to be very 
    fierce. Temptations have not ceased to tempt. The world remains the world. 
    Flesh still is flesh. Traitors still dwell within. Satan still hates. His 
    wrath increases. With craftier stratagem he marks his opportunities, and 
    lays his snares. There is no day, when allurement spreads not some net. Woe 
    would be yours, if Jesus were not ever near. But He is near, ministering 
    real strength. Thus you hold on. Thus you hold out.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a miracle of grace, when thus the little flock 
    gains trophies, "strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might." It is 
    divine empowerment, when thus experience shouts, "I can do all things 
    through Christ, who strengthens me." Aid from heaven is supplied, and then 
    the old serpent flees. Victory comes, because the Lion of the tribe of Judah 
    helps. Wonder of wonders! In Jesus' might, the weakest heart—the feeblest 
    will—with Lion's strength, beats back all hell.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, ever remember, then, where your true power 
    lies. Take not one step, approach no work, except armored in a Savior's 
    grace. Appalling instances record, how saints have stumbled, when they have 
    ventured forth alone. Abraham flinched. Noah sinned foully. Jacob stooped to 
    fraud. David tumbled into filthiest mire. Peter acted a coward's part.</p>
<p align="justify">Seek not excuse for such vile falls in nature's frailty, 
    or in evil's power. Nature is frail. Evil is mighty. But here is the 
    fault—Faith did not grasp the ready sword. Prayer did not ask the ready 
    aid. Learn from these instances to meet Goliath in the name of God. And then 
    fear not. You will stand Lion-like in strength.</p>
<p align="justify">Does any poor sinner, pierced by many a wound—bemired by 
    many a fall—tottering at each step beside a precipice's edge—read these 
    lines? Sir, turn not from the encouragement of this Gospel-truth. You yet 
    may obtain strength to trample down your perils and your foes. You live. 
    Your many wounds have not brought death. In these present words another 
    warning meets you. Is not this the Savior's call? Come, then, and join 
    yourself to Him, and all His might is yours—and you will triumph with 
    those, who, through His blood, have overcome. <i>Cease to grovel a crushed 
    worm. Become a Christian Lion.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Courage. </p></b>Lions to their strength add courage. They 
    never know timidity. Valiantly they face all danger. Fearlessly they rush to 
    the attack. No multitude of beasts or men alarm them. As power is in their 
    limbs, so bravery fills their hearts.
<p align="justify">This quality again portrays the child of God. <i>When 
    heavenly commands are clear, unflinchingly he obeys.</i> He confers not with 
    flesh and blood. Despite all threats, he steadfastly advances. His only fear 
    is, lest he should fear. He only trembles, lest he should tremble.</p>
<p align="justify">See the <i>three captive youths</i>. The tyrant menaced. 
    They stood alone against an empire. What! shall they yield? No, rather, 
    welcome the furnace—the agony—the flame. They failed not God. God failed 
    not them. He made them bold as Lions. And their fame lives among faith's 
    heroes.</p>
<p align="justify">See <i>Daniel</i>. Command is urgent. Shall his knees 
    leave their beloved employ! Shall he address a worm, though king, in prayer! 
    The thought is keener torture, than the Lion's teeth. With open window 
    bravely he worships. His courage conquers. The lions' mouths are closed. The 
    tyrant's heart is turned.</p>
<p align="justify">See, too, <i>the</i> <i>Baptist</i>. He fears not Herod's 
    might. Fearlessly he drags to light the darling sin. He chooses truth and 
    prison, and death; rather than unfaithfulness and ease. Where he sees error, 
    there his mouth is open to reprove.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, let it be so with you. What though falsehood's 
    guise be specious—and high authority endorse it—and brilliant gifts 
    commend it—and pliant worldlings fondle it—and gilded honors follow in its 
    rear—if the cup holds one poison drop—if statements swerve one 
    hair-breadth from Gospel-truth, then, with Lion valor let your voice scare 
    the traitor. Thus Paul resisted Peter to the face.</p>
<p align="justify">So, too, <i>courageously confess Christ. </i>This often 
    needs a martyr's spirit. When friends desert—and the world sneers—and 
    blight descends on prospects—and Gospel-truth seems linked with trouble—it 
    needs a Lion's heart to testify, 'None but Jesus—none but Jesus!' But thus 
    the Apostles, menaced with near death, preached Christ more fully and more 
    clearly. Their hearts were faith. Their faith was courage. Their courage was 
    success.</p>
<p align="justify">A noble army of confessing saints beckon us onward in 
    this path. Ignatius moved with a Lion's heart to meet his grave in lions' 
    jaws. May his bold words be cherished, while the world endures! "Now do I 
    begin to be a disciple of my Master Christ." Luther stands with Lion's 
    courage re-echoing Paul's resolve. "None of these things move me." In this 
    grand spirit he exclaimed, "Though there were devils many as the tiles on 
    the roofs of Worms, I shall go forward."</p>
<p align="justify">Come, then, believer, be you, too, as a Lion for your 
    Lord. Boldly devise great plans. Heroically act them out. Let neither earth 
    nor hell intimidate. Your cause is good. Your call is from God's throne. 
    Your help is sure. What promises encourage! What triumphs are at hand! Only 
    be very courageous. Be not a coward in the camp of Christ—for Judah's Lion 
    expects Lion-followers.</p>
<p align="justify">Gad dwells as a Lion. Dan is a Lion's cub. Will you be 
    less?</p>
