<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>The Tribe of BENJAMIN</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858<br/> <br/> <i>"About Benjamin he said: "Let the beloved of the Lord rest 
    secure in Him, for He shields him all day long, and the one the Lord loves 
    rests between His shoulders."</i> Deut. 33:12</p>
<p align="justify">Benjamin! Thoughts of love are quickly kindled by the 
    very name. Affection folded Benjamin in its embrace. He closed the line of 
    Jacob's sons, and thus no younger rival moved him from his fondled place. He 
    was endeared, too, as the expiring Rachel's child. She died, when he began 
    to live. Thus, all the feelings, which have softest sway, enshrined him 
    eminently in his father's heart.</p>
<p align="justify">When then this tribe appears, our minds anticipate much 
    tender favor. And it is so. A designation of endearment is adjoined—"Of 
    Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, here pause. A wondrous truth refuses to be put 
    aside. Give it glad welcome. Listen fully to its cheering tale. Imbibe the 
    precious draught of its delight. Let its sweet fragrance perfume all your 
    hours. The truth is this. The name pertains to every member of God's 
    family—"Beloved of the Lord." Each child of God is loved, as a Benjamin, in 
    heaven's palace.</p>
<p align="justify">What! loved of God! Love is the soul of feeling. It is 
    the blazing of the heart in warmth. It is a current of resistless strength. 
    It places a dear object above self. It is intense desire for fellowship. It 
    weeps, and joys, and thrives, in unison with anther's sorrow and delight. It 
    is the strongest impulse of the breast. It holds the rudder of the life. It 
    is the principle, which many waters cannot quench, neither can floods drown 
    it. Song 8:7.</p>
<p align="justify">Is there such feeling in the realms of light towards 
    inhabitants of earth? Yes, truly. Each of the heaven-born seed is loved with 
    perfect love by the Triune Jehovah.</p>
<p align="justify">The FATHER loves—and writes His loved ones in the book 
    of life—and chooses them to be the spouse, and crown, and glory of His 
    Son—and sends His Christ to buy them out of ruin's grasp—to cleanse their 
    filth in efficacious blood—to fit them to dwell, as partners of His throne.</p>
<p align="justify">JESUS so loves, that He puts on our flesh, and takes the 
    place of the condemned, and bears in His own body all the just penalties of 
    sin, and undergoes the uttermost of wrath, and drinks the very dregs of 
    anguish. Attend Him through His painful walk on earth—approach the 
    garden-mysteries—stand by the shameful cross mark all the signs of infinite 
    distress—hear the deep groans wrung from His agonized mind. The language of 
    these sufferings reveals, how much, how truly, and how constantly He loved. 
    Next raise the eye of faith, and see Him now at God's right hand. Whence 
    those incessant prayers—those mighty pleadings—that watchful eye—those 
    outstretched hands—that life devoted to one cause? His present acts repeat, 
    that He still loves. </p>
<p align="justify">The SPIRIT loves. It must be so. This feeling draws Him 
    to a sinner's heart. He ever finds that spot all ice—all death—all enmity 
    to God. But still He enters in, and works a saving change. He exerts 
    renovating might. He creates new life, and light, and holy powers. He 
    discloses the activity, the vileness, and the end of sin. He thus stirs up 
    the trembler to flee unto redeeming arms. He gives him faith to take the 
    title-deeds of heaven. He leaves not, nor forsakes, until grace expands into 
    full glory. Such is the Spirit's work. And is not every part a manifest 
    display of love?</p>
<p align="justify">Thus God is love. He never was, and never will be, but 
    one ocean of eternal love. The truth, then, is most clear. Each real 
    believer ever was, and ever will be a Benjamin. His is the title, "Beloved 
    of the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, ponder the value of this fact. Its preciousness 
    exceeds worlds upon worlds of treasure. Our present scene is full of change, 
    of coldness, and of hate. Friends die, or kindly feeling withers. A frown 
    may freeze, where smiles were used to cheer. But here is our solace. We look 
    above. Heaven's love knows no eclipse. In that unfailing brightness we 
    forget surrounding gloom. Here, too, we find a mighty magnet drawing us to 
    holiness. We must love Him, who so loves us. We cannot love God, and not 
    desire to please Him. Hence His pure law becomes our true delight. The 
    slavish chains fall off, and willing service is our joyful walk. Sense of 
    God's love thus cheers and sanctifies.</p>
<p align="justify">Through this prelude we approach the BLESSING assigned to 
    Benjamin. It proves, that God's love is a vast treasure of gracious gifts. 
    It shows a threefold front. It strikes a triple cord. It brings the pledge 
    of safety, constant shelter, and fellowship with God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. Safety.</p></b> "The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in <i>
    safety</i> by Him." Survey the picture. It is lovely in repose. We seem to 
    see a child without one care seated securely by a parent's side. No anxious 
    fears disturb. Undoubting trust spreads its calm influence. A Father, strong 
    and watchful, is at hand. An arm is ready to defend. The happy son knows it, 
    and confides.
<p align="justify">The image tenderly depicts the true believer's blessed 
    state. He sits in peace beside his God. Faith's wings have borne him 
    upwards. His heart and thoughts have settled in a tranquil realm. The 
    restless wanderings of former days are past. There was a time, when he was 
    tossed about on stormy waves. He wandered hopelessly in search of peace. But 
    now he rests in God. His home is by his Father's side. "The beloved of the 
    Lord shall dwell in safety by Him."</p>
<p align="justify">This seat is safety. For think, how high it is upraised! 
    It is with God. What foe can now assail? Satan's darts are very many, and 
    impelled with mighty force. His arms, too, have exceeding skill. But these 
    are heights above his reach. The arrows from his strongest bow have but 
    restricted wings. The shafts fly not to those lofty seats, where God's dear 
    children cluster. They dwell in safety, for they dwell by Him.</p>
<p align="justify">A tender voice is ever heard, "Fear not, you worm Jacob, 
    and you men of Israel—I will help you, says the Lord, and your Redeemer the 
    holy one of Israel." Is. 41:14. Again it sounds, "I give unto them eternal 
    life—and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of 
    My hand. My Father, who gave them to Me, is greater than all; and no man is 
    able to pluck them out of My Father's hand." John 10:28, 29. Each tranquil 
    Benjamin may realize, "If God be for us, who can be against us?" Rom. 8:31. 
    They dwell in safety by Him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Constant shelter.</p></b> This is a sweet phase of safety, 
    and this is thus graphically promised—"The Lord shall cover him all the day 
    long." The warrior is sheltered, whom a broad shield surrounds. The sword 
    may deal fierce blows—the spear may roughly thrust—all weapons may attack. 
    But the assaults touch not. He stands unhurt. The inhabitants of a 
    well-built house are protected. The hurricane may rage. The hail may beat. 
    The rain may pour down floods. But the roof spreads a sheltering defense. 
    The strife of elements is warded off. So when the feathered mother spreads 
    her sheltering wings, the hawk may soar above—the gathering clouds may 
    menace—but the downy refuge covers. The young birds nestle free from harm.
    
<p align="justify">Thus for each Benjamin a constant refuge is provided. He 
    needs it. No warrior is more sorely pressed. The whole artillery of hell 
    seeks his destruction. No traveler is more exposed. Satan outside—the world 
    around—a treacherous heart within—assail his path. No infant bird is more 
    beset with perils. A preying beak is ever ready to devour.</p>
<p align="justify">But he defies this multitudinous array. How is it? Is he 
    not weak in self. Yes. His strength is feebler than a bruised reed. Alone he 
    cannot face one single foe—much less the myriads of earth and hell. Here is 
    his shelter—"The Lord shall cover him all the day long."</p>
<p align="justify">It would have been abundant favor to have given some 
    shield—or to have raised some roof—or to have spread some wing. But mercy 
    provides more for Benjamin. The Lord Himself is the constant covering. The 
    Lord, whose arms are infinite, ever hides him in Himself. "Our life is 
    hidden with Christ in God." Who, then, can injure? "All the day long" the 
    enemy may watch. "All the day long" the shelter protects.</p>
<p align="justify">But the believer is more than sheltered from these 
    perils. He is, moreover, covered from the condemning eye of God. His life 
    must always be a mass of sin. What hateful filth defiles him! But this may 
    all be buried from God's sight. O my soul, ever realize the covering robe, 
    which Jesus wrought and offers. It is 
    righteousness—perfect—spotless—divine. This He delights to cast around 
    you. Adorned with this, you fearlessly may meet Jehovah's scrutiny. No 
    blemish can be found. This imputed beauty makes you fairer than angelic 
    purity. Put on by faith this precious mantle, and then sing aloud, "Blessed 
    is he, whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered." Ps. 32:1.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">3. Fellowship with God.</p></b> Benjamin's lot has this 
    especial blessing. "He shall dwell between his shoulders." The shoulders are 
    the borders—the outward coasts—the confines of the land. Thus, "they shall 
    fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west." Is. 11:14. Here, 
    then, it is pledged, that Benjamin's land shall just contain God's earthly 
    courts. What the Lord says shall surely be. Therefore in appointed time the 
    Temple, that hallowed structure, rose on the mount, which skirted this 
    tribe's line. Such is the literal fulfillment. This promise, then, in its 
    first sense, assigns the position of the consecrated house.
<p align="justify">But the grand import of this word is spiritual. The 
    Temple is the symbol of a present God. In it true worshipers drew near. In 
    it God met the souls, which sought Him. The pledge, then, of this dwelling 
    in Benjamin's domain promises access to God. It pictures prayer 
    ascending—answers returned—constant communion. And is it not the saint's 
    delight to have this heavenly union! This is his constant feast—he dwells 
    in God, and God in him—he is one with God, and God with him.</p>
<p align="justify">This fellowship is based in Christ. He is the connecting 
    link. He is the Mediator. He has a divine hand, which touches God. He has a 
    human hand, which man may touch. Thus He unites the holy Father and the holy 
    flock. This communion is very paradise. It is the foretaste of heaven. It 
    passes beyond the veil, and penetrates the inner sanctuary. Faith, leaning 
    on Christ's arm, lives in this happiness. With filial confidence it brings 
    each trial—trouble—sorrow—need—affliction—doubt—distress, to a 
    Father's ear. And God is near to cheer—to bless—to wipe the weeping 
    eye—to soothe the wounded heart—to raise the drooping spirit—to send the 
    pilgrim singing on his way. As the Temple was in the lot of Benjamin, so God 
    is in the midst of Zion's sons. "He shall dwell between his shoulders."</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, do not you long to be an heir of Benjamin's large 
    portion? Do you not feel, that it must be the crown of bliss to be thus 
    safe—thus covered—thus free to heavenly communion! This becomes yours, 
    when you are one with Christ. Is such your case? If not, why linger in 
    peril, an unsheltered outcast? Draw near in faith. Wrestle in prayer. Invite 
    Him to come in. He will not hesitate, and His entrance brings Benjamin's 
    triple blessing—safety—constant shelter—fellowship with God.</p>
