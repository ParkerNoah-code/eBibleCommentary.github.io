<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>ISRAEL'S GOD</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858<i><br/> <br/>    "There is no one like the God of Jeshurun (Israel), who 
    rides on the heavens to help you and on the clouds in His majesty.</i>" 
    Deut. 33:26</p>
<p align="justify">This is the fervid exclamation of a soul acquainted with 
    its God. The tongue would adequately praise, but language fails. Struggling 
    efforts cannot do more than say, <i>"There is no one like Him."</i></p>

<p align="justify">For one moment strive to estimate the worth of this 
    attainment. Other knowledge is but darkness beside this light. All 
    discoveries of art and science are low as dust, contrasted with this pearl. 
    Let the expanded intellect take wing, and soar through all the skies above. 
    Let the celestial orbs be counted in their course. Let the earth's depths be 
    traced. Let hidden wonders be brought forth to view. Let history tell the 
    annals of the past. Let literature spread her storied page. Let keen 
    investigation scrutinize the intricate machinery of the human heart. When 
    all is learned, which mental power has ever grasped, what is the total 
    worth, compared with understanding of our God!</p>
<p align="justify">Other knowledge vanishes with time—and time is but a 
    tiny speck. This knowledge is ever growing through eternity. It has an 
    endless life. Other acquirements bring no inward peace, and heal no 
    conscience-wounds, and gladden no dying beds. This removes every fear and 
    spreads a holy calm. As is the value of the soul saved, such is the value of 
    God truly known.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, as you would live in bliss forever, obtain, then, 
    this prize. But search for it aright. God is revealed. He may be seen. But 
    only in the Gospel-mirror, and in the face of Christ. Here only, the 
    concealing curtains are withdrawn. Here only, can distinct display be found. 
    But here the sun shines forth in perfect beauty and unclouded glory. Here 
    every attribute appears in proper place, in just proportion, in blended 
    harmony. The cross is the truth-showing text-book. Come then to it. The 
    Spirit helping, while you gaze, you will take up the song, <i>"There is no 
    one like the God of Jeshurun."</i></p>

<p align="justify">Look up—behold the wondrous testimony. First, characters 
    of glowing light announce—"God is love." This is a truth established only 
    here. Read through creation's volume. Evidence, indeed, of mighty wisdom and 
    preserving care abounds. Elaborate effects prove the consummate <i>skill</i> 
    of the fabricating cause. Arrangements to promote happiness are clearly, 
    largely, and benevolently made. But this fair picture has a reverse. 
    Hurricanes and tempests sweep the earth. The storm destroys. The pestilence 
    extends its desolating scythe. Disease preys almost upon every frame. We 
    pity the feeble limb—the moody wanderings of unsound thought—the sorrowing 
    parent—the bereaved child—the mourning widow. We turn from tears, and 
    misery, and crime, and ask with a disquiet sigh, "Are these the orderings of 
    perfect love?"</p>
<p align="justify">Approach the page of <b>providence</b>. It is a wheel 
    moved by an unseen hand. Its constant motion asserts constant agency. But 
    its results perplex and puzzle. Today events cause happiness to overflow. 
    Tomorrow witnesses a flood of woe—affliction—loss—distress. We doubt—we 
    hesitate—we cannot surely say, "This ruling power is love."</p>
<p align="justify">We hear the proclamation of <b>God's law</b>. We listen 
    eagerly. But awe and terror meet us. It speaks, indeed. But all is the 
    sternness of inflexible decree. Give unimpaired obedience. Bring 
    righteousness without one flaw—one speck—one stain. Show a whole course of 
    strict compliance with strict terms. Then life eternal is secured. But if 
    there be transgression—then take the curse, and perish everlastingly; for 
    heaven's doors are closed, and wrath is the fixed penalty. Offence must reap 
    its wages, where pardon never comes, and fires never quench, and anguish 
    never ceases. What child of Adam's blinded race can commune with the law, 
    and thence conclude, that God is love?</p>
<p align="justify">Now place beside these doubts the exhibitions of the 
    cross. There God surrenders His own Son to shame—to agony—to death. He 
    lays on Him the crushing burden of His people's sins. He puts a cup of 
    infinite woe into those blameless hands. He bruises the innocent, that He 
    may spare the transgressor. He slays the guiltless, that He may release the 
    guilty. </p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, gaze on this fact. Feast on its consolations. 
    Mark well its story. You need not die, for Jesus dies. You may escape 
    hell-pains. A substitute suffers in your place. No punishment remains. The 
    storm breaks on a substituted head. The vials hold no wrath for you. Your 
    gracious Lord exhausts each drop. But this Savior—so sufficient—so 
    complete, is God's free gift. What, then, is this giving God? Surely you 
    shout, He is perfect love. The cross unravels every doubt. "There is none 
    like unto the God of Jeshurun."</p>
<p align="justify">Again, <b>mercy</b> is a sparkling attribute. God is rich 
    in mercy. His ever-enduring mercy reaches unto the heavens. But where is the 
    proof? We find it at Calvary. For what is mercy, but tender love 
    sympathizing and relieving misery, and longing to bring ease? And is not 
    this the trumpet-language of the cross? Christ thus expiring is surest 
    evidence, that God's heart yearns to relieve wretchedness—to chase 
    unhappiness away—to introduce delight and peace.</p>
<p align="justify">God also reigns upon a throne of <b>grace</b>. But the 
    cross alone establishes this truth. For what is grace, but love looking with 
    favor on undeserving worms—on lost ones, whose whole desert is 
    punishment—on criminals, whose silent lips can urge no plea—whose downcast 
    heads confess deep guilt. Grace finds at Calvary an open door, and free 
    opportunity to enter on this noble work. There it pardons, and receives, and 
    saves, and snatches from hell the rebels, who are nothing but iniquity. 
    Faith sees this clearly in the wounded Jesus, and cries, God is all grace. 
    "There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun."</p>
<p align="justify">Is <b>justice</b> God's essence? Is it so interwoven with 
    His being, that an unjust God, cannot be truly God? Now justice sternly 
    asks, that every debt be fully paid, and no demand be set aside? The cross 
    shows God in all the majesty of unsullied justice—in severity, which yields 
    no right. He there exacts each due. The sad transgressions of the chosen 
    race are countless in number—boundless in magnitude. Each is an 
    incalculable debt. Before the cross the scales are brought; and a Substitute 
    appears, who more than satisfies. He is supremely able, for He is divine. He 
    pays a death, in value, far exceeding thought. Justice cries, "Enough, I am 
    content—Enough, the whole is paid—Enough, no shadow of a claim 
    remains—Enough, the score is all wiped out."</p>
<p align="justify">Sinner, you cannot enter heaven, if you retain one sin 
    unexpiated. Justice immovably forbids, and rightly bars the gates.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, no charge remains against you, because your 
    Surety has infinitely paid. If through eternal ages you had lain in hell, 
    you might have been forever paying a debt forever great. Jesus by His one 
    offering clears all away. <i>Now</i> <i>Justice has become your ablest 
    advocate.</i> That attribute, once so severely adverse, stands your 
    prevailing friend. God is just and you are justified. Faith reads a full 
    receipt in Jesus' pierced hands, and intelligently joins in the song, "There 
    is none like unto the God of Jeshurun."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Holiness</p></b>, too, is a main pillar of God's government. 
    Unholiness in Him would overthrow the throne of righteousness, and lower 
    heaven to hell. But holiness abhors all evil. It cannot look upon an unclean 
    thing. It frowns iniquity to boundless distance. The impure cannot face it. 
    Where, then, can the sinner hide? His sin-stains exclude him from the sight 
    of God. If he should venture near, a holy voice is heard, "Bind him hand and 
    foot, and cast him into outer darkness." But at the cross our God is holy, 
    and the sinner saved.
<p align="justify">How can it be? Behold the problem solved. Sin is the dire 
    offence. Let sin but vanish, and holiness is no longer hostile. Its 
    opposition ceases. But the all-cleansing blood from Jesus' wounds 
    obliterates each mark of guilt. It changes filth to loveliness—deformity to 
    beauty—impurity to snow-bright luster. Holiness beholds the blood-washed 
    multitude. It finds no speck of sin in them. Therefore it gladly clasps them 
    to its pleased embrace. At the cross, this holiness, without receding from 
    its loftiest ground, smiles on transgressors, and welcomes them to God's 
    all-righteous throne. This is one of Calvary's wonders. Faith clearly sees 
    it—and exults—"There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun."</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, God must be absolutely <b>true</b>. His word 
    cannot be shaken. Now truth has clearly spoken. Its edict raises a gigantic 
    prison round the sons of guilt. Its sentence links them to eternal death. 
    How then can they escape, who thus are doomed? Come to the cross and 
    witness. Jesus presents Himself. He asks, O truth, what is your claim? The 
    answer is distinct. Whatever my lips have uttered, without one slightest 
    failure, must be done. All, who have sinned, must take the death denounced. 
    Jesus complies. He lays down life for each of His redeemed. In Him, His seed 
    all undergo the uttermost of truth's threat. No tittle is relaxed. Truth 
    remains true, and a vast multitude ascend to heaven. The cross thus 
    magnifies this attribute. Faith knows this, and again exclaims, "There is 
    none like unto the God of Jeshurun."</p>
<p align="justify">Another scroll surmounts the cross. It writes the praise 
    of everlasting <b>wisdom</b>. If any ask, where is wisdom's greatest work; 
    let him come here and read a scheme, which reconciles seeming 
    impossibilities. There was a task, before which all created minds could not 
    but hide their baffled heads. <i>Mercy</i> asks pardon—<i>Justice</i> 
    demands payment. <i>Grace</i> sues for life—<i>Truth</i> must have death.
    <i>Love</i> must admit—<i>Righteousness</i> excludes. But God appears, 
    leading His Son to the accursed tree—and all are satisfied— 
    delighted—honored—magnified—exalted—glorified. Not one is tarnished—not 
    one is set aside. Here is the brightest blaze of wisdom. The word is true, 
    Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 1 Cor. 1:24. Again faith 
    shouts, "There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun."</p>
<p align="justify">The real believer adds his individual praise. He can bear 
    witness, how this incomparable God has sent His Spirit to add personal 
    experience of these truths. He can record, "This God was once unknown by me. 
    I lived without Him in the world. But now the mists are gone. I see Him 
    saving even me in Christ. I claim Him, as my own. He is my Father. He has 
    brought me to His home—the bosom of His love. I find Him to be all that 
    Scripture states, and glowing saints relate, and my enormous need requires. 
    I find Him to be more. For words from angels' lips cannot tell out half that 
    sea of grace, on which I float to glory. And now my straining effort is, to 
    learn more and more. With this desire I meditate and pray at Calvary. The 
    more I <i>see</i>, the more I love. The more I <i>love</i>, the more I 
    praise. The more I <i>praise</i>, the more my heart expands. The more my 
    heart expands, the greater is my <i>peace and joy</i>. "There is none like 
    unto the God of Jeshurun." How precious is this sight of faith! How precious 
    will be the sight in heaven!</p>
<p align="justify">Happy the soul, whose glad experience thus responds, 
    "There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun." Reader, is this blessedness 
    your own? Be well assured, that life is a poor blank, until you know the 
    peerless God. Let this study be your chief concern. The Spirit waits to 
    reveal Jesus—and in revealing Jesus, to show Jeshurun's God. Be not 
    destroyed for lack of saving knowledge. Be not blind amid abounding light.</p>
