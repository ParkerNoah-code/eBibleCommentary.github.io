<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE CURSE</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"Anyone who is hung on a tree is under God's curse."</p></i> 
    Deut. 21:23
<p align="justify">This is a dreadful sentence. It shows the misery of 
    miseries—the inmost core of agony—the very soul of anguish—the sting of 
    woe—despair's extremity. This sum of evil is the Curse of God.</p>
<p align="justify">When God blesses, sorrow is joy—pain has sweet ease—and 
    burdens lose their weight. Beneath His <i>smile</i>, the bed of sickness is 
    repose, and death's approach is welcomed. If He is absent, there is a void, 
    which nothing can supply. But if He <i>frowns</i>, what horrors multiply! 
    What shall be said, then, of that <i>Curse</i>, which is His uttermost 
    display of wrath! Better, far better, not to have been born, than to meet 
    this. O my soul, whatever be the cost, escape it.</p>
<p align="justify">With this resolve approach the text before us. The 
    outside casket may seem rough, but it contains a precious jewel. "He, that 
    is hanged, is accursed of God."</p>
<p align="justify">The meaning must be primarily sought. Mark, this is no 
    statement, that criminals uplifted on a cross thereby pass into deeper 
    guilt. There was, indeed, most extreme ignominy in this mode of death. It was 
    the brand of utter loathing. But <i>man's</i> contempt entails not <i>divine</i> 
    curse. Earth may abhor, while heaven approves. The cross could never be the 
    cause of Curse. A saint might rise to heaven from that tree. It is not 
    meant, then, that a man, by being hanged, becomes accursed of God.</p>
<p align="justify">This word describes not malefactors in the mass. It is 
    particular. It has a prophet's voice. It is a Gospel-sign. It eyes 
    exclusively the Crucified Jesus. It only tells the fact, that He, who came 
    to bear God's Curse, should hang upon the tree. It pictures His especial 
    mode of dying. A cross shall be the evidence, that Jesus thereon sustains 
    the law's full threat. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader, this brings us to ponder closely the Lord's work. 
    From all eternity it was decreed, that He should bear His people's sins. 
    This is the essence of the covenant of peace. He willingly consents. The 
    guilt is all transferred to Him. Each violation of the law is charged to His 
    account. He stands the guilty one. Thus all His ransomed are released from 
    blame. Their penalties—their curse—are wholly claimed, received, and borne 
    by Him. A substitute suffers all, that they may suffer none.</p>
<p align="justify">These are the terms arranged in everlasting counsels. The 
    Savior is to be a substitute. The saved are to be free, because He pays. The 
    law remits no due. It takes all from another's hand. Jesus is a vicarious 
    Curse.</p>
<p align="justify">Such is God's grace—such the Redeemer's love—such the 
    simplicity of Salvation's scheme. This text, then, gives a signal mark, 
    whereby the Curse-sustaining Surety shall be known. Already had a typal 
    picture taught the truth. A brazen serpent, hanging on a pole, had shown the 
    Savior hanging on a tree. But here plain words speak plainly. Hanging is now 
    distinctly named. The voice cries, He, who is hanged, is the Curse of God. 
    No doubt remains. It stands announced, that when the true Deliverer shall 
    appear, upon the cross He shall expire. A pledge is given, too marvelous for 
    man's invention—too clear for man to misinterpret.</p>
<p align="justify">If this should fail, faith loses her sure ground. If 
    other death makes Christ its prey, Christ takes not the Curse away. The 
    Gospel-fabric crumbles into dust.</p>
<p align="justify">But this fails not. Outside the city's gate, the cross is 
    raised. To it the Lord is bound. On it He is upraised, a spectacle to God, 
    to angels, and to men.</p>
<p align="justify">But wondrous steps lead to this wondrous end. It seemed, 
    as though it could not be. While Israel's power remained supreme, the cross 
    was not a <i>Jewish</i> malefactor's death. If Jesus die, then, by their 
    rule, He will not die with pierced hands and feet. <i>Stones</i> will crush. 
    But difficulties vanish before God's decree. The scepter, therefore, passes 
    from the ancient people. The <i>Roman</i> law prevails. It must condemn and 
    execute. But, when the Romans slay, they crucify. Hence Christ, sentenced by 
    Pilate, is hurried to the tree. Hence on the cross He hangs. The prophecy is 
    thoroughly fulfilled. And faith, pointing to Calvary, shouts, Our God is 
    true—Jesus completely saves—<i>"Anyone who is hung on a tree is under 
    God's curse."</i></p>

<p align="justify">Reader, here for a moment take your meditative seat. But 
    vain the cross, except the Spirit gild it with His light. Therefore send 
    forth the fervent cry, 'Come, Holy Spirit, teach me the glory of Calvary's 
    scene!'</p>
<p align="justify">The prominent truth is this. Jesus there hanging is the 
    Curse of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Fully to realize the joy of this, we must distinctly 
    understand the Curse. Whence springs it? What kindles this fierce flame? 
    Disobedience is the one cause. If all men loved their God—if His one law 
    ruled in each heart—beamed in each look—spoke in each word—moved in each 
    step—then earth would not have known the name of Curse. The loving child, 
    walking with God, would only bask in smiles, and feast on blessings.</p>
<p align="justify">But ah! how different is the case! In Adam's fall the 
    human family pass into rebellion's realm. The fountain-head, being poisoned, 
    only can send evil from it. Hence wrath arises. Hence the Curse thunders.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, make this truth practical. For until ruin be 
    discerned, Christ's shelter never will be sought. Boldly then ask, 'Is this 
    Curse mine?'</p>
<p align="justify">Let God reply. Behold His mirror. View yourself therein. 
    Take His true standard. Measure yourself thereby. Produce His faultless 
    scales. There weigh yourself. The Spirit from His lofty throne thus speaks, 
    "Cursed is every one, that continues not in all things, which are written in 
    the book of the law, to do them." Gal. 3:10.</p>
<p align="justify">Oh! solemn word! But it is plain as solemn. Hear it, you 
    sons of men. Sift carefully its several parts. What is written in this 
    edict-book? The terms are brief and exact. They ask for love to God—to man. 
    This is the one demand—and this must reign in every movement of the heart 
    from cradle to the grave. All thought must flow in one broad channel—love. 
    All words must sound one echo—love. All works must have this spring—this 
    course—this end. Exception there is none. This rule's enclosure holds our 
    total race. No rank ascends above it. No poverty descends below it. Gold 
    cannot purchase license. Poverty cannot evade. Talent and learning cannot 
    frame excuse. All, who have breathed life's breath, from Adam's day to this 
    hour—all, who shall breathe, until the Lord's return—are under the 
    distinct command of love. If there be failure in one single thought, the law 
    is broken, and the Curse accrues.</p>
<p align="justify">But eyes are slow to open to this giant-truth. Could 
    silly earth be one wide scene of <i>unconcern</i>, if this reality were 
    felt? Could giddy crowds thus laugh and sport, if once they saw the hand of 
    Curse upon them?</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, perchance you fondly reason, The law is broken, 
    but the Curse will not fall on me. My pleas are many. They will land me on 
    some rock. Well, then, produce your pleas. The law says, 'Give me unsullied 
    love', and points to your defects. You cannot deny guilt, and thereby you 
    allow the Curse to be your due. But you reply, 'I erred in early days, with 
    unformed mind and thoughtless heart'. Be it so—early transgression is 
    transgression still, and therefore you are Cursed. You add, 'but I was 
    sorely tried. Could human nature stand, when so assailed?' The law knows 
    nothing of an extenuating cause. To err—be the occasion what it may—to err 
    is to be Cursed.</p>
<p align="justify">But perhaps you plead your penitence—your 
    broken-heart—your streaming eyes—your smitten breast—the floor worn out 
    by your knees. Can penitence recall the past, or undo what is done? It 
    cannot. Offence remains offence, and each offence is Curse.</p>
<p align="justify">Do you betake yourself to cries, and humbly supplicate 
    mercy—reprieve—space for reform! Do you say, Let me commence my course 
    afresh—blot out the debt, and let me enter on a new career! It cannot be. 
    Past deeds have earned their wages. The wages must be paid, and they are 
    Curse.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, do not evade this reasoning. Whatever be your age 
    or state, to this point you are brought—in self—by nature—by your own 
    deed—you stand accursed of God. There is no hour, in which love has not 
    failed. Therefore each hour has linked you to the Curse.</p>
<p align="justify">But perhaps you ask, 'What is this Curse?' You feel no 
    present wrath. The canopy of heaven is bright above. Shelter, and food, and 
    friends, abound. Unnumbered comforts cheer your path. It may be so. But this 
    present will not be always present. The future is drawing near. Death 
    presses at your heels. And judgment follows death. Then sin's deserts must 
    be received. And the deserts are Curse.</p>
<p align="justify">Do you still ask, 'What is the Curse?' Words cannot fully 
    tell. Thought cannot grasp the magnitude. No images can paint the 
    boundlessness of this anguish. But it cannot fall short of this. God puts 
    forth all His might—stirs up His utmost strength—strains every effort—all 
    for one purpose—to assert His majesty—to avenge His broken law—to heap 
    perdition on the offender's head. In brief, <b>the Curse is Hell.</b> Ah! 
    what is here implied! <i>Conscience</i> is tortured by the undying worm. 
    Remorse inflicts unmitigated stings. <i>Memory</i> upbraids with bitterest 
    reproach. The <i>body</i> writhes in all intensities of pain. Each sense 
    gapes, as inlet of agony. God is far off. Blackness of darkness thickens all 
    around. Satan insults. Wretched companions deepen the horror by their wails. 
    The woe increases by full knowledge of <i>eternal hopelessness</i>. Years 
    will roll on, but misery will be misery still. Ages will follow ages, but 
    respite will not dawn. The present will be ever present, <i>an infinity of 
    suffering. </i>Such is an outline of the Curse—just—merited—and sure. It
    <i>must</i> be. The broken law demands it. It <i>will</i> be. God's truth 
    declares it.</p>
<p align="justify">But why is this picture drawn? The purpose is to endear 
    the tidings of escape. The motive is to magnify the glorious truth, "<i>"He 
    who is hung on a tree" </i>even Jesus<i> "is accursed of God." </i>The 
    desire is, to win all thoughts to Him—the substituted Curse.</p>
<p align="justify">With this intent let us return to Calvary. The cross is 
    there erected. The mighty God-man is dragged to it. The nails affix Him, and 
    He there expires. Thus He becomes the Curse of God. Thus the whole vengeance 
    falls on Him. He there bears all the anguish, which would have been His 
    people's doom, if they had tossed forever on flame-beds. No grain of misery 
    is withheld. No pity spares Him. The Curse—the dreadful Curse—the total 
    Curse—in all its boundless length and breadth, pours its whole weight upon 
    Him. </p>
<p align="justify">Surely, then, all, who are contained in Christ, may now 
    confront the law. Let it bring forth their guilt. They own the justice of 
    the charge. Let it cry, 'Take my Curse'. They point to Jesus taking all. The 
    plea is valid. They cannot suffer what their Surety has first borne. They 
    are secure and free, simply because He has endured for them.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, will you not live beside the cross! Can you 
    withdraw your eyes! Read its clear language. Take its rich comfort. Clasp 
    its full joy. Doubt not—be verily assured—that it absorbs your Curse. 
    Drink its deep streams of peace. And bless your precious Lord, who thus 
    vicariously saves. Give all your heart—give all your life—to Him. Is He 
    not worthy! Think, that, without His love, your endless state would have 
    been endless Curse. Think, that, through His curse-bearing death, your 
    present state is blessing—your eternal home is glory.</p>
