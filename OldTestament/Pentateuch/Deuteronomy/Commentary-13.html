<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>PISGAH</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858 </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain 
    of Nebo, to the top of <b>Pisgah</b>."</p></i> Deut. 34:1.
<p align="justify">PISGAH is crowded with instructive thoughts. The scene is
    <i>solemn</i>, because death appears, and a wondrous life finds here a 
    wondrous end. It is <i>holy</i>, for God Himself attends the dying saint, 
    and closes the dying eyes. But its main interest is the marvel of the 
    distant prospects thence discerned. Moses ascends the mount. God meets His 
    faithful servant. All the beauties of the promised land are spread, as a 
    map, before him. And then he is translated to the heavenly reality. What 
    annals record similar events!</p>
<p align="justify">My soul, with reverence open this treasure-house of 
    profit. Great Spirit of all light descend, for without Your rays, even 
    Pisgah must be dark!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Moses lived long. </p></b>He passed a spacious sea of trial. 
    He trod a tedious course of trouble. His sighs were many. His spirit was 
    often pained. But the last step came, and landed him in glory!
<p align="justify">Believer, mark this, and gird up your loins. You, too, 
    may experience a stormy voyage through many billows. But each wave wafts you 
    nearer to your haven. The last will break—soon—very soon. And then, where 
    will your sufferings be? Behind—immeasurably distant. What will be 
    around—before you? Peace—joy—glory. Live, then, assured, that the end 
    approaches. The hope of rest makes all disquietudes to fade away. <i>Burdens 
    seem light, when borne for a brief space. Earth's longest sorrow cannot be 
    long.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Moses goes up with ready step to die. God cheers him with 
    an outspread prospect. With telescopic glance he is enabled to survey all 
    the extent of Canaan's lovely land. "And the Lord said unto him, This is the 
    land, which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will 
    give it unto your seed. I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you 
    shall not go over there." Deut. 34:4.</p>
<p align="justify">As we thus read, two thoughts arise.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. God's promises are stable as Himself.</p></b> His word 
    must be. He said, "I will give it:" and hands now take the gift.
<p align="justify">Believer, watch against UNBELIEF. Hew it to pieces. Tread 
    it to powder. Give it to the winds. Let no shred survive. It is shame, and 
    it is folly. It mars your peace. It keeps out floods of joy. Place your foot 
    firmly on the Word, and rise above all doubts. God's promise, surely, 
    steadily advances towards fulfillment, as the sun to its appointed rising.</p>
<p align="justify">Add Pisgah to the many proofs. The goodly land, so often 
    pledged, lies at its base. The happy tribes now reach their lots. So, too, a 
    rest is promised to the saints of God. There was no failure to Israel. There 
    will be no failure unto us. Jesus has entered as the forerunner. He holds 
    possession in His people's name. The keys are in His hands. He beckons 
    forward. He soon will give the welcome. The prize is sure to faith.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. But Moses may not cross the borders. </p></b>Why? Thoughts 
    of the heritage had often cheered his heart. His mind with eager wing had 
    often speeded towards this Canaan. It would have been sweet joy to have 
    reposed, after long journeyings, in this land. His lips would have been loud 
    in praise, while witnessing the people settled in their expected homes. But 
    this cannot be granted. He may behold from Pisgah's summit. But his feet may 
    not enter.
<p align="justify">Why? Sin is the cause. If there be misery, and shame, and 
    disappointment, these bitter streams may all be traced to sin, as the sad 
    source. At Meribah his faith had failed. Provoked, he spoke and acted in 
    unholy haste. His angry words—his blows inflicted on the rock—dishonored 
    God. He erred in presence of the host. And God must manifest displeasure. 
    Moses is loved—pardoned—saved. But he suffers. <i>His death on Pisgah 
    stands as a beacon, warning of sin's precipice.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Children of God, beware. Be ever on your guard. Watch 
    prayerfully your spirit, thoughts, and words. We move in midst of 
    wide-spread nets. Our feet soon are entangled. And then there must be 
    injury. We may repent, and bitter tears may flow. We may be mercifully 
    snatched from everlasting pains. We may gain heaven. But still there always 
    is a sorrow in sin's trail. Let this example settle deeply in your minds. 
    Moses through sin may not cross Jordan.</p>
<p align="justify">This fact is perhaps expressive of another truth. The 
    hands of Moses brought the tables of the Law. He was its mediating channel. 
    But this covenant can never convoy souls to heaven. It is weak to open those 
    bright gates. It is feeble to ascend that lofty hill. Be taught, all you, 
    who seek acceptance through the code of Sinai. The effort to fulfill these 
    terms is fool's play. It cannot prosper. It will surely fail. None enter, 
    with one stain of guilt. None enter, without righteousness, as pure as God 
    is pure. But the Law never can remove stains. It never gives a covering for 
    offence. It therefore admits not to God's presence. It never leads to the 
    celestial rest.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, whatever be your age or state, whatever be your 
    privilege, one thing is surely true, you are black with countless sins. 
    Turn, then, from the broken staff of moral guiltlessness to Jesus. He meets 
    your every need. Leaning on His arm, you may pass Jordan's waves. Safe by 
    His side you may attain true Canaan's joys. Pure in His righteousness, you 
    may stand welcome before God.</p>
<p align="justify">But Moses on Pisgah not only warns—he also <b>encourages</b> 
    to rapturous meditation; he leads us by the hand to precious thoughts. His 
    eye thence traverses a wondrous circuit. Aided by superhuman power, he roams 
    along the grand expanse of Israel's portion. From plain to plain—from 
    valley to valley—from hill to hill, he wanders in entranced delight. What 
    beauty—what fertility—enchant him! He sees the earthly home, so worthy of 
    God's chosen sons.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, is there no Pisgah, from which you, too, may 
    gaze? There is. It is the Gospel record. You should by frequent step ascend 
    this hill. You should release your mind from the poor grovelings of earthly 
    things. You should seek elevation for your heart in this chart and picture 
    of the coming bliss.</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus invites you to this Pisgah. Without Him, indeed, 
    your daily walk must be in a squalid marsh. Apart from Him, your horizon is 
    confined—and hope has no watchtower of survey. But join yourself to Him. He 
    will conduct you to a lofty seat, and open out a clear prospective of your 
    sure heritage. Seated by Him, your eye may feast on promised mansions. He 
    has indeed bought a rich country for you. And He gives the Gospel as the 
    graphic map.</p>
<p align="justify">The Spirit, too, delights to meet you with enlightening 
    aid. He will give power to apprehend this new Jerusalem; to count the 
    towers; to go round the buttresses; to mark the palaces. He will confer that 
    telescopic eye of faith, which scans the valleys, the plains, the mountains, 
    of your Canaan.</p>
<p align="justify">Bright, indeed, is the prospect. It reveals that glorious 
    home, which is the recompense of Jesus' blood. But what can be a recompense 
    for divine merit? <i>We estimate things by their price.</i> The price, which 
    He presents, is infinite. The equivalent, which He wins, is heaven. This, 
    then, must be a treasure beyond thought.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, <i>think by whom these mansions are prepared.</i> 
    Eternal love suggests their plan. Infinite power executes. Therefore they 
    must be infinitely perfect. Nothing can be absent, which can contribute to 
    pure ecstasy.</p>
<p align="justify">But Jesus dwells there now, intent on their completion. 
    They are wondrous words, "I go to prepare a place for you." His grace is an 
    ocean without shore. Here it flows out in ceaseless employ. His might is 
    boundless. Here it finds full exercise. <i>Heaven, then, must be the 
    concentrated blaze of all the happiness, which Jehovah can contrive and 
    form.</i> My soul, may you reach heaven! Cling to Jesus, and you cannot 
    fail. Reader, may you reach heaven! Cling to Jesus, and you cannot fail.</p>
<p align="justify">Neglect not, then, the truth, that in the Gospel we are 
    led to a Pisgah, whence we may survey this home. Let no one say, the 
    prospect is so dazzling that mortal gaze cannot rest on it. True! the 
    reality cannot be known by flesh and blood. Bodies, until transformed into 
    the likeness of the Lord, cannot become inhabitants. True! heaven in all its 
    blessedness exceeds our present thought. To know it fully, we must enjoy it 
    for eternal ages. But still we are encouraged to look forward from our 
    Pisgah's heights.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, strain, then, the eye of faith. Look, look 
    again. No, never cease to look. There you behold a flood of glory upon 
    glory. There cannot be improvement. Sin is outside. Temptations have no 
    place. Tears no more flow. Sighs are no longer heaved. Satan and his legion 
    are afar in utter darkness. The world has passed away. There is no longer 
    any fear of grieving God, or falling short, or bringing shame to Christ's 
    all-glorious name. Righteousness and peace are the streets and highways. 
    Eternal safety forms the battlements. Eternal praises sound from all the 
    inhabitants. Eternal glory sparkles on each brow. Eternal pleasure breathes 
    around. Each happy saint drinks a cup—so <i>full</i>, that it can hold no 
    more—so <i>pure</i>, that it cannot be purer—so <i>deep</i>, that 
    everlasting ages cannot exhaust it. My soul, may you reach heaven! Cling to 
    Jesus, and you cannot fail. Reader, may you reach heaven! Cling to Jesus, 
    and you cannot fail.</p>
<p align="justify">But when you thus contemplate heaven, especially observe 
    what is <b>its chief joy</b>. It is God—all—God—everywhere—God manifest, 
    and gazed on with undazzled eye. It is Jesus ever near—and seen without an 
    intervening cloud. Here on earth, ofttimes He is hidden, because sin 
    interposes, and distrust brings mist, and other scenes attract, and 
    indolence deadens the soul. In heaven there is no darkening medium. It is 
    eternal vision, and eternal adoration, of Jehovah, clearly 
    displayed—intensely and entirely loved.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, will you not, then, mount Pisgah, and let 
    thought revel in anticipating views? Such meditation is heaven on the path 
    to heaven. It is a foretaste, before earth be left.</p>
<p align="justify">Close not this humble volume, without deep resolve. Vow 
    in the spirit, to consecrate some portion of each day to searchings for 
    heaven in the Gospel-page. Become knowledgeable of your sure estate. Be not 
    a stranger to your near country. Often go in, perusing your own Canaan. And 
    may God meet you, as He met Moses! May He enlarge your sight to see—your 
    heart to love!</p>
<p align="justify">It is true wisdom to cultivate this Pisgah-meditation. 
    Thus <b>strength</b> is revived, and muscles are nerved to fight and 
    persevere. The combatant gains vigor, the racer presses on, when he beholds 
    the crown of victory almost reached. Think much of heaven, and you will soon 
    be there.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus <b>sanctity</b> progresses. Can he love sin, whose 
    soul is ever conversant with purity? Can he be won by siren-notes of earthly 
    pleasure, whose ears are ever drinking in the hallelujahs of the saved?</p>
<p align="justify">Thus <b>cares</b> grow light. Can his head hang down, or 
    his breast sigh, who is by constant thought an inhabitant of the realms of 
    bliss?</p>
<p align="justify">Thus <b>death</b> is welcomed as the friend, who comes to 
    change long-cherished hope into reality. Thus <b>Jesus</b> more and more is 
    prized and loved. We bless Him in proportion as we feel, that heaven is the 
    purchase of His grace, His work, His blood. When we say, He earned it—He 
    bestows it. Then we add, 'To Him be hourly praise—for Him let every moment 
    toil.'</p>
<p align="justify">Happy they, who gather such rich harvest on Pisgah's 
    summit! Spirit of God, strengthen my sight for such delightful gaze! Spirit 
    of God, use these poor pages to attract pilgrims to this mount!</p>
