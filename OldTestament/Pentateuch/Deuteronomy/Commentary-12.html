<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>GOD'S ISRAEL</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858 </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"Happy are you, O Israel; who is like unto you, O people 
    saved by the Lord, the shield of your help, and who is the sword of your 
    excellency! and your enemies shall be found liars unto you; and you shall 
    tread upon their high places."</p></i> Deut. 33:29.
<p align="justify">Moses thus speaks—and then on earth his lips forever 
    close. Just as his spirit spreads enraptured wings—just as he enters into 
    perfect light—he seems to pause, and take a farewell view of Israel's camp. 
    He now must leave the flock, for which he long had watched—the vineyard, in 
    which he long had toiled—the children dearer than his very life. But he 
    well knows, that they are God's especial care—loved above all nations of 
    the earth—bound in the bundle of distinguishing grace. Hence, joying in 
    their joy, and fervent in their hopes, he cannot check his overflowing 
    heart. His spirit thus finds vent, <i>"Happy are you, O Israel; who is like 
    unto you, O people saved by the Lord, the shield of your help, and who is 
    the sword of your excellency! and your enemies shall be found liars unto 
    you; and you shall tread upon their high places."</i></p>

<p align="justify">These precious words are obviously, in their first sense, 
    the portion of those tribes, whose feet now stood on Canaan's confines. But 
    the treasure is not theirs exclusively. Such thought is far too narrow. Here 
    is each true believer's lot. This heritage descends to all faith's sons. It 
    may be claimed by all, who to the end of time, trust in Christ Jesus—bathe 
    in His blood—put on His righteousness—and are the temple of His Spirit. 
    Happiness—perfect—heaven-born—heaven-sent—is their sure property. Here 
    are the pastures, in which they all are privileged to feed. Happy are you, O 
    child of God, who is like unto you!</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, you, then, are invited to draw out the 
    fragrance, which these delicious flowers present, and to luxuriate in these 
    pastures of delight.</p>
<p align="justify">What is the first element of this <b>HAPPINESS</b>? What 
    is the richest savor in this cup? What is the sweetest music in this note? 
    What is the brightest jewel in this crown? It is <b>salvation</b>—salvation 
    realized. "Who is like unto you, O people saved." Saved—so that sin can no 
    more injure, and self no more destroy, and Satan no more claim—saved, so 
    that soul-misery is infinitely distant—saved, so that God is your 
    Father—heaven is your home—a throne of glory is your high seat—and 
    hallelujahs are your eternal song. Is not this happiness? This joy at once 
    uplifts from earth. Let clouds of trial gather—let billows of affliction 
    toss—let persecution, threats, and sneers assail—the heart, which clasps 
    assurance of salvation, sits high above all other troubles. There is no 
    darkness, where this true light shines. "Happy are you, O Israel, who is 
    like unto you, O people saved!" </p>
<p align="justify">But assurance of salvation is not firm, unless it rests 
    upon a mighty rock. This rock is here displayed. It is the Lord—the Lord 
    Himself. It is Jehovah, strong in omnipotence—"Saved by the Lord!" </p>
<p align="justify">Mark well, <b>salvation is the Father's will</b>. He 
    writes the book of life. He frames the covenant of grace. He cannot change. 
    He cannot be diverted from His plans. None can obliterate His fixed decrees. 
    They must be saved, for whom He purposes salvation. Saved by the Father is 
    sure salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">Mark next, <b>salvation is the work of Jesus</b>. He 
    comes, able and qualified to save to the uttermost. He rescues captive souls 
    from Satan's grasp. By his blood He puts out the penal flames. By His 
    strength He shatters every fetter. By His own right hand He tears down the 
    gates of hell—and clears away all hindrance. He sends His angels to be 
    guards. He causes all revolving providences to bring good. He never leaves 
    His happy flock, until the crown is won. They must be saved, for whom He 
    thus works out salvation. Saved by Christ is sure salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">"Saved by the Lord." No man could help himself. United 
    companies could bring no aid. The hosts of the angelic world are vain to 
    take away one sin. Jesus alone is able to achieve such work. Alone He 
    undertakes. Alone He consummates. Alone He finishes. Thus the true Israel is 
    "Saved by the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">The eternal <b>Spirit</b> speeds on the wings of love to 
    lend His aid. He opens blinded eyes to see the glories of the cross. He 
    shows the grace and beauty of the dying Lamb. He melts the stony heart to 
    love the precious Lord. He makes the sinner one with Christ by faith, and so 
    an heir of God. Saved by the Spirit is sure salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">This salvation, then, is a sure Rock. Its summit towers 
    above the heaven of heavens. Its deep foundations cannot be uprooted. It 
    stands secure—complete—immovable. Nothing can detract from it. More cannot 
    be added. He must be happy, then, whose feet are set upon this stable 
    ground. The word is brightly true, "Happy are you, O Israel, who is like 
    unto you, O people saved by the Lord!"</p>
<p align="justify">But perhaps a sigh is heard, 'Will not mighty <b>foes</b> 
    strive to destroy this happiness?' Foes, indeed, are strong and many. There 
    is SATAN, hating with terrific hate, and aided with the countless troops of 
    hell. He comes on, armed with tremendous weapons, each barbed with venom, 
    each directed with consummate skill, each urged with super human force. Can 
    he be happy, who hourly stands in such a fight?</p>
<p align="justify">There is the WORLD, too, now smiling with seducing arts, 
    now bitter in sarcastic sneers, now menacing with poverty, contempt, 
    disgrace, and countless ills.</p>
<p align="justify">The FLESH, too, is a restless plague—an Achan in the 
    camp—a viper nurtured in the breast—a traitor hidden in the recesses of 
    the heart, ever willing to betray—ever ready to suck life-blood. There must 
    be danger in such a combat-field—and danger disturbs happiness.</p>
<p align="justify">But what, if the <b>defense</b> is so impenetrable—so 
    wide—so near—that none of these attacks can prosper? What, if a covering 
    shield averts each point? Then the calm warrior will dwell in blissful 
    peace, fearless of real hurt.</p>
<p align="justify">Now view the fact. Is not a shield prepared for every 
    child of faith? And that shield, is it not the Lord Himself? Yes, the word 
    loudly sounds—He is "The shield of your help." He screens. He shelters. He 
    protects. He keeps unharmed, uninjured, and unwounded. Adversaries, 
    therefore, must be infinite in number, more than omnipotent in strength, 
    before they can prevail.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, realize this sure defense. Go forth, brave to 
    encounter every conflict. Shielded by God, you are as safe, as if the heaven 
    of heavens were your covert. Behind this panoply you may smile at the 
    battering rage of the incessant shower, and sing "Happy am I, saved of the 
    Lord, who is the shield of my help!"</p>
<p align="justify">But Zion's warriors are not happy in security alone. They 
    covet trophies. Laurels must crown their brow. Now to be conquerors they 
    need offensive weapons. They must give wounds, and smite, and overthrow. 
    Their hands must wield a sword.</p>
<p align="justify">Happy believer! as you have God for a shield, so, too, a
    <b>sword</b> is sharpened for your use. It is not of the earth. It is framed 
    by no human skill. It is from heaven. Therefore it is resistless. It is the 
    Lord Himself. Therefore it is all-conquering. He is "the sword of your 
    excellency." Know then your power. Face each opponent. Advance to the 
    assault. Deal heavy blows. Spare not. The mighty God strikes with your arm. 
    And when He strikes, each giant-adversary must fall low.</p>
<p align="justify">Happy are you, so screened! Happy are you, so equipped 
    for victories! What, though hell's troops move on, proud in their boastings, 
    swelling in wrathful words of menace! It is added, "They shall be found 
    liars unto you." Their arrogance shall be, as empty bubbles. Their vaunting 
    pride shall pass, as the passing wind. Their threats shall vanish, as the 
    smoke. They may accuse—they may insinuate a host of doubts—they may 
    suggest, that God will fail, and your soul perish, before the conflict end. 
    But these vile whisperings are false. The fight will gloriously end. Your 
    feet shall crush their necks. The Spirit of truth, by Moses' lips, sounds 
    these grand words—"Your enemies shall be found liars unto you, and you 
    shall tread upon their high places." </p>
<p align="justify">Reader, I trust, that you now are well taught, where 
    happiness alone can dwell. Its home is with God's Israel. It is the portion 
    of the chosen race. It is the heritage of those, who know and love the Lord. 
    Under the shelter of His wings, His people rest encircled with these joys. 
    Let such open their eyes to view their happy state. Let them receive with 
    faith the countless pledges of their God. Is it not said, "He, that spared 
    not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him 
    also freely give us all things!" Rom. 8:32. Is it not said, "All things are 
    yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, 
    or things present, or things to come, all are yours, and you are Christ's, 
    and Christ is God's." 1 Cor. 3:21-23. Is it not said, "The ransomed of the 
    Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon 
    their heads—they shall obtain joy and gladness—and sorrow and sighing 
    shall flee away." Is. 35:10. Only believe, and become happy in this 
    happiness. "Happy are you, O Israel." Only believe, and rejoice with joy 
    unspeakable and full of glory. Faith ever sings, and happy is its song.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, this tract would sincerely detain you, while it 
    makes a final effort to impress your heart. Pause, then, and say, is 
    happiness your lot? Do you arise with morning light to joy? Do you move 
    joyously throughout the day? Is joy the hand, which bolts your evening door? 
    Your head hangs down. A sigh tells a sad tale. Your feet have not attained 
    this happy ground. How is it? You have sought happiness, but you have sought 
    it, where it never grows. The <b>world</b>, perhaps, enticed you. It showed 
    a panoramic view of glittering honors—tinsel wealth—vain titles—empty 
    bubbles of applause—and fading flowers of visionary peace. You toiled long 
    in the pursuit; and now, wearied—worn-out—desponding, you confess, the 
    world has been a miserable cheat.</p>
<p align="justify">Perhaps a more refined bait has allured. Perhaps science 
    and literature's page have courted. For a while you have found interesting 
    converse with brilliant thoughts, and lofty flights of intellect. But still 
    you are not happy. There is a void. There is distress. Conscience is 
    restless and disturbed. The heart finds no repose on such a pillow. The bark 
    cannot cast anchor on such sand. "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, and 
    vexation of spirit." Alas! you are not happy.</p>
<p align="justify">Know, then, you never can be, while apart from God. 
    Listen. Turn not away. Cast not aside these lines. Is it too late? You live. 
    Jesus still lives. The living word still cries, "Come unto Me, and I will 
    give you rest." Be, then, persuaded. Approach the cross on bended 
    knees—with suppliant lip—in deep humility—with earnest prayer. Confess 
    your need. Avow your willingness to be Christ's. Place your whole soul and 
    heart in His redeeming hands. Wrestle with Him. Let Him not go, until your 
    burdens fall, and peace swells like a rising tide. He can bring back to God. 
    He can assure of pardon. He can reveal His pierced hands and side. He can 
    bestow the title-deeds of life. He can admit you, as an adopted child, to 
    the high family of grace. Then you will fully feel, how true are Moses' last 
    words, "Happy are you, O Israel; who is like unto you, O people saved by the 
    Lord, the shield of your help, and who is the sword of your excellency! and 
    your enemies shall be found liars unto you; and you shall tread upon their 
    high places."</p>
<p align="justify">Holy Spirit, use these humble lines as seed of happiness, 
    now and ever, to each reader's soul!</p>
