<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>The Tribe of
    </b></font><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>LEVI</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858<i><br/> <br/>    "Of Levi, he said, Let Your Thummin, and Your Urim be 
    with Your holy one, whom You tested at Massah, and with whom You contended 
    with at the waters of Meribah—who said unto his father and to his mother, I 
    have not seen him—neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own 
    children—for they observed Your word and kept Your covenant. They shall 
    teach Jacob Your judgments and Israel Your law—they shall put incense 
    before You, and whole burnt-sacrifice upon Your altar. Bless, Lord, his 
    substance, and accept the work of his hands—smite through the loins of 
    those who rise against him, and of those who hate him, that they rise not 
    again."</i> Deut. 33:8-11.</p>
<p align="justify">Levi was peculiarly the Lord's. This tribe toiled not in 
    military service. Its happy hours revolved in <i>holy</i> duties. Its life 
    was round the altars. The tabernacle was its charge, and its employ looked 
    always unto God.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus it appears <i>a ministerial type</i>. We see in it 
    the pastor's portrait. It represents that heaven-born, heaven-sent band, 
    which stands apart to deal with man for God.</p>
<p align="justify">This is life's highest privilege—earth's grandest 
    dignity—honor, which angels do not share—glory, which drives all other 
    heroes into shade. The greatest minister is our greatest man. His words 
    achieve the noblest triumphs on the world's stage.</p>
<p align="justify">What then, will Moses' lips pour forth, when Levi's tribe 
    comes for its blessing? Reader, draw near to hear! Spirit of God, draw near 
    to teach!</p>
<p align="justify">Choice servants are addressed—therefore, choice gifts     will be bestowed. Levi's outline is first drawn. Three bold characteristics     are displayed. These threefold marks are, holiness—acquaintedness with 
    trial—impartial zeal.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. The tribe is HOLY.</p></b> "Let Your Thummin and Your Urim 
    be with Your holy one." Holiness! What is it, but the image of our 
    God—conformity to Christ—the stamp of heaven upon the soul. It is God 
    living in the heart—moving in each step—breathing in each breath—heard in 
    each word—pervading the whole man. It is the Spirit's presence, saying, let 
    there be light, and there is light—let there be love, and there is 
    love—cleaving sin's roots, and they decay—sowing pure seed, and it bears 
    fruit. It is an upward course—leaving the world behind—eschewing 
    evil—hating what Jesus hates—panting to be godlike. It is that lofty 
    state, which springs from reception of the Gospel. Truth sanctifies. Error 
    is darkness in mind and life. Christ seen—Christ loved—forms the new man. 
    So, too, it is happiness without alloy. The holy man alone is happy. All sin 
    is misery. Departure from it is the path of peace.
<p align="justify">Servants of Christ, seek holiness. Let this crown sparkle 
    on your brow. From head to foot let this robe clothe you. Inhabit earth as 
    Zion's citizens. So will your life preach louder than your lips. So will 
    your walk have magnet-influence, attracting unto heaven. A holy shepherd 
    wins a holy flock.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Next, Levi had conflicted with TEMPTATION</p></b>—"Whom 
    You tested at Massah, and with whom You contended with at the waters of 
    Meribah."
<p align="justify">It was one of Israel's darkest days, when the camp 
    murmured, because water failed. We lack clear evidence, that Levi was not 
    tainted with this guilt. But from this mention, we take hope, that he stood 
    firm, when others fell. But whether he resisted or gave way, the temptation 
    put him to the test. Massah proved him. Meribah sifted his principles.</p>
<p align="justify">All Adam's sons live tempted lives. Satan is not yet 
    chained. There is no place—no heart—which he infest not. His wily crafts 
    exceed all power to count. And his wrath increases, as the time grows less. 
    But the Lord's ministers are his especial hate. Against them every dart is 
    hurled. For them all snares are laid. And why? Their fall brings many to the 
    dust. The sheep will wander, when the shepherd strays.</p>
<p align="justify">But still his weapons often wound himself. For frequently 
    temptation proves to be a purifying furnace, and a brightening file. The 
    tempted lose their dross, and gain more brilliant polish. So, too, it is <i>
    a school of discipline</i>. Here ministers drink deeply of experience's cup. 
    They thus become expert to sympathize with others' woes—to open out the 
    adversary's arts—to point to strongholds of defense—to stay the slipping 
    feet, and to pour balm into the stricken soul. Thus trials give ability and 
    skill. Satan uses them; and the result is injury to himself.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">3. Levi has, too, the praise of honest ZEAL</p></b>—"Who 
    said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him—neither did he 
    acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children." These words again 
    remind of dreadful evil in the camp. Moses was absent in the mount. The 
    impatient people ask for gods to lead them on. A golden calf is made. They 
    worship it. The air echoes with festive noise. Moses in haste comes down, 
    and cries, "Who is on the Lord's side? let him come unto me. And all the 
    sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him." Ex. 32:26. They draw 
    their swords. They rush to vindicate the cause of God, They spare not friend 
    nor relative. No ties of kindred or of blood screen from due vengeance. 
    Where they find sin, there they deal death. God gave the zeal, and braced 
    their nerves, and smiled upon their deed, and thus applauds it.
<p align="justify">You ministers, mark this. Your office calls you to 
    reprove—rebuke—condemn. Evil is evil, wherever it is seen. You must stand
    <i>flint-like</i> before all the world. If relatives and friends transgress, 
    they must be boldly checked. You speak for God. You must be honest, fearing 
    no man's face.</p>
<p align="justify">Levi, thus portrayed in threefold character, then 
    receives a sixfold blessing.</p>
<p align="justify">1. A grand <b>distinction</b> first appears. "Let your 
    Thummin and your Urim be with your holy one." The message is distinct. Let 
    Levi ever stand a priest before his God. Let the breast-plate, with its 
    mysterious contents, ever gird him. These contents, though shrouded in some 
    mist, intimate <i>perfection </i>and<i> light</i>. At once we see the 
    foremost ornaments of ministerial life.</p>
<p align="justify">PERFECTION! Nothing inferior may be sought. The walk may 
    have no stain. The garments must be purely white. The keen observer may 
    detect no fault. Oh! what vigilance—what care—what prayer are needed! 
    Lapses in those who guide, produce extensive ruin. Lord, lead Your servants 
    in a perfect way! Be a protecting shield around! Adorn them beauteously with 
    every grace!</p>
<p align="justify">LIGHT! Father of lights, be their light! May they forever 
    dwell beneath Your rays, and, as reflecting mirrors, scatter radiance 
    around! May they go forth, as champions clad in armor of light! Thus may 
    true Thummin and true Urim ever be the glory of those, who are ambassadors 
    for Christ!</p>
<p align="justify">2. Next, "They shall <b>teach</b> Jacob Your judgments 
    and Israel Your law." Here is the pastor's solemn dignity. He occupies a 
    pulpit-throne. Thence he announces the decrees of the eternal kingdom. The 
    flock sit round to hear God's judgments—to receive God's law.</p>
<p align="justify">Preacher, take heed. Your volume is heaven-inspired. Add 
    not—it is impiety. Detract not—it is sacrilege. It is not yours to frame a 
    system or devise a code. Your message is prepared. Your text-book is divine. 
    Read and proclaim. Let all your teaching flow in one clear stream—"Thus 
    says the Lord." The Gospel committed to your trust is God's glory—His 
    wisdom in the highest—the transcript of His mind—the mirror of His 
    love—the power, which drives out darkness, softens hearts, gives new birth 
    to dead souls, breaks Satan's chains, snatches from hell, uplifts to heaven, 
    converts bold rebels to devoted friends, and plants a paradise in the 
    world's waste. Then PREACH THIS WORD—only—clearly—fully. Be faithful. Be 
    distinct. Signs of salvation will then surely follow. The seed of truth is 
    never lost. It has an innate life. It is impregnate with divinity. Who can 
    destroy it? Truth long since would have died, if Satan or man's hate had 
    power to slay.</p>
<p align="justify">3. <b>Honors</b> are added. "They shall put incense 
    before You—and whole Burnt-sacrifice upon Your altar." They shall cause <i>
    sweet savor</i> to ascend. The Gospel-savor is the sweet merits of Christ's 
    fragrant work. They shall pile victims on the altar. The Gospel has but one 
    victim—the God-man slain.</p>
<p align="justify">These words are as a trumpet-voice to warn each minister. 
    The pulpit stands his golden altar, from which precious fragrance should 
    never fail to rise. Sermons should all be redolent of Jesus's worth. Each 
    utterance should be, as curling incense, filling heaven and earth with joy. 
    The pulpit stands, too, his brazen altar, on which victims bleed. The 
    congregation should be led to sit around the cross. The dying Jesus should 
    be the one grand sight—giving Himself a willing offering, that guilt may 
    thus be cleansed, and sins obliterated, and debts paid, and curse removed, 
    and God appeased, and hell's gates closed, and heaven's throne won.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It follows—"Bless, Lord, His substance." Levi had no 
    allotted lands. "I am your portion, and your inheritance," said God. Numb. 
    18:20. The tabernacle-offerings are their supply. A special maintenance is 
    their lot. Special servants are specially sustained.</p>
<p align="justify">They must be well fed, whom God thus supplies. Let then 
    no faithful pastor fear. He may not have—he covets not—abundance of 
    earth's pelf. But the barrel will not fail. The cruise will still suffice. 
    In God he has incalculable wealth. "The Lord is the portion of my 
    inheritance and of my cup—you maintain my lot." Paul testifies, "I have 
    all, and abound—I am full." Phil. 4:18.</p>
<p align="justify">5. It is encouragingly added—"Accept the work of his 
    hands." Smile, Lord, when Levi thus draws near. Turn not from the prayer, 
    the service, and the praise, which he presents upon Your altar.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is the joy, the hope, the strength, the victory of 
    the faithful servant. He knows, that truth proclaimed by life and lip—in 
    public and in private—cannot but prosper. The Gospel-sickle reaps not in 
    vain. Harvests of saved souls will be brought in. Heaven's garner will be 
    filled. He will present before God's throne children begotten by his 
    words—jewels drawn by his efforts from nature's quarry, and polished as 
    pillars for the palace of the King. The labor is not in vain. The Lord 
    accepts.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly—"Smite through the loins of those who rise 
    against him, and of those who hate him, that they rise not again." A 
    Korah—a Dathan—an Abiram rose to assail. But their defeat was signal. They 
    died not the common death of men. The gaping earth devoured them. Numb. 
    16:32.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">So</p></i> <i>faithful ministers must always expect the 
    adversary's rage.</i> They foil him most. Therefore he most desires their 
    ruin. As against Christ—so against them—he marshals his whole force. But 
    while he mightily assails, Omnipotence protects. While his many legions 
    harass, an infinity of love defends. Thus they hold on. Thus they hold out. 
    Thus they will ever bloom, like Aaron's rod, until the last saint is 
    gathered in. Their teaching voice will sound on earth, until the hallelujah 
    is full-toned above. They go on conquering, for Jesus fights beside them.
<p align="justify">You ministers, turn not from Levi, without many a solemn 
    thought. There is no <i>work</i> like yours—so holy—so exalted—so 
    godlike! There is no <i>help</i> like yours. Jesus, who sends you, goes 
    forth by your side. There are no <i>hopes</i> like yours. The brightest 
    crown is that, which sparkles with redeemed gems. Bless God—take 
    courage—work. Uplift the cross with prayerful hands. Preach the true 
    Christ. Live the true life of faith. Then Levi's full inheritance will raise 
    you high. How high, God only knows! Christ's fellow-workers will not be low 
    among Christ's fellow-heirs.</p>
