<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE LAST TRIBES</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858<i><br/> <br/>    "Of Naphtali he said, O <b>Naphtali</b>, satisfied with 
    favor, and full with the blessing of the Lord, possess the west and the 
    south. And of Asher he said, Let <b>Asher</b> be blessed with children; let 
    him be acceptable to his brethren; and let him dip his foot in oil. Your 
    shoes shall be iron and brass; and as your days, so shall your strength be."</i> 
    Deut. 33:23-25.</p>
<p align="justify">Naphtali and Asher now appear. They are the last in 
    order—not the least in favor. Their blessing proves again the truth often 
    stated, that <i>the treasury of God is a vast mine</i>. It bestows much—but 
    much ever remains. The sun has poured down floods of rays on a long train of 
    generations, but the streams cease not—the fountain is not impoverished. 
    The elders of faith's house have been most plenteously enriched, but we may 
    still as plenteously obtain. Store upon store—wealth upon wealth—grace 
    upon grace—still fill the heavenly coffers. There is no end, no limit. Full 
    hands are ever open to dispense. Abundant gifts in ages past still leave 
    abundant gifts for present and for future days.</p>
<p align="justify">My soul, if you are poor, it is not because God's 
    blessings fail. Let faith not cease to bring its empty vessels, they will 
    not cease to be supplied. "He gives more grace." Jam. 4:6.</p>
<p align="justify">Mark, how Naphtali's rich portion confirms this. This 
    tribe is "satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the Lord." 
    Possession of the west and south is also granted. Their lot is fixed in 
    fertile and healthful spots. The goodly fruits, which crowned their 
    baskets—the choice position of their lands—their sheltered valleys—their 
    inland sea, fulfilled this promise. Nurtured, in nature's richest lap, they 
    reveled in favor and in blessings.</p>
<p align="justify">But the possession thus granted seems to hint at nobler 
    gain. When Jesus put on our flesh, and trod our earth, this tribe was chosen 
    as His frequented home. Here stood Capernaum—the scene of His most mighty 
    works. Here He displayed the brightness of those glorious deeds, which 
    testified divine commission. Here the God-man moved—healing 
    disease—allaying pain—soothing deep misery—reviving drooping 
    hearts—uttering pure wisdom—fulfilling the long line of prophecy—lifting 
    high the Gospel beacon. This was surpassing honor. This was privilege 
    exalting to the very heavens. "O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full 
    with the blessing of the Lord," your eyes were privileged to see incarnate 
    Deity.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, come now and trace in <b>NAPHTALI'S</b> 
    distinguished lot, the features of your happy case. Is not this picture 
    drawn, that you may realize your plenteous treasures? You, too, are 
    "satisfied with favor." You, too, are "full with the blessing of the Lord."
    </p>
<p align="justify">"Satisfied with favor." You once were dead in trespasses 
    and sins. You moved a living carcase with a lifeless soul. Your every step 
    was hellward. Your every moment hurried you towards endless woe. Your life 
    was ignorance—rebellion—slavery—disgrace. But now the darkness is 
    dispersed, and true light shines. You see the cross. You use the blood. You 
    stand in a new world of spiritual delight. You are a new creation of 
    thought—affection—hope—desire. You live for God—to God—with God—in 
    God. </p>
<p align="justify">But whence the change? Did it result from nature and your 
    own resolve? Did rolling years beget this wisdom? Oh! no. You owe the whole 
    to sovereign grace. God, of His own free will, looked down with favor on 
    your ruined soul. His favor gave you, as a jewel, to His Son—and gave His 
    Son to be your uttermost salvation. His favor sent the Spirit to make you 
    one, by faith, with Christ. Thus all things are yours. Child of grace, do 
    you not rapturously sing, I am indeed a Naphtali, "Satisfied with favor!"</p>
<p align="justify">"Full," too, "with the blessing of the Lord." Happy 
    state! The Father ever lives to bless. Jesus ever reigns to bless. The 
    Spirit ever works to bless. The morning dawns, that blessings may descend. 
    The day goes on, that blessings may proceed. The clouds, which seem to 
    portend storms, bring showers of blessing. Life is a blessing, while it 
    lasts. Death is a blessing, when it comes. <i>
    Trials—afflictions—losses—temptations—are blessings, because they wean 
    from earth.</i> When time is left behind, and eternity reviews life's 
    journey; then will the truth stand prominently out, that each saint's cup 
    was "full with the blessing of the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">But Naphtali's distinction was, that <b>Jesus chose it as 
    His earthly dwelling.</b> Believer, have not you similar delight? Your soul 
    is Jesus' home. He, whom no heavens can hold—He, to whom infinity is a mere 
    speck—scorns not to abide within you. "I am come into my garden, my sister, 
    my spouse." You may always realize His present smile. You may always hold 
    sweet communion. You may ever whisper to His ready ear, and catch the joy of 
    His replying voice. You may always lean upon His arm, and rest upon His 
    breast. Christ dwells in your heart by faith.</p>
<p align="justify">Moses looks on from Naphtali to <b>ASHER</b>. His is the 
    final blessing. It is largely bounteous. It seals again the truth, that <i>
    God delights to scatter favors with unsparing hand. </i>It has a voice still 
    calling believers to a treasure-house, where they may ask with open mouth, 
    and take with open hand. </p>
<p align="justify">"Let Asher be blessed with children—let him be 
    acceptable to his brethren—and let him dip his foot in oil. Your shoes 
    shall be iron and brass—and as your days, so shall your strength be." Deut. 
    33:25.</p>
<p align="justify">Out of this crowded diadem only the last sparkling gem 
    can be examined. But is it not a jewel far exceeding this world's boasted 
    wealth! "As your days, so shall your strength be." This promise intimates 
    the fact, that days will vary. As in nature, clouds screen the sun—and 
    storms descend—and tempests rage—and hurricanes sweep fearfully—and rapid 
    changes come—so is it in the life of grace. The morning brightness often 
    gives way to mid-day gloom. The mid-day gloom brings in evening wildness. 
    The skies are now serene—we look above on one expanse of clearest blue—now 
    the scene varies, and thick darkness frowns, or forked lightning darts its 
    angry shafts. Faith has no lofty seat, which trials cannot reach—and no 
    seclusion, which distress cannot invade. But it has a rock, from which no 
    foes can shake—the rock is Asher's blessing, "As your days, so shall your 
    strength be."</p>
<p align="justify">Strong in this pledge—bold in this might—safe in this 
    safety—confident in this security—impregnable within this fort—happy in 
    this happiness, faith feels, "I shall not be injured, or destroyed. Days may 
    be dark and sad; I may be sorely buffeted; but strength shall be enough. All 
    earthly props may fall, but I shall stand. All human friends may flee, but I 
    shall not be left alone. All trials may in turn assail, but they shall not 
    prevail. Satan may hurl each dart, but a strong shield shall ward them off. 
    All snares may be most craftily laid, but they shall not destructively 
    entangle. The world may use its every enticing art, but I shall be enabled 
    to escape. It may mutter its threats, but I have a sufficient refuge. I may 
    be tempted—persecuted—wronged—but not cast down. I often may fear. I 
    often may see a yawning precipice before my feet. The ground may tremble. 
    But I am safe. I hold a saving promise—"As your days, so shall your 
    strength be." </p>
<p align="justify">Faith can fly back, and commune with the elder saints. It 
    hears from all the self-same story. We had a course through stormy seas, 
    where billows tossed, and rocks were sharp, and quicksands opened their 
    engulfing jaws. But our barks rode triumphant to the haven. As our days, so 
    was our strength.</p>
<p align="justify">Jacob speaks of an outcast life—and many enemies—and 
    overwhelming griefs—and lonely tremblings—and inward fears—but still 
    strength was built up. He held on to the end. He testifies, The Angel 
    redeemed me from all evil. David presents a painful chart. What cruel hate 
    of men! what thirstings for his blood! what foul assaults of Satan! what 
    stumbles! ah! what falls! His soul-life often seemed trodden in the dust. 
    But he revives. Oil of grace supplies the flickering lamp. The heaven-lit 
    flame never expires. Others are bound, and dragged to torturing flames; but 
    they survive. The menace cannot overcome. The fire cannot consume. Their day 
    is very terrible, but strength endures. Others are cast a prey to angry 
    beasts, but their peace is as a placid lake. The outward scene is wild 
    affright, but their souls never quake. The Lord is with them, and their 
    strength abides.</p>
<p align="justify">View Paul and Silas in the inmost cell. Their wounds are 
    smarting—the dungeon is deep—the chains clash heavily. But inward comfort 
    flows in full tide. Thanksgivings swell. They loudly sing, and bless a 
    loving God.</p>
<p align="justify">Mark the heroic calmness of the early preachers of the 
    faith. Threats and imprisonment are their lot. They feel, as men; but they 
    rejoice, as saints. They neither faint nor fail. They sit unmoved amid an 
    earthquake of alarms. As their days, so is their strength. It is Paul's glad 
    acknowledgment—but not Paul's sole experience—"Sorrowful, yet always 
    rejoicing." "I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me." 
    Martyrs and confessors press forward to give like witness. They joy in 
    anguish—they embrace the stake—they hug encircling flames. They find, that 
    days are often terrible, but never without needful strength. Was Stephen 
    left without support, when, with angelic look, he kneeled down, and, praying 
    for his murderers, amid a shower of stones, fell tranquilly asleep?</p>
<p align="justify">The whole bright throng around the throne attest the 
    same. They passed through many perils—sorrows—fights—but heavenly 
    strength braced their loins—sustained their hearts—fanned their desponding 
    spirits—and made them more than conquerors. From every lip one testimony 
    sounds. The word is true, "As your days, so shall your strength be."</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, tremble not. Take courage. Go forward. You may 
    be young, and a long course may open to your view. Foes must infest it. You 
    have no promise, that trials will not come. Satan spares none. He grants no 
    Sabbath of repose. But face the worst, bold and serene in Christ. Hold fast 
    the staff of grace. Trust and fear not. Trust and pray always. Trust and 
    plead this word. It is not Asher's only. It is your portion. You will surely 
    find, "As your days, so shall your strength be."</p>
<p align="justify">You may be worn with malady, and tottering down the 
    valley of years. You may dread Jordan's waves, and the cold touch of death. 
    But clasp the promise. The greater need brings the more large support. How 
    many tremblers have gone triumphantly to rest! <i>Christ's love exceeds all 
    hopes.</i> His merciful fulfillments surpass each pledge. He cannot fail. He 
    cannot disappoint. Come what may—this will be true, "As your days, so shall 
    your strength be."</p>
<p align="justify">But faithfulness must add, that these rich mercies are 
    not Israel's portion only. Those who are Christ's, possess, and claim, and use, 
    and joy in them. They, who reject Him, see but a casket, which they open 
    not. Their days have trouble without strength. Their future will have misery 
    without end. Let not such turn from Naphtali and Asher until they share what 
    Naphtali and Asher gained from God. The blessings of these tribes may yet, 
    through grace, be sought and found.</p>
<p align="justify">Eternal Spirit, mighty source of light and inward life, 
    give Your help! Open each eye to see the beauty, riches, blessedness, and 
    glory of God's heritage. Stir up each heart to wrestle, until the word is 
    heard—"Great is your faith, be it done unto you, even as you will."</p>
