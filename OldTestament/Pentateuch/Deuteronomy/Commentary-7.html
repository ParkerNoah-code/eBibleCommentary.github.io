<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>The  Tribe of JOSEPH</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858<i><br/> <br/>    "Of <b>Joseph</b> he said, Blessed of the Lord be his 
    land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that 
    couches beneath, and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and 
    for the precious things put forth by the moon, and for the chief things of 
    the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, and 
    for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof, and for the good 
    will of Him, who dwelt in the bush. Let the blessing come upon the head of 
    Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him, who was separated from his 
    brethren. His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are 
    like the horns of wild oxen; with them he shall push the people together to 
    the ends of the earth—and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they 
    are the thousands of Manasseh."</i> Deut. 33:13-17.</p>
<p align="justify">This blessing is an overflowing stream. Gift follows 
    gift, as if beneficence left bounds behind. Treasures are scattered with 
    unsparing hand. The grant seems to say,' Take, until no more can be 
    received.'</p>
<p align="justify">Joseph is the tribe thus signally enriched. He sparkles 
    as the brightest jewel of his father's house. His early grace—his 
    persecuted youth—his rescue from the pit—his firm resistance of enticing 
    evil—his prison-sufferings—his exaltation to be a prince in Egypt—his 
    call to be a savior to his house—with all the tender incidents of his 
    affecting tale, are verdant spots in the first Bible-pages. He lived no 
    common life. No common blessing passes to his seed.</p>
<p align="justify">While faith, too, journeys by his side from scene to 
    scene—from early hatred until knees bowed before him—from the low dungeon 
    to the lofty throne—it quickly sees <i>a living type of Jesus. </i>The 
    varying lights and shadows graphically show the Lord. Hence it is no 
    surprise, that special honors crown him. The lips of Jacob gave him an 
    exceeding share. Gen. 49:22-26. The lips of Moses add new stores. It is fit, 
    that those who trace out most of Christ to men, should stand pre-eminent in 
    heavenly favor. Hence Joseph enters on this goodly lot.</p>
<p align="justify">His CHARACTER is first described. This claims, then, 
    primary regard. It is a simple portrait. All is comprised in this one 
    praise—he is the "<b>separated</b> from his brethren." He differs, and 
    because he differs, he is cast out. He will not walk in evil ways. And evil 
    men despise him. He loathes their vices, and they loathe his grace. He 
    cannot live, as one with them. And they conspire, that he shall live no 
    more. But while the wicked frown, God smiles. While scales of enmity are 
    full, the scales of recompensing favor far outweigh.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, while you survey this feature of God's child, 
    ask, 'Is your likeness here?' Do not forget, that two families inhabit 
    earth. In principle—in taste—in habit—in desire, they are as separate, as 
    light from darkness—cold from heat—pole from pole—life from death. There 
    is the serpent's seed. There is the heaven-born race. There is the world. 
    There is the little flock of grace. There is the broad road. There is the 
    narrow way. There are the sheep. There are the goats. Hence the importance 
    of the question, Have you escaped from nature's thraldom? Do your feet tread 
    the upward path of life? Do you belong to Belial, or to Christ?</p>
<p align="justify">Be wise, and ascertain your real position. Rest not a 
    slave among slaves—a worldling among worldlings. Tarry not in the doomed 
    plain. Come out, like Joseph. He was separate. And did he lose thereby? Let 
    his blessing now give reply.</p>
<p align="justify">The BLESSING is so worded, as to exhibit the fullest 
    measure of earthly fertility. All causes, which concur to multiply and ripen 
    fruits, shall lend their congenial influence. The land shall blossom, as an 
    Eden. The canopy of heaven shall pour down softening rains. The gentle dew 
    shall ever sparkle in refreshing drops. Springs from beneath shall permeate 
    the clods. The annual and the monthly produce shall periodically bloom. The 
    ancient mountains shall supply their tribute. Their caverns shall be rich in 
    ore. The lasting hills shall slope luxuriant in olives and in vines. Joseph 
    shall know no scarcity or dearth. Its borders shall abound in "the precious 
    things of the earth and the fullness thereof." The corn shall widely wave in 
    golden wealth. The grass shall spread its verdant carpet. All cattle and all 
    flocks shall browse. Thus earth shall bring her every treasure—and Joseph's 
    sons shall feast at nature's overflowing table.</p>
<p align="justify">Such is the superficial view. Thus the first aspect shows 
    abundance of terrestrial goods. But these strong images are bright with 
    higher significance.</p>
<p align="justify">Surely this is a vivid scene of better wealth. Our 
    precious Bible—the book of every age and climate—often culls <i>nature's</i> 
    field to impress <i>spiritual</i> ideas. Things visible portray invisible 
    possessions. This principle leads us to look from the outward landscape, and 
    to seek deeper lessons for the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">The parallel is quickly found. Obvious illustrations soon 
    occur. For instance, the heart is often parched and dry. But Jesus can 
    sweetly soften. "He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass—as 
    showers, that water the earth." Ps. 72:6. Each morning opens on a scene of 
    need. Each morning finds supplies. "I will be as the dew unto Israel." Hos. 
    14:5. The roots of grace are planted on a flinty soil. There must be 
    constant nourishment, else the leaves wither. Fear not, believer, "You shall 
    be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail 
    not." Is. 58:11. "He shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that 
    spreads out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat comes, but 
    her leaf shall be green, and shall not be careful in the year of drought, 
    neither shall cease from yielding fruit." Jer. 17:8. </p>
<p align="justify">The inner man, once profuse with every noxious 
    weed—where thorns and briers raised their fruitless heads—when cheered by 
    heaven-sent rays, smiles as a garden, blossoms as a rose. The promise 
    stands, "I will plant trees—cedar, acacia, myrtle, olive, cypress, fir, and 
    pine—on <i>barren</i> land." Isaiah 41:19. Then precious crops of <i>holy 
    words</i>, and <i>holy works</i> in due succession come. Then fruits of 
    godliness ripen in turn. <i>Faith</i> stands a noble tree. <i>Hope</i> 
    raises high its richly laden boughs. <i>Love</i> scatters fragrance all 
    around. Clusters of <i>righteousness</i> bear witness, this is the vineyard 
    of the Lord—the field watered by grace—filled with the Spirit's seed—and 
    cherished by heaven's brightest beams.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, turn not from this spiritual landscape, without 
    the thought, 'Is your soul thus?' The test of state is always one—"By their 
    fruits you shall know them." The word is true, "He who abides in Me, and I 
    in Him, the same brings forth much fruit." John 15:5. Do you thus abide in 
    Christ? Do you draw fertilizing sap from that rich stem? Do you sit ripening 
    beneath the sunny smiles of God? So only can your heart be Joseph's fertile 
    land.</p>
<p align="justify">Joseph has more than promise of this large prosperity. 
    There is <b>assurance of divine good will</b>. This is his crowning 
    blessing. He inherits "the good will of Him who dwelt in the bush."</p>
<p align="justify">Observe, how Moses cherished to his last hour that early 
    revelation of his Lord. He can look back on much, and close, and dear 
    communion—but that display is still most splendid in the retrospective 
    view. No time can dim its luster.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, what can obscure on memory's mirror your first 
    clear view of Jesus! What can deaden on your retentive ear the voice, which 
    first assured you of His love! Your heaven began, when you had evidence of 
    His good will. Cherish this sweet assurance. Open your eyes more clearly to 
    discern it. Clasp tight your hands around it. Through every day—in every 
    day's concerns—think, what high favor hovers round you! From all eternity 
    good will regarded you. To all eternity it will warmly burn, and through all 
    time it will remain your guard. It was good will to undertake your full 
    redemption. </p>
<p align="justify">It was good will to leave heaven's glories in your 
    service. It was good will to live and die in your behalf. The low 
    estate—the sufferings—the groans—the agony—the cross—the streaming 
    blood—the death—the grave—all manifest good will. And now this favor 
    enriches you with daily grace. It will not fail, while life endures. It will 
    watch by your dying bed. It will receive your fleeting breath. It will 
    present you faultless before the Father's throne. It will rejoice over you, 
    while endless ages roll. Nothing can quench—nothing can part from—"the 
    good will of Him who dwelt in the bush."</p>
<p align="justify">Joseph's blessing still flows on. Distinctive evidence, 
    that he is the heir of good will, follows. Thus it abounds. "His glory is 
    like the firstling of his bullock." He shall stand 
    stately—beauteous—strong, as the prime offspring of the herd. He shall 
    move the admiration of the plain.</p>
<p align="justify">Here, again, the deepest truth is spiritual. Where shall 
    we find the glory of the human race? It can be only in the realms of grace. 
    There is no loveliness in this world's slaves. They are 
    polluted—tainted—marred by sin—crippled in power—impotent for good. But 
    when the Spirit leads them to a Savior's blood, and thus obliterates each 
    filthy stain—when faith puts on the robes of divine righteousness—when 
    power from heaven renews the nature—when they receive the lineaments of 
    Christ—when they reflect the God-man's image; then weakness and deformity 
    are followed by strength and beauty—then this grand pledge is fully 
    redeemed—"His glory is like the firstling of his bullock." Deut. 33:17. It 
    is ever true, that each Joseph is made strong in a Savior's strength, and 
    beauteous in a Savior's beauty, and moves among his fellow-men, the salt of 
    the earth, the light of the world.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, Joseph <b>shall do valiantly</b>. His prowess 
    shall crush every foe. His conquering power is thus described—"His horns 
    are like the horns of wild oxen—with them he shall push the people together 
    to the ends of the earth." Deut. 33:17.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus faith's life is one triumphant conflict. Who can 
    recount the adversaries checking the upward march! But opposition is in 
    vain. There is a Captain, who implants courage, girds up the loins, and 
    cheers His followers onward, until the everlasting palms are waved, and 
    everlasting hallelujahs sound. The blood-washed troops prevail, strong in 
    the Lord, and in the power of His might. </p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, <b>his numbers shall exceedingly expand</b>. 
    "They are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of 
    Manasseh." The child of God often mourns his solitude. He seems to be as a 
    lonely cottage in the deserted vineyard. Is. 1:8. But when the total flock 
    is gathered in—when the whole body is complete—when Jesus brings the 
    collected sheaves to heaven's garner; then how vast will be the circle upon 
    circle of saved souls! <i>The ransomed multitude is numberless. The death of 
    Jesus gives birth to countless life.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Reader, think of <i>the world's tinsel gifts</i>—weigh 
    Satan's wages, as earned in time, and paid in the eternal world. Then turn 
    and contrast the blessing, which "comes upon the head of Joseph—and upon 
    the top of the head of him, who was separated from his brethren." Shall this 
    bright crown be yours? Jesus's hands bestow it. Seek it. Ask it. None 
    seek—none ask—in vain.</p>
<p align="justify">Ah! wretched worldling, when will you be wise! Come and 
    display your treasure. Your best is but a fading flower—a fleeting 
    shadow—a tottering reed—a failing brook. And how long can your hands 
    retain it? How long!—You startle. You tremble. You turn pale. How long! It 
    perishes, while you strive to grasp it. What will then follow! Hell is at 
    hand to answer.</p>
<p align="justify">Happy Christian, show your treasure. You produce Joseph's 
    portion—abundance of all grace. How long! A bright eternity is the measure 
    without measure.</p>
