<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>JESUS VERY NEAR</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858<i><br/> <br/>    "The word is very near unto you, in your mouth, and in 
    your heart, that you may do it." </i>Deut. 30:14.</p>
<p align="justify">Here the Gospel beams forth brightly. This is a picture 
    with Christ in the foreground. Here is a compass needle, pointing to 
    Him—the pole. There is no place for doubt. Cavils are silenced. For the 
    Spirit, who thus speaks by Moses, interprets also by the mouth of Paul. He 
    draws back every veil. He rolls away all clouds; and shows the Lord, as the 
    heart and marrow of this record.</p>
<p align="justify">This passage, then, is rich in exceeding worth. As such, 
    it should be studied with exceeding care. Paul thus unfolds it, "Moses describes 
    the righteousness, which is of the law, that the man, who does those things, 
    shall live by them." Rom.10:5. Mark, you who fondly dream of human merit. 
    The legal covenant is clearly stated. Fulfill the terms—perform the 
    works—bring an obedience without one blemish—an unbroken whole—and then 
    the recompense is earned. Then life eternal is won as a rightful due. But if 
    transgression be incurred, the mouth is closed—the plea is gone—reward is 
    forfeited. Who can say, 'pay me, for my task is incomplete! or, give me the 
    prize, although it is unwon! or, crown me, though I am vanquished in the 
    race!' But such is the language of self-righteous men. Can folly be more 
    foolish—blindness more blind! Thus <i>merit-claimants </i>grope down this 
    dark path to a darker night.</p>
<p align="justify">Paul proceeds to state the contrast. "But the 
    righteousness, which is of faith, speaks this way." Rom. 10:6. Blessed 
    be God! All glory to His sovereign grace! There is a righteousness 
    pure—perfect—wrought not by man, but by Christ. It is declared to be "of 
    faith," because faith's happy sons receive it—wear it—plead it; in it they 
    stand and prosper; by it they mount to heaven. This righteousness is here 
    introduced, as a person uttering a glorious voice "Say not," O anxious 
    sinner, "in your heart, who shall ascend into heaven? (that is to bring 
    Christ down from above) or, who shall descend into the deep? (that is to 
    bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what does it say? The word is near 
    you, even in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word of faith, which 
    we preach."</p>
<p align="justify">"The word is near you." Do any ask, What word? The answer 
    is, "The word of faith."<b> </b>The Gospel-tidings about Christ; that word, 
    which faith bears—prizes—welcomes—clings to—lives by—that record, from 
    which delightedly it draws strength—peace—joy—comfort—glory.</p>
<p align="justify">We here are plainly told, that this word was very near to 
    Israel's sons. Their knowledge was comparatively twilight, but still 
    abundant gleams broke on them from the Sun of Righteousness. Their every 
    rite was Christ, in shadow. He was the soul of every ordinance. He was 
    reflected by the tabernacle in all its parts. The altars stood His graphic 
    form. He died in every dying lamb. He bled in all the flowing blood. He 
    groaned in every victim's groan. The curling incense was His fragrant 
    prayer. The veil portrayed His flesh. The priest in the resplendent 
    robes—in every sacrificial act—in the uplifted hands—in the grand words 
    of blessing, showed Him, as He ministered below, and as He ministers above. 
    The leper preached the malignity and cure of sin. The true instruction from 
    Mosaic lips was Christ—His grace—His person—and His perfect work. The 
    outstretched finger of each part pointed to Him. A constant voice called to 
    one sight—"Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the 
    world"—turn to the promised seed—the bruiser of the serpent's head—the 
    great High-priest—the efficacious blood. Leviticus was a mirror, in which 
    our elder brethren might read the full salvation, which the Father planned, 
    and which the Son in due time achieved. Thus Gospel-truth was very near to 
    Israel's sons.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, learn hence to study Moses with mind intent on 
    Christ. Dig in this mine, as miser eager for pure gold. The flowers of this 
    garden all breathe heavenly fragrance. As salt is in each ocean's drop, so 
    Jesus is in each portion of these rites. You lose the prize, except you find 
    Him. Never take only superficial chaff from fields of such rich grain.</p>
<p align="justify">But if the Lord was "very near" in ancient signs, is He 
    not more than near to those, on whom the full light shines? Believer, come 
    then and realize your favored state. Bask on your sunny hill. Luxuriate in 
    your abundant pastures. Walk up and down your spicy gardens. To you there 
    should not be a desert-spot. The whole scene should blossom as a rose.</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus, indeed, is more than near. He came from heaven—He 
    took our flesh, that He might unite us, as living members, to Himself, the 
    living Head. Nearness has become oneness. The separating wall is broken 
    down. The intervening distance is removed. He asks our hearts, that He may 
    dwell therein. He opens wide His arms, that we may there repose. "Abide in 
    Me, and I in you."</p>
<p align="justify">Precious truth! There is no place, nor time, nor state, 
    when faith may not uplift the eye—open the ear—put out the hand—and 
    realize a present Savior. Friends may depart—death may sever tightest 
    bonds. But He, who ever lives, is ever living by our side. Solitude is not 
    too lonely for His visits. Crowds exclude Him not. The morning and the 
    evening hours—the busy day—the silent night—alike admit Him. Climate is 
    no hindrance. In realms of snow or plains of scorching heat, the Savior 
    journeys and tarries with His faithful servants. The rich man's hall is not 
    above His reach—the poor man's hut is not below it. He, whom the heaven of 
    heavens is narrow to contain—He, whom space cannot hold—He, from whose 
    sight the angels veil their eyes—He, who sits enthroned co-equal on 
    Jehovah's throne, always is "very near" to the poor worms, who take Him, as 
    their all.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, here is your never-failing help. Let some 
    cases, well known in Christian life, lend their aid to make this truth more 
    clear. <i>Conscience</i> will often tremble on the review of sin. Iniquities 
    will rise, as spectres from their long-closed graves. They will pass by in 
    terrible array. Their hideous forms will point to torment, as their due. 
    Their taunting voice will ask, 'What hope can dwell in hearts so stained!'</p>
<p align="justify">But turn from such terrors to your present Lord. He, too, 
    is "very near," showing His hands—His side. You may there read with open 
    eye the total ransom paid. There is no need of distant wanderings to escape 
    these alarms. The wells of everlasting peace are open at your feet. "The 
    word is very near unto you, even in your mouth and in your heart." It 
    shouts, "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as 
    snow—though they be red like crimson, they shall be white as wool." It 
    adds, "There is redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins." 
    Who can be sad, with such a volume full of pardons in his hand! Who can 
    despair, while he can eye a guilt-removing Jesus!</p>
<p align="justify">When <i>Satan</i> ragingly assaults—when he puts forth 
    his utmost might to thrust you headlong into depths of sin—when his 
    ensnaring net encompasses your feet—when the betraying heart offers the key 
    to let the murderer in—when the weak flesh begins to slide down the 
    alluring slopes—when the world tenders its most fascinating and alluring 
    charms—is there not peril? There is! Sad annals testify, how easily saints 
    fall. But fall not. There is a staff near. "The word is very near unto 
    you—in your mouth, and in your heart." Listen to the sweet 
    encouragements—"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation." 
    "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly." "Resist the 
    devil and he will flee from you—draw near unto God, and He will draw near 
    unto you." These mighty rocks are "very near." Set your feet fast upon them, 
    and your stand is firm.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes <i>afflictions</i> roll wave upon wave. Your 
    eye on all sides rests on woe. The dearest relatives are hidden in the 
    grave. Bereavement sits your solitary guest. Pains rack the frame. Vigor and 
    health decline. The nights are wearisome. The days bring anguish. Poverty 
    can scarcely obtain the needful clothing and the daily bread. Your best 
    designs are blackened by suspicions. Reproach and taunt ply their thick 
    darts. Earth seems one wide-spread desolation. But in these troubles faith 
    faints not. Christ's voice "is very near unto you, in your mouth and in your 
    heart." A very chorus of support swells happily around—"The Lord is my 
    Shepherd, I shall not lack." "The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of 
    trouble." Surely these consolations will uplift the head above all 
    threatening billows.</p>
<p align="justify">You may be called to <i>duties</i>, which surpass your 
    strength. You feel, that you are weak to bear the burdens, and to scale the 
    heights. You fear, that you must yield—defeated—crushed. And truly you 
    must be overwhelmed, if you are alone. But alone you cannot be, while Jesus 
    lives. If only you be really called, you may advance high above trembling. 
    His voice "is very near unto you, in your mouth and in your heart." Grasp 
    the ready promises—"As your days, so shall your strength be." "I, the Lord 
    your God, will hold your right hand, saying unto you, fear not, I will help 
    you. Fear not, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel—you shall thresh the 
    mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff." Who can 
    faint—who will not rather be courageous, with help divine so near!</p>
<p align="justify">A trying hour comes on apace. <i>Death</i> still 
    exercises universal sway. "It is appointed unto all men once to die." None 
    should think lightly of an event so solemn. Momentous change! Time 
    ceases—eternity arrives. Its accompaniments, too, are humbling. The powers 
    droop. A languid body scarcely holds a languid mind. Beloved friends must 
    all be left. Satan sees his last hope, and therefore musters his whole force 
    to barb his final thrust. He draws with craftiest skill his <i>farewell bow</i>. 
    This passage would indeed be dark and perilous, without a Savior "very 
    near." But the believer grasps a reviving word—"Yes, though I walk through 
    the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil—for You are with me, 
    Your rod and Your staff they comfort me." </p>
<p align="justify">Jesus, now gone to fit mansions in the heavenly home, 
    then comes to receive His people, that where He is, there they may ever be. 
    He draws the nearer, as the need increases. His everlasting arms are 
    underneath. Thus the cold waters cannot drown. Thus martyrs' fires have been 
    welcomed, and the excruciating stake been rapturously clasped. Believer, 
    dread not death. Hope, rather, that Jesus will be "very near." Expect His 
    presence—and it will be given. Ask His support, and it will surely come.</p>
<p align="justify">But after death, what meets you then! To die is to be 
    with Christ. To soar from earthly scenes is to escape the clouds of 
    sense—the mists of partial glance—the darkness of a prison-state. Then 
    faith expires, and eternal sight expands. Then Jesus in very presence is 
    forever "very near."</p>
<p align="justify">Surpassing blessedness! amazing joy! perfection of all 
    glory! The very thought is rapture. What must be the full reality! The 
    expectation dazzles. What will be full enjoyment! The Lord—the Lord 
    Himself—is near in all the brightness of His Deity. Separation never can 
    occur. Nothing can ever part. Jesus—Jesus in seen glory—is now "very 
    near." </p>
<p align="justify">Some read these lines, whose conscience warns, that they 
    possess no title to such bliss. Christ is not theirs by faith. They have not 
    fled to Him for refuge. They cling not to His cross. Their hearts have never 
    opened to admit this inhabitant. Sirs! tremble. But why tarry thus? 
    Arise—make haste—draw near. The penitential prayer of faith soon reaches 
    Him—for He is "very near."</p>
