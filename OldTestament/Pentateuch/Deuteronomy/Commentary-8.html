<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE UNITED TRIBES</b></font></p> <p align="justify">Henry Law, 1858<i><br/> <br/>    "Moses said this about the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar: May the people of <b>Zebulun</b> prosper in their 
    expeditions abroad. May the people of <b>Issachar</b> prosper at home in 
    their tents. They summon the people to the mountain to offer proper 
    sacrifices there. They benefit from the riches of the sea and the hidden 
    treasures of the sand." </i>Deut. 33:18-19</p>
<p align="justify">Two tribes come hand in hand. They are descendants of one 
    mother, Leah—and they inherit neighboring lots. Here they are colleagues in 
    a common blessing—and drink, as fellows, of one enriching cup.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a lovely sight, when brothers are co-heirs of 
    grace. The Gospel-records brighten with such pictures. Andrew and Simon are 
    united by more than kindred-ties. John has a fellow-laborer in James, his 
    parent's son. Jude, and the other James, born of one father, are newborn of 
    one Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">Do not these instances exhort each pious brother to seek 
    especially a brother's good? Do not they bring the animating hope, that the 
    door of success will open readily to such loving touch? Let then no gracious 
    brother rest, while any son of the same mother treads the downward path. In 
    prayer—by gentle example—by winning counsels, let him persevere, until 
    union be cemented in one center—Christ. God wills the effort. Will He be 
    slow to bless?</p>
<p align="justify">How great, too, is the gain! For where is treasure like a 
    brother plucked from the quarry of the world, and placed a jewel in the 
    diadem of Christ! Sweet is the walk, when such move side by side to one 
    eternal home.</p>
<p align="justify">Another thought stands at the threshold of this case. The 
    younger ranks before the elder. This cannot be without design. The same 
    occurs, when Jacob's dying lips address them. Zebulun precedes. Issachar, 
    the first by birth, gives place. Similarly Jacob's right hand rests on the 
    younger, Ephraim. Manasseh has inferior honor. And other instances occur.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, learn hence, that <b>God sits supreme upon His 
    throne</b>. He holds a scepter swayed in love—in wisdom—and in sovereign 
    will. He raises one. He places others in a lower grade. Here showers of 
    grace descend. Here the dew falls in tiny drops. We see the fact. We know, 
    that there is purpose. But we trace not the origin of these decrees. In 
    humble reverence we bow and we adore. All must be wise, and just, and right. 
    The day draws near, when clearer light shall show consummate skill. The 
    structure of the Church will then appear wondrous in perfection. Each part 
    is fixed by an unerring hand.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us now heed <b>THE BLESSING</b>. The first word 
    sounds, "Rejoice." This ever is our Gospel's note. Joy is the gift, which 
    Jesus's hands extend. This is the feast, to which true ministers invite.</p>
<p align="justify">When will a blinded world unlearn that silliest of 
    fictions, that ways of faith are cheerlessness and gloom! Let faithless men 
    be honest, and they must confess, that their career is restless care—keen 
    disappointment—and self-wrought vexation. They pluck the thorn—not the 
    flower. They feed on husks—not on rich fruit. Their cup is wormwood—not 
    the vine's juice. Their present is distress—not peace. Their future is 
    dismay—not hope. How different is the new-born heart! There constant joy 
    keeps court—joy in the Lord, who washes out all sin—who gives the key of 
    heaven, and title-deeds of endless bliss, and pledge of a weight of glory, 
    and strength for the journey, and triumph at the end. The mandate is not an 
    unmeaning word, "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice." 
    Phil. 4:4.</p>
<p align="justify">But Zebulun has his peculiar place—so, too, has 
    Issachar. Their calling differs. Zebulun's line extends around the coast. 
    His ships traverse the seas. His commerce is across the waves. While 
    Issachar reposes in inland scenes—and dwells in meadows and in valleys. His 
    life is rustic tranquillity. But whether in turmoil or in peace, joy is the 
    heritage of both. "<i>May the people of <b>Zebulun</b> prosper in their 
    expeditions <b>abroad</b>. May the people of <b>Issachar</b> prosper at home 
    in their <b>tents</b>.</i>"</p>
<p align="justify">They have the happy knowledge, that all their labors are 
    in appointed course—they go out, or they tarry, under heavenly directive, 
    and therefore with glad hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">This leads us to observe, <b>how varied are the stations 
    of man's calling! </b>How diverse are positions! Some reign in palaces—some 
    toil in cottages. Some feast at plenty's table—some pine in poverty's 
    contracted cells. Purple and splendor deck a Dives—Lazarus lies a beggar at 
    the gate. Some work at looms—others in fields. Some climb the mast—others 
    handle the spade. Some exercise the mental powers—others strain the muscles 
    of the body. Some soar in literature's highest flights—some crawl 
    unlettered to the grave. Some guide a nation's counsels—others are 
    instruments to execute these laws. Some are exalted to far higher work. They 
    are ambassadors for Christ. Their office is to tell aloud His wondrous 
    love—to rouse the slumbering—to feed Christ's flock—to uplift thoughts 
    from earth—to spread soul-renovating truths—to build up saints in their 
    most holy faith. </p>
<p align="justify">But perfect wisdom rules these varieties on life's stage. 
    No being enters or recedes, but in accordance with God's will. He 
    speaks—they live. He speaks—they die. Entrance and exit are in His hand. 
    At His decree all kings, all beggars, breathe and expire. Both times and 
    stations are allotted by His mind. He raises to the pinnacles of earth—or 
    veils in seclusion. He leads to walks known and observed by all, or hides in 
    garrets of obscurity. Let then the child of God live, rejoicing in his day 
    and lot. No change would be improvement. He best can serve his generation, 
    and advance his soul-concerns, by working cheerfully in his assigned 
    position.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, when you distinctly see the beckoning cloud; 
    when you set forth, or rest, submissive to clear guidance; banish 
    fears—cast out all doubts—lift up the happy head—clap the exulting 
    hands—rejoice—give thanks. A heavenly Father cannot set you in wrong 
    place. A loving Savior cannot lead you in wrong paths. A gracious Spirit 
    cannot endow you with wrong gifts. All is well. Look up and follow, and, as 
    you follow, sing, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out—and Issachar in your 
    tents."</p>
<p align="justify">Next, there is WORK, in which these tribes concur. They 
    are described as <b>zealous to bring others to know God</b>—"They shall 
    call the people unto the mountain—there they shall offer the sacrifices of 
    righteousness." These words exhibit missionary features. We seem to see them 
    mourning for ignorance, and longing to impart truth—hating darkness, and 
    yearning to infuse light; loving the one true God, and ardent to call the 
    wandering to His fold—the heavy-laden to His rest—the worshipers of stocks 
    and stones to Zion, the Gospel-mount.</p>
<p align="justify">Grace had made them to differ from the world around. 
    Revelation had taught them the way of life. They had received 
    Christ-shadowing ordinances. Their worship was not degraded rites of 
    ignorance. Their altar and their victims were typal of the sin-removing 
    Lamb. Their services were bright with God's own truth. Thus, with burning 
    hearts, they called the people unto the mountain, where they offered the 
    sacrifices of righteousness. They would not know, and love, and serve, 
    alone.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, catch hence a gale to fan the fire kindled in 
    your soul. Each child of God—in heart—in lip—in life—should be a flame 
    of enterprising zeal. Is he 
    enlightened—called—selected—converted—pardoned—comforted—sanctified—saved—only 
    that SELF may live? Away with such unworthy thought. Let the low slaves of 
    Satan, let poor paltry worldlings, shiver in the freezing atmosphere of 
    SELF. Let their desires, with unplumed wing, hang heavily around their 
    ease—their profit—their indulgence—their debasing lusts. But let faith 
    soar in higher regions, and break forth in grander efforts, and spread in 
    more ennobled work. Surely its sympathies should grasp the total family of 
    man! Surely its love should travel round the circuit of the globe! Surely 
    its cry should ever call poor sinners to the cross!</p>
<p align="justify">Awake, then, arouse; be up, be doing. What! shall souls 
    perish, while you sleep? Shall hell enlarge its borders, while you loiter? 
    Shall Satan push on his triumphs, and you look on indifferent? Shall 
    superstition thrive, and you be silent? Shall ignorance grow darker, and you 
    care not? Forbid it, every feeling of 
    pity—tenderness—humanity—compassion. Forbid it, every thought of a soul's 
    boundless worth. Forbid it, all the unutterable wonders wrapped in the name, 
    eternity. Forbid it, every pious wish to snatch immortals from undying 
    woe—and to upraise them to undying bliss. Forbid it, all your love to 
    Jesus' glorious name—all your deep debt to His atoning blood—all your 
    delight in His appeasing cross. Forbid it, all your hope to see His face in 
    peace—and sit beside Him on His throne—and ever bask in heaven's unclouded 
    sunshine. Forbid it, your deliverance from hell—your title-deeds to heaven. 
    Forbid it, your constant prayer, "Hallowed be Your name—Your kingdom 
    come—Your will be done." Forbid it, your allegiance to His rule—the 
    statutes of His kingdom—the livery, which you wear. Forbid it, His 
    awakening example—His solemn and most positive command. Forbid it, every 
    motive swelling in a Christian heart.</p>
<p align="justify">Up, then, and act. Soul-death meets you at each turn. The 
    world in its vast wideness perishes untaught. The spacious fields are 
    neither tilled nor sown. The many millions are heathen—and therefore 
    rushing hell-ward. Help, then, the missionary cause. You may—you can—you 
    should. The need is for men—for means. Can you go forth? Let conscience 
    answer. If not, you yet can pray, and give. Write shame—write base 
    ingratitude—write treason to Christ's cause on every day, which sees no 
    effort from you for the heathen world.</p>
<p align="justify">Read not in vain how Zebulun and Issachar subserved this 
    cause. They called the people to the mountain. They strove to increase the 
    sacrifices of righteousness.</p>
<p align="justify">The blessing adds, <i>"They benefit from the riches of 
    the sea and the hidden treasures of the sand."</i> God will enrich them. 
    Their traffic shall collect plenteous store. They trade for their God, and 
    their trade shall be full wealth. Who ever lost, who worked for Him!</p>
<p align="justify">Remember, that all gain is gainless, if unconsecrated. <i>
    The worldling's bags have holes—his barns soon empty—his coffers have no 
    locks.</i> Treasure laid out for God is laid up in safe keeping.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, come then, restore to God what He entrusts to 
    you. It will be paid back. But with what interest? God only knows. And on 
    what day? When the returning Lord shall reckon—when the applauding voice 
    shall say, "Well done, good and faithful servant—enter into the joy of your 
    Lord." Matt. 25:21. But now you may have happy foretaste.</p>
<p align="justify">Will any put these humble lines aside, without much 
    inward search? Let it not be so. Let every heart enquire, Lord, am I Yours? 
    Is my inheritance among Your chosen flock? Do I lie down in their fair 
    pastures? Do I draw water from their wells of life? Am I Your Zebulun—Your 
    Issachar? Is my life a clear testimony, that I serve Christ? Do I show, that 
    I am alive by many infallible proofs? Acts. 1:3.</p>
<p align="justify">If not, oh! let the prayer be heard, 'Lord, make me 
    Yours, and keep me Yours forever. If other lords have held me in their 
    chains, may the vile bondage cease. Accept me, worthless as I am. "Draw 
    me—we will run after You." Fit me—enable me—and my whole life shall be 
    delighted service. Supply me with the oil of grace, and then the flame of 
    glowing toil shall blaze. A Zebulun and Issachar in privilege will always be 
    a Zebulun and Issachar in zeal.</p>
