          Dearly Beloved in the Lord,<br />
          If there is a holy, strong, and tender bond — it is that which unites
          a Pastor to his Flock. It is the nearest feeling, which earth knows,
          to the immeasurable love of Jesus towards His Church. The faithful
          Minister lives, when the people, for whom he watches, live — through
          supporting mercy, in the full faith of the Gospel. It is, as it were,
          his death — when they lie dead in unbelief and vanity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Beloved, when I draw this picture, I am painfully conscious that it
          casts me far into the shadow of shame. But I desire to quicken myself
          by openly avowing, that your best interests should be mine, and that,
          in the service of your spiritual welfare, I count all labors light,
          all prayers but few.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          With earnest longings, then, to nurture your souls in true religion, I
          am bold to ask brief converse with you in these humble pages. It
          pleases our Heavenly Father, to whom be Glory, now and ever — that I
          should be with you, as in scantiness of every ministerial ability; so,
          too, in much bodily weakness. I may not do what I would desire. I
          would do all I can. Hence, I seek this access to your homes, that I
          may whisper to you, in the hours of your retirement, what I would
          gladly proclaim before the assembled congregation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          My constraining motive is that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may
          be glorified in you, and you in Him. I know, and am deeply persuaded,
          that all peace, all joy, all salvation are in Him. I see, as a very
          sunbeam, the grand truth — that you are blessed, and are blessings,
          just in proportion, as you abide in Him, and He in you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Woe, therefore, is unto me, if I leave any effort untried, to set Him
          before you. Let me rather use every voice of lip and pen, to beseech
          you to hear Him — to look to Him, to receive Him, to trust in Him, to
          love Him, to follow Him, to serve Him, to live in Him, and by Him, and
          for Him. I would thus strive, wrestling with the Holy Spirit, to work
          so mercifully and mightily in your hearts — that Christ may there be
          enthroned — an adored and rightful Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I have no fear, lest there should be excess in your faith, and
          reverence, and love, and obedience of the Heavenly Savior. I think no
          folly so pitiable as the sneer, that men may follow Jesus too closely
          in holy bearing and Godlike walk. I rather pant for means to exhibit
          Him to you, as clearly as the saints in light behold. Him — that so
          you may be wholly His, as they are.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I am deeply rooted in the assurance that His presence is helpful to
          you in everything — and hurtful in nothing. Whatever your station or
          employment, if you fulfill its duties with a loving eye intent on
          Jesus, with a submissive ear listening to His inward guidance — then
          your life will be as Heaven's summer-day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Without hesitation, then, or reserve — I point directly to the Savior.
          In doing so, I have God for my witness, and His Word for my pledge —
          that I guide to the only path of real prosperity, and solid delights.
          I burn with desire, that you should be the holiest of the holy, the
          most joyous of the joyful, the most blessed among the blessed, the
          most glorious among the glorified. Surer evidence I cannot give, than
          the entreaty of this feeble messenger — that you would receive Christ
          as your All.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If anything can enlarge my concerns — which should be large as
          infinity — it is our favored position among the parishes of England.
          The sweet healthfulness of our climate, and other rare advantages —
          attract an ever-flowing stream towards our shore, as their choice
          resort. Many, indeed, come, so evidently taught of God, that they
          move, as shining lights among us. But there are others — not a few —
          whose semblance tells us that they are mere votaries of the god of
          this world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Beloved, would it not be gain beyond gain, if this thoughtless crowd
          should here learn that the Gospel is no empty sound — but the very
          power of God unto Salvation? Let them read this, not only in the
          public ministrations, but in the heavenward walk of the flock. Let
          them see in your <i>holy happiness</i>, that Christ is a living and
          life-giving God, converting the vacant and self-vexing mind — into a
          well stored pleasure-ground. Make Him your All! And He through you,
          and you by Him, will win — He only knows how many — to His
          transcendent joys. Who can conceive of the privilege — if immortal
          multitudes, through your grace, should love and honor Jesus as the
          well-spring of their souls' health!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I now commend you to the God of all grace, praying Him to smile
          hallowed blessings on this my lowly converse with you. May He knit
          each heart to each, and all hearts unto Himself, through Christ our
          All!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Allow me to subscribe myself, <br />
          In sincere devotedness, <br />
          Your ministering servant for Jesus' sake,<br />
          Henry Law, December, 1854.

          The object of these pages is simple, clear, holy. It is to arouse
          attention to the blessed truth, that<b>
            Christ pervades all Scripture</b
          >, as <i>salt</i> all waters of the sea, as <i>light</i> the brightest
          day, as <i>fragrance</i> the garden of choice flowers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To see this is my prime delight. To testify it is my happiest duty.
          Devoted loyalty to Him who is the first and last, the sum and
          substance of all Scripture, impels me. Earnest zeal for the undying
          souls of men constrains me. I know, and am intensely persuaded, that<i>
            all peace, all joy, all salvation, are in Jesus. </i
          >My eyes are widely open to the fact that men are blessed, and are
          blessings, just in proportion as they live, ever gazing on Christ,
          ever listening to His voice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Shame, then, and guilt and woe would be my portion, if I should leave
          any effort untried to unfold His glorious image. Let me rather use
          every power of life and pen to <i>magnify</i> and <i>exalt</i> Him—to
          beseech men to <i>ponder</i> Him—to <i>search</i> for Him—to
          <i>receive</i> Him—to <i>love</i> Him—to <i>follow</i> Him—to
          <i>serve</i> Him—to <i> commend</i> Him—to <i>live</i> in Him, and
          through Him, and for Him. I would thus strive, the Spirit helping, to
          assail and melt and conquer hearts, that Christ may there be
          enthroned, in all His rightful majesty, a beloved and adored Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There can be no excess in the faith and love and adoration and
          obedience of the only Savior, the King of kings and Lord of lords! Has
          there ever lived the saint, whose moan it has not been, that, always
          striving to learn, he still was miserably ignorant in the full purpose
          of the Bible? What is there comparable to the profit of this
          knowledge? It is helpful to men in everything, hurtful in nothing.
          Whatever be the station or employment, if the duties are performed
          with loving eye intent on Jesus, with mind rejoicing in His discovery,
          with heart luxuriating in His riches, then toil will be no toil,
          because of the constant refreshment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Who will deny that the happiest man on earth is he who is most
          enriched with enlightened views of Christ, and acts out most devotedly
          this faith? He lives at heaven's high gate. He holds close communion
          with Him, through whom his transgressions are forgiven, his sins are
          covered, his person accepted, his soul saved. He knows in whom he
          believes. He discerns the glories of His person, the redeeming worth
          of His wounds, the ransoming efficacy of the pierced hands and feet,
          the sheltering shadow of the cross. He reads the assuring language of
          Calvary. He sees his name written on the God-man's heart. To him the
          morning sweetly dawns, because it awakens to the renewed light of
          Jesus' grace. To him the day gladly speeds on, because its advance is
          progress in divine instruction. To him the night is calm repose,
          because he rests on the pillow of atoning love. The darkest cloud is
          fringed with rays of joy, while he meditates on salvation's Lord, and
          all events drop gladness. Can I know this, and not beseech men to make
          Christ their All?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Until this is truly done, how dreary is the present state, and the
          future prospect! <b>Without Christ</b>, religion is a sunless sky;
          public service a casket without the jewel; life is a dreary passage to
          a dreadful end; the home is no abode of peace; the family has no
          strong bond of lasting love; the trade yields no returns of worthy
          profit; death is a downfall into the unfathomable abyss; eternity is a
          prolongation of unutterable woe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          <b> Without Christ</b>, prosperity is an adverse tide, and adversity
          is a foreshadowing of deeper misery. Birth is no benefit, if Christ is
          never born within. Life is no gain, except to live is Christ.
          <b> Without Christ</b>, God is an adversary; Scripture sounds
          condemnation; and Satan is waiting for his victim, which his
          prison-house is ready to receive. Can I know this, and not beseech men
          to make Christ their All?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We live, too, in days when countless fallacies court men in garb of
          truth. How shall we meet, expose, expel them? Wisdom is needed, for
          theological error is shrewd and bold. It often is opposed by error,
          and then victory leaves darkness more dark. The conquering champion's
          panoply is full intelligence of Christ. Christ is the <i>sword</i>,
          before which Roman frauds and novel sophistries fall low. He is the
          <i>shield</i> which guards the heart from all the poisoned arrows of
          the deceiving and deceived. In Him there is reply for every error's
          every wile. Christ truly seen is an impregnable fort. Christ well
          applied smashes all falsehood's weapons. He is God's wisdom in the
          highest. The man is safe on wisdom's high ground who is well versed in
          Him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Therefore my desire in these pages is to turn minds to clear
          discoveries of the Lord Jesus. The <i>Father's</i> eye moves not from
          Him. The <i>Spirit</i> never wearies to reveal Him.
          <i>Angelic</i> intellect pants to dive more into His depths. The
          <i>saints</i> in light find Him increase of everlasting light. May the
          unfolding Spirit help each reader to glean more in the golden field of
          Scripture; and may the Pentateuch be found
          <i>a boundless treasury of Christ!</i>
