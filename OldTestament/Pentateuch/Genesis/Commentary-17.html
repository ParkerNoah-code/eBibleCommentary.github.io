<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE COVENANT </b></font></p>

<p align="justify">"I will establish My <b>Covenant</b> between Me and you, 
    and your seed after you, in their generations, for an everlasting Covenant." 
    Genesis 17:7</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! does your conscience certify that you are a true 
    disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ? Have you cast a helpless soul into His 
    helpful arms? Have you buried all your guilt and all your fears in the grave 
    of His wounds? By <i>death unto sin</i>, do you prove that you are crucified 
    with Him? By <i>life unto righteousness</i>, do you manifest the power of 
    resurrection with Him? If so, what cause have you to bless God that He 
    breathed the breath of life into your nostrils, and the Spirit of life into 
    your soul! For great are your privileges, rich is your portion, bright are 
    your prospects, sure is your inheritance. Your blessedness is summed up in 
    the word, the great God is your Covenant-Father. Search your Bible. Study 
    the charter of your heavenly freedom. Read the title-deeds of your high 
    estate. This world's miser counts his gold, his jewels, and his fields. 
    Shall not the heir of two worlds know his imperishable wealth? Clasp 
    especially to your heart the roll of blessings. They are sanctification of 
    spirit—adoption into God's family—divine light—and eternal pardon. The 
    believer may claim them all by covenant pledge. "But this is the new 
    covenant I will make with the people of Israel on that day," says the Lord. 
    "I will put my laws in their minds, and I will write them on their hearts. I 
    will be their God, and they will be My people. And they will not need to 
    teach their neighbors, nor will they need to teach their family, saying, 
    'You should know the Lord.' For everyone, from the least to the greatest, 
    will already know me," says the Lord. "And I will forgive their wickedness 
    and will never again remember their sins." Jeremiah 31:33-34</p>
<p align="justify">Few are the eyes, which are not dazzled, when such 
    treasures shine, as fields of light, before them. Wondering thought will 
    question, How can <i>God</i>—the high, the holy One—whose being is 
    perfection—whose home is eternity, have fellowship with <i>man</i>, the 
    low—the vile—the loathsome, the offspring of the dust—the fluttering insect 
    of a moment? No monarch would make league with the base rebel in the 
    dungeon. How then can the height of heaven thus descend to misery, disease, 
    and filth? When nature looks down to the pit, in which human nature grovels, 
    impossibilities seem many. But still the fact is sure, God is in Covenant 
    with every child of grace. Let witnesses be called!</p>
<p align="justify">First, let <i>Abraham</i> appear. He was born in sin, 
    prone to evil—the child of wrath, laden with iniquity, just as we are. But 
    his evidence asserts, that God thus communed with him. "As for Me, Behold My 
    Covenant is with you." "I will establish My Covenant between Me and you and 
    your seed after you." Let <i>David</i> next be heard. By natural descent, he 
    was as we are. But his truthful gratitude exclaims, "He has made with me an 
    everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things, and sure." Thus far the point 
    is clear. God covenants with man. But, perhaps some trembling believer may 
    doubt whether such grace extends beyond the favored elders in the household 
    of faith. Mercy speeds to give the reply, The Covenant is established with 
    Abraham and his seed after him. And "if you are Christ's, then are you 
    Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! this truth is now resplendent as the sun in its 
    brightness. It cannot be denied, that if you are Christ's, you are a 
    covenant-child of God. We are thus prepared to examine the nature of God's 
    Covenant, in its conditions and confirmation. The first step is to settle 
    deeply in your mind, that this Covenant is no covenant of works. Once, 
    indeed, such compact was proposed. "Do this," was the requirement. "Live," 
    was the recompense. But it saw the light only to perish. Man placed it not 
    in his heart, but beneath his feet. He touched it only to scatter it to the 
    winds. The privilege was instantly forfeited. The voice which began in 
    promise, ended in wrath. The beauteous column fell, never to rise again. The 
    gracious page was torn, never to be re-written. I fear that there are many, 
    who in the dark night of nature dream the idle dream, that this Covenant 
    still lives, and that they shall live through it. </p>
<p align="justify">But a broken reed is no support. The sinking sand is no 
    foundation. A violated treaty is no sound plea. It is a pitiable argument, I 
    claim, because I have no claim. As well might the prodigal demand, Receive 
    me again, because I am undutiful: or the rebel, Restore me, because I am a 
    traitor: or the criminal, Acquit me, because I am guilty: or the debtor, 
    Release me, because I am fraudulent. Such are the delusions of those who 
    trust in a vanished Covenant. It began and ended in Adam. The strength of <i>
    innocence</i> could not hold it. How then can the weakness of <i>guilt</i> 
    recover it, or the tongue of transgression plead it? </p>
<p align="justify">But far different is the Covenant of grace, which is the 
    believer's safeguard. It is written in unfading letters of eternal love. It 
    is based on the rock of changeless purpose. It is such, because "God has 
    commanded it forever." But where do its birth, its vigor, its undying 
    freshness come from? It exists, it is strong, it is everlasting, because it 
    is made with Jesus. He stands before God as the second Adam; the head of a 
    Spirit-born progeny. God commits to Him terms and promises for them. He 
    binds Himself to terms and promises for them. Thus God pledges to them, 
    Christ pledges for them. God stipulates; Christ undertakes. </p>
<p align="justify">But what are the conditions? God requires that they be 
    all cleansed from all sin—all clothed in all righteousness—all renewed in 
    every faculty of soul and spirit. Christ is responsible for the full 
    performance. God promises that He will be their God. Christ promises that 
    they shall be His people. Such is the new Covenant—made and ratified in 
    Christ. Let us now sit down beneath the tree of Scripture, and catch some 
    precious fruit, which falls into the lap of faith. </p>
<p align="justify">What rich supplies come from Isaiah 42:6, and 49:8! Here 
    Jehovah communes with His co-equal Son. We are brought into the 
    council-chamber of eternity. God, in His majesty, says, "I, the Lord, have 
    called You in Righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will keep You, and 
    give You for a Covenant of the people." And again, "I will preserve You, and 
    give You for a Covenant of the people." We are here bade to gaze on Jesus, 
    as Himself the Covenant. And such He is: for it has no being, no 
    continuance, no power but in Him. He is its <i>essence, </i>its<i> reality,
    </i>its<i> fullness, </i>its<i> all</i>. It is founded, erected, concluded 
    in Him. No Christ, no Covenant. Receive Him, and it is yours in all its 
    truth and riches. Reject Him, and you perish, because you have not the 
    shadow of a plea. He is the Covenant, because, as Jehovah's fellow, He 
    designs it, and wills it, and orders it, and frames it, and accepts it. He 
    is the Covenant, because, as God-man, He takes it into His own hand, and 
    works out its every condition. </p>
<p align="justify">Receive next the evidence of Mal. 3:1, "The Lord, whom 
    you seek, shall suddenly come to His temple, even the <i>Messenger of the 
    Covenant</i>, whom you delight in." Here Christ is the Messenger of this 
    Covenant. But what is the office of a messenger? He conveys tidings from 
    party to party. Just so, Jesus comes traveling in the greatness of His 
    strength, flying on the wings of His love, hastening in the zeal of His 
    heart to proclaim, that a Covenant is made, and to tell what the Covenant 
    contains. In the Word, through His ministers, by sealing ordinances, He 
    reads to us, line by line, the provisions of this charter. He shows us, as 
    in a glorious mirror, God reconciled, peace established, all grace 
    purchased, and heaven's portals opened. O my soul! has Jesus caused the 
    sweet notes of this message to be the music of your holiest delights? </p>
<p align="justify">But the messenger flies back to the courts above, and 
    gives report to His heavenly Father, These poor sinners have heard of Your 
    Covenant-grace; they have hidden their faces in the dust of penitential 
    shame; they have clasped the records with the eager hand of adoring faith; 
    old things are passed away from them, all things are become new; out of 
    darkness they are light: from hatred they are love: they are no more aliens, 
    but children. O my soul! are you thus brought within the bonds of the 
    Covenant? </p>
<p align="justify">Again, glean the tidings of Heb. 7:22, "By so much was 
    Jesus made a <i>Surety</i> of a better testament," or Covenant. Here Christ 
    is the Surety of this Covenant. But what is the work of a Surety? He 
    engages, that each party shall fulfill the contract. There was no surety in 
    the Covenant of works, and it quickly failed. But here the God-man Jesus is 
    the Surety. He is Surety for the Father. He is Surety for His people. </p>
<p align="justify">I need not repeat what boundless blessedness the Father 
    promises. All shall be given. Not one drop shall be withheld. The cup shall 
    overflow. It must be, for Jesus is Surety. The conditions of believers are 
    alike secure. They shall kneel in penitence; and live by faith; and cling to 
    the refuge; and be fruitful trees of righteousness. In due time Jesus will 
    call them all, and work in them to will and to do, and at last present them 
    cleansed, and washed, and beautified, and sanctified, a glorious Church, not 
    having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. The truth, the love, the power of 
    the Surety will accomplish this. </p>
<p align="justify">What delights, too, flow from Heb. 12:24, "To Jesus the 
    Mediator of the new Covenant." As Mediator, He stands between God and man. 
    He is one with God, and one with man. He places His hands on each. Thus they 
    become one in Him. Separation vanishes: union is effected. Thus 
    Covenant-blessings never fail to wing their way from heaven. Thus the 
    Covenant-incense of holy love, and filial fear, and willing service never 
    ceases to ascend. </p>
<p align="justify">Feast, moreover, on the truth of Heb. 9:15, "He is the 
    Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of 
    the transgressions which were under the first Testament, they which are 
    called, might receive the promise of eternal inheritance." Covenants of old 
    were rendered valid by a victim's blood. When God showed Abraham the 
    Covenant of grace, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp passed between the 
    slaughtered limbs. Hence the everlasting Covenant must be sealed with blood. 
    An atoning, a peace-making sacrifice dies. It is none other than the 
    Mediator Himself. The Father is well-pleased, and cries, "My Covenant will I 
    not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips." The believer 
    responds with overflowing praise, God is my Covenant-Father forever and 
    ever. His Covenant is sure with me; by the Spirit's help, my covenant shall 
    be inviolate with Him. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! is such the language of your thanks-giving and 
    thanks-living heart? Many, alas! prefer to enter into treaty with the world. 
    Its easy terms are easily proposed. It demands compliance with its 
    fashions—adoption of its principles—putting on its habits—neglect of the 
    Bible—worship in mere forms. It offers in return a full-frothed cup of 
    carnal and mental joy. The deluded victims sign. They take the 
    tinsel-goblet. They drink nothing but the dregs of disappointment and of 
    shame. Then comes the end. An eternity of woe puts a seal to the truth, that 
    the friendship of the world is enmity with God. Flee from this deceiving 
    truce-breaker! Come out. Stand apart. Be separate. Lost souls discover too 
    late that a league with the world binds them over to hell.</p>
