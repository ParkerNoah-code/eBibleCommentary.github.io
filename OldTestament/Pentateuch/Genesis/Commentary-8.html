</font></p>
<p align="justify">"He will comfort us." Genesis 5:29 </p>
<p align="justify">Thus speaks the patriarch Lamech. Such is his voice of 
    joy, when he receives his first-born Noah. He was tilling a soil hardened by 
    the curse—fruitful only in thorns and thistles. But now a son is given to 
    share the painfulness of his daily toil. Cheered by this hope, he calls his 
    name <i>Noah</i>, which has the meaning of <i>Rest </i>or<i> Comfort</i>. 
    Reader! in these simple pages there is but one thing sought: the best good 
    of undying souls. Therefore I examine not whether this name was designed as 
    another ray of the coming Savior. I rather proceed to realities, which all 
    experience. I rather turn to tidings, which are bright on the Gospel 
    surface. </p>
<p align="justify">I first state a fact, which is ancient as the fall, and 
    wide-spread as man. It is this—A sinful world is a tearful world. Wherever 
    we stand, our shadow is sorrow. It s so before the flood. It is so now. In 
    all climates and ranks, the head is weary, and the heart is sick. </p>
<p align="justify">I next state a truth, which came in, as twin-born, with 
    the earliest promise. It is this—Consolation is provided. God has sent forth 
    Christ Jesus from the bosom of His love to be the Consolation of this 
    woe-worn world. It is my longing desire that this heavenly knowledge would 
    more largely shed its pure balm. I mourn that men should drink nothing but 
    the dregs of bitterness, while healing streams flow close beside them. Let 
    me invite you, then, to come with me for a few moments into some of the 
    chambers of earth's grief. I can show you there, with the Spirit helping, 
    that in Jesus Christ there is a pillow for the throbbing brow—a cordial for 
    the fainting spirit—a plank for the sinking—a haven for the tempest-tossed.
    </p>
<p align="justify">I need scarcely say that the heart of misery is misery of 
    heart—the soul of anguish is anguish of soul. But where is the home of this 
    extreme distress? Surely in the breast of him whose conscience is awake to 
    discern the nature—the evil—the wages—of his sins. <i>The nest of 
    self-delusion has now become a bed of thorns.</i> Before his eyes God 
    frowns, dreadful in justice. In his ears the law thunders a tremendous 
    curse. He moves forward, and there is a gaping hell. Shall he stir—the next 
    step may cast him headlong into flames. Shall he sleep—he may awake among 
    the lost. Where can comfort reach a mind thus tortured? It cannot spring 
    from earth. For let the world now present its every charm; how worthless are 
    they! The world has nothing, but for a sin-blinded man. When things are seen 
    as they really are, <i>earthly toys</i> are worse than empty bubbles. </p>
<p align="justify">Comfort, to be comfort now, must come from heaven. All is 
    mockery, except it can tell of God reconciled—sin pardoned—the soul safe. 
    Now Jesus can raise out of these lowest depths; and He alone. He can guide 
    the trembler to His cross. He can reveal to him there a heavenly Father, 
    arrayed in glories of eternal love. He can point to His own dying as the 
    death of wrath. He can show the sword of justice sheathed in His own 
    heart—the flames of vengeance quenched in His own blood—the hand, that was 
    uplifted to strike, now extended to bless—all hell piled upon the Guiltless, 
    and heaven freely given to the guilty! Is not this Consolation? It is! And 
    Jesus pours it from His wounded hands and pierced side! </p>
<p align="justify">Is not this, I repeat, Consolation? Ask those who have 
    tasted it. Ask the jailor. Terror-stricken he sprang in—wrath was at his 
    heels—he heard of Jesus—peace soothed his fears, and he rejoiced, believing 
    in God with all his house. But it occurs, alas! too often, that they who 
    have escaped, as drowning mariners, to this rock, are enticed again to 
    stray. They cease to watch and pray. Then the tempter finds an open door. 
    They neglect the preserving means of grace. Then the foe creeps in. The 
    Spirit is grieved and withdraws. Corruptions regain their power. <i>Woe to 
    backsliders!</i> what wretchedness is theirs! Consciousness of peril 
    returns, and it is embittered by keen self-reproach. They see how basely 
    they have deserted the Friend, who had said to them, while in their blood, 
    Live. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! perhaps this agony is yours. You once had rest in 
    Jesus, but it is gone. The fault is wholly your own. He did not drive you 
    from Him. You have departed from Him. And now you sigh, Oh! that it were 
    with me, as in the days when the Sun of Righteousness shone upon my path. Do 
    not be tearless, for grievous is your fall. But do not be hopeless, for 
    Jesus is yet near. His voice still follows you, "Return, and I will not 
    cause My anger to fall upon you." In nothing is His tenderness more tender, 
    than in stilling the sobs of those who sob in penitence before Him. Return 
    then. The Lord still extends the arms of His pitifulness. He is the balm in 
    Gilead. He is the Physician there. He cannot be silent to the cry, "Restore 
    to me the joy of Your salvation." </p>
<p align="justify">There are others who closely cling to the Lord, and yet 
    are disquieted. They gratefully acknowledge, "Hitherto has the Lord helped 
    us;" but heaven seems far off; the pilgrimage is long; adversaries are many; 
    their own strength totters—they look to the winds and waves, and trembling 
    takes hold upon them; they say with David, we shall one day perish by the 
    hand of Saul. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! perhaps you have such heart-felt misgivings. 
    Truly if Jesus were other than He is, you might thus faint. But now I am 
    bold to bid you arise and shake yourself from the dust. Open your eyes and 
    read His heart. It speaks one language. It is all encouragement. It tells of 
    faithful love, which, as it never had beginning, so it can have no end. He 
    draws you to the shelter of His wings, and there stifles each rising doubt 
    by assurances as large as they are free—as gentle as they are countless. He 
    tells you, "Because I live, you shall live also." "Your life is hidden with 
    Christ in God." If you ask richer Consolation, you ask more than God can 
    give. </p>
<p align="justify">But afflictions break upon you with ceaseless tide. This 
    is to be expected. It is our common lot. There is no home so lowly, but some 
    sorrow finds the door. There is no palace so upraised, but some sorrow 
    mounts the steps. Faith shields not from this. "In the world you <i>shall</i> 
    have tribulation." But welcome all sorrow, if Jesus enters by its side! This 
    always is so to the true believer. Health may wither like a fading flower; 
    languor and disease may feed upon the frame; there may be tossings to and 
    fro until the dawning of the day. But Jesus can relax with smiles the 
    pain-contracted brow, and charm with songs the wakeful night. Earthly 
    possessions may crumble to decay; poverty may sit where affluence used to 
    smile. </p>
<p align="justify">But can the believer's portion fail? Oh, no! he has all 
    the treasures in the word, "The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not lack." 
    Friends may forsake; averted looks may chill. There may be treachery or open 
    hate, where once much love was pretended. Jesus knew this trial in its 
    bitterest form. Hence He is quick to prove that He changes not with the 
    changing world. He magnifies His sympathy by sticking closer than a brother. 
    His own presence more than fills each void within. </p>
<p align="justify">But <i>death</i> draws on with rapid step. Yes! it will 
    soon draw back the covers of your bed, and extend an <i>icy hand</i> to bear 
    you there. You will then need strong Consolation. Long-tried props can prop 
    no more. Alone you must go through the dark valley. But not alone! For Jesus 
    whispers, "I am with you. Thus I guide to my many-mansioned home." <i>So the 
    last trial is the last and largest Consolation. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Believer, let me beg you to live and die leaning on Jesus 
    as your Consolation. Would you be expert in this happy state? Make it, then, 
    your daily habit to meditate upon Himself—His promises—His dealings. Hold 
    close communion with Him. Measure the breadth, the length, the depth, the 
    height of His office and His work. Be assured that all that He is, and all 
    that He has, and all that He has done, and all that He is doing, and all 
    that He will do, is yours. You have never been absent from His heart, and 
    never can be. You are a member "of His body, of His flesh, and of His 
    bones." <i>Abide in Him at all seasons, and all seasons will be comfort. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Strike, too, the <i>rock of the promises </i>with<i> the 
    rod of faith</i>. Sweet waters will gush out. They will flow very deep, and 
    very broad, and all within this channel, "Comfort, comfort, my people, says 
    your God." Take frequent walks also by the side of the faithful pilgrims of 
    old. Precious is their companionship. They may be sorrowful, yet they are 
    always rejoicing. They may be homeless wanderers, as Jacob was, yet they are 
    comforted. They may pine long in dungeons and under evil fame, as Joseph 
    did, yet they are comforted. They may be destitute of all things, as Elijah 
    was, yet they are comforted. They may flee for their lives and hide 
    themselves in caves of the earth, as David did, yet they are comforted. They 
    may be in the hottest fire of persecution, as the three captive youths were, 
    yet they are comforted. They may be in all perils, and in the wildest 
    storms, as Paul was; they may be called to bear faithful witness in scoffing 
    crowds, or before frowning tyrants, as this apostle was, yet they are 
    comforted. They may die the martyr's death under showers of crushing stones, 
    as Stephen did, yet they are comforted. They may lose all things, yet they 
    never lose the Consolation, which is in Christ Jesus. It is the work of His 
    Spirit. It is the gift of His grace. It is the token of His indwelling. It 
    is the foretaste of His heaven! </p>
<p align="justify">Perhaps the eyes of some rest upon these pages, who are 
    strangers to this deep well-spring of Consolation. Unhappy men! Your hearts 
    are a disconsolate blank. You have been sowing vanity, and what do you now 
    reap? You have made the world your all, what has it given you? If much be 
    obtained, more is coveted. Possessions do not content. Pursuits only weary. 
    This hour is fretfulness. The next is a dreaded abyss. You wander over 
    fields of anxiety, and there is no place of rest. Society is a hollow 
    insipidity. Solitude is a dismal gloom. Where are your comforts? There are 
    none in the retrospect, none in hand, none in the horizon. The past 
    upbraids, the present dissatisfies, the future terrifies! A condemning voice 
    within tells you, that is true. Turn not, then, from the beseeching voice of 
    this page. Be persuaded. Consent, consent to be happy. "Seek the Lord while 
    He may be found." "Take with you words." Plead with Him His office, "The 
    Lord has anointed Me to comfort all that mourn in Zion." Plead with Him His 
    call, "Come unto Me, all you that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give 
    you rest." Plead with Him His promise, "I will not leave you comfortless." 
    Plead with Him His title, "The Consolation of Israel." Plead with Him His 
    tender voice, "As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you." 
    Plead with Him the dreadful gulf between the saved and the lost, "Now he is 
    comforted, and you are tormented." Plead with him the command from heaven, 
    "Comfort, comfort my people, says your God." Cease not thus to plead, until 
    you can say of Him, who is far greater than Noah, "This same shall comfort 
    us."</p>
