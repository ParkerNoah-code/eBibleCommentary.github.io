<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE RAINBOW IN THE 
    CLOUDS</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">"I have set My <b>rainbow in the clouds</b>, and it will 
    be the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth." Genesis 9:13</p>
<p align="justify">In the rainbow there is a charm, of which every eye is 
    conscious. It looks forth through the dark windows of the storm, and earth 
    rejoices in the reviving visit. Its lovely hues proclaim that the gloom is 
    past. It spans the clouds, as the fair herald of returning clearness. Its 
    noble form, its various shades of distinct and blended color, surpass all 
    praise. Admiration can only say—it worthily magnifies its mighty Maker. Such 
    delights become us. <i>The book of nature is the penmanship of God.</i> 
    Every line should be a sanctifying lesson. Enlightened piety sings, "The 
    works of the Lord are great, sought out of all those who have pleasure 
    therein." </p>
<p align="justify">But the shining light of the rainbow teaches far more 
    than that our God is excellent to plan, and almighty to perform. To receive 
    its especial instruction we must ponder its birth. Let us go back, then, and 
    take our station by the side of Noah, when it first awakened his grateful 
    thanks. His feet again trod on the solid pavement of earth. But the sound of 
    rushing torrents had left their echo in his ear. The expanse of desolation 
    had not faded from his view. What had been, might be again. Each gathering
    <i>cloud</i> might mantle the world in final ruin. Each falling <i>raindrop</i> 
    might open the sluices of another deluge. Thus fears would lodge in his 
    breast; and "fear has torment." </p>
<p align="justify">From the foreboding patriarch, let us turn to our God. He 
    is glorious in tenderness, and pity, and compassion, and watchful care 
    towards His people. It is His merciful will that they should repose in 
    perfect peace. He invites them to feed by the still waters of confiding 
    love. He would have the wings of each breeze to flutter over them—laden with 
    joy. He would have every shadow to spread the covert of protection. But how 
    will He calm the trembling anxieties of Noah? A <i>word</i> of heaven-sent
    <i>promise</i> might suffice. But He, who multiplies to pardon, multiplies 
    also to give comfort. His word indeed shall go forth, but it shall go forth 
    sealed with an enduring, ever-speaking seal. He will call a new wonder into 
    being. A <i>smiling offspring</i> <i>of the weeping cloud</i> shall 
    tranquilly assure the earth, that waters have no more a mandate to lay 
    waste. And what is this wonder? An arch, cheering and bright, embraces the 
    skies. On a scroll of variegated light there is inscribed, These storms drop 
    fertility—they break to <i>bless</i> and not to injure. </p>
<p align="justify">How is this wonder framed? Jehovah's works are sublime in 
    their simplicity. The sun looks forth from the opposite skies. Its rays 
    enter the descending drops, and returning to the eye in broken pencils, 
    paint the rainbow on the illuminated background. Heaven dries up the tears 
    of earth, and the high roof above seems to take up the Gospel-hymn, "Glory 
    to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men." Thus the 
    rainbow is more than an evidence of skill and power. It is the brilliant 
    signet on God's preserving arm. It is <i>the golden impress</i>, by which He 
    ratifies the covenant, that "the waters shall no more become a flood to 
    destroy all flesh." </p>
<p align="justify">But faith looks further. It is ever intent to catch the 
    image of its beloved Lord. It has learned the sound principle, that <i>the 
    whole field of nature reflects the beauties and glories of Jesus. </i>It has 
    read the testimony, that He is the "true Light," and the "true Bread," and 
    the "true Vine." Hence it is not slow to inquire, Is He not too the truth of 
    the "faithful witness in Heaven?" While it thus listens to drink in some 
    Gospel-music from the rainbow, the word sounds plainly: "For a brief moment 
    I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will take you back. In a moment 
    of anger I turned my face away for a little while. But with everlasting love 
    I will have compassion on you," says the Lord, your Redeemer. "Just as I 
    swore in the time of Noah that I would never again let a flood cover the 
    earth and destroy its life, so now I swear that I will never again pour out 
    My anger on you. For the mountains may depart and the hills disappear, but 
    even then I will remain loyal to you. My covenant of blessing will never be 
    broken," says the Lord, who has mercy on you. Isaiah 54:7-10.</p>
<p align="justify">Here the great depths of God's love are broken up. As the 
    deluge overtopped the highest hills, so this assurance drowns the pinnacles 
    of doubt and hesitation. It places the covenant of <i>Noah</i> in contrast 
    with the covenant of <i>Jesus</i>. God promising to hold back a flood, 
    pictures God, making oath, that He will save to the uttermost. The earth 
    safe from watery waste is the Church safe from all wrath.</p>
<p align="justify">But if the former had a pledge impressed on the 
    firmament, much more has the latter a seal of unfading perpetuity—even Jesus 
    high in the glories of heaven. Thus faith sees the rainbow in the cloud, and 
    adores the Savior on the right hand of God. </p>
<p align="justify">But this is not all. The rainbow, which cheers us in the 
    first pages of our Bible, shines brightly to the last. We read in the 
    Revelation, that John was in the Spirit—a door was opened before him in 
    heaven—and behold, a throne was set. But what encircled it? The Rainbow! As 
    the vision advanced, he saw a mighty angel come down from heaven clothed 
    with a cloud, and a <i>rainbow</i> was upon his head. Thus in the fullest 
    blaze of the Gospel, the rainbow continued the chosen emblem of the grace 
    and truth, which came by Jesus Christ. How can we render thanks enough for 
    this super-added pearl in our diadem of encouragements? </p>
<p align="justify">We are thus led to look for our rainbow on the brow of 
    every threatening storm. In the world of <i>nature</i> it is not always 
    visible but in the world of <i>grace</i> it ever shines. When the darkest 
    clouds thicken around us, the Sun of Righteousness has neither set nor has 
    eclipsed: and its ready smile converts the drops into an arch of peace. </p>
<p align="justify">Let a few cases from the diary of experience illustrate 
    this. In our journey through the wilderness, the horizon is often obscured 
    by <i>storms</i> like these; terrors of conscience, absence of peace, 
    harassing perplexities, crushing burdens of difficulties. But from behind 
    these dusky curtains, the <i>rainbow</i> strides forth in its strength. It 
    is indeed a cheerless day, when terrors of conscience pour down pitiless 
    peltings. Specters of past sins start up. A grim array of bygone iniquities 
    burst their tombs; and each terrifies by hideous form, and each points to 
    eternal death as its due. The light of life seems excluded by the dread, 
    "Can there be hope, when sins have been so many, and so grievous—and against 
    the clearest knowledge—and after such tender pardons, and such healings of 
    mercy?"</p>
<p align="justify">Wild is this tempest's roar—but in its midst faith can 
    still look upwards, and see Jesus with outstretched arms before the throne 
    of God. <i>There is a rainbow upon His Head</i>, and the bright colors 
    write, "Father, forgive them." "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses 
    us from all sin." The darkness vanishes, and clear joy returns. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Absence of peace</p></i>, too, is a heavy cloud. Many a cross 
    of spiritual distress lies in the believer's path. Today he may recline 
    joyously on the sunny slopes of the Gospel—tomorrow the thunders of Sinai 
    affright. Today David sits high at the banquet of the king—tomorrow he is an 
    outcast in the cave of Adullam. Now the Church rejoices in the voice of her 
    Beloved, that knocks, saying, "Open to Me:" soon she laments, "I sought Him, 
    but I could not find Him." 
<p align="justify">I must not pause to explore the <i>marshes</i>, from 
    which these chilly mists arise. But it is sure, that <i>the fault is with 
    our hearts.</i> Sin may be indulged—then comforts die. Means of grace may be 
    neglected—then heavenly communions are shut out. But in these dreary hours 
    the gladdening rainbow, which crowns the Redeemer's head, will suddenly 
    appear. In letters of light the truth is emblazoned, "Jesus Christ, the same 
    yesterday, and today, and forever." "I change not, therefore are you not 
    consumed." "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Again the darkness 
    vanishes, and clear joy returns. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Perplexities</p></i> are often as a mass of clouds. The 
    pilgrim would climb the hill of Zion, but impassable rocks are on either 
    side—the sea is in the front—the Egyptians in the rear. He sighs, as the 
    lepers of Samaria, "If we say, we will enter into the city, then the famine 
    is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit still here, we die 
    also." He is in the straits of David. The enemy has left him desolate; his 
    friends are ready to stone him. But he looks aloft to Jesus, and the rainbow 
    is bright. The "faithful and true Witness" cheers him onward: "This is the 
    way, walk in it." "I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you 
    shall go, I will guide you with My eye." 
<p align="justify">So, also, <i>burdens of difficulties</i> often oppress. 
    The believer is ready to sink beneath the weight. Moses felt this when he 
    said, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth 
    the children of Israel?" But a Bow was in the cloud, and it sparkled with 
    the promise, "Certainly I will be with you." He went and prospered. The 
    women on the way to the sepulcher were in gloom, "Who," said they, "will 
    roll us away the stone?" But a rainbow was in the cloud. Hoping against 
    hope, they advanced, and the stone was gone. Paul trembled, when he was to 
    stand alone before the tyrant and his court. But a rainbow was in the cloud, 
    and he took courage: "At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men 
    forsook me. Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me, and 
    I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion." </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, have you, like Noah, been called by God into 
    the ark of Salvation? Then, like Noah, <i>you may trace the rainbow in every 
    trial and discouragement. </i>Go forward undismayed, for you are encompassed 
    with heaven's hosts of covenant-grace. Nothing can separate from the love of 
    God, which is in Christ Jesus. You believe that no waters can again destroy 
    this earth. So believe, that neither sin, nor Satan can sweep you to 
    perdition. Your "life is hidden with Christ in God." The eternal God is your 
    tower of security. The arms of Christ are the guards around you. While God 
    is God, mightier than Satan, you are safe. While Christ is Christ, 
    all-sufficient to redeem, you are safe. Behold the rainbow. Satan cannot 
    pluck it from the skies. Behold your Jesus. Satan cannot reach His throne.
    </p>
<p align="justify">But do not extol the beauties of the rainbow, you who are 
    strangers to the sheltering ark. Alas! it is no harbinger of peace to such. 
    It tells indeed, that God is love, and God is true. But love rejected is no 
    friend: and truth unheeded is a relentless foe. When the clouds blacken, let 
    such tremble—for truth says, "upon the wicked He will rain fire and 
    brimstone, storm and tempest." When the rainbow gleams sweetly forth, let 
    them tremble—for it warns, God has set me here as a pledge, that His word 
    cannot be broken. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, these lines guide you to look upward; may they 
    also help you to look onward! Here you have no rainbow without a cloud and 
    without a storm. Here you see Jesus only by the eye of faith, in emblems, in 
    records, and in means of grace. But soon, throughout eternity's calm 
    brightness, you will gaze upon the rainbow of His glory. And as you gaze, 
    you will shine, even as He shines. For we shall be like Him, when we shall 
    see Him as He is!</p>
