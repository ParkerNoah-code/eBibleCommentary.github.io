    CLOTHED</font></b></font><font size="4"> </font></p>
<p align="justify">"The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife 
    and clothed them." Genesis 3:21</p>
<p align="justify">There is one God and one access to His smile. There is 
    one heaven and one door to it. The Savior, who was to come, and the Savior, 
    who is to come, is one Christ. The faith of Abel and of the Baptist looked 
    to the same object. Noah did not preach one righteousness, Paul another. The 
    Patriarchs did not rejoice in one hope, the Apostles in another. From first 
    to last, all the pilgrims to the hill of Zion lean on one arm. All the 
    voyagers, who cross the sea of life to the haven of eternal rest, are guided 
    by one compass. How all-important, then, is the thought for you, for me—Have 
    we escaped the many by-roads of destruction? Are we securely journeying 
    along the one only track which leads to life? </p>
<p align="justify">The Lord Jesus Christ is this one way. The rays of His 
    redeeming love burst forth, so soon as there was a sinner to be enlightened. 
    The garden of Eden witnessed the dark sight of innocence <i>destroyed;</i> 
    but it witnessed, too, an earnest of more than innocence <i>restored</i>. 
    The parents of our race were not driven into the wide wilderness of the 
    earth without a cheering prospect, and a strong comfort, and a precious 
    promise, and a distinct hope of full recovery. The heavenward road was 
    marked out before them in a clear map. Jesus was pictured to them in living 
    colors. </p>
<p align="justify">Even the <i>clothing</i> made for them, and put upon 
    them, preached the Gospel to them. Consider their case. They were conscious 
    of shame, and blushed to meet the light of day. In their distress they 
    sought concealment. They contrived—human invention could do no more—a shadow 
    of a clothing. How flimsy, how tattered was it! But God in mercy came to 
    their relief. He supplied all their need. He made "coats of skins and 
    clothed them." </p>
<p align="justify">It may be that until now you have seen nothing in these 
    garments but a warmth for the body and a screen from the wintry blast. But 
    be assured, the meaning is far larger. It is spiritual. It tells us of the 
    robe of Righteousness, which God has provided to adorn and beautify the 
    naked soul. May the Lord, by His Spirit, show this wonder to us! We gain 
    light on the subject by examining <i>the substance of which the coats were 
    made.</i> It was not leaves joined together—nor twisted bark—nor plaited 
    roots. It was the skin of lifeless animals. Death, then, must have commenced 
    its desolating work within the garden. But how did it approach its earliest 
    victims? Not in the slow step of gradual decay. This was the <i>morning of 
    existence</i>. Time was in its infancy. The wastings of age were yet far 
    off. These beasts of the field must have fallen by the hand of violence. </p>
<p align="justify">But why? Not to supply man with food. Before the flood,
    <i>herbs alone</i> sufficed for nourishment. Noah was the first who heard 
    the enlarged grant, "Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; 
    even as the green herb have I given you all things." They were slain, then, 
    for some other purpose. It could have been no unholy purpose, for God 
    regarded their slaughter with no displeasure. This He testified by using 
    their skins. If, then, they died according to the will of God, but not to 
    feed man, there remains only the solid conclusion, that <i>they were offered 
    in sacrifice</i>. Thus they foreshadowed the Lamb "foreordained before the 
    foundation of the world." And hence we learn that in Eden victims bled. Yes! 
    the first drop, which stained the earth, the first expiring groan, 
    proclaimed in the most intelligible terms, "the wages of sin is death;" and 
    "without shedding of blood is no remission." The doctrine of these rites is 
    the doctrine of the Cross. </p>
<p align="justify">All doubt is thus removed as to the skins, which supplied 
    man's first apparel. They were taken from the offerings for sin. Hence each 
    sacrifice presents to the eye of faith the double sign of full salvation. 
    Each altar casts a shadow, not only of the blood, which buys from hell; but 
    also of the Righteousness, which buys all heaven. Such is the figure—It is 
    indeed admirable for simplicity. But who can express the length and breadth 
    of the truth which it unfolds?—a truth which is the very key of heaven, and 
    the green pasture of the soul. Until we understand this, we are only at the 
    threshold of the Gospel. Will you not, then, draw nearer with me to seek the 
    full comfort of full knowledge? </p>
<p align="justify">I cannot doubt that your earnest desire is, when this 
    short life is past, to enter into the joyous mansions of the blest. But have 
    you robes of your own suitable for such abode? To be in heaven is to be with 
    God. All there are beauteous in holiness. All shine in purity. All are white 
    in spotless perfection. The eye of God rests on each with delight. He can 
    find no blemish in them. He counts them all fit to sit on thrones of glory. 
    But <i>how</i> have they obtained this unsullied clothing? It can be nothing 
    framed by man. Defiled hands can only work defilement. "We are all as an 
    unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." It is plain, 
    then, that if we could dwell where nothing but Righteousness reigns, we must 
    bring Righteousness with us. It is equally plain, that we can as easily make 
    ourselves gods, as array ourselves in unstained robes. </p>
<p align="justify">Who then will adorn us, that we may be found worthy? This 
    reasoning leads us to the glad tidings of the glorious Gospel. All is 
    provided for us in the Savior Jesus. The Righteousness needed by us, and 
    presented to us, is His obedience. He does for us, what we could never have 
    done. In Him we become what we never could have been without Him. He works 
    out an infinite worthiness, that He may be to us all that His name imports, 
    "The Lord our Righteousness." How precious is this well of truth!</p>
<p align="justify">Let us draw deeper refreshment from it in gratitude and 
    faith. Behold again and again the glorious fact. One, made of a woman, has 
    passed through human life without once straying from the path of God. The 
    earth has seen a man pure as God is pure, holy as God is holy, perfect as 
    God is perfect, sinless as God is sinless. He went round the circumference 
    of the law without one deviating step. With strong wing He soared to its 
    utmost height, and neither paused nor flagged. The searching eye of God 
    always upon Him, could not once find the absence of heavenly love in any 
    thought, or word, or deed. He had all trials, but no fault—all temptations, 
    but no sin. The ground was ofttimes slippery, but He never slipped. He was 
    assailed on all sides, but He never fell. Thus He stood before God, holding 
    in His hands a full unbroken obedience—accomplished—completed to the 
    minutest letter. But it was all <i>for us! </i>He wrought it, that He might 
    give it; and He gives it to every naked sinner, who in faith flees to be 
    thus sheltered by Him. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! perhaps you eagerly exclaim, Are these tidings 
    confirmed to me by the mouth of the Lord? They are! They are! Listen to His 
    words: "The Righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto 
    all, and upon all those who believe." Fully trust this saying, and all peace 
    is yours. It is "unto all," as payment placed to their credit in the book of 
    account. Thus when God reckons with the believer, and asks the fulfillment 
    of the law, behold! there appears on his behalf, deposited by the hand of 
    Christ, an obedience extensive with the very uttermost demand. God neither 
    desires nor can receive more. So, too, it is "upon all." Hence, when the 
    believer stands at heaven's gate, he appears in heavenly robes—the 
    righteousness of Christ is upon him. What more can be required? It is as 
    bright and glorious as God Himself. </p>
<p align="justify">I wish, indeed, that you should be satisfied on this 
    point. In this affectionate desire, I beseech you to weigh well another 
    Scripture: "He has made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might 
    be made the Righteousness of God in Him." Blessed is the man in whose heart 
    these words take root! They are precious beyond ten thousand times ten 
    thousand worlds. Do not they state that we—even we—who are all vileness by 
    sin, if only we are one with Christ by faith, are made the Righteousness of 
    God! To be reckoned <i>righteous</i> would be much. To be made <i>Divine</i> 
    Righteousness is far more. O my soul! limit not this mercy. Rejoice in the 
    full comfort. The humble believer re-echoes Scripture when he says, I am 
    made in Christ the Righteousness of God. </p>
<p align="justify">It is manifestly the Lord's will that this provision for 
    the soul should be always present to our adoring eye. Therefore it is, that 
    the object most familiar to our senses—even the covering of the body—is 
    planned to portray it. Study, then, this lesson. It is suited to every mind. 
    The palace and the cottage alike teach it. It is as clear to the unlettered 
    as to the learned. I would sincerely commend it to your faith and your 
    affection; but I find that earthly shadows fall as far short of the heavenly 
    reality, as the creature is nothing when compared with the Creator. </p>
<p align="justify">We admire Adam's robe of innocence. It was pure and 
    lovely, but it was human. Not so this robe. It is Divine. The God-man, 
    Jesus, is its Author. Adam's robe was soon soiled and lost. Satan touched 
    it, and it crumbled into nothingness. This Divine robe is kept in the height 
    of heaven; the destroyer cannot reach it. The skins brought to Adam would 
    soon wax old, and perish. This is "everlasting Righteousness." Age rolling 
    after age brings no decay; its newness is unfading. Earthly robes are 
    sometimes of surpassing splendor. But what would be the brightness of 
    Solomon's royal apparel beside this?—dim as the fairest star before the sun 
    in mid-day strength. </p>
<p align="justify">Here I stop, feeling that eternity cannot exhaust the 
    praises of this garment. But I have not written in vain, if these few words 
    make its preciousness more precious to the souls of any. Reader! do you 
    desire to possess it? Ask, and you have. Seek with earnest faith, and it is 
    yours. The prodigal returns, and the father says, "Bring forth the best robe 
    and put it on him." The weeping penitent comes, and heaven's best robe is 
    cast around him. Be wise, then, and listen to the voice which cries from 
    above, "I counsel you to buy from Me, white clothing, that you may be 
    clothed." What can you desire more? Here is Christ's worthiness, for our 
    unworthiness. His sinlessness, for our sinfulness. His purity, for our 
    impurity. His beauty, for our deformity. His sincerity, for our deceit. His 
    truth, for our falsehoods. His meekness, for our pride. His constancy, for 
    our backsliding. His love, for our hate. In a word, His fullness, for our 
    emptiness. His glory, for our shame. His one Righteousness, for our manifold 
    unrighteousness. </p>
<p align="justify">Happy the man, who replies, I hide myself in You, O 
    blessed Jesus! I receive You, as of God made unto me Righteousness. He 
    sweetly sings, "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful 
    in my God; for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has 
    covered me with the robe of Righteousness." He humbly adds the note of 
    transport, "Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of Righteousness, 
    which the Lord, the Righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to 
    me only, but unto all those who love His appearing."</p>
