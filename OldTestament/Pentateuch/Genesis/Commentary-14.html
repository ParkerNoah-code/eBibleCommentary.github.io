<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>MELCHIZEDEK </b></font></p>

<p align="justify">"Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and 
    wine, and he was the priest of the most high God." Genesis 14:18</p>
<p align="justify">The first war, which darkens history's page, is ended. 
    Abraham is moving homewards—crowned with success—laden with spoil. Suddenly 
    a scene breaks on us—marvelous in what it reveals—marvelous in what it 
    conceals. A personage, who is all wonder, stands on the stage of Scripture. 
    His name bids us mark him well. It is a full Gospel-note. He is high in 
    earthly dignity, for he is Salem's <i>king</i>. He is high in holy function, 
    for he is the <i>priest</i> of the most high God. Do we ask his lineage? It 
    is shrouded in a veil, which we may not pierce. Do we seek the morning of 
    his days? His sun never rises. Do we seek the evening of his life? His sun 
    never sets. He only appears in full-blown stature, and in meridian blaze. So 
    obscure is he in sublimity, so sublime in obscurity, that it is no surprise 
    to hear the question, <i>Can this be merely man? </i>He comes forward with 
    neither empty hand nor silent lip. He strengthens the patriarch with 
    refreshment for the way. He adds, too, the greater strength of blessing in 
    the name of God. Abraham owns the claim to reverence and to homage. He 
    presents a tenth part of all. </p>
<p align="justify">Such is the record. But Scripture pauses not here. It 
    teaches us, that <i>all these lines of mystery are lineaments of Jesus</i>. 
    It shows, in this stately person, no doubtful glimpse of the glories of the 
    office of the Lord. It tells us in distinct phrase, he is "made like unto 
    the Son of God." The tidings are often repeated, that Jesus is "a priest 
    forever after the order of Melchizedek." Hence faith, which only lives 
    looking unto Jesus, sits at His feet in holy, happy musings, and finds the 
    cheering of full Gospel-rays. </p>
<p align="justify">Behold Melchizedek! In wise purpose his descent is hid 
    far beyond our sight. So, too, clouds and darkness mantle the first rise of 
    Jesus. He is, by eternal generation, the co-eternal Son of the co-eternal 
    Father. But who can grasp such mystery? He, who begets precedes not the 
    begotten. This truth is a boundless ocean. Let us meekly stand on the shore 
    and marvel. But let us not repine, that <i>we cannot fathom what is 
    fathomless.</i> This truth hides its lofty summit in the heaven of heavens. 
    Let the poor worms of earth repose in reverence around the base. But let 
    them not venture to climb the giddy heights. To know God's essence, we must 
    have God's mind. To see Him as He is, we must be like Him. To span the 
    lengths of His nature, we must have His infinitudes. To survey His 
    magnitude, we must sit as compeers on His throne. </p>
<p align="justify">We read, and are assured, that Jesus, by eternal birth, 
    is God of God, and very God of very God. But while we cannot dive into the 
    depths, we bathe our souls in the refreshment of the surface. For hence it 
    follows, that He is sufficient to deal with God and to satisfy God, and thus 
    to save His people to the uttermost. We see not Melchizedek's cradle. But we 
    distinctly see him man on earth. Eye-witnesses, who heard Jesus and handled 
    Him, give testimony, that He, too, has tabernacled in our clay, and thus was 
    qualified to shed His life-blood as our ransom. </p>
<p align="justify">In Melchizedek we find neither first nor last hours. No 
    search can tell when he began or ceased to be. Here is Jesus. His age is one 
    everlasting day. From eternity past to eternity to come, His being rolls in 
    one unbroken stream. Before time was, His name is, "I am that I am." When 
    time shall have run its course, His name is still, "I am that I am." </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! does such greatness fill you with tremblings of 
    awe? Do you sigh, How can I draw near? How can I cast myself into His arms? 
    Behold Him! His eternal being is eternal love. He never lived, He never will 
    live, but with His people engraven on His heart, and spread before His eye. 
    "I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness 
    have I drawn you." Zion's walls are continually before Him. Immeasurableness 
    encourages, for it is immeasurableness of tender grace. </p>
<p align="justify">Melchizedek! How mighty is this name! He that utters it, 
    says, <i>"King of Righteousness</i>.<i>"</i> Who can claim that title, in 
    its full purport, but Jesus? What is His person, what His work, but the 
    glory of Righteousness? Since Adam fell, earth has seen no Righteousness 
    apart from Him. But His kingdom is first <i>Righteousness</i>, then <i>Peace</i>. 
    There is a throne in it righteously erected to dispense Righteousness. All 
    the statutes, decrees, ordinances, every precept, every reward, every 
    penalty—is a sunbeam of Righteousness. Each subject is bright in royal robes 
    of purity—each wears a crown of Righteousness. Each delights in 
    Righteousness, as his new-born nature. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! do you not long to be righteous, even as He is 
    righteous? There is one way—only one. Cleave to Jesus. His Spirit-giving 
    scepter will kill in you the love of sin, and plant in you the living seeds 
    of Righteousness. Melchizedek was a local monarch. His city was graced with 
    the name of Salem, which is Peace. The war which stalked through the land, 
    troubled not these tranquil citizens. Here again we have the sweet emblem of 
    Jesus' blissful reign. His kingdom is one atmosphere of peace—one haven of 
    unruffled calm. Heaven is at peace with the inhabitants. Sin had rebelled. 
    It had aroused most holy wrath. It had armed each attribute of God with 
    anger. It had unsheathed the sword of vengeance. It had pointed the arrows 
    of destruction against our world of transgression. But Jesus cleanses His 
    flock from every stain of evil. He is "the Lamb of God, who takes away the 
    sin of the world." The eye of God can no more find the cause of antagonism. 
    A flood of smiles descends upon the blood shed kingdom. The inhabitants are 
    at peace with heaven. </p>
<p align="justify">Sin had filled them with hatred of God's holiness—dread 
    of God's avenging arm—aversion to God's presence. But Jesus, by His Spirit, 
    plucks out the heart of stone, and implants a heart of filial love. The one 
    delight is now to draw near to God—to walk by His side—to listen to His 
    voice—to sing His praise. The inhabitants are at peace within. The sight of 
    the cross stills each rising storm of conscience, and stifles the accusing 
    voice of Satan. They see a divine Redeemer quenching by His blood the flames 
    of hell—building by His merits the palace of heaven. Trouble vanishes before 
    this morning star. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! there is no peace but in this Salem. But within 
    these walls there is one song of perfect peace. The gates are yet wide open. 
    The Prince of Peace calls to His standard. Blessed, blessed are they, who 
    hear, and hasten, and are at rest! </p>
<p align="justify">Melchizedek is called to the most hallowed functions. He 
    is the consecrated <b>priest</b> of the most high God. As king, he sat above 
    men. As priest, he stands before God. This holy office exhibits Jesus. He 
    spurns no office which can serve the Church. The entrance of sin calls for 
    expiation. No sinner can approach a sin-hating God without a sin-removing 
    plea. This expiation can only be by the death of an appeasing victim. The 
    victim can only die by a sacrificing hand. Hence we need a Priest to 
    celebrate the blood-stained rite. And all which is needed, we have in Jesus. 
    Cry out and shout, O happy believer, your "Christ is all." An altar is 
    upraised. The altar is Christ. No other can suffice. He alone can bear the 
    victim, which bears His people's sins. A lamb is led forth. The lamb is 
    Christ. None other has blood of merit co-equal with man's guilt. Jesus, 
    therefore, God in essence, man in person, extends Himself upon the accursed 
    tree. But who is the Priest who dares approach a super-human altar? Who has 
    a hand to touch a victim-God? The very sight would shiver man into 
    annihilation. Therefore <i>Jesus is the Priest</i>. But <i>can He slay 
    Himself? </i></p>

<p align="justify">Reader! God's will is His nature. Love for His people is 
    His heart. He looks to God—He looks to His Church, and counts it joy to give 
    His blood. Believer, open wide your eyes of faith—gaze on this glorious work 
    of your glorious High Priest. He spares not Himself, that all who flee to 
    Him might be spared forever. But mark it well, the Lamb has died once and 
    forever. The Priest's work on earth is finished once and forever. The 
    shadows are passed away. The one Priest entered with His own blood into the 
    holy of holies, having obtained <i>eternal</i> redemption. Will any now 
    speak of <i>priests, </i>and<i> altars, </i>and<i> sacrifices</i> on earth? 
    Let them beware. Let them consider. It is no light matter to trifle with the 
    Spirit's language, and the names of Jesus. What begins in ignorance may end 
    in death. "It is finished," is gloriously inscribed on the Priest's work 
    below. "It never ceases," is as gloriously written on the work above. Jesus 
    lives and His office lives! </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, behold Him on the right hand of the Majesty on 
    High. He appears in priestly vesture. The names of the true Israel are on 
    His <i>shoulders</i>—a token that all His strength is theirs to uphold them. 
    The names are on His <i>breast</i>—a token that, while His heart beats, it 
    beats for them. The voice of His pleading ever sounds and ever prevails. 
    Father, forgive them; and they are forgiven. Father, have mercy on them; and 
    mercies speed on rapid wing. The incense of His intercession ever rises. 
    Father, bless them; and they are blessed. Father, smile on them; and it is 
    light around. With extended hand, He takes their every offering of prayer, 
    and praise, and service. He perfumes all with the rich fragrance of His 
    merits. He makes all worthy in His own worthiness, and thus our nothingness 
    gains great reward. </p>
<p align="justify">Melchizedek meets Abraham with bread and wine. The weary 
    warrior is way-worn and faint. Refreshment is provided. The Lord is very 
    tender of His people's needs. Dreadful is the curse on the Ammonites and the 
    Moabites, because they did not meet Israel with bread and water in the way, 
    when they came forth out of Egypt. Here again we see our great High Priest. 
    With God-like bounty, He bestows every supply, which wasted strength, and 
    sinking spirits, and failing heart require. The fight of faith is fierce—the 
    journey of life ofttimes seems long—but at every step a banquet-house is 
    open, and refreshing delights are spread. </p>
<p align="justify">There is the solid sustenance of the <i>Word: </i>there 
    are the overflowing cups of the <i>promises</i>: there is the abundant feast 
    of holy <i>ordinances</i>, as manna from the hand of God: there is the 
    spiritual food of His own body given—of His own blood shed. Our true 
    Melchizedek invites us to draw near. And while we regale in soul-reviving 
    faith, the gracious voice still sounds, "Blessed be Abraham by the most High 
    God." The Patriarch, in grateful reverence, makes an <i>offering</i> of a 
    tenth part of all. O my soul, what will you render to your great High 
    Priest? Let your adoring language be, O Lord, I am Yours! You have bought me 
    by Your blood! You have won me by Your melting grace! You have called me by 
    Your constraining voice! You have subdued me by Your all-conquering Spirit. 
    I am Yours! My soul is Yours to adore You! My heart is Yours to love You! My 
    body is Yours to serve You! My tongue is Yours to praise You! My life is 
    Yours to glorify You! My eternity is Yours to gaze on You—to follow You—to 
    hymn Your name. But Eternity! Eternity! Eternity is too scanty for a 
    redeemed soul to magnify a redeeming Jesus!</p>
