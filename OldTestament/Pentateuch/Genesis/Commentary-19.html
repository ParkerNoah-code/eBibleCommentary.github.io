<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE LADDER </b></font></p>

<p align="justify">"Jacob had a dream in which he saw a ladder resting on 
    the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were 
    ascending and descending on it." Genesis 28:12</p>
<p align="justify">The voice which cannot err, denounces, "Be sure your sin 
    will find you out." Thus, by eternal law, misery stalks in transgression's 
    rear. Out of the Gospel-path, our feet are in furrows sown with woe. 
    Godliness is a quiet haven. Departure from it is a sea of trouble. This 
    truth is darkly written on many a sigh and many a tear. The case of Jacob 
    painfully attests it. Behold him a downcast and a lonely wanderer. He treads 
    a cheerless, solitary way. A journey is before him—long and perilous. He 
    tenderly sorrows for delights behind him. He tremblingly forebodes the evils 
    of tomorrow. But his keenest anguish is an upbraiding conscience. He leaves 
    his home, because he first left his God. </p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, bear all things, suffer much, suffer long; but 
    never venture, by ungodly schemes and ungodly guile, to run before the 
    pillar and the cloud. The sin of man hastens not the set purposes of God. 
    No, it rather stays the hand upraised to bless, and arms it with a 
    chastening scourge. Perhaps the declining sun never withdrew its light from 
    one more deeply in gloom than Jacob when he paused at Luz. The canopy of 
    heaven was his only roof—the bare earth his couch—the rugged stone his 
    pillow. Instead of a tender mother's tender care, he had hardness in its 
    hardest form. </p>
<p align="justify">But Jacob was an heir, from everlasting ages, of an 
    everlasting portion which is never lost. Hence an unchanging Friend grieved 
    in his every grief, and marked with sympathy his every step. The Lord, whose 
    love is wisdom, and whose wisdom is love, leads His children into depths for 
    their good; but leaves them not in depths to their hurt. It was so with 
    Jacob. It will be so while saints on earth need to be brought low, that they 
    may more securely rise. </p>
<p align="justify">Sleep closes his eyes. But in the night-watches marvelous 
    teachings gladden the unclosed eye of faith. "Jacob had a dream in which he 
    saw a ladder resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven." Here 
    was no obscure sign of Him, who comforts most by revelations of Himself. The 
    seed of the Woman, the Blessing of the Earth, the Covenant of His people is 
    unfolded in clearer emblem. The Redeemer is displayed wondrous in His 
    person, His work, His grace. Thus the patriarch found, as many find, that <i>
    the absence of man is the nearness of God</i>, and that the dark pages of 
    trial are inscribed with new lessons of love. He arises, and exclaims, 
    "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not." </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! this image, so radiant in Gospel-truth, vanished 
    not when morning came. It has a power to teach in every age, and to make 
    each lonely spot a Bethel to the pilgrim's heart. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Ponder well this Ladder. </p></i>Another like it, earth never 
    saw. Mark its <b>extent</b>. It unites the worlds of Deity and man. It 
    connects our sin-vile hovels with the abode of the Eternal. Resting on the 
    ground, which our feet defile, it rises and stretches upward, and pierces 
    the skies, and mounts to the very throne of God! As such it pictures Him, 
    who is at once the Highest of the high, and the Lowliest of the lowly—who, 
    while he thinks it not robbery to be Jehovah's fellow, counts it all joy to 
    be the poor man's kinsman. It shows Jesus, in the miracle of His person—man, 
    without ceasing to be God—God, without scorning to be man. These are blessed 
    tidings! Hold them fast, as the anchor of all hope—hold them up, as the 
    beacon of all salvation—hold them forth, as realities of grandest 
    significance.
<p align="justify">Our Jesus is the mighty God! All that there is in the 
    Godhead of power, and might, and wisdom, and love, and dominion has been 
    His, and must be His forever. Eternity is His birth-place. Heaven is His 
    home. His strength is Omnipotence. His arm is Infinity. His eye is 
    All-seeing. His ear is All-hearing. His mind is Omniscience. He wills, and 
    it is done. He puts on glory for a crown; and the brightness of that diadem 
    is the redemption of souls. Think forever, and you reach not the threshold 
    of His vastness. Adore forever, and you touch not the skirts of His praises. 
    The SUMMIT of this Ladder is Jesus reigning, the ever living God.</p>
<p align="justify">Observe, too, that a Savior less than this, could have 
    been no Savior for a sin-stained soul. For what is sin? It is an infinite 
    evil, because it outrages every infinite attribute of God. Hence, it is 
    inseparably linked with infinite woe. Oh! who can tell the boundlessness of 
    its dread results. It scales the heavens, and awakens wrath. It goes down to 
    hell, and kindles inextinguishable flames. It rolls on, a ceaseless tide, 
    throughout eternity. A moment did it. But no ages can undo it. Who then can 
    bear it away? The touch of <i>man</i> makes it more sinful. Angels' efforts 
    are as a straw before a rock. But Jesus comes. His blood is sprinkled, and 
    it vanishes. He hurls it from Him, and it is no more found. Why? Because 
    Jesus is God. If the height of heaven were the pulpit; if the pealing 
    thunder were the voice; if the universe were the audience; no more worthy 
    utterance could sound, than that the blood of Jesus blots out sin, because 
    the blood of Jesus is the blood of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence the delights which Jesus gives to the awakened 
    heart. It is conscious of iniquities towering to the skies. But, in the 
    merits of a Savior-God, a grave is found to bury all. Hence, too, we learn 
    why many think so little of this great salvation, and are content with a 
    mock shelter of their own construction. They are dead as to what sin is. But 
    when the Spirit once strikes the conscience with its sin-discovering rod, 
    there can be no peace but in a divine refuge, no rest but under infinite 
    covert. Christ, and Christ only, is such refuge, and such covert. I fear, 
    that to many this is a hidden truth. If once men saw it, they might dare to 
    sport with the lightning, or to wrestle with the whirlwind; but they would 
    not dare to trample on a Savior-God. </p>
<p align="justify">This image proclaims Jesus as invested also with our 
    nature. The Ladder set up <i>on the earth</i>, is Jesus very man, as truly 
    as He is very God. Yes, our Creator is our brother, that He may redeem us. 
    Man must die. Jesus hangs on the cross—<i>man</i>, that He may represent; <i>
    God</i>, that He may render a sufficient sacrifice for man's sin. His Deity 
    enables. His manhood qualifies. The one is all-sufficiency. The other is 
    all-fitness. Thus He cancels every debt, and makes all payment, and endures 
    all punishment, and exhausts the whole curse, and works a glorious 
    righteousness, and rescues all His sheep from the jaws of hell, and exalts 
    His spouse in spotless luster to the throne of His glory!</p>
<p align="justify">Next, the common uses of the Ladder instruct much in the 
    divine art of using Jesus for hourly help. By the Ladder <i>we leave the 
    lower ground.</i> By it we rise to things which are above. Just so, by Jesus 
    there is open passage for our souls and services from our lowest estate, to 
    Zion's heavenly heights. Sin not only left us prostrate, with no means to 
    soar: but it fixed an intervening gulf, which unaided man could never pass. 
    But Jesus interposes, and distance disappears. Believer, your heart's desire 
    is that your prayers and praises may speak to God. Place them on Jesus, and 
    they fly aloft. None can check their ascending speed. They are breathed 
    below, and instantly resound on high. You long that your tears of penitence 
    and sighs of shame may be heeded, where mercy reigns. There is no hindrance.
    <i>Mourn with godly sorrow, clinging unto Jesus, and you melt a heavenly 
    Father's heart!</i> You strive in word and work to glorify His name. Labor 
    with every effort intermixed with Jesus, and nothing can be done in vain. 
    How sweet is it to the eye of faith, to see its every cry, and hope, and 
    deed, thus carried buoyant to the court of God! </p>
<p align="justify">Soon you must die. Be it so. Commit your departing spirit 
    to the care of Jesus, and, released from its cage of clay, it will mount 
    with eagle-wings, and tarry not until the portals of eternal day are passed.</p>
<p align="justify">But the Ladder also affords means of DESCENT. We need 
    supplies from above. Through what channel can they come? Jesus alone 
    presents an open course. Through Him the Spirit is outpoured. The light 
    which dispels our darkness—all views of saving love—strength to begin and 
    persevere on the heavenward race—the joys, which make this wilderness to 
    blossom as the rose, all wing their downward flight by this connecting 
    Ladder! The believer stands upon this Ladder, and voices run along it, each 
    assuring him that his iniquities are pardoned, his person accepted, his soul 
    saved. By this path the promises come down into his willing hand, and 
    answers tell him that his prayers are heard. By this way ministering angels 
    hasten to encamp around, and to beat back the host of unseen foes. O my 
    soul, can you enough bless Jesus, who thus unites a blessed people with a 
    blessing God? </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! this subject is personal and practical. Tell me, 
    then, have you found, do you duly prize, <i>do you daily use these</i> <i>
    heaven-wrought steps? </i>The solemn significance of the solemn question is 
    this—Have you by faith grasped Jesus? Are you by faith cleaving unto Him? 
    Faith is the <i>eye</i> which sees the Ladder—the <i>hand</i> which touches 
    it—the <i>strength</i> which holds it—the <i>feet</i> which mount it. Has 
    the Holy Spirit opened to you this figure, which was new life to Jacob? 
    There is a ready test. Is the world beneath your tread? Do you trample on 
    its love, its fashions, its maxims, its principles? <i>Feet set on a Ladder, 
    no more rest on earth! </i>The man, who is in Christ is high above the 
    world. "You are not of the world, even as I am not of the world." </p>
<p align="justify">There is another test. Is yours <i>an ascending life? </i>
    On the ladder there is upward movement. So the believer rises, step by step, 
    from grace to grace. As there is no progress while one foot cleaves to the 
    dust, so there is no growth in grace while lingering affections adhere to 
    mire. We must be wholly Christ's or none of His. </p>
<p align="justify">Again, <i>are your days all effort?</i> There is no 
    mounting without toil. Saints strain every nerve. They run an unwearied 
    race. They wrestle in prayer. Their praises are as the ceaseless rapture of 
    angelic chords. Their zeal flows, as the ocean's tide. They rest not—digging 
    in the mine of Truth, and scattering abroad the riches which they find. Thus 
    they take heaven by holy violence. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! if you are some <i>lazy loiterer</i>, some 
    dreaming slumberer, I tremble for you. <i>Christ</i> worked on earth. Christ 
    works above. As is the Head, so are the members. As is the Lord, so are the 
    servants. Take heed, too, of <i>false ladders</i>. Satan has forged many. 
    Their form is specious. Their height seems heaven-high. But the summit 
    points hell-ward. The steps are rottenness, and soon they break. Salvation's 
    Ladder is only one—Christ Jesus. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, you profess to be on this Ladder. Hold fast. 
    Watch and pray. Some, who seemed to climb well, have foully fallen. The most 
    perilous slip is from the highest round. Perhaps you are conscious that your 
    foot has slipped. If so, arise and adore God, that you live. Arise and pray 
    for grace, that you may re-ascend. </p>
<p align="justify">Unbeliever, you know nothing of this approach to God. You 
    are afar off now. How will you bear to be far off forever? Hear then; and 
    may the Spirit bless the concluding word! There is a Ladder from every <i>
    sin</i> and every <i>sorrow</i> upon earth. But there is no ladder of escape 
    from hell's wages, and from hell's pains. There are no stairs, by which the 
    rich man may soar to Abraham's bosom. There is no stairway by which Judas 
    can leave "his own place."</p>
