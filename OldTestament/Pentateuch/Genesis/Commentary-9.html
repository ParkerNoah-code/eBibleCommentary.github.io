<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE ARK </b></font></p>

<p align="justify">The Lord then said to Noah, "Go into <b>the ark</b>, you 
    and your whole family." Genesis 7:1</p>
<p align="justify">The story of <b>the ark</b> has been familiar to us from 
    memory's birth. It gave interest to our earliest lessons. Its very name 
    revives the instructions by a tender mother's side, or from some anxious 
    teacher's lips. It brings us back to the first pages of our first Bible, and 
    to our seats as children in our childhood's class. In a land of Christian 
    teaching, most in their youth thus pondered <i>the record of a wretched 
    world's most wretched end.</i> In thought they trace and retrace each 
    particular, until the whole is vivid, as a witnessed scene. But they who go 
    no deeper, <i>only trifle as with a nursery-toy.</i> Their feet reach the 
    threshold of truth's palace, but they enter not into the wide chamber, in 
    which God dispenses light. They do not break the box of precious ointment. 
    They are like Hagar—a well of water is near—she thirsts, but sees it not.
    </p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">Reader! do not be deceived. The Bible is a mirror in your 
    hands for this grand end—that you may see therein a loving Savior's loving 
    heart, and a mighty Savior's mighty deeds. Jesus is the treasure of the 
    field of Scripture. If you win Him, you are rich and wise forever. If you 
    win Him not, all other wealth is poverty—all other knowledge is <i>a 
    brilliant folly. </i>Act on this soul-saving principle; and never close the 
    sacred pages until you are cheered by the smile of Him, who is the smile of 
    heaven. </p>
<p align="justify">Come, then, and with holy longing after the light of 
    life, let us contemplate the Ark. Jesus is there in all the glories of 
    redeeming love. "Make an ark of gopher wood." Here is no human forethought. 
    It is a voice from heaven. But for what purpose? The reply pencils the dark 
    background, on which the bright features of God's grace appear most 
    prominent in beauty. "God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the 
    earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil 
    continually," or every day. Sin enormous—sin all-prevailing—sin without 
    ceasing, was the vapor which went up from earth. But can <i>sin</i> thus 
    rear its head, and <i>wrath</i> lie still? Impossible! Sin is the abominable 
    thing, which God hates. It cannot move onward without dragging vengeance in 
    the rear. Behold the proof. God the holy and the just proclaims, "The end of 
    all flesh is come before Me." But would any plead that the threat was vague, 
    and gave no definite alarm? Judgment draws not the glittering sword, until 
    the clearest trumpets sound the clearest sound. </p>
<p align="justify">Mark the next thrilling note, "Behold I, even I, will 
    bring a flood of waters upon the earth." Thus all might know what terrors 
    were gathering around. Thus all heard the tolling of execution's bell. God 
    is righteous. He strikes not without cause. He strikes not without warning. 
    The notice, though thus distinct, seems to have been uttered only by one 
    preacher's voice. But who can count the messages upon messages, throughout 
    all ages, which have clustered around our earth, each testifying that the 
    day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men draws near? Reader! you have 
    been often told that <i>everlasting burnings are the bed of sin.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">The threatened vengeance moved with reluctant step. 
    Patience suffered long. Years dawned and closed, and still the sun was 
    bright, the skies were clear. Surely if space for repentance brought the 
    grace of repentance, the world would have been clad in sackcloth of 
    penitence and shame. But something far mightier than <i>external opportunity</i> 
    must work before a soul can feel, and confess, and forsake its sins. <i>Man, 
    not arrested from on high, is man going downward in guilt. </i>A lengthened 
    respite is often nothing but a lengthened iniquity. I beg you, apply this. 
    It is not mine to know your years, your warnings, or your calls. But years 
    you have; and warnings you have had; and every moment is a call. Say, then, 
    has the goodness of God led you to repentance? Let conscience answer. 
    Believe me, reprieves are not pardons. Execution delayed is not execution 
    escaped. Agag is spared today, to die more signally tomorrow. If you are 
    still a wanderer from God, let this hour see your tears, and hear your 
    prayers; <i>or soon you may never cease to weep, where prayer is never made.</i>
</p>
<p align="justify">Amid this spreading flood of evil the ark continues to 
    rise. Noah had heard the word, "Make an Ark." The command was startling. He 
    was to provide against a judgment, new and unknown. Reason would question, 
    how can it be? Experience—which knew not the like—would darken doubts. 
    Prejudice, with many ready cavils, would hint that it was improbable, if not 
    impossible. But God has spoken—The man of God was persuaded. He acted, and 
    prepared, and was saved. It could scarcely be, but that ridicule and sneer 
    would embitter his days of trustful toil. Many who saw him work, would mock 
    his unabating labor. He would stand a very by-word for brain-sick delusion.
    </p>
<p align="justify">This is faith's constant trial. The natural man 
    understands not its motives, its hopes, its expectations, its doings. But it 
    is quick of ear to hear, and quick of eye to see a guiding God. It well 
    knows whom it believes. It has an assurance far more assured than all 
    conclusions of reason or testimonies of sense. Thus nothing moves it. It 
    tramples down hindrances. It embraces the cross, and wins the crown. The 
    last hour strikes at last. The cup of iniquity overflows. Who now can stay 
    the right hand of the Lord? The clouds gather—the ceaseless torrents fall.
    <i>Where now is the jest—the taunt—the bravery of unbelief?</i> The truth of 
    God is a truth discovered too late. Destruction is found to be a reality, 
    when the victim feels the grasp. Refuge has ceased. The loftiest buildings, 
    the tops of the highest rocks, are only a watery grave. Earth is a whirlpool 
    of despair, and then the silence of departed life. </p>
<p align="justify">Such is the solemn fact. <i>Wrath denounced, and wrath 
    not feared, is wrath without escape!</i> But hearken! for <i>every drop of 
    this huge deluge has a voice</i>, which sighs; as surely as the ungodly of 
    the old world once lived, so surely did they sink in anguish. The word of 
    God responds with as many tongues; as surely as men tread the same earth, so 
    surely will the final flames burst forth. What! though the hour is not 
    expected. Unheeded slumber is one sign that it is near. Decreasing moments 
    will soon decrease no more. A worn out thread scarcely restrains the sluices 
    of a fiery flood. The end rolls forward. Soon, and it will be here. Soon, 
    and it will be past. Soon, and we shall have had our part in it. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! will it find you in the Ark of salvation, or 
    writhing in the billows of the lost? Pause, and reflect. The world decrepit 
    and blind in sin, is tottering to the gulf of ruin. Are you, then, secure in 
    an all-sufficient haven; or are you unsheltered, as a tiny bark in the midst 
    of a wild ocean's roar? Why do I thus ask? Because I would have you safe, 
    and happy, and peaceful, and blessed forever. But safety there is 
    none—happiness there is none—peace there is none—and blessedness there is 
    none, except in the Gospel-ark, who is Christ Jesus. Behold Him! Behold Him!</p>
<p align="justify">What is the Ark of old to us, but an emblem of His full 
    redemption? He is the one deliverance from all peril. He is the heaven-high 
    refuge. He is the all-protecting safety. He is the building of enduring 
    life; the foundation of which was laid in the counsels of eternity; which 
    was reared in the fullness of time on the plains of earth; and the head of 
    which towers above the skies. He is that lofty fabric of shelter, which God 
    decreed, appointed, provided, and sets before the sons of men. He is that 
    sure covert, which is so fortified, that all the thunderbolts of the 
    almightiness of divine judgment play harmless around it; and all the raging 
    storms of vengeance, and all the fury of the waves of wrath, only 
    consolidate its strength. It must be so. For our hiding place is the mighty 
    God. Our salvation is Jehovah's fellow. Our glorious sanctuary is the 
    glorious Jesus. </p>
<p align="justify">This Ark is brought very near—even to your feet. Its 
    portals are widely open. All things <i>call</i> you, no, <i>command</i> you 
    to come in. God's finger writes above the door, "whoever enters is forever 
    safe." No powers of earth or hell can injure or affright the rescued 
    inmates. Do you pause? Alas! too many a brow proclaims in letters of 
    worldly-mindedness, frivolity, indifference, profaneness, and sin—"as our 
    fathers were, so are we." <i>But will you be self-slain? </i>Would that I 
    could pierce the windings of your heart, and detect the fatal hesitation, 
    which administers its opiate there! I would drag the monster into light. I 
    would give you no rest, until you had trampled it to death. </p>
<p align="justify">Think, do any of the following marks betray the foes 
    which lodge as murderers within you? Convictions are sometimes hushed by the 
    silly smile—"we are only as the mass around us. If we are in peril, who is 
    not? Can these crowds all perish? Surely there is mercy in God, which will 
    hold back such an ocean of unfathomable woe." This thought is an old 
    deceiver. Numbers change not the truth of God, or the character of sin; 
    neither can they frame a bark to float on waves of fire. </p>
<p align="justify">Youth, if it thinks at all, may think that <i>coming 
    years</i> will bring some refuge. This is an idle dream. When did hardened 
    hardness melt into softness? <i>Will unbelief, by growing old, ripen into 
    faith? </i>The morning of life was no barrier against the flood. Who can 
    count <i>the cradles</i> which it devoured? If you are young, be wise, and 
    laugh not through a speck of time, and then wail through an immeasurable 
    eternity. </p>
<p align="justify">Others are at ease, because they have been taught the 
    truths of Jesus. The Ark was well studied of old. Day after day it was the 
    gaze and discourse of thousands. But this did not save them. <i>They who 
    trust to the mere head knowledge, will find their memory a keen edge to the 
    gnawings of the undying worm.</i> It may be that in forms, and ordinances, 
    and services, you draw very near, and seem to place your hands on saving 
    grace. Thus many <i>touched</i> the Ark, and did no more. As the water rose, 
    they would cling to it with agonized grasp—in vain! They are outside. And 
    all outside is death. </p>
<p align="justify">Others hope, sometime before they die, to cry and pray. 
    How many sank in fruitless shriekings for some help! Perchance you are high 
    in gifts, in talents, in position, in influence, in diligence, in 
    self-esteem, in man's applause. But as the peaks, which soared above the 
    clouds, dwindled before the flood; so the loftiest pretensions are very dust 
    before the great white throne. Is it so, that you have a shadowy hope, that 
    at last <i>something self-framed</i>, will be a plank of escape? Many 
    devices were devised, when the deluge began its unsparing work. But all were 
    as a mocking straw. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! do not be cheated of your soul's life-blood by 
    impostors in such thin disguise. Turn to the truth of God. Seek the one 
    real, solid, substantial provision, to which our Bibles point with extended 
    arm. There is but one name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be 
    saved. There is but one security. <i>We are only safe when enclosed and 
    wrapped up in Christ. We are above peril only, when dwelling within Him, the 
    Ark. </i>We are covered only, when we nestle in His wounded side. We are hid 
    only, when gathered under His widely-spread wings. Never rest until you have 
    passed the threshold of this heaven-wrought Ark. Then you may rejoice with 
    the people of God. "Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to You while 
    You may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach 
    him." Psalm 32:6</p>
