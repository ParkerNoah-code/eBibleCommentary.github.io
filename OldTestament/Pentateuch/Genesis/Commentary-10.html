<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">THE ALTAR</font></b></font><font size="4">
</font></p>
<p align="justify">"Noah built an <b>altar</b> unto the Lord." Genesis 7:20</p>
<p align="justify">To know the sanctifying power of grace, we must trace its 
    actings in holy men. A machine of many wheels is a complex puzzle, until 
    each part is seen in motion and in work. Thus it is by close study of godly 
    models, that we learn what <i>spiritual temples can arise from vile 
    materials of earth;</i> and how poor sinners, weak as we are, can become 
    courageous like heroes in the field of trial. </p>
<p align="justify">The scene may vary with the sun and with the cloud. But 
    still <i>some prominent marks</i> can never be obscured. The child of God 
    will always exhibit—ready obedience to a heavenly Father's will—undoubting 
    trust in His Word—calm submission to His guidance—constant approach to Him 
    through reconciling blood—and hallowed joy in prayer and praise. It is no 
    tree of faith, if it is not laden with these fruits. It is no purified metal 
    if it is not stamped with this image. It is no heaven-born soul unless it 
    proves its descent by these features. It is no heavenward walk, except along 
    this consecrated road. </p>
<p align="justify">The truth of this is written, as with a sunbeam, in the 
    annals of Noah. God said, "Make an ark." The work, though strange, is 
    instantly begun. The Lord calls, "Come, and all your house, into the ark." 
    If there be perils without, there are also countless perils within. But in 
    calm confidence he enters—and in following the Lord fully, he has all safety 
    and all peace. Again the same voice speaks, "Go forth from the ark." He 
    leaves his refuge to stand on the grave of a buried world. He had known the 
    earth as the riot-house of evil; but now it is a noiseless solitude. He 
    reads in one vast ruin the epitaph of sin. It is rightly concluded, that <b>
    worship</b> was his first employ. "Noah built an altar unto the Lord." </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The peculiar moment gives peculiar complexion to this 
    act.</p></i> Matters upon matters were crowding for attention. He was houseless. 
    There was no fold for the herds. He had all to do; and all demanded thought, 
    and plan, and arrangement, and effort, and toil. If ever man might plead 
    that distracting necessities excluded God, Noah was that man. If ever there 
    was a time too full for thoughts of heaven, this was the time. But no! All 
    shall yield to Him, who is above all. He, who is First, shall have the 
    first. He, who is Best, shall have the best. The earth's first building is 
    an Altar to its Maker. The patriarch's first care is to bless the care, 
    which has so cared for him. His first posture is the bended knee and the 
    uplifted hand!
<p align="justify">If I seem to linger on the outskirts of my subject, it is 
    to press this point: Satan often holds back the arm upraised to knock at 
    mercy's gate by the check, Not now, not yet! Earthly duties must have their 
    dues. This hour is claimed by the family—the trade—or rest. Listen not. No 
    time is lost by giving it to God! No work is good, except begun, continued, 
    and ended in Him. Devote to Him your earliest—your last.<i> He will not be 
    your debtor!</i> He, who never can be paid, will more than overpay you. </p>
<p align="justify">The Altar was raised, that offerings might bleed thereon. 
    You doubt not, that the dying victim and the flowing blood pictured the 
    dying of the Lamb of God. This is the first letter of the Gospel-primer. It 
    is, however, equally true, though not so obvious, that the Altar preaches 
    Him, who is the sum and substance of redemption's wonders. Jesus is every 
    part of sin's atonement. As He is the true <b>Priest</b>, and the true <b>
    slain one</b>, so, too, He is the true <b>Altar</b>. He presents Himself to 
    die upon Himself. Believer, thus your sacrifice is perfect because it is 
    entirely divine. You have a <b>Priest</b>—and only one; and He has passed 
    into the heavens, and sits at the right hand of the Majesty on high. You 
    have a <b>Lamb</b>—and only one. No more is needed. And He died but once; 
    for once was absolutely sufficient to satisfy and save. So, too, you have an
    <b>Altar</b>—and only one. It ever stands before the throne of God. Jesus is 
    this Altar. </p>
<p align="justify">This is no dream of imagination. It is the faithful 
    saying of our God. The Spirit Himself leads to the Altar, and bids us read 
    in it this Gospel-lesson. He guided the Apostle's lips to utter, "We have an 
    Altar." Therefore an Altar is counted among our treasures. But where is it? 
    It must be where the Priest is, and where the blood is. They are not here. 
    They are within the veil of heaven. There, too, is our Altar; and, being in 
    heaven, it can only be the Lord Jesus. This is the well of truth which the 
    Spirit opens. With joy let us draw water from it. </p>
<p align="justify">The Altar has many uses; but this is the main—it is the 
    victim's dying bed. Hence Jesus, when He comes to die, must have such a bed. 
    Now, let faith go back to Calvary—the cradle of its hopes. There, in the 
    fullness of time, our great High Priest is seen, leading a willing Lamb. The 
    Lamb is Himself. It bears no common burden, "for the Lord has laid on Him 
    the iniquities of us all." The weight of one sin would thrust a soul forever 
    and ever, downward and downward, deeper and deeper into the bottomless pit 
    of woe. But who can count the sins under which Jesus groans? The number is 
    infinite, and each a mass which knows no measure. On what altar, then, can 
    this heavy-laden sufferer lie? Let all angels spread beneath Him their 
    combined strength—it is but a broken reed. Shall worlds be piled upon 
    worlds?—They would crumble into dust. Heaven can give no aid. It is all dark 
    above, when Jesus cries, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken me?" Earth 
    has fled. He looked, but there was no man. But all that He needed, He was in 
    Himself. <i>His Deity is the Altar of His expiring humanity.</i> He is His 
    own support. Supported by Himself, He fails not under the whole flood of 
    Jehovah's outpoured wrath. Upheld by Himself, He drinks the last dreg of the 
    cup of fury. Firm on this rock, He pays, until justice cries, Enough. Strong 
    in His own might, He satisfies, until satisfaction overflows. Immovably 
    based on His own Godhead, He blots out iniquity, until iniquity no more is 
    found. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! I thus earnestly exalt Jesus, as the one Altar of 
    expiation, that you may learn more clearly, that He is All in buying the 
    soul from death. Believe me, it is not easy, it is not common, to see this 
    truth in its unclouded glory. Satan and all hell strain every nerve at every 
    moment to darken it with mists. Poor nature is prone to drink the potion, 
    that <i>some help</i> from Christ makes all things safe. Self, bewitched 
    with self, and self-performances, fondles the conceit, that man's 
    meritoriousness, decked with Christ's merits, is the key of heaven. What is 
    this, but to <i>build an altar of human rubbish, with human tools, and then 
    add Christ thereto? </i>This is the <b>delusion</b>, which, with Christ on 
    its front, stalks through the earth, and murders thousands! This is the <b>
    poison tree</b>, beneath the shade of which, many lie down and dream that 
    they make Christ their only hope, while <i>the main weight of trust is hung 
    on self! </i>This is the <b>fiend</b>, which mocks the lost, by showing them 
    too late that Christ extolled in name, is not Christ reigning in the heart. 
    This is the <b>foe</b>, which often makes the faithful ministry a fruitless 
    field. </p>
<p align="justify">Men imagine that to hear of Christ, and to commend the 
    sound, amounts to saving grace. Self, in some form, is earth's loved altar. 
    Here is the deep mischief of <i>the Church of Rome.</i> Here is the net so 
    speciously wrought—so craftily spread, by <i>that power of darkness. </i>
    That heresy admits enough of Christ to calm the conscience, but it retains 
    enough of self to slay the soul. It denies not, that Jesus lived and died to 
    save—but it denies that Jesus alone can suffice. It therefore erects very <i>
    many</i> altars—and very <i>high</i>—and very <i>captivating</i> to sense 
    and fancy. It makes these <i>the real groundwork of the sinner's hope.</i> 
    It then surmounts the whole with Christ, and, like a Babel-builder, thinks 
    that the summit will extend to heaven. There is a semblance of uplifting 
    Christ. But it is Christ added to angels—Christ added to saints—Christ added 
    to a train of mediators and intercessors—Christ added to the church—Christ 
    added to penance—Christ added to purgatory—Christ, as the pinnacle of a 
    pyramid of man's works. This is <i>the papal Gospel</i>. But the feet of the 
    image are of clay. It cannot stand—and its downfall will crush, like Dagon's 
    temple. </p>
<p align="justify">Others sport with this idol, who are papists in heart, 
    though not in name. They find an altar in forms, and services, and 
    self-denials, and superstitions. They build on a foundation of their own, 
    and then call Christ to decorate their structure. They grant that the scale 
    is light without Him; so at last they cast in the plea of His merits to 
    supply defects. This creed may seem to lead to life, but it goes down to 
    hell. The word is sure, "You who are trying to be justified by law have been 
    alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace!"</p>
<p align="justify">But there are other uses of the altar. <i>It received the 
    gifts and first fruits of the worshiper.</i> From it, supplies of food were 
    taken. To it the guilty fled. Its ground was a sanctuary; its horns a 
    refuge. Jesus is all this. Reader! your calling is to dedicate yourself—your 
    soul—your body—all that you are—all that you have—all that you can do—a 
    sacrifice to God. You may not keep anything from Him, who has given more 
    than all heaven for your ransom. Settle this truth, then, steadily in your 
    mind; that there is no acceptance for person, or services, except in the 
    Beloved. Words and works are worse than worthless, except when offered in 
    the faith, and through the merits, and for the sake of Jesus. That fruit is 
    only rottenness, which is not sanctified by His blood, and consecrated to 
    His glory. Cement yourself, your every intent—your every doing to Him. 
    Nothing but the rich incense, which curls from this Altar, can render you, 
    and your life, a sweet savor unto God. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! be much in <i>prayer</i>. This is the breath of a 
    living soul. Each moment is a need, each moment should be a heaven-ascending 
    cry. But it is only at one altar, that petitions gain power to prevail. 
    Supplicants, with Christ in their arms, take heaven by storm. But prayer 
    unmixed with Christ is a smoke vanishing into air. It is scattered, as the 
    chaff of the summer threshing-floors. </p>
<p align="justify">Abound, too, in <i>thanksgiving</i>. The command is, "In 
    everything give thanks." The tide of mercies ever flows. Shall the stream of 
    grateful love ever ebb? But it is no welcome praise, unless it be fragrant 
    from this Altar. Adoration must here plume its wings, or it can never fly 
    above the skies. </p>
<p align="justify">The soul needs hourly food. And it is here that it must 
    seek refreshment. Rich indeed is the meal to which the Gospel calls! The 
    word—the promises—the ordinances—the sacraments—are spread as an abundant 
    feast. <i>But it is Christ, who constitutes the essence of the nourishment!</i> 
    Apart from Him means of grace are but a choking husk. </p>
<p align="justify">The Altar, too, had horns. The offender clinging to them 
    was safe. No avenging hand could touch him. Thus, all who flee to Christ, 
    may smile at every foe. No threat of the law, no sword of justice, no 
    pursuer's rage can harm. Happy the believer, who has made this Altar the 
    home of his safe delights! Beneath its shelter he will often resolve, "Here 
    I have laid down the burden of my every sin; here will I add, by the 
    Spirit's power, the whole of a devoted and adoring life. He, who is the 
    Altar on which I die to sin, shall be the Altar on which I live to God. For 
    pardon and for godliness, Christ shall be my All."</p>
