<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">THE MORE 
    EXCELLENT SACRIFICE</font></b></font><font size="4"> </font></p>
<p align="justify">"But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn 
    of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering." Genesis 
    4:4</p>
<p align="justify">A long course of years has fled since the earth drank in 
    the blood of Abel. His was the earliest of all graves. But he is not silent 
    in it. His faith has an ever-living voice. No time can stop its warning 
    sound. "By it, he, being dead, yet speaks." Such is the heaven-told fact. 
    Surely then there must be much most worthy of notice in his testimony, since 
    it thus rolls on from age to age. Its subjects must be all-important. It is 
    so—none can be compared to it. It is so—for it proclaims the Lord Jesus 
    Christ. This is the purpose of its call to every child of man, "Believe on 
    the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." Trust in His blood. Plead 
    nothing but His death before God. Make His cross your only hope. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! perhaps you have never found all this Gospel in 
    Abel's brief life. But it is there. Unfold with me the record; and let us do 
    so in humble prayer, that the Spirit may graciously teach. For without His 
    aid, none ever see the Lord. Abel stands before us in the lovely character 
    of one whose spirit rejoices in God his Savior. This is the prominent 
    feature in his portrait. He selects the firstborn of his flock. He brings it 
    as an offering. He lays it on the altar. He raises the knife. He takes the 
    life, as a debt due to God. Such is his conduct. But what moves him to this 
    mode of worship? He must have some grand intent. Let us trace it. </p>
<p align="justify">Did <i>reason</i> convince him that he was a sinner, and 
    show him that, as such, his own life was forfeited? Did it whisper the hope, 
    that he might recover it, by giving another in its place? Did it suggest the 
    idea that the death of a guiltless victim might be the release of a guilty 
    soul? That could not be. <i>A sinner's blindness never suspects the real 
    desert of sin</i>—much less can it imagine a blood-stained ransom. There is 
    God in that thought. </p>
<p align="justify">But while we thus inquire, Scripture draws back the veil 
    and tells us the principle, which lived in his heart. It was faith. "By <i>
    faith</i> Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain." Thus 
    the case is cleared. For faith is trust in God, and humble reliance on His 
    Word. God speaks—and faith hears—believes—obeys. Faith can breathe only in 
    the atmosphere of revelation. It can stand only on the rock of divine 
    promise. It has no ear, but for heavenly tidings. It can read only what the 
    finger of God writes. It can always give a reason, even this, "The mouth of 
    the Lord has spoken it." </p>
<p align="justify">We are sure, then, that since Abel offered in faith, he 
    was following the positive directions of God. We are thus led to read many 
    of the workings of his soul in this service. It cannot be, but that his 
    parents had made known to him, in terms of shame, the enormity of their 
    willful fall. Hence he knew how it occurred, that he was born a child of 
    wrath, and an heir of corrupted nature. But could they pause here? Oh! no. 
    Adoring gratitude would constrain them to add that pardon was provided, and 
    that a Redeemer, all-qualified and mighty to save, was coming to lay down 
    His life. They would teach, too, that a holy rite had been ordained by God 
    to exercise faith, and to keep alive the expectation of the atoning lamb. 
    This was the Bible unto Abel. Here he would read the main lessons of the 
    Gospel of salvation. He staggered not through unbelief. He embraced the 
    truth wholly unto life eternal. In the twilight of the world, he saw the Sun 
    of Righteousness. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! does not this bring condemnation to multitudes, 
    who in the full blaze of light never get saving faith? We thus gain insight 
    into the spiritual man of Abel. He stands at this altar, a man of 
    humility—faith—love. He is full of self-abasement. He abhors himself in dust 
    and ashes. His act confesses that he is a lost, and ruined, and undone 
    sinner. He sees that eternal rejection is his due. He feels that he has no 
    power of himself to help himself. </p>
<p align="justify">But he is full of faith. In looking off from himself he 
    looks upward to another. He knows, that in the heaven of heavens there lives 
    a Savior ready to fly down with healing in His wings. He sees in the blood 
    of his victim, a pledge of the blood prepared to cleanse him to the very 
    uttermost. He is full, too, of sanctifying love. <i>For no man can trust in 
    mercy so full, so unmerited, so suitable, so effectual, without feeling, 
    that thus purchased from perdition, he must live a willing sacrifice to the 
    God of grace.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">At this time there was another by the side of Abel. But 
    now a great gulf parts them. It was his brother Cain. He was born in like 
    guilt. He doubtless shared the same parental instruction. In outward 
    advantages there was no difference. But is their spiritual character the 
    same? Far otherwise. The truth which melts the one, only hardens the other. 
    One receives the blessing. The other abides under the curse. Their dealings 
    with God manifest them. It is a sad sight. But we must not shrink from 
    observing how Cain discovers himself. He seems to come to God. This is good. 
    But what does he bring?—"The fruit of the ground." The first appearance is 
    fair. But the disguise falls; and we see the hideous marks, which prove that 
    he "was of that wicked one." </p>
<p align="justify">We find <b>self-will</b> at the root of his religion. God 
    has ordained the way in which He was to be approached. Cain thinks that he 
    can use a course more suited to the majesty of heaven and the dignity of 
    man. He places his puny reason above the counsels of the All-wise. He turns 
    from a revealed will to grope in the darkness of his own vain conceits. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! is not this a pitiful case? But it is the 
    delusion of many. "Professing themselves to be wise, they become fools." 
    Self-will first makes a god—then a religion—and at last a pit of destruction 
    for itself. </p>
<p align="justify">We next see <b>pride</b> in him. This must be, for it is 
    the first-born of unenlightened reason. Creation leaves man dust. Sin makes 
    him the vilest of dust.<i> But still he walks vaingloriously, until grace 
    opens his eyes, and lays him low in his proper humility. </i>So it is with 
    Cain. He feels neither sin, nor need of pardon. Therefore he proudly 
    tramples on an offering, which tells him of nature's pollution. High-minded, 
    he will not wash in the blood of the Redeemer, that he may be purified. Thus 
    he is a model of that class, who, in every age, say, "We are rich and have 
    need of nothing; and know not that they are wretched, and miserable, and 
    poor, and blind, and naked." </p>
<p align="justify">There was <b>unbelief</b>, too. God had set before him 
    the redemption of Jesus Christ. It was proclaimed in promise and in type. 
    What more could have been done? But Cain believes not. Unbelief closes his
    <i>eyes</i>—he will not look to Jesus. It closes his <i>hand</i>—he will not 
    lay hold on Him. It clogs his <i>feet</i>—he will not run to Him. It closes 
    his <i>ear</i>—he will not hear of Him. It closes his <i>mouth</i>—he will 
    not cry unto Him. It closes his <i>heart</i>—he will not receive Him. Do you 
    marvel at his folly? Take heed! Take heed! Conscience may know, "You are the 
    man." </p>
<p align="justify">The end is quickly told. Bad soon becomes worse. Unbelief 
    swiftly goes down to its place, where the Gospel is never preached, and hope 
    never comes. God expostulates. Cain yields not. He sees the righteousness of 
    faith, only to hate it. He seeks, by the murder of his faithful brother, to 
    extinguish the light which upbraids him. He falls into the recklessness of 
    despair. And now, from his everlasting chains, he cries, "Beware of 
    rejecting the more excellent sacrifice." </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! it may be, that, careful about many things, you 
    have, until now, been careless concerning that which should be the main 
    concern of man. Listen, then, for a moment, I beseech you. Do you not hear a 
    startling question from this story? It is this. <i>Are you a follower of 
    Abel or of Cain?</i> In simpler terms, are you receiving or neglecting the 
    Lord Jesus? I say the Lord Jesus. For this is the real point. He was the end 
    of the "more excellent sacrifice," which Abel brought, which Cain scorned. 
    He is the Lamb appointed by God, accepted of God, and led to our very doors 
    in our Bibles. Who can utter the mighty motives which urge the sinner to 
    avail himself of this sacrifice? They are more than the moments of eternity. 
    Each speaks as loud as the thunders of Sinai. Each has a thrilling clang, as 
    the trumpet of God. </p>
<p align="justify">Only consider its real <i>power</i>. It is just this. It 
    saves forever all the souls of all poor sinners, who present it to God in 
    faith. Now, is not your soul precious? It is so beyond all thought. It needs 
    redemption from wrath and ruin. Are you prepared to offer its equal price? 
    Suppose the balances of heaven brought out. What can you place as a 
    counterpoise in the counter-scale? You have nothing, but what is lighter 
    than vanity. Produce now "the more excellent sacrifice." Its worth is beyond 
    all weight. Offer this, and you are saved. Will you now be Cain-like, and 
    reject "the more excellent sacrifice"? Your sins are many. The sands of the 
    sea-shore are few in comparison. But each must be blotted out, or you die. A 
    sin unpardoned cannot enter heaven. What, then, will you do? One thing is 
    clear. You cannot undo the done. You cannot recall the past. But behold "the 
    more excellent sacrifice." It cleanses from all sin. Through it all manner 
    of sin is forgiven to the children of men. It makes the scarlet, white as 
    now, and the crimson, like wool. It changes the vilest into perfect purity. 
    Its merits can render you spotless. </p>
<p align="justify">Will you be Cain-like, and reject "the more excellent 
    sacrifice"? You need peace. Satan threatens. The law condemns. Conscience 
    accuses. Your wounds are deep. Your burdens heavy. Memory shows frightful 
    specters. The heart bleeds. You go mourning and heavy laden. You look to <i>
    self</i>. It is despair. You look to the <i>world</i>. It mocks your woe. 
    You look to <i>reform</i>. It is a broken cistern. You fly to outside <i>
    performances of devotion</i>. They are reeds, which break and pierce the 
    hand. </p>
<p align="justify">How different is "the more excellent sacrifice!" It tells 
    you that God is satisfied, guilt remitted, and all accusers silent. It thus 
    brings peace—perfect peace, which passes all understanding. Will you now be 
    Cain-like, and reject "the more excellent sacrifice"? </p>
<p align="justify">You desire sanctification. You pant to be conformed to 
    the image of Christ. This is well; for it is an eternal law of God, that 
    without holiness no man shall see His face. But holiness can be learned only 
    at this altar. It is a sight of the dying Jesus, which kills lust. It is the 
    shadow of the cross, which causes evil to wither. A lover of iniquity cannot 
    dwell on this hallowed ground. But there never was a holy man, who did not 
    live in glory in "the more excellent sacrifice." If ever you would walk with 
    God in true righteousness, you must not be Cain-like, and reject it. But 
    remember this sacrifice is only one. Jesus by the one offering of Himself, 
    once made, "has perfected forever those who are sanctified." Pass by it, and 
    you can find none else. Pass by it today, and you may seek it in vain 
    tomorrow. </p>
<p align="justify">Hear, then, the voice of Abel, which calls you without 
    delay to hasten to the one altar of salvation. Reader! turn not from these 
    humble lines, until in truth you can say, I rejoice in the Lord Jesus 
    Christ, I find Him to be "the more excellent sacrifice."</p>
