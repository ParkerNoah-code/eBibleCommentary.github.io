<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE EXCEEDING GREAT 
    REWARD </b></font></p>

<p align="justify">"I am your shield, and your<b> exceeding great reward</b>." 
    Genesis 15:1</p>
<p align="justify">It is a grand truth, that pleasantness and peace hold 
    constant court in the believer's breast. But it must be so. For where faith 
    dwells, there is Christ; and He enters as the author and giver of all joy.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! come apart for a little moment, and pray over the 
    simple words, which here endeavor to confirm this principle. If the 
    Christ-revealing Spirit withdraws the veil, you will see the well-spring of 
    happiness. Drinking of this pure stream, you will go on your way, blessed 
    with much of heaven in possession—with all heaven in prospect. </p>
<p align="justify">We here fly back to Abraham's inspiring annals. He was 
    dwelling in the land of his birth, in the home of his childhood, amid the 
    friends of his heart. A voice shakes him from his dead repose. "Get out from 
    your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house." Many 
    would have said, "This is a hard saying, who can hear it?" Not so the called 
    of the Lord. By faith he "obeyed, and he went out, not knowing where he 
    went." He was no loser. He received manifold more in this present time, and 
    in the world to come life everlasting. Again, when he had scattered kings in 
    the rescue of Lot, princely treasures courted his acceptance. Masses of gold 
    and silver sparkled at his feet. "Take the goods for yourself," was a 
    tempting offer, but with holy indifference he turned away. He was no loser. 
    After these things, an assurance richer than all the riches of earth 
    enriched him. "Fear not, Abram, I am your Shield and your exceeding great 
    reward." </p>
<p align="justify">Now in this narrative we have an unerring teacher's 
    voice. It tells us that <i>the true Christian is called to many 
    relinquishments, to much self-denial, to constant trampling on earth's 
    gilded baits. </i>But it tells us, that <i>every relinquishment is wealth, 
    and every loss is gain. For he who leaves all for Christ, receives more than 
    all in Christ. </i>A few particulars will establish this truth. There is a 
    plain inscription over the portal of the heavenward-path: "Strait is the 
    gate, and narrow is the way." He, then, who would enter, must be stripped of 
    all those flowing robes, in which men flaunt and swell in nature's broad 
    road. Self-righteousness must be torn off to its every shred. This is the 
    very flaying of the soul. Dependence on imagined merit adheres as the very 
    skin. But it all must yield. Self, in its most cherished form, must be 
    despised and hated, as an abominable thing. All our darling excellences, all 
    our fond conceits, all our superiorities must be rejected, as a filthy rag. 
    It is hard work to cast all this away, and to go naked to be clothed by 
    Jesus. But, if ever we would be saved, it must be done. </p>
<p align="justify">So, too, every hope which finds a Savior in the externals 
    of rites and services, and means of grace, must be ground to powder and 
    given to the winds. The channels of grace are not grace. The way is not the 
    end. The implements by which we feed, are not food. The husk is not the 
    kernel. The casket is not the jewel. The scaffold is not the building. The 
    door is not the mansion. Here again is work, which requires a martyr's 
    spirit, and more than human discernment. Satan is quick to deck our holy 
    things, and our holy places with a show of saving efficacy. He whispers, 
    that to put these into their proper place, is to put religion out of all 
    place. But we must not hesitate. <i>Christ must be embraced, unaided and 
    alone, or not at all. </i></p>

<p align="justify">I need scarcely add, that every sweet sin, which has long 
    been caressed in the recesses of the heart, must be dragged to the light and 
    slain. This is ofttimes as the plucking out the right eye. But there must be 
    no sparing. Christ is light. Sin is darkness. How can they be one? Sin 
    loved, indulged, retained, binds fast the soul to the wheels of the chariot 
    in which Christ cannot sit. </p>
<p align="justify">Again, the love of the world, in its foolish vanities, 
    its empty shows, its godless maxims, its defiling pleasures, its lying 
    principles, its soul-beclouding books, and all its idol-worship of talent, 
    wit, and falsely-called glory, must be nailed to the cross. Its conformity 
    must be shunned, as poison—its touch shunned, as a viper's sting. The heart 
    must have no throne, but for Christ. Every joy must center in Him—every 
    flower of refreshment must be gathered from Him. This walk is a departure 
    from nature's country, from sin's kindred, and from the devil's home. It is 
    a march towards a land, which Christ will give. It requires efforts many, 
    and struggles many, and conflicts many, thus to take up the Christian's 
    staff, and to put on the Christian's sandal, and to spurn all things dear to 
    nature and to self. </p>
<p align="justify">But what is <i>rejected?</i> Nothing but husks and 
    shadows—nothing but vexation, and disappointment, and misery—nothing but an 
    oppressive load, a mocking shadow, a gnawing care, a weary chase after 
    emptiness, a groaning under present burden, a dread of future reckoning. </p>
<p align="justify">What is<i> gained?</i> The substance of all good, the 
    perfection of all excellence, in Christ. He welcomes to the secret chambers 
    of His love. He opens His heart. A voice is heard by every coming sinner, 
    You thus give yourself to Me, because I gave Myself for you, and now I give 
    Myself to you. Fear not, I am your "exceeding great reward." O my soul, is 
    this all-satisfying treasure yours? It turns all dross to gold, all clouds 
    to sunshine, all sighs to song, and earth to the very gate of heaven. </p>
<p align="justify">Mark well the vast assurance, "<b>I</b> am your exceeding 
    great reward." There would have been wondrous grace in the word, I will give 
    some recompense. But it is more than grace to say, I Myself am your reward. 
    The prospect of future glory would have been sweet encouragement, but it is 
    mercy above mercy to bestow a present, instant privilege. <b>I</b> am your 
    reward. There would have been marvelous comfort in the pledge, You shall 
    lose nothing in my service. But it is very God to speak, "I am your 
    exceeding great reward." Mark, then, the vast assurance.<i> Christ Himself</i> 
    is the reward—the present reward—the great reward—the exceeding great 
    reward, which fills believing hearts. All He is, and all He has is theirs. 
    Theirs by His <i>love</i>, which had no birth—theirs by His <i>grace</i>, 
    which has no bounds—theirs by His <i>promise</i>, which has no change; 
    theirs by His <i>gift</i>, which cannot be recalled. Theirs, because He 
    delights to bless them. Theirs, because He overjoys in their joy.</p>
<p align="justify">Sincerely would I speak of the reward, which He gives in 
    the gift of Himself. But here the tongues of men and angels fail. He is God. 
    Is <i>His deity</i> a treasure? He says to His people, Open wide your hands, 
    My deity is yours! As God, His power is Omnipotence. He uses it for them. It 
    protects them by night and day from the fury and hate of earth and hell. It 
    stands every moment a high barrier between them and destruction. It prevails 
    with Satan to beat him back. It prevails with the Father to draw Him near. 
    His <i>wisdom</i> is unsearchable. But it is all for them. He so <i>plans 
    and disposes</i>, that the fate of empires and the falling sparrow alike 
    yield them good. His <i>Spirit</i> is theirs. He is sent forth to awaken, to 
    reveal salvation, to win to the cross, to cheer, to sanctify, and to lead 
    into the pastures of truth and holiness. </p>
<p align="justify">He is God-man. As such He has died, and endured agonies, 
    and sustained a curse, and wrought righteousness, and possesses a kinsman's 
    heart to sympathize. All is theirs. His <i>death</i> is theirs, that they 
    may never die. His <i>agonies</i> are theirs, to expiate. His <i>curse</i> 
    is theirs, to redeem. His <i>blood</i> is theirs, to wash them whiter than 
    the whitest snow. His <i>righteousness</i> is theirs, to deck them in 
    beauties fit for the Father's admiring gaze. His <i>sympathy</i> is theirs, 
    that He may have a fellow-feeling in all their infirmities, and a brother's 
    pity in all their griefs. So, too, His<i> present life</i> is theirs, that 
    they may live forever. His <i>intercession</i> is theirs. Hence streams of 
    blessings ever flow. His <i>advocacy</i> is theirs. Hence pardons cease not: 
    and God's countenance is ever the meridian-sun of smiles. </p>
<p align="justify">Yet a little while, and He comes again. His <i>return</i> 
    is theirs, to receive them in glorified bodies unto Himself. His <i>heavens</i> 
    are theirs, that they may dwell in one home. His <i>throne</i> is theirs, 
    that they reign on one seat. His <i>angels</i> are theirs, as ministering 
    guards. His <i>providences</i> are theirs, always revolving around the pivot 
    of their welfare. His <i>ministers</i> are theirs, to call, to feed, to 
    build them up. His <i>Scriptures</i> are theirs, as a mirror, in which they 
    may see His work and learn His ways. His <i>ordinances</i> are theirs, as 
    nourishment and strength, as seals and pledges of His everlasting covenant. 
    Thus they live, that they may receive grace from Him. They die, that they 
    may receive glory in Him. They revive, that they may see all the perfections 
    of Jehovah, and feast upon all joys before Him. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! strive to expand these hints. They tend to show 
    the blessedness of the "exceeding great reward" in Christ. But is it your 
    desire to have your portion in such happy state? Come, then, surrender all 
    for Christ. Make Him your own by faith. Lift up the gate of your heart, and 
    this King of Glory will come in. Abide in Him, and He will abide in you. 
    Give Him your confidence, and He will be to you this boundless recompense. 
    Can you think that He is less rich to bless now, than He was of old? Have 
    His rewards lost one grain of their immeasurable greatness? It cannot be.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Act the faith of Abraham, and you will hear as Abraham 
    heard, and find as <i>Abraham</i> found, "I am your exceeding great reward." 
    You will testify, as grateful <i>Jacob</i> did, "God has dealt graciously 
    with me, and I have enough," or rather, "I have all things." You will 
    experience with <i>Moses</i>, that the reproach of Christ is greater riches 
    than the treasures of kingdoms. </p>
<p align="justify">You will touch the chord of David's harp, and sound 
    aloud, "The Lord is the portion of my inheritance, and of my cup." Your 
    overflowing heart will testify, that <i>the half was not told you! </i>But 
    we need not go back to the early records of faith to show that Christ is 
    this "exceeding great reward." It is the one experience of all His servants. 
    Many are cottages, in which, while <i>penury</i> frowns, the godly inmate 
    smiles content, and sings the song of heaven over scanty fare. Many are the
    <i>reviled </i>and the<i> oppressed</i>, in whose mouth is neither railing 
    nor complaint, but one meek utterance of praise. Many are the chambers of <i>
    languishing and pain</i>, in which the very groans are melodies of 
    gratitude. Many are the beds of <i>dying</i>, in which death is abolished 
    and peace triumphs. </p>
<p align="justify">Faith can explain all this. It knows Him, who, by His 
    presence, makes all burdens light—all sorrows joy. It is the Lord. He dwells 
    there by faith. He is the "exceeding great reward." Faith, too, can take 
    wings and pierce the skies, and enter the home of the redeemed. What is that 
    scene? Multitudes upon multitudes, with robes of white, and crowns of 
    righteousness, and palms of victory, and songs of endless praise, follow the 
    Lamb wherever He goes. This is the recompense of Christ. He bought it all. 
    He gave it all. He prepared it all for them. He prepared them all for it. Is 
    He not an "exceeding great reward?" Can you now take the world instead of 
    Him? Look again. Read again. Think again. Holy Spirit! allow no one to put 
    these pages aside, until, by Your mighty power, Christ is established in the 
    heart, as the "exceeding great reward."</p>
