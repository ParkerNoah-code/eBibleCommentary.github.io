<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE STOREHOUSES OPENED</b></font>
</p>
<p align="justify">"So with severe famine everywhere in the land, <b>Joseph 
    opened up all the storehouses</b> and sold grain to the Egyptians." Genesis 
    41:56</p>
<p align="justify">He has much to learn, who has not found a garland of 
    delights in Joseph's story. The variety of incident, the rapidly changing 
    scene, the crowded picture of <i>man</i> in every character and every 
    circumstance, make it a choice pleasure-ground for young and old, for 
    peasant and for sage. The sacred pen, pointed by heaven, and deeply dipped 
    in the human heart, enters each chamber, in which feeling dwells. We weep 
    with the weeping father; we grieve in his protracted grief; we revive, when 
    he lives again in his son restored. We tremble with the youth trembling in 
    the pit. We sigh with him sighing in his exile. We take courage with him 
    trampling on his temptation. We are disconsolate with him, disconsolate in 
    his dungeon. We triumph with him, when he surmounts reproach, and takes his 
    seat as the ruler of a mighty empire. </p>
<p align="justify">But the grand value of the narrative is not the simple 
    style, the tender pathos, the amazing events, the winding thread of 
    providential arrangement, or the happy end. These lead the mind through 
    luxuriant fields of captivating interest. But if this be all, the profit is 
    as a fading flower, or as a morning gleam. He only gains, who gains a 
    blessing for his soul. The soul is the real man. All else is earthly as 
    earth; and transient as time. The book, the employment, the companion, the 
    scene, which adds not to spiritual store, whatever may be the seeming 
    promise or the present attraction, is an injury, an enemy, a poison, and a 
    blight. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The Scripture before us is precious, because every view 
    of Joseph exhibits Jesus! </p></i>Who is the envied, and hated, and rejected of 
    his brethren? Who is the sold for pieces of silver; the cast out into Egypt; 
    the numbered with the transgressors; the apparent culprit between two 
    offenders, of whom one is exalted, the other perishes? Who is raised from 
    the prison to the right hand of majesty? In all these outlines, is not Jesus 
    seen? He it is on whose shoulder the government is laid. He it is, who 
    rescues His kindred from perishing. He it is, whose heart yearned over them, 
    when they knew Him not. He it is, to whom the perishing must flee. He it is, 
    who has the key of all supplies. The name is Joseph. The true image is 
    Jesus. 
<p align="justify">But the text of this chapter limits our view to one 
    feature of this spacious picture. The <b>bounty</b> diffused by Joseph is 
    the <b>bounty</b> which is in Jesus. Let us draw near, then, to this 
    treasury of treasuries. And may the Spirit, sweet in His omnipotence, and 
    omnipotent in His sweetness, open our eyes to see its fullness—and our hands 
    to take of it! </p>
<p align="justify">The narrative discloses <i>a universal misery</i>. 
    Affliction in an appalling form brooded over a paralyzed world. The staff of 
    life failed. Hunger presided grimly at every board. The pallid cheeks, the 
    hollow voice, told the sad tale of death begun. But amid all the 
    hopelessness there is hope. Storehouses had been filled with grain; and 
    Joseph was appointed, as a minister of mercy, to deal out relief.</p>
<p align="justify">The glad tidings fly gladly through the land. Crowds 
    throng the life-restoring gates. Do you ask, why is there speed in every 
    step—and eagerness in every look? Hunger touches them with an iron grasp. 
    Home gives no hope. In toil there is no help. Only one can relieve. To 
    linger is to die. To apply to Joseph is to regain abundance. They rush from 
    ruin into remedy. <i>Here we see the starving sinner fleeing unto Jesus!</i> 
    There is a day, in which poor man sits careless in the hovel of his 
    need—content with husks of his own procuring. But <i>when light from on high 
    reveals his impoverished state</i>, then a very earthquake shakes the whole 
    fabric of his delusion. He finds that, as a terrific famine, sin sucks his 
    life-blood. In mercy's hour he hears, "You yet may live. There is bread 
    enough, and to spare, in Jesus." What now can keep him back? He bounds over 
    all mountains of difficulty: he wades through all oceans of hindrance: he 
    strides over all opposing taunts and sneers: he breaks every detaining 
    fetter. You may tie the winds with a thread: you may allay the storm with a 
    word: you may sweep back the ocean with a feather, but you cannot stop the 
    awakened sinner, who hungers for a <i>crumb of mercy</i>, and who knows that 
    to reach Jesus is to have all-sufficiency forever. </p>
<p align="justify">But perhaps I address some, who have not fled in rapid 
    flight towards this <i>one center of relief. </i>Awake, awake, before you 
    sleep the sleep of death! Do you not know that your land is famine-stricken? 
    It is so. Sin, as a desolating waste, has ravaged all the field of <i>human 
    nature</i>. It yields no healthful pastures for the soul. It has no regaling 
    fruits with juice of life. It is only a rank wilderness of thorns, and 
    briers, and noxious weeds. You must get <i>heavenly manna</i>, or you die! 
    The hands of Jesus alone dispense it. Will you not, then, arise and seek 
    Him? </p>
<p align="justify">Others, with some consciousness of peril, and some 
    efforts to escape, yet pine and languish. They set forth in search of food. 
    But Satan's false sign-posts mislead them. So they turn aside to granaries, 
    which 'error' has erected, and which 'self' has furnished. Here they feed on 
    the empty bubbles of outward rites, and forms, and unsubstantial religious 
    show. The cravings of <i>sense </i>and<i> imagination</i> may be satisfied. 
    But sense and imagination are not the soul. </p>
<p align="justify">Others advance farther, and yet never reach the coffers 
    in which <i>saving treasure</i> is laid up. It may be, <i>they pause at the 
    portals of God's word.</i> This guide is indeed divine. In every word of 
    every verse the voice from heaven speaks. But to listen to instruction is 
    not safety. The <i>knowledge</i> of the storehouse, is not food for the 
    famishing.<i> Ah! miserable woe, to fall into hell with Scripture on the 
    lip! </i></p>

<p align="justify">Others rest in <i>the Church</i> as their sufficient aid. 
    It is indeed a heaven-raised fabric. It is the pillar and ground of the 
    truth. It warns and teaches. But it can neither give nor retain life. <i>Ah! 
    miserable woe, to drop into hell from the scaffold of salvation!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Others feed only on <i>Sacraments</i>. These are indeed 
    ordained of God, as precious signs and seals of grace; but signs are not the 
    substance, neither are seals the deeds. <i>Ah! miserable woe, to enter hell 
    with Sacramental elements in the hands!</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Others are content with the refreshment, which faithful
    <i>ministers</i> afford. They are indeed the stewards of Christ's mysteries, 
    the heralds of His grace, the under-shepherds of the flock. It is their 
    province to go in and out before the sheep. But the <i>true nourishment</i> 
    of the soul is not kept by them. <i>Ah! miserable woe, to enter hell through 
    the schools of heaven!</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Others delight themselves in <i>labors</i> for Christ's 
    name. Works are indeed the <i>evidence</i> of faith, and shoots from its 
    root. But the evidence is not the motive—the shoot is not the root. <i>Ah! 
    miserable woe, to lie down in hell in a garb of outward godliness! </i></p>

<p align="justify">Reader! believe me, to obtain support, and grace, and 
    life, <i>we must go directly unto Jesus!</i> No hands but His deal out 
    supplies. Does any tremblingly inquire, "Will a ready welcome meet my suit?" 
    Myriads have sought, and all have found. He never yet sent suppliants away. 
    The decree is sure—"Him who comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out." His 
    character varies not: "He has filled the hungry with good things." The 
    silver tone of the call yet sounds; "Eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink 
    abundantly, O beloved." </p>
<p align="justify">Do you further ask, "What are the provisions of this 
    banquet-house?" I could more easily count ocean's sands, than tell the 
    plenteousness, which is here spread. "Hear, O you heavens, and give ear, O 
    earth." The Lord gives His body and His blood for food. "My flesh is food 
    indeed, and my blood is drink indeed." Faith stretches out an eager hand, 
    and adoringly partakes. But how? Not with carnal lip. The thought is heresy. 
    Reason scorns it. Infidelity derides it. Scripture denies it. All experience 
    rejects it as a pitiful and profitless conceit. No. <i>Faith takes and 
    digests the feast with the pure and holy relish of the heart! </i>The hidden 
    manna is the savory truth of Christ's body given, and Christ's blood poured 
    out for sin. The spiritual reception of this fact is strength, and vigor—not 
    to a crumbling house of clay—but to a new-born, ever-living soul. The inner 
    man thus nourished, fights, with a giant's might, the fight of faith, and 
    mounts up with eagles' wings towards Zion's heights. </p>
<p align="justify">Here, too, we gain the full nourishment of<i> precious 
    promises and Scripture-truths</i>. When the Lord's hand applies them, then 
    every word is spirit and is life. The poor, the weary, and the heavy-laden 
    come. Trials, afflictions, and temptations weigh them down. They crave 
    support, and they find it in gracious testimonies, and refreshing tokens of 
    eternal love. Like Jonathan, they taste the honey. Their eyes are lightened, 
    and their spirits cheered. </p>
<p align="justify">Indeed, there is no sustenance for Christian life, which 
    is not here provided. It is a grand word, "It pleased the Father that in Him 
    should all fullness dwell." Fullness not for Himself, for He is glorious as 
    God can be—but that He may replenish weary pilgrims. As the sun is light and 
    gives light—so Jesus is grace, and diffuses grace. The one experience of all 
    His suppliants is, "Of His fullness have all we received, and grace for 
    grace." The empty return full. The impoverished are made rich. The weak 
    become strong. The faint revive. The drooping are renewed in vigor. The 
    famished are fed. To some there was a tedious journey to the storehouses of 
    Joseph. But the rapid <i>flight of faith</i> brings us in one moment to the 
    depository of grace. Perhaps there were <i>appointed hours</i>, at which 
    Joseph distributed the grain. The gates of Jesus are widely open day and 
    night. Crowds might be detained by Joseph, while others were relieved. Jesus 
    is always waiting to give ready ear. The Egyptian granaries, though very 
    full, might be exhausted. Our supply is not in a cistern, but in an 
    ever-flowing spring. The contents are as deep as infinity, as boundless as 
    God. The Egyptians are required to purchase. We receive all, without money, 
    and without price. Over the Gospel-mart is inscribed, "Ask, and you shall 
    have." </p>
<p align="justify">Do you perish for need of the bread of life? Remember, 
    you are unfed, because you will not feed—you starve, because you will not 
    take. Are you as a sapless plant with little fruit and scanty shoots? It is 
    because you rarely seek the Joseph of the Gospel. But think again. "He gives 
    more grace." He has come, that you might have life, and that you might have 
    it more abundantly. Child of God, you have drawn near. You know how quickly 
    to your cry the door flew open. You sued for pardon. It was granted. You 
    sought for joy and peace. Your heart was filled. You told your need of light 
    and guidance. Directing rays shone brightly on your path. A suppliant eye 
    longed for some tokens of a Savior's love. Soon you beheld his heart, 
    engraven with your name—bleeding for your ransom. </p>
<p align="justify">Now, go and show your gratitude. You best can do this by 
    constant coming to the Storehouse door. Jesus ever stands to open. Will not 
    you ever stand to knock? He lives a life to give. Will not you live a life 
    to take and to dispense?</p>
