<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE SHIELD</b></font>
</p>
<p align="justify">"Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your <b>shield</b>." 
    Genesis 15:1</p>
<p align="justify">Abraham had heard the terrible clang of war. He had been 
    in perils of fight. Thus he knew, that without the safeguard of a Shield, 
    the warrior must go forth to overthrow and death. The sword was scarcely 
    sheathed, when the Lord, remembering His mercy, visits His faithful servant. 
    Seasonable are His words of comfort. "Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your <b>
    shield</b>." Here was assurance, that all foes were as chaff; for the 
    patriarch was encompassed with God, as with a shield. </p>
<p align="justify">In Abraham <i>warring</i>, and Abraham <i>shielded</i>, 
    every soldier of the blessed Jesus sees himself. The service of the Lord, 
    soothed as it is with heaven's own peace, is still a storm of assaults from 
    earth and hell. The <i>repose of faith</i> excludes not the <i>fight of 
    faith</i>. Rest in trouble is not rest from trouble. Hostile bands must meet 
    us in hostile land. Satan is yet at large, and is full of wrath. The flesh 
    is still the flesh, and lusts against the spirit. The world is still the 
    world; and, though worn out by centuries of sin, is vigorous to hate, apt to 
    wound, powerful to captivate, strong to enchain. Hence a ceaseless tide of 
    battle rolls. But it is vain, for Jesus ever lives, and ever loves, and 
    still cheers every believer, saying, "Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your <b>
    shield</b>."</p>
<p align="justify">But what is a shield? It is armor framed for defense. 
    Borne on the arm of the combatant, by rapid movement, it baffles the 
    assailant's aim. Whatever be the attack, its broad surface intervenes, and 
    all behind is safe. Just so in the fierce battle-field of faith, Jesus is a 
    wide-spread covering. Hence every foe hurls every dart, as <i>a harmless 
    straw. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Reader! here is a holy image. May it speak holy lessons 
    to the soul! It will do so, if by the Spirit's life-giving grace, it makes 
    Jesus more clear to faith, and more dear to the heart. Let us then take our 
    prayerful stand on the ground of truth, and solemnly mark what perils 
    threaten, and how Jesus wards them off. </p>
<p align="justify">How few duly consider the tremendous dangers, to which 
    they are exposed by sin! Could <i>the monster</i> be so lightly regarded, so 
    trifled with, so fondled, if its nature and its consequences were really 
    seen? Could men so live in its embrace, if they felt that it makes God an 
    enemy? But truly it fortifies God, and all that God is, with weapons of just 
    wrath. The thunderbolts of divine fury burn hot against it. The right arm of 
    omnipotent displeasure is ever raised to sweep it to destruction. </p>
<p align="justify">Such is the dreadful fact. But how can <i>dust and ashes</i> 
    stand, when God arises in the magnitude of infinite vengeance, and in the 
    multitude of infinite resources? <i>Flight</i> there is none, for God is 
    everywhere. <i>Resistance</i> there is none, for God has all power. <i>Self</i> 
    is ruin, because self is sin: and sin is the only cause of the furor. </p>
<p align="justify">But do I in these pages converse with anyone who is most 
    righteously provided in Christ Jesus? Jesus stands between the 
    justly-offended majesty of God, and the justly-perishing offender. He 
    presents Himself to receive each blow. They fall, they all fall, they all 
    must fall. Truth and holiness require it. But they fall, they all fall, on 
    Him. Terrible is the outpouring of the indignation, which beats terribly 
    against Him. "It pleased the Father to bruise Him." But He bears all. If 
    Deity assails, Deity sustains. It is against His fellow, that Jehovah wakes 
    His sword. All the arms of the armory of an avenging God fall harmless, 
    because all spend their fury in the breast of God's co-eternal and 
    co-almighty Son. Thus the believer meets God's wrath, and lives. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! are you safely hidden in Jesus? Woe is merited by 
    you, and it must come. To brave it in the open plain of defenseless nature 
    is sure perdition. There is no shadow of safety, but under these sheltering 
    wings. Have you by faith made this refuge yours? Faith, and faith only, 
    admits into the impenetrable defense. "Being justified by faith, we have 
    peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." </p>
<p align="justify">But God's abhorrence of evil is not our only adversary. 
    There is <i>the evil one</i>, red with the blood of myriads of our race. He 
    cannot but hate, for his heart is hatred. He cannot pity, for he revels in 
    man's misery. He cannot spare, because he lives, when we die. The first days 
    of our pilgrimage are the first days of his plots—his wiles—his cruel 
    warfare. He lays an ambush at every turn. Now a shower of darts pelts 
    pitilessly. Now the weight of incessant batterings descends. Now a sudden 
    arrow flies swiftly in the dark; and suddenly we fall, before danger is 
    suspected. He never slumbers, never is weary, never relents, never abandons 
    hope. He deals his blows alike at childhood's weakness, youth's 
    inexperience, manhood's strength, and the totterings of age. He watches to 
    ensnare the morning thought. He departs not with the shades of night. By his 
    legions he is everywhere, at all times. He enters the palace, the hut, the 
    fortress, the camp, the fleet. He enshrouds every chamber of every dwelling, 
    every pew of every sanctuary. He is busy with the busy. He hurries about 
    with the active. He sits by each bed of sickness, and whispers into each 
    dying ear. As the spirit leaves the tenement of clay, he still draws his bow 
    with unrelenting rage. </p>
<p align="justify">Such is our terrific and life-long fight. How can it be 
    that each moment is not a death-wound? We could not but be cast down, except 
    some Shield, far stronger than our own struggles, or our own resolves, were 
    cast around us. And where can we find this shelter, but in Jesus? He 
    interposes the might of His intercession: "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has 
    desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for 
    you, that your faith fail not." His prayers are our victory. They gain 
    supplies of divine aid. They brace us with heaven's strength. Thus we resist 
    the devil, and he flees from us. </p>
<p align="justify">Jesus shields us, too, by giving <i>the shield of faith</i>. 
    He is the author and finisher of this grace. Against this all the fiery 
    darts of the wicked are powerless. They touch it, only to be quenched. <i>
    The sprinkling of His blood is also an impregnable security. </i>Satan sees 
    this and trembles. It is an armor which he cannot pierce. This is the one 
    experience of the Church of the firstborn. They are all sorely pressed, but 
    they are more than conquerors, for they overcome by the blood of the Lamb! 
    Thus the Evil One touches not the shielded ones of Jesus. </p>
<p align="justify">But there are other foes swarming in every secret corner 
    of the camp. We have to wrestle with <b>self</b>, which cleaves to us as a 
    girdle of destruction. The flesh gives no quarter. Its lusts are terrible 
    shafts. They have strewn the earth with heaps of mighty slain. <i>David</i> 
    met them without his Shield, and his scar went down with him to the grave.
    <i>Joseph</i> was assailed. The enemy's aim was skillful, and bold, and 
    strong. But the Lord covered his heart, and temptation entered not. "How," 
    said he, "can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" The blow 
    recoiled, and he was safe. </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>pleasures</i>, the <i>luxuries</i>, the <i>honors</i> 
    of high station, also beat down their countless victims. None can withstand 
    them in human strength. But none can be vanquished, who have the Lord for 
    their breastplate. <i>Moses</i> was tried by their most seductive craft. He 
    might have sat next to the king in royal state. But he "endured, as seeing 
    Him who is invisible." And being dead, he tells us how to drive back this 
    wily troop of fascinations. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Man's frown </p></i>and<i> persecution's</i> threat give 
    deadly wounds. All this fury frightened <i>Daniel</i> and the captive 
    youths. The tyrant's wrath, the burning fiery furnace, the den of raging 
    beasts gaped menacingly on them. But they fled to the Lord. He was their 
    Shield, and they were unharmed in spirit and in body. Moreover, the 
    Zion-ward path is in the face of batteries, from which hosts of <i>cares and 
    anxieties</i> pour down their envenomed darts. How suddenly will they muster 
    their efforts to disquiet! It is well with me today through grace. But what 
    may come on the morrow? Friends may fail. Their pleasant seats may be a 
    melancholy void. Disease and languishings may make the frame a misery. Such 
    thoughts are pointed with keen anguish. And there is no shelter, but in the 
    Lord. He alone can deaden their sting. But He can shield by spreading before 
    our eyes His eternal love, His never-failing presence, His ever-watchful 
    care, His ever-living promises. 
<p align="justify">No apprehensions can slay the life, or vigor, or calm of 
    the soul, when the voice of Jesus whispers, "Do not fear, for I am with 
    you." "All things are yours." "This God is our God forever and ever, He will 
    be our guide even unto death." The soul is surely cased in peace, when it is 
    folded in the arms of Jesus. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! are you a true disciple of this Lord? If so, 
    bring forth your trial, your foe, your peril, your need, and I will show you 
    Jesus Almighty, and immovable, and ever-watchful to screen you from this 
    very hurt. "The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous runs into 
    it and is safe." </p>
<p align="justify">But do I in these pages converse with anyone who is afar 
    off from Christ? Unhappy child! can I speak to you of security? No, I warn 
    you, that you are on all sides defenseless, and in the midst of ruins. Where 
    is your shelter from the wrath of <i>God? </i>Where, from the rage of <i>
    Satan?</i> Where, from the death-blows of <i>self?</i> Where, from the 
    soul-murdering <i>world? </i>You have none! Oh! think. It is not yet too 
    late. You yet live, and your wounds, though many, may all be healed; and 
    your foes, though many, may all be driven, like vanishing smoke, before you. 
    The words, on which your eye now rests, direct you to the <i>only</i> 
    refuge.<i> Flee to Jesus! </i>He is always near, and always sufficient to be 
    your all-sufficient Shield. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, will not you put your seal to this truth? Have 
    you not found <i>a cluster of aid</i> in Him? Can you not say with David, 
    "Many there be who say of my soul, there is no help for him in God. But You, 
    O Lord, are a shield for me!" Will you not cry, "Blessed are you, O Israel! 
    who is like you, a people saved by the Lord? He is your shield and helper 
    and your glorious sword." And will you not exhort, "O Israel, trust in the 
    Lord, He is their help, and their Shield. O house of Aaron, trust in the 
    Lord, He is their help and their Shield. You that fear the Lord, trust in 
    the Lord, He is their help and their Shield." </p>
<p align="justify">What especial encouragement is here to <i>the faithful 
    minister</i> of Christ! What a tower of all-prevailing strength to the 
    humble laborers in the Gospel-field! They seem to sow in weakness the seed 
    of a few weak words. But it takes root. A gracious plant springs up. It 
    sheds forth fragrance like Eden, and bears fruit for the garner of the King 
    of kings. It thus flourishes, though checked by uncongenial climate, 
    scorched by fiery suns, battered by rain and hail. The wild-boar out of the 
    woods cannot ravage it; nor the wild beast of the field devour it. How is 
    this? No weapon that is formed against it, can prosper; for the Word of the 
    Lord is truth, "I am your Shield." Therefore, you servants of the living 
    God, bless His holy name. He always causes you to triumph in Christ. Go on 
    with the shield of faith, and under the covering of your Lord. Soon will the 
    conflict end—and in Salvation's kingdom you will sing the glories of 
    Salvation's Shield!</p>
