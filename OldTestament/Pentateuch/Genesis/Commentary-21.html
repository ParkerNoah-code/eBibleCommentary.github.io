<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>NUMBERED WITH THE 
    TRANSGRESSORS</b></font> </p>
<p align="justify">"Joseph's master took him and put him<b> in prison</b>, 
    the place where the king's prisoners were confined." Genesis 39:20</p>
<p align="justify">Prison is a place of humiliation and of shame. It is 
    peopled by those who are under accusation of crime, or who are awaiting the 
    sentence of outraged law. As such, the very name suggests ideas of infamy, 
    and chains, and death. The inmates are the actual or suspected perpetrators 
    of evil, whose name is a reproach—whom society casts out—who are as the 
    noxious weed, which must be rooted from the soil, and as the plague-spot, 
    which it is peril to approach. </p>
<p align="justify">But <i>who is the prisoner</i>, into whose cell these 
    words admit us? Within these walls of guilt we find<i> a guiltless man</i>. 
    The blameless <i>Joseph</i> is here immured. Without offence, he is wronged 
    as an offender—without transgression, he is numbered with transgressors. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! the pure delight, the sanctifying feast of 
    Scripture, consists in this. In every page the voice of Jesus is heard—at 
    almost every turn the image of Jesus is discerned. It is clearly so in the 
    dungeon-scene before us. <i>Joseph</i> in custody, reviled for iniquity 
    which he did not commit, foreshadows <i>Jesus</i>, who, without sin, is made 
    sin for us. Yes, He for whom the heaven of heavens is no worthy throne, is 
    clothed for us in prison-garb, and tastes for us the prison-shame. Hence the 
    Spirit records, "He was taken from prison and from judgment."</p>
<p align="justify">In approaching this truth, it is well to ask the amazing 
    question, <i>By whom</i> was Jesus arrested? and often to ponder the more 
    amazing reply. <i>He was arrested by the justice of God. </i>But why? Had 
    any fault stained His path? The bare thought is chilling, as the shock of 
    blasphemy. Let it be met with a shudder of denial. Holiness was the essence 
    of His being—the pulse of His soul. He was born the <i>Holy</i> Child Jesus. 
    He lived the <i>Holy Man</i> Jesus. He died the <i>Holy Sufferer.</i> He 
    rose the <i>Holy Conqueror</i>. He ascended in <i>Holy triumph.</i> Holiness 
    is the scepter of His kingdom forever. </p>
<p align="justify">How, then, could <i>justice</i> touch Him with a jailor's 
    grasp? Because, though no shade of sin was <i>in Him</i>, still <i>mountains 
    of sins were upon Him.</i> Although infinitely far from personal offence, He 
    stood before God laden with all the countless transgressions of a countless 
    multitude. Here is the godlike grace of God. He consents to <i>remove guilt 
    from the guilty, and to place it on the guiltless.</i> He transfers the sins 
    of the sinful to His sinless Son. Wondrous is the word, but true as 
    wondrous, "The Lord has laid on Him the iniquities of us all." So Jesus is 
    our sin-bearing surety. He appears, <i>by substitution</i>, as covered, 
    defiled, deformed by the whole accumulated mass of all our guilt. He is 
    verily accounted, and is verily treated, as the perpetrator of every evil 
    deed—as the speaker of every evil word—as the harborer of every evil 
    thought, which had stained, or should stain, each child in the redeemed 
    family.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence we understand the agony of His heart: My iniquities 
    have taken hold upon Me, they are more than the hairs of my head. He 
    presents His back to receive the hateful load. Justice finds it on Him. And 
    therefore justly claims Him as his prisoner. </p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, have you by faith a saving interest in Christ? 
    Then know your full relief. He snaps the chain which would have dragged you 
    down to hell. He passes under the dark waters of your pollution, that you 
    may be reckoned clear of every stain. He becomes your unrighteousness, that 
    you may be the righteousness of God in Him. The Bible is a sealed book—the 
    story of the cross is a beclouded page—peace is a delight untasted—hope is 
    an idle fiction, until Jesus is prized as a substitute and a surety. How 
    great the change, when He is so revealed! Then <i>Justice</i> shines in all 
    its glory—<i>Grace</i> in all its brightness—<i>Mercy</i> in all its 
    triumphs—<i>Salvation</i> in all its riches. Then the Gospel-trumpet sounds 
    with power, "Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world."
    </p>
<p align="justify">But in the Egyptian dungeon we see more than a 
    resemblance of the blameless Jesus bearing blame. Transactions are 
    transacted there, which help to unclasp the records of the empire of grace. 
    There are <i>two offenders</i> of no common note by Joseph's side. Human 
    judgment looks in vain for difference between them. They are similar in 
    outward calling—involved in like displeasure and degradation—expecting like 
    ignominious end. But soon they are parted. One mounts the path of favor, and 
    is crowned with honors—the other is left in bonds to die. Such is the 
    relation. </p>
<p align="justify">But in it there is a predictive picture. It is a signal 
    of the distant wonders of the cross. When man's rage and Satan's craft seem 
    to prevail, and Jesus is led as a lamb to the slaughter, a corresponding 
    circumstance occurs. To fill the cup of insult to the brim, notorious 
    culprits are linked as His befitting companions. But this studied effort to 
    degrade Him to the level of the vilest sons of infamy, only attests His 
    truth. The word which cannot fail, had said, "He was numbered with the 
    transgressors." </p>
<p align="justify">Behold the fulfillment. He is uplifted between two 
    malefactors. When will vain men learn, that <i>opposing rage only works out 
    the purposes of God?</i> The wildest rebellion is yoked to the chariot of 
    His counsels, and His will. But let us draw nearer and trace the coinciding 
    features of the two events. We take our station at Calvary. The accursed 
    trees are upraised. The three are transfixed thereon. Jesus hangs in the 
    midst. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! again and again I beseech you, be often at this 
    spot. That cross is the price of countless souls! the ransom of all the 
    redeemed! and the glory of God in the highest! He knows nothing of sin's 
    remission, who makes not these wounds his covert. He will never taste life, 
    who washes not in the fountain here opened. He only enters heaven, who 
    pleads this plea. Jesus here suffers, that He may wrest the scepter from the 
    hands of Satan—overthrow the empire of darkness, and cause every perfection 
    of Jehovah to be a pledge for salvation. It is a truth to be maintained 
    before all the world, that the religion which glories <i>not</i> in the 
    blood of the Lamb, is but a superstition of ignorance and conceit. The 
    blood-besprinkled hope alone can live. </p>
<p align="justify">We look next, to those who writhe in torture on each 
    side. It seems that they both begin to die, hard as the very nails which 
    pierced them. But soon a change—as great as light from darkness—life from 
    death—love from hate, passes over the <i>one</i>. He loathes the sin which 
    once he fondled. He confesses its enormous malignity, and he professes to 
    fear the God whom he had scorned. But from where is this newness of every 
    feeling? It is not the fruit of outward circumstance. All visible 
    appearances are common to them both. But <i>one alone</i> is touched, and 
    taught, and enlightened, and turned. How is he thus softened? Some <i>
    invisible power has entered the recesses of his heart, and there crushed 
    every godless foe. </i>It can only be the Spirit of the Most High. It is His 
    sole prerogative to convince of sin. Without Him the outward fact of trial, 
    affliction, pain, suffering, warning, threat, entreaty, never opens the 
    blinded eye, or turns the wandering feet. Whenever awakened conscience 
    cries, "Behold I am vile, I loathe and abhor myself," Omnipotence has aimed 
    the blow, which brought the rebel to his knees. </p>
<p align="justify">But more than this. A <i>trusting eye</i> now gazes upon 
    Jesus. To the mocking mob He seems "a worm and no man" but through all the 
    rags and poverty of humanity, through all the disguise of blood and of 
    infamy, faith knows the King of kings, the Conqueror of Satan, the divine 
    Deliverer, the all-subduing Savior! The shameful cross is discerned as the 
    glorious high throne of incarnate Deity. Here again we see the mighty 
    Spirit's work. <i>He alone can show Jesus to the soul. </i>But when He 
    speaks the word, the despised and rejected of men is loved and adored as the 
    chief among ten thousand, the altogether lovely One, the one dispenser of 
    the mercies of salvation. </p>
<p align="justify">But this is not all. A man may confess, "I have sinned," 
    and yet perish. Such was the case of Judas. The knowledge of the <i>head</i> 
    may boast, "We know You, who You are," and never obtain life. Such is the 
    case of devils. To gain interest in Christ, there must be <i>a personal 
    application</i> to Him—close dealing with Him. But when the soul is deeply 
    taught its need, and sees that Christ alone can minister relief, it cannot 
    be kept back. It receives a strength which bursts all fetters—wades through 
    oceans of difficulty—surmounts mountains of obstacles—and never rests, 
    until, safe in His sheltering arms, it hears the welcome of His lips. It was 
    so with the dying thief. Mark his cry, "Lord, remember me." I am perishing, 
    but You can save me. The flames of hell almost encompass me, but You can 
    rescue. "Lord, remember me." </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! is your <i>need</i> less than his? No! For it is 
    great as need can be. And things infinite admit not of comparison. Is your
    <i>loss</i> less precious than his? Is your <i>eternity</i> less eternal? It 
    cannot be. Have you, then, cried with his intensity, "Lord, remember me?" 
    Happy they, whose hearts thus wrestle with the Lord! They win the priceless 
    prize of heaven. They gain the matchless gain of everlasting joy. It was so 
    with the dying thief. So it will always be. Quick is the heart of Christ to 
    feel, and swift His word to cheer. "This day you shall be with Me in 
    Paradise." There is no doubt, no demur, no delay. A sinner mourns, the 
    Savior pities! A sinner looks, the Savior smiles! A sinner speaks, the 
    Savior hears! A sinner prays, the Savior answers! The petition is, 
    "Remember." The grant is "You shall be with Me." Blessed sorrow! blessed 
    faith! blessed prayer! blessed grace! </p>
<p align="justify">Blessed Savior! You are worthy to be called Jesus. You 
    are worthy to reign on the throne of the adoring heart. You are worthy to be 
    extolled with every breath. You are worthy to be proclaimed by every lip in 
    every climate, in every age. You are worthy to be the eternal hymn of 
    eternal hallelujahs. </p>
<p align="justify">It may be, that I address some, who, through many years 
    of worldly-mindedness, and unbelief, have been tottering on the precipice of 
    perdition. But you yet live; and Christ still lives; and the Spirit has ever 
    a heart of tenderness, and an arm of power. Therefore there is hope. The 
    door, though closing, is not yet closed. The thief pressed forward and found 
    grace. He had a golden moment; he seized it, and he is now with Jesus. What 
    will you do? Will you sit still and perish?</p>
<p align="justify">But perhaps Satan, that liar from the beginning, is 
    suggesting the thought that a death-bed will bring grace to repent, and to 
    believe, and to seek mercy. Believe him not. Was it so with <i>the other 
    thief? </i>The gnawing of agony only hardened him. Hell was near, but he 
    neither saw, nor feared, nor shunned it. And now from the midst of a fiery 
    lake he warns, as a frightful beacon, that <i>death approaching with sure 
    tread, and touching with strong hand, neither changes the heart, nor begets 
    faith.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">But let me rather hope that you have drunk truly of the 
    cup of life. If so, you differ, you widely differ, you infinitely differ 
    from former self, and from the mass around. But from where is the 
    difference? Surely you will gratefully allow, <i>Sovereign love</i> looked 
    lovingly on me—<i>conquering grace</i> dealt graciously with me. Surely you 
    will add, "By the power of sin I was what I was. By the grace of God I am 
    what I am. Sin numbered me with transgressors. But eternal purpose and 
    eternal love laid help for me on One that is mighty. Jesus was numbered with 
    the transgressors, that I might be numbered with His saints in everlasting 
    glory!"</p>
