<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">SHILOH</font></b></font><font size="4">
</font></p>
<p align="justify">"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver 
    from between his feet, until <b>Shiloh</b> comes; and unto him shall the 
    gathering of the people be." Genesis 49:10</p>
<p align="justify">Shiloh is a word first uttered in a dying chamber, and by 
    dying lips. Reader! how soon may your eyes be closing to the speck of earth, 
    and opening on the expanse of boundless being! Accept the humble hope, that 
    in such hour Shiloh, who is Christ, may be your solid support; and that the 
    light of His presence may make the dark valley bright. </p>
<p align="justify">Shiloh introduces us to a solemn scene, in which death 
    and joy stand hand in hand. The aged patriarch had known the perils and 
    tossings of a stormy voyage. But the longed-for haven now opens to receive 
    him. Our billows, too, may rage and swell. But let us struggle on in hope. 
    They waft the believer by rapid tide to the calm water of eternal rest. 
    Shiloh is almost the last testimony of the expiring parent. Happy is it thus 
    to leave a legacy of cheering blessings to those who watch around us! Happy 
    to direct the mourner's thought to Him, who has abolished death, and who 
    will gather all His children into one home of blessed union—where union is 
    eternity. </p>
<p align="justify">Shiloh. It is a sweet and mighty name. Sweet, for it is 
    His, whose name is as ointment poured forth. Mighty, for it is His, whose 
    name is above every name. In it He comes near to hold enlightening converse 
    with our minds. His love delights to reveal the riches of His goodness, and 
    of His glory, to His people. Thus while the highest angels veil their faces 
    while they worship at His throne, He draws the poor sinner to His side, and 
    bids him read, line upon line, the records of His grace. He passes before us 
    in a long train of titles: each giving fresh knowledge and awakening fresh 
    rapture. But while other names shine each as one ray of attribute, Shiloh is 
    a very wreath of light. Others are as separate jewels. This is a fully-set 
    diadem. It has many tongues. May each, by the Spirit's power, speak much to 
    us! </p>
<p align="justify">Shiloh is the <b>Sent</b>. "Go, wash in the pool of 
    Siloam, which is by interpretation, Sent." Here then Jesus spreads, as it 
    were, His credentials before us. He bids us mark, that He comes not without 
    authority; that He is commissioned by some court. Yes, truly, He brings a 
    message from a far-off kingdom. He speaks an absent Sovereign's will. <i>By 
    whom</i> is He thus sent? Hear one of the many voices, with which Scripture 
    scatters the reply throughout its pages. "In this was manifested the love of 
    God toward us; because God sent His only-begotten Son into the world, that 
    we might live through Him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that 
    He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins." The 
    eternal <i>Father</i> sends the eternal Son. We adore the love of <i>Jesus</i>, 
    in visiting this earth. We adore the love of the <i>Spirit</i>, in aiding us 
    to see His work and hear His voice. Let us adore, with every power of 
    adoration, the love of the Father, in opening the door by which He came. The 
    praise of every breath can never reach the glorious Giver's glorious gift. 
    The fountain of redemption lies deep in the Father's heart. The first link 
    of salvation's golden chain is in the Father's hand. The thought, "Let us 
    send a Savior," sprang into being in His mind. "God so loved the world, that 
    He gave His only begotten Son." "God commends His love toward us, in that, 
    while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." </p>
<p align="justify">Let us strive to measure the greatness of the love in the 
    greatness of the Sent One. The Father's Shiloh is the Father's Son. In the 
    fullness of time "God sent forth His Son." If He had emptied heaven of all 
    its shining hosts, and despatched them in glorious array, it would indeed 
    have been a brilliant embassage. But all would have been as dross, compared 
    with Jesus. He as much transcends all multitudes of angels, as the Creator 
    can transcend the thing which He has made. He had lived a whole eternity, 
    while they were wrapped in nothingness. How much more precious He than they! 
    Could then no other Shiloh execute the errand? Impossible! The work to be 
    accomplished is the sinner's redemption. Infinite righteousness must be 
    spread over the unrighteous. For this Jesus is needed. For this Jesus is 
    sent. Expiation must be made for sins, infinite in number, and each infinite 
    in guilt, and therefore Jesus comes. Jesus alone is able to atone. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, read then in your Shiloh the tender graces of 
    the Father's heart. He sends so much to save you, that He could send no 
    more. Read the boundless worth of your soul. Shiloh's merits are its only 
    price. Read the unutterable anguish of the lost. Shiloh alone had strength 
    to bear it for you. Read the inconceivable glories of the redeemed. That 
    heaven must be bright indeed, which is the purchase of a divine Shiloh's 
    blood.</p>
<p align="justify">Shiloh! The next expression of the word is—<b>He for whom 
    it is reserved</b>: He to whom the kingdom appertains: He, who is the heir 
    of all things. Thus Jesus is revealed, as seated on the throne of 
    redemption's glories. We catch the sound of the proclamation, "There was 
    given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and 
    languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which 
    shall not pass away, and His kingdom, that which shall not be destroyed." 
    Here is that sure purpose, and that sure promise, which is faith's high 
    tower of undoubting confidence. Here is the foreshadow of the onward coming 
    of victories, which must be. </p>
<p align="justify">What though the world is foolish, in mad rebellion 
    against Shiloh? What though iniquity may seem a mighty potentate? What 
    though the pure truths of Jesus are trodden as the mire beneath ungodly 
    feet? The name of Shiloh laughs all foes to scorn. It is a banner of 
    triumph, on which is inscribed, "His is the kingdom, and the scepter, and 
    the sway." "Yet have I set My King upon My holy hill of Zion." "Sit at My 
    right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool." Yet a little while, 
    and Jesus will take to Himself His great power and reign, "and the wicked 
    shall be silent in darkness." </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, cease then to be downcast, because you see not 
    yet all things put under Him. Your Shiloh must prevail. Look <i>back</i> and 
    see what wonders have followed the preaching of His name. Look <i>around</i> 
    and see what numbers are flying to the cross, as doves to their windows. 
    Look <i>onward</i>, and delight yourself in the view of fields ripening for 
    the harvest. In following Him, you follow a mighty Conqueror to mighty 
    victories. In His service you march to blessed triumphs. How soon, and every 
    foe shall lick the dust! How soon, and every cry of opposition shall have 
    died away! How soon, and His chariot-wheels shall drive gloriously, and 
    Satan, and the grave, and hell, and all the legion of sin's slaves, shall 
    writhe in captive chains! The kingdom is reserved for Shiloh. It may be you 
    have often prayed, "Your kingdom come." It is at hand. The answer tarries 
    not. How will it find you? Does faith bear witness, that you are called to 
    inherit the kingdom? Or does conscience tremble, lest His glory should be 
    your everlasting shame. Prepare to meet Him. Shiloh's reign is at the door.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Shiloh brings another message. It means—<b>His Son</b>. 
    Do you ask, whose Son? Faith takes the largest view. It answers, the Son of 
    God—for Jacob's mind is fixed on God. The Son of Man—for Jacob speaks of 
    Judah. Deity and humanity are here claimed for Christ, and both are His. </p>
<p align="justify">He is Jehovah's Son. This is the keystone of salvation's 
    arch. This is the light of salvation's skies. He is one with the Father. One 
    in nature—one in essence—one in every perfection. In every sense He is His 
    co-eternal and co-equal fellow. From everlasting to everlasting He is the 
    Mighty God. Before all worlds, and world without end, He is God over all. 
    They know no hope, who know not Christ, as God. It is mockery to say, "Look 
    unto Me and be saved," unless the speaker be divine. If He were less, He 
    could not remove one speck of iniquity from a sin-soiled soul. It cannot be 
    too firmly maintained, that <i>each sin is an infinite evil, and therefore 
    requires the expiation of infinite merit!</i> But you have all infinitudes 
    in Shiloh. He is omnipotent to bear away the countless sins of the whole 
    multitude of the redeemed. He is sufficient to clothe them with 
    righteousness fit for heaven. He is irresistible to subdue every foe. He is 
    all-glorious to present them all-glorious before the throne of God—and to 
    encircle them with all glories forever. This He can do, because He is 
    Shiloh, the Son of God. </p>
<p align="justify">But Shiloh—His Son—may mean <b>the Son of Judah</b>. Here 
    then we have another sign of the Woman's Seed. Jesus shall be the Lion of 
    Judah's tribe. He shall put on the rags of our poor flesh, as the offspring 
    of one of Judah's daughters—cradled in Judah's city. This is the wonder of 
    heaven, of earth, of hell, of all eternity. Does it fill your heart with 
    raptures of adoring praise? Do you find in it precious token of His 
    boundless love, and sure proof that He is qualified to redeem? </p>
<p align="justify">Ponder well the fact. If Christ is not truly man, there 
    is no atoning death—no expiating blood—no justifying righteousness—no 
    kindred sympathy—no open way to God—no center of union. God is infinitely 
    far from man. And man is immeasurably below God. But Shiloh comes to make 
    them one, with every property and faculty of man, and every power of God. 
    Faith is satisfied, and cries, "My kinsman, my Lord, my God, my full, my 
    complete Salvation!"</p>
<p align="justify">But there is yet another chord from Shiloh's harp. It 
    sounds the sound of <b>Peacemaker</b>. What sweet music to a poor trembling 
    sinner! He knows that sin makes tremendous enmity. It turns the heart of God 
    to wrath. It fills His lips with threats, and His hands with destroying 
    weapons. It builds the walls of hell, and kindles the fire, and hurries its 
    victims to the never-dying worm. But Shiloh flies to earth, and wrath 
    departs, and love resumes the throne, and peace puts on the crown. He takes 
    away the provoking cause. He buries sin in the fathomless ocean of His 
    blood. God looks on the believer wrapped up in Jesus, and loves him with 
    immeasurable love, and blesses him with countless blessings, and honors him 
    with heaven's honors, and glorifies him with heaven's glories! Shiloh is our 
    peace with God. </p>
<p align="justify">But He is more. He causes the waters of perfect peace to 
    flow in sweetest tides over the troubled surface of an awakened soul. When 
    the Spirit-taught conscience feels what we really are, and what we really 
    merit, what agonies come over him! There can be no ease, no hope, until 
    Shiloh bears us to His cross, and opens to us His wrath-appeasing wounds. 
    But when we see all our punishment descending upon Him, each fear is lulled 
    to rest. The storm of anguish becomes the calm of heaven's own joy. The 
    trial of life, the apprehensions of trouble, the threats of poverty and of 
    pain, the frowns of the ungodly, no more can harass. He, who has Shiloh in 
    his heart, has no room for anything but peace. He hears no voice, but that 
    of the Prince of Peace, always whispering, "Peace I leave with you, My peace 
    I give unto you." Such is the Shiloh promised by the dying patriarch. He has 
    come. He has fulfilled all. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! Do not put aside this feeble testimony, until you 
    can say, I know Him—I love Him—I cling to Him in all the offices, which the 
    large terms reveal.</p>
