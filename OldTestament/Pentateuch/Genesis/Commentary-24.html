          "I have waited for Your Salvation, O Lord." Genesis 49:18
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          <i> Salvation</i>! Blessed be God, that our fallen earth has heard the
          joyful sound! It is unheard in hell. Reader! blessed be the grace,
          which brought it to your ears! Multitudes of man's family are
          strangers to it. But thrice-blessed be the Spirit's love, if it is the
          sweetest melody which charms you—the loudest note, by day and by
          night, of your unwearied praise! To multitudes, it is a tuneless
          cymbal.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Salvation! It peoples the many mansions of the heavenly kingdom. It is
          the bliss of the ever-blissful. It is the joy of the ever-joyful. It
          is the happiness of the ever-happy. It is the song of the
          ever-singing. It is the peace of the ever-peaceful. It is the rest of
          the ever-resting. It is the glory of the ever-glorified. O my soul!
          see to it that you are saved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Salvation! It is a register written by Jehovah's pen. It is the decree
          of Divine councils: the fruit of omniscient mind: the first-born of
          unmeasured love: the perfection of eternal thought: the strength of
          omnipotence. It is the fabric, which every attribute of God erected,
          with concurring hand; in which every stone is brought by mercy, and
          shaped by wisdom, and laid by grace; in which there is no defect—no
          blemish—no decay! It is the soul-built temple, which will rise and
          shine in growing splendor through all ages. O my soul! see to it that
          you are saved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Salvation! It is the work for which <i>Jesus</i> was born in
          Bethlehem, and lived on earth, and died at Calvary, and descended into
          the grave, and burst the bonds of death, and mounted to heaven, and
          sits on the right hand of God. For this He trod the lowest valley of
          shame and grief. For this He drank the deepest cup of wrath and
          torment. For this He grappled with all the powers of darkness. For
          this He reigns and prays on high.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the work, for which the <i>Spirit</i> seeks our earth, and
          knocks at the barred entrance of the sinner's heart. For this He
          assails the fortress of self-love, and reveals the perils of sin, and
          wrestles with ignorance and vain excuses. For this He strives, until
          the arms of rebellion fall, and the contrite soul flees to the cross,
          and embraces Jesus, and shelters in the sure refuge of His wounds! O
          my soul! see to it that you are saved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Salvation! It is the first message which mercy uttered to a ruined
          world. It is the end of every prophecy—the significance of every
          precept—the beauty of every promise—the truth of every sacrifice—the
          substance of every rite—the song of every inspired lip—the longing
          desire of every renewed heart—the beacon, which guides through the
          voyage of life—the haven, to which the tides of grace convey—the end
          of faith, the full light of hope, the home of love. O my soul! see to
          it that you are saved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Salvation! It is the absence of this blessing, which builds the
          prison-house of hell, which kindles the never-quenched fires—which
          forges the eternal chains—which wraps the dreary regions in one mantle
          of blackness—which gives keenness to the undying worm—which bellows up
          the smoke of torment—which gives the bitterness of despair to the
          hopeless wail. O my soul! see to it that you are saved. Better not
          have been born, unless you are saved. Life is a curse, death is the
          abyss of misery, without this joy of salvation. To what profit would
          it be, to hold the scepter of kingdoms, to call the whole race of men
          our vassals, to look around on all the world as our own possession, to
          see in every creature only an instrument of our indulgence, to revel
          in every ease and luxury, to drink the fullest cup of pleasures, to
          sit on the highest throne of honor, to be caressed by all the
          affection, and to be extolled by all the adulation of man, unless you
          are saved? All these things, if they could be multiplied beyond our
          powers to calculate, and piled beyond our faculties to grasp, and
          stretched to time which we could not count, would be as nothing, and
          less than nothing, would be only the mockery of splendid woe—without
          salvation. Gain this, and all, and more than all, is gained. Lose
          this, and no words can express, no thought conceive, the amount of
          wretchedness, which is your endless doom. O my soul! see to it that
          you are saved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Do you ask, but <i>where</i> is this treasure, so surpassing all
          treasures, to be found? It is all in Jesus Christ. He is full, and
          perfect, and eternal Salvation. Hear the voice from heaven: "You shall
          call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins."
          Hear the lips which were touched by the living coal: "Believe on the
          Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." Hear the testimony of the
          Spirit: "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that
          Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here is truth—unerring truth—divine truth—high as the heavens—clear as
          light—sure as God. Sophistry cannot perplex it. Falsehood cannot deny
          it. Salvation is Jesus Christ! You may be clothed in purple and fine
          linen, and fare sumptuously every day, as Dives did—and not be saved.
          You may rule vast provinces, and command vast armies, as Pharaoh and
          Nebuchadnezzar did—and not be saved. You may be beautiful and lovely
          to behold, as Absalom was—and not be saved. You may belong to a
          Church, pure, and simple, and apostolic, and blessed with holy
          ordinances, as Ananias and Sapphira did—and not be saved. You may live
          under the highest blaze of Gospel-teaching, as Judas did: no, you may
          bear witness to the truths of Jesus, as he did—and not be saved. You
          may be exalted unto heaven in privileges and opportunities, as
          Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum were—and not be saved. You may have
          the shrewdest intellect, as Ahithophel had—and not be saved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But you cannot believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and fail of
          Salvation. The word abides for ever, "Whoever believes in Him shall
          not perish, but have everlasting life." Let the rich man believe, and
          he is saved. Let the poor man believe, and he is saved. Let the young
          believe—let the old believe—let the wise believe—let the ignorant
          believe—and all is safe! Christ is theirs, and Christ is Salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Does any eager soul exclaim, "Tell me further, wherein Salvation's
          blessedness consist?" Is it <i>a blessed rescue</i>, to change
          ceaseless wailings into endless praise—the blackness of darkness into
          the glories of brightness beyond the sun in his strength—the woeful
          dungeons of the lost into the palace of Jehovah—the chains of misery
          into palms of triumph—the beds of flame into the throne of glory?
          Salvation effects this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is it <i>a glorious work</i>, to turn hatred into love—cursing into
          adoration—every fiendish passion into one flow of holy peace—and to
          exalt the poor sinner from being the comrade of devils into
          partnership with the saints in light? Salvation speaks, and this is
          done.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Does any add, "Let me clearly understand, <i>how</i> this is all
          accomplished?" Come, see the excellent things, which Jesus works. He
          saves, by rescuing from hell. He saves, by giving title to heaven. He
          saves, by making fit for heaven. All praise be to the Captain of our
          Salvation. He saves, <b>by rescuing from hell. </b>Hell is the home of
          sin—the wages of sin. The steps of sin tend towards it. The toil of
          sin is to earn this payment. But if sin be removed, hell is escaped.
          Now Jesus takes away sin. From His wounded side, and pierced hands,
          from the cross on which He died, from the altar on which He makes
          atonement, a stream of blood flows forth, of efficacy so mighty—so
          cleansing—that it washes away every speck and stain of iniquity!
          Plunge all the sins of all who ever sinned, into this unfathomable
          ocean of merit, and they disappear forever! The foulest transgressor,
          bathed in this blood of atonement, becomes so pure, so white, that God
          can discern no blemish in him. Satan can no more allege a fault, or
          establish a claim against him. Why should he be made over to the
          dungeons of that jailor? He owes no debt, for all is discharged! He
          has no mark of perdition on his brow—for all is obliterated. How can
          he receive the wages of wrath? They have been already paid to the
          Surety in his stead. Thus Jesus saves His people from hell, because He
          breaks the only chain, by which the sinner can be tied down. No sin,
          no wrath—no sin, no hell. But sin can no more be found when Jesus
          casts it from view, far as the east is from the west.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He saves, <b>by giving title to heaven</b><i>.</i> He not only
          expiates on the cross. But moreover, He weaves, by His most pure and
          Godlike life on earth, a mantle of divine righteousness. This
          completely clothes all who are one with Him. His fulfillment of the
          law is reckoned their very doing. Thus robed in celestial robes, the
          redeemed have right to pass the gates of life. They are free to the
          citizenship of heaven. They are privileged to advance to the very
          throne of God. No seat is too high, no honors too vast for those who
          shine in this garment of Salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the believer needs more than a key to unlock the heavenly gates.
          He must bring more than outward decoration. There must be
          <i> an inward fitness</i>, or joy would not be joy. There must be a
          nature congenial to the nature which exists in heaven. The atmosphere
          above is all

          <i>holiness</i>. There is but the one pulse of perfect love in that
          abode. To an unrighteous man, this home would be a dismal solitude.
          From every sight he would shrink, every sound would be a discordant
          note. The presence of the godly inmates would be reproach and misery.
          Their one employ would be hateful irksomeness. Their one song, "Holy,
          Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts," would fill him with vexation and
          distress.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the Salvation of Jesus prepares for such rapture. He by His Spirit
          dethrones the love of sin: implants delight in God: takes barren
          hardness out of the soil: fills it with the flowers of Paradise:
          transforms it into the garden of the Lord. He of God is made unto us
          <i> sanctification</i>, as well as <i>redemption</i>. His pure robe
          decks those only, whom His spirit purifies. It is the hand of a new
          nature, which receives the new clothing. "The king's daughter is all
          glorious within," as well as arrayed in "wrought gold." All, who
          present the plea of Christ's righteousness, exhibit conformity to His
          likeness, and bring heart-longings for His immediate presence. Such is
          the great Salvation. O my soul! see to it that you are saved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is great, because willed, provided, accepted by a great God, even
          the <i>Father:</i> because wrought out and finished by a great God,
          even <i>Jesus:</i> because applied by a great God, even the
          <i> Spirit</i>. It is great, because it averts great woe: bestows
          great grace: and blesses a great multitude. O my soul! see to it that
          you are saved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Happy is life, when we can say with Paul, "He has saved us, and called
          us with an holy calling." Happy is <i>prayer</i>, when the Spirit
          supplies the loud Amen. "Whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord
          shall be saved." Happy is <i>praise</i>, when faith adds the chorus,
          "The Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song, He also has become my
          Salvation." Happy is <i>death</i>, when truth can testify, as in
          Jacob's case, "I have waited for Your Salvation, O Lord." Happy is
          <i>eternity</i>, when adoration sings, "Salvation to our God, which
          sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb!" O my soul! see to it that
          you are saved. But give ear, the Spirit warns, "How shall we escape,
          if we neglect so great Salvation?"
