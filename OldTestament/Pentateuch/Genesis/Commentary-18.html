<p align="justify">"Abraham called the name of that Place Jehovah-Jireh." 
    Genesis 22:14</p>
<p align="justify">Faith is the brightest star in the firmament of grace. 
    High is its origin—for it is born in heaven. Lowly is its abode—for it 
    dwells on earth in the hearts of the redeemed. Mighty are its deeds—for it 
    prevails with God, and over sin and Satan. It treads down seeming 
    impossibilities. It strides to victory over mountains of stupendous 
    hindrance. It speeds to its haven through oceans, in which each billow is an 
    overwhelming difficulty. It braces the Christian warrior for every 
    combat—giving a shield to screen, and a sword to subdue. It has a keen eye 
    to discern things invisible. It reads the mind of God, as written in the 
    tablets of eternity—as emblazoned on the cross of Christ—as wrapped up in 
    the folds of providence. It enthrones Jesus, as king of the inner man. It 
    kindles and fans the flame of love. It opens the lips of prayer and praise. 
    It turns the current of life into a strong stream of spiritual service. It 
    endures, until the gates of light open at its touch. It only expires, when 
    it sees the Lord face to face. </p>
<p align="justify">Should we not then earnestly covet this gift of gifts? 
    Should we not prize it, as the treasure of treasures? Should we not boldly 
    use it, as our best defense? Should we not seek it, as our truest wealth? 
    With this desire, come with me, and let us view faith's prowess in one of 
    the noblest passages of Abraham's noble life. And may the Lord the Spirit so 
    accompany us with His gracious teaching, that we may become heirs of the 
    faith and blessedness of this heroic servant of the Captain of Salvation!
    </p>
<p align="justify">God had looked on Abraham, when he was low in Satan's 
    dungeon. He had called him from bowing down to stocks and stones to see the 
    light of life. He had turned the darkest night into the luster of truth. He 
    had ofttimes shone around him in cheering communion. He had opened to his 
    wondering gaze the unsearchable riches of redemption. He had given pledge, 
    that the Savior from on high should put on human nature in his family. 
    Nature called hope of progeny an idle dream. But the Lord spoke, and Isaac 
    lived. After such miracles of mercies, after such wondrous promises, and 
    more wondrous fulfillments; "God tested Abraham." A trial was sent to test 
    the reality and the strength of his grace. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! faith untried, unprobed, unproved, is faith 
    uncertain. The quality of the metal is ascertained, by what it can do and 
    bear. The courage of the soldier is evidenced in the field. The depth of the 
    root is shown by resistance to the hurricane. It is a rock, if no lashing 
    surges can move it. It is a good foundation, when no batterings shake the 
    building. But trials do more than search whether faith is deep-rooted. They 
    also consolidate and invigorate it. The often-strained sinew becomes more 
    firm. The long-strained racer wins the prize. By exercise new powers expand 
    and fit for the wrestle. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! if you are a partaker of this blessed gift, think 
    it not strange, that you are called to breast the thwarting current of many 
    an opposing wave. It is needful—it is right—it is good. The issue will be a 
    richer harvest of assurance and delight. Lift up then the head, and "count 
    it all joy, when you fall into diverse trials." But what furnace was ever 
    hot as that which burnished Abraham's faith? He was rejoicing in his 
    child—the signal token of God's signal favor. Suddenly the voice, which had 
    so often caused his heart to burn, freezes his heart to stone. "Take your 
    son, your only son—yes, Isaac, whom you love so much—and go to the land of 
    Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, 
    which I will point out to you." He hears, but can he hear aright? His 
    fondest hopes become a ruin. The promise, dearer than life, withers as a 
    blight-stricken bud. The tree which held salvation's seed, falls low. The 
    channel of redemption's stream is choked. </p>
<p align="justify">But God spoke—that is enough. The command is from 
    heaven—positive and clear. It cannot err. Isaac may die, but faith dies not. 
    It can reason, God has all wisdom, and power, and truth; "with Him is no 
    variableness, neither shadow of turning." Clouds and darkness may shroud the 
    event. But through clouds and darkness, the faithful word and the loving 
    purpose will break forth, as a summer's morn. So Abraham rose up early, and 
    hastened to do His will. </p>
<p align="justify">Let this example teach, that <i>prompt obedience is the 
    surest wisdom</i>. God loudly addresses you in your Bible. He shows you the 
    one path of life. He calls you to bring one sacrifice to Him in the arms of 
    faith, and to offer one Lamb on one Altar. Rise up early and obey. To linger 
    is to court ruin.<i> Delay is the craftiest net of Satan.</i> It is the 
    terrible pitfall, out of which there are rare escapes. Many in torment will 
    forever deplore the miserable hesitation, which ended in their miserable 
    end. They tarried, but death tarried not. They paused, and the voice of 
    mercy ceased. Commands unheeded are the common and the rapid road to hell.
    </p>
<p align="justify">For three days Abraham journeyed towards the appointed 
    mount. This was large opportunity for unbelief to whisper many a dissuading 
    thought. This was long time for the father's heart to ache. He looks on his 
    child, and there is agony. He looks up to his God, and the agony melts into 
    the calmness of unruffled peace. He turns to his child, and his foot would 
    sincerely falter. He turns to his God, and the step is firm in resolute 
    resolve. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! faith is a persevering and unflinching grace. It 
    holds fast by the Word—so it holds on—so it holds out. But now every fiber 
    of affection is wrung by the simple inquiry of his confiding Isaac, "My 
    father, behold the fire and the wood, but <i>where is the lamb for a burnt 
    offering?" </i>None can tell the anguish of such a moment, for none were 
    ever pierced by such an arrow, but it laid open the recesses of his heart, 
    only to show how faith there reigned. Abraham answered, "God Himself will 
    provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son."</p>
<p align="justify">Here is faith in its simple element of trust, and in its 
    single consistency of acting. It totters not. Its stand is as a giant's 
    stand on earth: because its head towers above the skies, gazing upon God. It 
    leaves the time, the place, the means, the method, the all to Him. So it 
    goes forward. It knows that God's leadings lead to God's glory. And God's 
    glory is its happy paradise. It was so. Isaac is bound. And must he really 
    die? Faith stops not to inquire. He is laid upon the altar. The hand is 
    stretched out. The knife is taken. The last moment has come. But the last 
    moment is the fit time to crown faith with reward, and victory, and peace. 
    The voice which bade, now forbids. He who said, "Take your son," arrests by 
    saying, "Lay not your hand upon the lad." </p>
<p align="justify">Behold God's wondrous way. His word is honored. Faith 
    triumphs, and is honored too. It is tried, and by the trial is confirmed and 
    expanded. The patriarch now begins a new life of heavenly joy. For the joy 
    of <i>Isaac born</i> is nothing to the joy of <i>Isaac restored</i>. A 
    giving God was love in the highest. A restoring God is love in higher 
    heights. </p>
<p align="justify">Nor is this all. A memorial is raised to cheer the 
    faithful throughout all generations. So Abraham called that place 'The Lord 
    Will Provide.' And to this day it is said, "On the mountain of the Lord it 
    will be provided." Believer, this memorial proclaims the full provision, 
    which is laid up in Jesus for His waiting people. They are indeed loved, and 
    cared for, and enriched. Jehovah-jireh is this sweet mountain of spices, on 
    the many slopes of which they delightedly recline, and find all blessings 
    strewn around them. These pages are written to exhort you to make this spot 
    your daily and your holy pleasure-ground. Intimately acquaint yourself with 
    these green pastures. Be assured, that here sufficiency abounds for you, 
    while time shall be, and when time shall be no more—sufficiency for every 
    need of body and of spirit, which has been, or shall be, or can be. </p>
<p align="justify">I well know that your <i>poverty</i> is deep—your <i>
    perils</i> countless—your <i>strength</i> a quivering reed. But still you 
    are rich, and safe, and strong; for Jesus changes all your broken and your 
    empty cisterns into overflowing fountains of most suitable supply. When you 
    feel that the burden of your sins is intolerable, and pressing you to the 
    lowest depths of the bottomless abyss, come to Jehovah-jireh! Your Jesus 
    provides relief. His arm is the arm of Omnipotence. His shoulders are the 
    shoulders of Deity. With strong hand He places all your guilt on Himself, 
    and bears it away, and it is no more found. When you sigh to be assured that 
    your every debt is paid, your every penalty endured, come to Jehovah-jireh! 
    Jesus is made flesh, and become your nearest kinsman, that in your very 
    nature, and in your stead, He may pay all, and suffer all. When your soul is 
    trembling and fluttering, as the dove among unsparing vultures, or the lamb 
    before devouring wolves, come to Jehovah-jireh! Jesus presents aid in each 
    trial, power for each duty, shelter in each storm. He is the high place, 
    which the shafts of the foe cannot reach—the covert which the storm cannot 
    pierce. His sure voice proclaims, "I the Lord do keep it, I will water it 
    every moment. Lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day." </p>
<p align="justify">As the sun is full of light, and the ocean of drops, so 
    He is the full-stored treasury of needful grace. He is the tree laden with 
    all fruits at all seasons. Whenever we approach, the produce is ripe, and 
    bending low to the hand of faith. In Him are supplies of <i>living</i> grace 
    for a living hour, of <i>working</i> grace for a working hour, of <i>
    striving</i> grace for a striving hour, of <i>praying</i> grace for a 
    praying hour, of <i>suffering</i> grace for a suffering hour, of <i>dying</i> 
    grace for a dying hour—grace for prosperity and for adversity—grace for the 
    family, the closet, the sanctuary, and the public haunts of men—grace for 
    the palace, the hut, the camp, the fleet—for those who rule, and for those 
    who serve—grace for childhood, for manhood, and for age—grace for health, 
    for sickness, and for pain—grace for those who rejoice with the joyous, and 
    for those who mourn with the mourners, and weep at the grave. When the 
    Father gave Jehovah-jireh to the Church, the gift was all things. "He who 
    spared not his own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not 
    with Him also freely give us all things?" </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! let me solemnly ask, have you sought 
    Jehovah-jireh? Is Jesus the king and mainspring of your heart? Then know 
    your rich possession. Rejoice in it. Live on it. Cease to spend money for 
    that which satisfies not. But eat the good which is before you, and let your 
    soul delight itself in fatness. Pine not in your own hut of penury, while 
    His palace of all plenteousness courts your entrance. Lean not on your own 
    crumbling staff, while the Rock of ages is near to uphold you. </p>
<p align="justify">It may be that some poor sinner hears of this 
    all-sufficiency, and wails, Oh that I had interest in these blessed 
    provisions! But alas! I starve, while others feast. Friend, why is it so? 
    Why are you a stranger to this fertile mount? It is not because 
    Jehovah-jireh is far distant. It is not because repelling barriers drive 
    back. Scripture ever points to it, crying, "Yet there is room." No, Jesus 
    draws near to the very door of your heart and knocks. In the lines before 
    you, He beseeches you, Open unto Me, open unto Me. Will you tarry? Will you 
    refuse? What! will you be poor now, and poor forever—miserable now, and 
    miserable forever—while Jehovah-jireh, with inviting fullness, presents to 
    you the overflowings of present grace, and future glory?</p>
