<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">THE SERPENT'S 
    HEAD BRUISED</font></b></font><font size="4"> </font></p>
<p align="justify">"I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between 
    your seed and her seed. He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His 
    heel." Genesis 3:15</p>
<p align="justify">We look around us, and we see the world full of sin. We 
    look within us, and we find hearts full of the same sad plague. It is a 
    terrible fact—and we ask with a sigh,<i> how did evil gain this rule? </i>
    God's word only can give the answer. We there read, that one in the form of 
    a serpent enticed our first parents, and, by prevailing, changed their 
    nature. But who is this serpent? We further learn that it is the devil. He 
    thus disguised himself, that he might deceive. The Bible does not close, 
    until this truth is left beyond a doubt. It is twice written, "that old 
    serpent, who is the Devil and Satan." The moving cause, then, of our being 
    born in sin, and living in sin, stands confessed—it is the Devil. </p>
<p align="justify">He obtained his first power over our race by <i>deceiving</i>. 
    He continues that power by deceiving still. His main art is to keep us blind 
    concerning himself, and concerning the great Deliverer. I am sure of this, 
    because I see many who pass all their days without one real thought, that 
    they have a foe always near, plotting their misery. They hear and perhaps 
    speak of him, as though he were an empty name, and not a mighty and most 
    malignant power. Reader! this may be your case. If so, turn not, I humbly 
    implore you, from a few words, which, by God's grace, may be light to your 
    darkness, and life to your captive soul. </p>
<p align="justify">Consider the <i>nature</i> of Satan. His titles show it. 
    He is the 'prince of this world'. Therefore his sway is world-wide. All the 
    millions of our race, without one exception, were born his slaves. They 
    entered life with his chains around their hands, and with his throne erected 
    in their hearts. Can they gain freedom for themselves? No. His guards are 
    too many and his fetters too strong. Do they desire it? No. The will, by 
    nature, chooses his service. Jesus warns, "You are of your father the Devil, 
    and the lusts of your father you <i>will</i> do." He is the god of this 
    world. He sets up the idol of fame, or pleasure, or money; and men fall down 
    and worship it. He opens his churches, and decks them with attractive show, 
    and serves therein a pleasing cup of error, and multitudes go in to learn 
    his creed. He is leader of countless troops. </p>
<p align="justify">There is not a spot, not a house, in all the world, which 
    he leaves unoccupied. Do we go forth? we are surrounded. Do we seek 
    solitude? we are followed. In the courts of God—in the place of 
    gathering—his vassals swarm around us. We read of a legion in one person. 
    How vast then must be the collected army! Hence there is a sense in which <i>
    omnipresence</i> is his; because there is no place, which some of his 
    emissaries do not fill. So, too, <i>omniscience</i> may be claimed for him; 
    because there is nothing, which some ear does not hear for him. Whatever be 
    our acts, he beholds; whatever be our words, he hears. He is a spirit. 
    Therefore <i>he has access to the secret places of the heart. </i>He can 
    plant the seeds of all evil in the mind. If we close the outward gates of 
    sense, he can still come in, and defile the thoughts, and make every 
    imagination as wicked as himself. He entered into Judas Iscariot. He filled 
    the heart of Ananias. Reader! has he not often made lodgment within you? Oh! 
    think, then, why is not your lodgment among his slain ones!</p>
<p align="justify">He is as <i>crafty</i> as he is strong. <i>His real 
    design is seldom known, until his bait is taken.</i> His web is not seen, 
    until the victim is entangled. The hidden pit is only discovered by the 
    fall. He has been employed in the same work for nearly six thousand years. 
    Therefore he well understands his <i>tools</i>, and the <i>materials</i> on 
    which he works. He is studying our tempers and characters all the day long.<i> 
    We know little of ourselves—he knows us perfectly. </i>He sees the weak 
    point—the fitting time—and accordingly he lays the snare. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Gehazi</p></i> little thought that Naaman's visit would be 
    the tempter's trap. <i>Hezekiah</i> as little thought that the embassy from 
    Babylon would unmask his vain-glory. A question from a servant girl in a 
    moment plunges <i>Peter</i> into cowardly guilt. Reader! ever watch, ever 
    pray, if you would escape temptation. <i>This is a dark picture. </i>Who can 
    view it, and not tremble? But, though fearful, it is only <i>a faint outline 
    of the mighty and cruel enemy of souls. 
</i>
<p align="justify">Give ear now to the tidings which I proceed to proclaim. 
    Though he is <i>strong</i>, there is One far stronger. Though he is <i>great</i>, 
    there is One gloriously greater. Though he is <i>mighty</i>, there is one 
    Almighty. Though he is <i>wily</i>, there is One who is All-wisdom. Though 
    he is <i>many</i>, there is one Infinite. Though he is a <i>captivator</i>, 
    he has been taken captive. Though he is an <i>enslaver</i>, he has become a 
    slave. Though he forges <i>chains</i>, he is enchained. Though he has 
    brought low, he lies low. Though he is a <i>conqueror</i>, he has been 
    conquered. </p>
<p align="justify">The blessed Jesus comes a Conqueror, a Deliverer, a 
    Redeemer, a Savior. He treads down the devil, and gives deliverance, 
    redemption, salvation to all the children of men, who stand under His banner 
    of victory. Reader! perhaps you are one of anxious spirit, and are not 
    ignorant of many tremblings, lest at last you should perish by the hands of 
    this foe. If so, how eagerly you will say, Give me proof that Jesus crushes 
    this tyrant's power. All praise be to the God of grace! proofs abound. 
    Listen to the voice of the Lord God in Eden. "He," the Seed of the Woman, 
    the Lord Jesus, "shall bruise your head." Did not God know what would 
    happen? He did. Can God speak, and His word not come to pass? Impossible! 
    Then this fact is true—the serpent's head must be bruised by Jesus. Take 
    comfort, then; take courage. <i>Man was scarcely ruined, when he who ruined 
    him, was doomed to ruin. </i>The <i>savage joy</i> of having marred 
    creation's beauty was only felt, to be turned into the writhings of hopeless 
    rage. Success was despair. He removed his foot from the neck of fallen man, 
    and fled from the garden with the undying sound echoing in his ears, "He 
    shall bruise your head." Such was the sure sentence of God. </p>
<p align="justify">Now take a case which shows that Satan's power has indeed 
    a power above it. You know the story of <i>Abel</i>. He trod this earth a 
    fallen being, as we are—hated by Satan, as we are—exposed to all his wiles, 
    as we are. But he trusted in the promised seed for escape; Satan could not 
    hold him. His early death, by a murderer's hand, landed him not in the 
    kingdom of hell, but of God. Thus <i>the first soul</i> which left a human 
    body, proved that Jesus could rescue the prey out of the destroyer's jaws.
    </p>
<p align="justify">You know, too, the story of <i>Enoch</i>. He was a man of 
    like nature with us, born in corruption. You cannot doubt that Satan shot 
    his every arrow at him. But his soul received no fatal wound. It was guarded 
    by faith in the coming Savior. By faith in this promise he walked with God. 
    By faith he mounted to heaven—another jewel in the Conqueror's crown. In the 
    same way, <i>all the holy men</i> of the old world found that there was 
    shelter and safety under the wing of the promised Conqueror. One promise 
    convinced them, and gave them life. How many testimonies tell you of this 
    rescue! Oh, let them not teach in vain! </p>
<p align="justify">But, in fullness of time, <i>the Conqueror</i> appears in 
    human form. Satan knows Him well. He heard the voice from heaven, "This is 
    my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." He makes one desperate effort to 
    obtain the mastery. The blessed Jesus meets the conflict. Every advantage of 
    outward circumstance is given to the adversary. He draws from his quiver his 
    often-tried and most successful darts. He musters his strength and all his 
    skill. His empire depends on the outcome. The most that hell can do, is 
    done. But all in vain. Each blow falls harmless before the Word of the Lord. 
    The devil quits the field, baffled and beaten. He finds himself held down by 
    the chain, "He shall bruise your head."</p>
<p align="justify">He makes one effort more. He stirs up wicked men to seize 
    and nail the blessed Jesus to the cross. When the Woman's Seed bows His head 
    and dies; the enemy <i>seems</i> to triumph. But the end of the combat shows 
    where the victory is. If Satan is the stronger, let him keep Jesus in the 
    grave; let the prison detain the prisoner. But it does not—it cannot. Jesus 
    bursts the doors—comes again from the dead—shows Himself alive—and ascends 
    in triumph to the heavens. Thus the victory is forever won. The destroyer 
    lies forever destroyed beneath His feet. </p>
<p align="justify">And when a few more years are past, the Lord Himself 
    shall descend from heaven with power and great glory, and the devil shall be 
    cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, and shall be tormented day and 
    night forever and ever! There is everlasting fire prepared for the devil and 
    his angels. "He shall bruise your head." The point, then, is clear. God is 
    true. Jesus is Conqueror.<i> The Goliath of hell is fallen!</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! this battle has been fought, this victory won, 
    that poor sinners may be rescued. May the Holy Spirit help you to behold 
    your high tower of safety, and to flee into it! Satan cannot but hate 
    you—for his name is hatred, as surely as God is love; and he desires to have 
    you, that he may sift you as wheat. But if you are found in Jesus, you are 
    high above his reach. He will attack. He will threaten. He will affright. 
    But Jesus will be your shield; and that shield must be shattered before you 
    can be harmed. Study the records of the Word. It is the history of the long 
    war between the children of light and "the power of darkness." You will see 
    that he has tried every weapon in the armory of hell. He has no other in 
    reserve. But all have failed. They cannot rise higher than <i>the heel.</i> 
    The head is safe with Christ in God. </p>
<p align="justify">Mark, too, how a mightier hand guides his blows to wound 
    himself. Satan's kingdom is made to totter under Satan's assaults. He 
    brought in <i>sin</i>—and so the door flew open for the <i>Gospel</i>. He 
    persecutes the early converts—and the truth spreads rapidly abroad 
    throughout the world. He casts Paul into the dungeon of Philippi—and the 
    jailor believes with all his house. He sends him a prisoner to Rome—and 
    epistles gain wings to teach and comfort all the ages of the Church. </p>
<p align="justify">Fear not, then, believer, the curse is on your foe. <i>
    Dust is his food. He cannot swallow the jewels of Christ's crown.</i> He may 
    entice you with many things sweet to sense; but look to the Cross, and you 
    see them no more. He may terrify you with roarings, as of a lion; show him
    <i>the wounds of the Lamb, and he is gone.</i> He may stand as your accuser 
    at the judgment seat; but if you are washed in the blood of Jesus, he can 
    find no mark in you, by which to claim you as his own. Be assured, if you 
    are one with Jesus by faith, His full triumph is yours, "and the God of 
    peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly." </p>
<p align="justify">If such be your happy case, lift up your head with joy 
    and sing the holy song, "Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in power. Your 
    right hand, O Lord, dashes the enemy to pieces. In the greatness of your 
    majesty, you overthrew those who rose against you. Your anger flashed forth; 
    it consumed them as fire burns straw." Exodus 15:6-7</p>
