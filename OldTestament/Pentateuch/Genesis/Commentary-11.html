<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE SWEET SAVOR</b></font>
</p>
<p align="justify">"The Lord smelled a sweet savor." Genesis 8:21</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! do not you desire that your soul may prosper at 
    the throne of grace? Perhaps you reply, "Such blessedness is beyond all 
    price. But how can one so low as a creature—so vile as a sinner, gain happy 
    acceptance?" Blessed be God! there is a ready door. Draw near, leaning by 
    faith on the arm of Jesus—robed by faith in His righteousness—pleading by 
    faith the costly merits of His blood, and you enter encircled with songs of 
    welcome! All heaven rejoices over you with joy unutterable. </p>
<p align="justify">Our Bible seems written with the grand intent thus to 
    guide, by an ever-living way, to the rest of God. Therefore it is, that in 
    its pages we see the golden portals flying open, when touched by hands like 
    ours. <i>Abel</i> comes with the appointed Lamb—no frown repels him. "God 
    accepted Abel, and his offering." <i>Noah</i> comes with the same key—no 
    bolts obstruct him. His service is grateful incense. "The Lord smelled a 
    sweet savor." So it ever has been. So it ever must be. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">There is a virtue in the death of Jesus, so precious, so 
    mighty, that it has resistless power with God.</p></i> Whenever the poor sinner 
    presents it, there is new chorus to the hymns on high; "again they say 
    Hallelujah." How important is it, that this truth should be as a sun without 
    a speck before us! Hence the Spirit records, that when Noah shed the blood 
    which represented Christ, "The Lord smelled a sweet savor." Thus the 
    curtains of God's pavilion are thrown back; and each attribute appears 
    rejoicing in redemption. The Lamb is offered, and there is fragrance 
    throughout heaven. O my soul, these are blessed tidings. They show the 
    irresistible plea, by which we may obtain pardon, and every needful grace.
    
<p align="justify">This lesson might indeed have been spread over a wide 
    expanse of reasoning and of proof; and still the outline might have been 
    scarcely touched. But the Spirit simply states, "The Lord smelled a sweet 
    savor." We catch one glance, and all is seen. The cross is raised, and 
    clouds of prevailing odor pierce the skies. </p>
<p align="justify">This image is a bright jewel in the Bible-treasury, 
    because it speaks the language of every class, in every age, in every 
    climate. It was light to pious pilgrims in patriarchal times. After the 
    lapse of centuries, it is equally light to us. It revived our elder 
    brethren. It will revive the last saint. It stoops to the lowliness of the 
    most lowly hut. It soars above the loftiness of the most lofty intellect. 
    "The Lord smelled a sweet savor." All read and understand alike, that 
    Jehovah reposes in Jesus, and is satisfied to the extent of Deity. Just as 
    one orb contains all light, so this brief word is the whole Gospel of 
    reconciliation. The children of Israel were taught in the twilight-rites the 
    fullness of the work of Christ. The flowing blood preached all forgiveness. 
    But to assure their hearts, over each victim this olive-branch was 
    waved—"The priest shall burn all on the altar to be a burnt-sacrifice, an 
    offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">So, too, when the Apostle Paul uplifts the cross, he 
    proves its power by the same emblem. "Christ also has loved us, and has 
    given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet 
    smelling savor." This is the magnifying medium, through which we see, that
    <i>the dying of Jesus is the garden of God's sweetest perfumes. </i>His one 
    sacrifice is eternal and unbounded fragrance. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us now draw nearer, and learn how the whole Godhead 
    here expands itself in limitless delights. When we contemplate God in His 
    majesty, we see upon His head the many crowns of every pure and holy 
    excellence. They all shine in one grand harmony of infinite, unchangeable 
    glory. They cannot be parted. They cannot exist asunder. They are united by 
    bands, which God alone could frame, but which God can never disunite. The 
    question instantly arises, How can they all concur in raising a sinner to 
    share the Eternal's throne? </p>
<p align="justify">First, let JUSTICE speak. Its claim strikes terror. It 
    has a right to one unbroken series of uninterrupted obedience through all 
    life's term. Each straying of a <i>thought</i> from perfect love incurs a 
    countless debt. It has in its hand an immeasurable roll, written within and 
    without against us. If it be willing to relax, it would merely overlook 
    evil, and God would cease to be God. Therefore it sternly cries, <i>pay me 
    what you owe!</i> But how shall he pay, who has nothing of his own but 
    sin?—Behold the Cross. Here Jesus pays a death, the worth of which no tongue 
    can reckon. Justice holds scales, which groan indeed under mountains upon 
    mountains of iniquity—but this one sacrifice more than outweighs the pile. 
    Thus justice rejoices, because it is infinitely honored. For if all the 
    family of man had been cast into the prison-house of torment—if they had 
    writhed forever, paying the penalty of hell-pains—the whole could never have 
    been cancelled. Eternity could not have seen the end. But Jesus dies, and 
    justice at once is crowned with everlasting satisfaction.</p>
<p align="justify">A case from common life, though far short of the entire 
    truth, may help to clear it to our view. A debtor's debt amounts to 
    thousands. His means can render a penny on each day. The creditor arrests 
    him and takes the daily mite. Years pass, but the mass scarcely lessens. The 
    removal of a daily grain will not wear out the ocean's sands. But let a rich 
    man come, and in one sum discharge the whole. The claim ceases. The prisoner 
    goes free. The creditor exults in a payment, which is unlooked-for gain. 
    Thus at the cross, justice receives a cup of atonement, so full, that it can 
    hold no more. It revels in the sweetness of the savor. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Ponder the wonders which are here achieved. </p></i>Justice 
    not only drops its avenging sword, but it becomes arrayed in smiles of 
    approving love. It is no more an <i>adversary</i>, demanding condemnation. 
    It stands, as an <i>advocate</i>, insisting on acquittal. The principle, 
    which rigidly requires death for each sin, as rigidly refuses to take the 
    payment twice. Cling then to the cross. There justice, by a mighty plea, 
    establishes your right to heaven. 
<p align="justify">Next, there is a sweet savor here to the TRUTH of God. If 
    justice is unyielding, so too, is Truth. Its yes is yes; is no is no. It 
    speaks, and the word must be. Heaven and earth may pass away, but it cannot 
    recede. Now its voice is gone forth, denouncing eternal wrath on every sin. 
    Thus it bars heaven's gates with adamantine bars. In vain are tears, and 
    penitence, and prayers. Truth becomes untrue, if sin escapes. But Jesus 
    comes to drink the cup of vengeance. Every threat falls on His Head. Truth 
    needs no more. It claps the wings of rapturous delight, and speeds to heaven 
    to tell that not one word has failed. </p>
<p align="justify">Take another faint image. A king issues a decree. His 
    oath is pledged that death shall follow disobedience. A subject rebels. He 
    is convicted. Execution is required. If the king hesitate, where is his 
    truth and faithfulness, and where is the majesty of his empire? But let the 
    king's son, in the offender's stead, endure the penalty. Then the law is 
    magnified, the statute is inviolate, the sacredness of order rejoices, while 
    the guilty lives. Thus, when Jesus suffers, Truth gains honor for its every 
    saying, and smells a sweet savor of content. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, rejoice in the cross. Here only, the Word, 
    which had forged such mighty chains, finds that it can live in your life. It 
    demands salvation for you; for it has nothing against you, but all for you 
    in the unalterable promise, "Whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but 
    have everlasting life." </p>
<p align="justify">Need I add, that Jesus is a sweet savor to the HOLINESS 
    of God. This perfection is the sensitive plant of heaven. It recoils from 
    the approach of sin. It cannot look upon uncleanness. It has no eye, but for 
    unsullied righteousness. It only breathes where all is pure. Now, at the 
    cross a marvel is effected, which is joy to every fiber of its heart—a 
    stream thence flows, which washes out the crimson-dye, until it can be no 
    more found. Nor is this all.<i> The sinner looks to the cross, and, as he 
    gazes, the love of evil withers, and the love of God buds forth. </i>Thus 
    the cross presents to Holiness "a glorious Church, not having spot, or 
    wrinkle, or any such thing." </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! would you obtain a title and fitness for heaven? 
    Live at the cross. It gives a <i>fitness</i> to inherit. It gives an <i>
    aptness</i> to enjoy. Ministers of Christ, would you weaken the sway of 
    Satan? Preach the cross. They only die to the rule of sin, who die in Jesus 
    to its penalties. <i>There is no sanctifying principle but faith in Christ!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Sweet too is the savor which MERCY here inhales. Mercy 
    weeps over misery. In all afflictions it is afflicted. It tastes the 
    bitterest drop in each cup of woe. But when anguish is averted, the guilty 
    spared, the perishing rescued, and all tears wiped from the eyes of the 
    redeemed, then is its holiest triumph! Loud is its rapture, when it sees a 
    countless multitude snatched from the bitterest agonies, and borne to 
    celestial bliss! Overflowing is its delight, when it hears voices, like 
    ocean's waters, hymning the victories of the Lamb! Infinite is its joy, when 
    it realizes that this adoration will swell louder in melody through endless 
    ages! But it is only at the cross that Mercy raises this exulting head. I am 
    painfully aware that many of the sons of sin have some vague thought of 
    finding mercy without finding Christ. Oh! that they might learn, before it 
    is too late, that <i>God's saving mercy is only found at Calvary! </i></p>

<p align="justify">Reader! I trust, that you now distinctly see, how every 
    attribute sings, and rejoices, and gives thanks, and glories in the 
    all-satisfying Jesus. His incense ascends, and heaven luxuriates in the 
    savor. Hence the Father brings in the Son with the happy voice, "Behold my 
    elect, in whom my soul delights;" and again, "This is my beloved Son, in 
    whom I am well pleased." </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! is the like mind in you? Is the joy of heaven 
    your joy? Is its refreshment the refreshment of your heart? Is its perfume 
    the perfume of your spirit? Does your every faculty expand and rejoice in 
    Jesus? Is He your Paradise of every spice and every flower? Is He your 
    Garden of Eden, in which each moment is a moment of blossoming, and each 
    blossom opens in increasing fragrance? </p>
<p align="justify">Believe me, every sweet savor is in Him. Believe me, 
    there is no sweet savor elsewhere. The world is a foul desert. The vapor of 
    its weeds is corruption and rottenness. Turn from its thorns and briers. 
    Come and walk up and down in the verdant places of the Gospel. Partake of 
    the deliciousness which here abounds. The ransomed all sing in the ways of 
    the Lord; "His name is as ointment poured forth." "He is the Rose of 
    Sharon." "A bundle of myrrh is my Beloved unto me." "He is as a cluster of 
    henna blossoms." "All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia." 
    He is the sweet savor, which can never fail. </p>
<p align="justify">Can any hear this and turn to Christless habits? Ah! 
    child of sin, pause, I beseech you. Apart from Christ, your person is 
    accursed—Your merit is a filthy rag—Your prayer is an abomination—Your 
    praise is an insult—Your service is a mockery—Your walk is a daily step from 
    God—Your death is a downfall into hell. Tell me, is it not far better to be 
    unto God a sweet savor of Christ? Think! a life redolent of Christ will be 
    an eternity of fragrance through the realms of light. But a life which is 
    the scent of earth's corruptions, becomes at last a loathsome fume in the 
    charnel-house of darkness.</p>
