        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed
          and her seed. He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His
          heel." Genesis 3:15
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These are <i>the first words of grace to a lost world.</i>

          When were they spoken? By whom? To whom?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          <b> When</b><i> were these words spoken? </i>Just after sin had come
          in, and innocence was gone, and man had become a guilty creature
          before God. One command had been given, for the purpose of seeing
          whether he would love, and fear, and serve his Maker. That one command
          had just been trodden under foot. Pause here for one moment and think.
          Some people dream of earning eternal life by doing God's will. This
          way has been tried. It failed. The end of it was ruin. Our first
          parents were <i>innocent</i>, and had no inward tendency towards evil,
          but they rushed into it. But we are <i> born with corrupt hearts</i>,
          and fully bent on sin, and can we keep ourselves holy and spotless? It
          is a vain thought. Let us cast it away. We cannot continue blameless.
          Our wicked nature is always drawing us out of the straight path of
          godliness. We have not stood blameless during one hour of one day of
          our lives. The charge is true, and every honest conscience will
          confess it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          <b> By whom</b><i> were these words spoken? </i>We read, "<i
            >The Lord God</i
          >
          said." What proof is here, that our God is merciful and gracious!
          Think how He had been offended! Think, with what base ingratitude—with
          what contempt He had been treated! <i>Satan's lie</i> had been trusted
          rather than <i>His truth</i>. His easy yoke had been broken, as if it
          had been some hard restraint. The language of the proud heart had
          been—We will not have God to reign over us!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God, even He, descends. No thunder-bolt is in His hands. No avenging
          angels follow to sweep the rebels into perdition. The voice which
          speaks is the voice of mercy. The tidings which are brought, are the
          tidings of deliverance. O my soul, can you consider the Speaker, and
          not exclaim—Truly, God is good—He wills not the death of a sinner!
          Reason as the wife of Manoah did, "If the Lord were pleased to kill
          us, He would not, as at this time, have told us such things as these."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          <b> To whom</b> <i>were these words spoken? </i>Three only were
          present. First the guilty pair. Mark their state, and learn from it
          that <i>the first step in the way of salvation is taken by God. </i>We
          have sure evidence before us. He wills to save, when man wills to die.
          He moves to save, when man moves to perish. Our first parents are
          before Him, a picture of all fallen sinners who would be born of them.
          As they were, so are we by nature. They were sinners,
          <i>blind and hardened</i>. So are we. Blind, I say; for
          <i>their eyes were not opened to the dreadful condition</i>

          into which they had passed,<i> or the dreadful misery</i>, which was
          now their lot. Hardened, I say—for they did not confess their sin, or
          humble themselves, or weep tears of sorrow, or utter prayers for
          mercy. Just such is man's natural blindness and hardness from that day
          to this. And still to such God comes in love—to such God speaks of
          recovery to His favor and His kingdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Reader! calmly meditate on this. You will see, that when man is all
          careless, God is all care; when man can do nothing, God does all; when
          man deserves nothing, God gives all.
          <i>Salvation is from first to last of<b> grace! </b></i>Man rushes to
          hell. Grace calls to heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Next, another being was present. But there was no hope for him. He was
          only told that destruction was his doom. We have here a proof that
          <i>God makes a difference between offenders.</i> Let us not vainly
          ask, why mercy yearns over <i>man</i>, and turns from the
          <i>angels</i>

          which fell? There can be but one reply, "Even so, Father, for so it
          seemed good in Your sight." And can we so reply, and not sing praise,
          that we, who have so <i>sinned</i>, should be so <i>pitied</i>, and
          have such rich provision of <i>pardon?</i> O my soul, think on these
          things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But <i>what is this rich provision? </i>We read the answer in the
          word, "her seed." Here is a promise, that <i>a deliverer</i>

          would come into this world, who would be born of a woman. If the
          question be put, "Who is this seed of the woman?" We readily reply—The
          Lord Jesus Christ. The blessed Savior. The only Redeemer. The only
          begotten Son of God Most High. True, the voice of God here promises
          that Jesus, appointed to save—should be made man—should be one of our
          family by birth—should be bone of our bones, flesh of our flesh. The
          fact is easily stated. But, Reader! is it your habit to ponder over
          the great and precious truths belonging to it?

          <i
            >Mark! The mighty God, without ceasing to be God, becomes man to
            redeem us!</i
          >
          <i>Wonder of wonders! </i>The like to this never has been—never could
          be.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let the <i>greatest king</i> become the lowest beggar—let the
          <i>richest prince</i> leave his palace for the vilest cell of a
          loathsome prison—it is as nothing compared to the act of Jesus, when
          <i>He left heaven to put on the rags of our mortality! </i>The Creator
          of all things appears a creature! The Almighty is a weak babe!—The
          Eternal is a child of time!—The Infinite is contracted into the limits
          of this poor flesh! Is not this the wonder of wonders? Is not this
          grace which has no bounds?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Reader! do you seriously believe that Jesus thus humbled Himself even
          for you? If you do, you cannot but feel that no debt can be like your
          debt; and that, as heaven is high above the earth, so great is what
          you owe, beyond what you can ever pay. In the poor matters of this
          earth, a prince's or a noble's birth awakens signs of far-extending
          joy. The banners wave. The steeples sound. The festive table is
          spread.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Shall we then call upon the realm of <i>nature</i> to celebrate with
          worthy praise this praise-surpassing fact? What if the <i>sun</i>

          could hang forth millions of lamps, each brighter in brilliance than
          itself; what if each drop of <i>ocean's</i> water could raise a chorus
          of ecstatic hallelujahs; what if each leaf of every
          <i>forest</i> could cast back the pealing shout; it would be shame to
          offer<i> a tribute so unfit!</i> But there is a testimony of delight
          which Jesus seeks. He is repaid, when grateful hearts throw wide their
          portals to receive Him, and when welcoming praise extols His saving
          name. O my soul, will you not then bid all that is within you, to
          clasp the hands of loving worship around the manger at Bethlehem?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When <i>Abraham</i> saw the day of Christ afar off, he rejoiced and
          was glad. The <i>unborn Baptist</i> could not restrain emotion, when
          the unborn Jesus was brought near. The beacon-star filled the
          journeying <i>sages</i> with exceeding great joy. The multitude of the
          <i> heavenly host</i>, who shared not in redemption's mercies, made
          heaven's vault to echo with their praises. O my soul, can
          <i>you</i> be silent? Hear you not the angel's cry? "I bring you good
          tidings of great joy." Will you not with great joy drink in these
          tidings? "Unto you is born a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." Will
          you not, in aged <i>Simeon's</i> spirit, clasp Him to the heart of
          faith, and lift up the hymn of praise?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Next, have you, too, seriously pondered,
          <i>for what exact purpose did Jesus become the Woman's Seed?</i>—Our
          peace and happiness depend on the right knowledge of this. It was just
          for this purpose, that He might be qualified to stand in the poor
          sinner's stead; and might be in a condition to represent him. You know
          that the Word of God has spoken, and cannot be called back, "The soul
          that sins, it shall die." You know, too, that to die, in this
          sentence,
          <i>means to suffer forever the torments of the lost. </i>Under this
          condemnation you and I are brought by sin. You and I, then, must thus
          endure, unless God be pleased to take the death of a sinless one in
          the place of our death. Jesus is willing to bear all for us; how could
          He do so, without being man? He could not. Therefore, He is made man.
          So when God's Truth and Justice say—I must have that man's life; Jesus
          is ready to reply—I am of his nature, here is my life for his. Mark,
          then, He is the Woman's Seed, that He may have a life to lay down, and
          have blood to shed, for the <i>ransom</i> of such as we are. See
          clearly, that Jesus takes man's flesh, that He may redeem from death
          all of man's family who trust in Him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus, also, in man's nature,
          <i>He obeys all the commandments of God.</i> But the righteousness
          thus worked out is not for Himself. It is wrought, that He may impute
          it to all who come to Him. This He never fails to do. So when the
          poorest believer presents himself for admission into heaven, he can
          show, for his passport, a perfect righteousness placed over him by
          Jesus. It is so all-sufficient, that, when weighed in the balances of
          God, it lacks nothing. I repeat these truths, because they are the
          groundwork of true faith. Jesus was the Woman's Seed, that, being
          exactly as we are, yet without sin, His <i>death</i> might be a
          substitute for our death—His <i>righteousness</i> might be a
          substitute for our righteousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Reader! are you a poor sinner, feeling your misery and dreading
          eternal wrath? Flee to the Woman's Seed! There is pardon in Him to
          wash away all iniquities. The faithful of the old world knew Him by no
          other name, but they believed God, that, in due time, He would come,
          and thus satisfy God's justice for them. They looked to Him who would
          be born. They looked, and none can look in vain. Do you seek after a
          righteousness to make you fit to appear in heaven? It is all ready in
          the Woman's Seed. Stretch out the hand of faith, take it, and it is
          yours forever. Whatever you need dwells richly in Jesus, the Woman's
          Seed. Cast on Him your vileness, and take His purity; cast on Him your
          poverty, and take His riches; cast on Him your nothingness, and take
          His fullness; cast on Him your curse, and receive His blessing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Do you hesitate—do you stagger—fearful to approach one so excellent in
          holiness? Well might you tremble, if bade to draw near to God in His
          glory. But He who calls you, is your Kinsman—the Woman's Seed. You may
          fly up to Him on the wings of faith, and embrace Him with the arms of
          faith, and cling to Him with the hands of faith, and lay your weary
          head upon His breast, and tell Him all your sorrows; and you will find
          that His heart is a brother's heart, as tender to sympathize, as His
          power is all-sufficient to save.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Do you still stand doubting? What, when Jesus has come so far for you,
          will you not stir one step towards Him? When He has stooped so low,
          will you not ascend to Him? When He brings Himself, in man's form, to
          your very door, will you not open and welcome Him? Surely there is
          enough in the Woman's Seed to slay all unbelief; enough to win and
          conquer every heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here we see heaven coming down to earth, that earth may be raised to
          heaven. Here we see the Son of God becoming man, that men may become
          the children of God. Will not this satisfy—persuade—allure?
          <i>Surely God could do no more!</i> Man, then, can say no more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I close with this earnest entreaty; read these few words again and
          again, until you find the flame of faith and love kindling in your
          soul; and then, on the bended knees of gratitude, exclaim—I bless You,
          Heavenly <i>Father</i>, for the promise in Eden of the Woman's Seed. I
          bless You, for sending, in the fullness of time, the Woman's Seed. I
          bless You, O

          <i>Lord Jesus Christ</i>, for coming to save me, as the Woman's Seed.
          I bless You, <i>Holy Spirit</i>, for revealing to my soul the Woman's
          Seed.
