<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">THE HEAVENLY 
    BRIDEGROOM</font></b></font><font size="4"> </font></p>
<p align="justify">"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh." 
    Genesis 2:23</p>
<p align="justify">Our Bible is a very Paradise of each sweet flower and 
    each regaling fruit. But the believer sits down most gladly in those choice 
    spots, which are thickly set with tokens of the Savior's tenderness. Surely 
    happiness mounts up to heaven, when on Scripture's ground, and under the 
    Spirit's light, the soul discerns that Jesus loves with an everlasting love. 
    Reader! this humble tract will visit you in a favored hour, if it should 
    lead you to drink deeply of such joy. </p>
<p align="justify">We cannot move far amid the pages of the Word, without 
    hearing the silver voice—Give ear unto Me, that I may tell you of My love. 
    For this purpose each tender image speaks by turn. Does a <i>father</i> love 
    with strength of manly love? Jesus is the Everlasting Father. Is a <i>mother</i> 
    gentle in her soft caressings? Jesus is more constant—"they may forget, yet 
    will I not forget you." Is a <i>brother</i> generous in his affections? 
    Jesus is the firstborn among many brethren. Is the <i>sisterly</i> <i>union</i> 
    as the intertwining of hearts' fibers? The Church is "His sister, His 
    spouse." Is a <i>friend</i> noble in his sympathies? We read, "Henceforth I 
    call you not servants, but I have called you friends." </p>
<p align="justify">Will not these parallels suffice? No! not if another can 
    be added. As all colors combine to form pure light—so <i>all tints must join 
    to form the full portrait of a loving Savior. </i>There remains the 
    full-blown endearment, when heart flows into heart in <i>bridal</i>-union—and 
    will Jesus claim His people as His bride? It is so! This is the emblem, 
    which is the Spirit's choice delight. It meets us in the garden of Eden. It 
    walks by our side throughout the green pastures of the word. It only leaves 
    us, when Revelation writes no more. "The Spirit and the Bride say Come." 
    Echo replies to echo, "As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall 
    your God rejoice over you." "I will betroth you unto Me forever; yes, I will 
    betroth you unto Me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in 
    loving-kindness, and in mercies." </p>
<p align="justify">Following such holy guidance, let us now seek Jesus in 
    that pure feeling, which innocently played in Adam's heart, before sin 
    entered with unhallowing touch. The narrative is simple. "So the Lord God 
    caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep. He took one of Adam's ribs and closed 
    up the place from which He had taken it. Then the Lord God made a woman from 
    the rib and brought her to Adam." But the mystery is deep. A greater than 
    Adam and the first spouse are in this history of sinless union. Faith has 
    been taught, and quickly learns, that <i>the spiritual Bridegroom and the 
    mystic bride are here! </i>Earth's first espousals are but the shadow of 
    heaven's far earlier love. </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>second Adam</i> sleeps a sleep—even the sleep of 
    death; but not in Eden's innocent delights, but on <i>the hard altar of His 
    ignominious cross.</i> His side is pierced. There flow thence the means to 
    constitute the Church. There is blood to expiate every sin—and water to wash 
    from every stain. The Father presents the bride to Adam. The same Father 
    gives the favored bride to Christ. Adam receives her as portion of himself. 
    Christ's word takes up the same welcome. They "are members of His body, of 
    His flesh, and of His bones." </p>
<p align="justify">We are thus emboldened to draw with reverential pen some 
    lines of likeness. Marriage can only be in kindred race. Here the bride is 
    low in lowly origin. Her coarse material is clay. But Jesus dwells in 
    heaven's bright palace, bright in all the brightness, glorious in all the 
    glories of His own Deity. How can union be? He leaves His home. He veils His 
    Almighty might. He seeks our cell. He scorns not our loathsome rags. He is 
    born a child of man in Bethlehem. He lives the Son of Man in human nature.</p>
<p align="justify">O my soul! did your Lord thus stoop to make you His 
    forever? He did. Infinite was the distance—but He came with lightning-speed 
    on wings of love—and rested not, until He rested in your far-off abode. The 
    bridegroom counts all efforts light to win the bride's regard.<i> Can it be, 
    that Jesus strives to gain unlovely souls?</i> It is so! He lives, when we 
    love. He scarcely seems to reign, until the heart presents her throne. Hence 
    in the Scriptures He sends letter upon letter, each burning with the pure 
    flame of tenderness. Hence He follows with the fond call—Turn! turn! Look 
    unto me. Come unto Me. Return unto Me. Follow Me. Abide in Me. Hence He 
    sends His faithful ministers—the friends of the Bridegroom—to plead His 
    cause—to appeal in His behalf—to beseech in His name—to set forth His 
    matchless charms—to show that His love is strong as death, and pure as the 
    light, and boundless as eternity. That ministry is most true to Christ—most 
    rich in everlasting fruits, which paints most vividly the mind of Christ.
    </p>
<p align="justify">But more than this. The <i>Holy Spirit</i> comes 
    commissioned by the Father and the Son. He reveals the Lord in all the 
    beauties of His person—all the wonders of His grace—all the glories of His 
    work. He subdues all prejudice—turns the stream of opposing will—and kindles 
    a blazing torch in the dark corners of the soul. Thus union is achieved. The 
    faithful soul forgets her own people and her father's house. She casts out 
    the former rivals, which bewitched her thoughts. She comes out and is 
    separate from a once-fondled world. She leaves all, and cleaves to Christ.
    </p>
<p align="justify">In nuptial bonds the bride rejects the distinction of her 
    former name. A new address attests that she is no more her own. It is just 
    so in spiritual union. What! though the nature of Jesus proclaims essential 
    Deity—that very nature is the Church's diadem. We are first told, that "The 
    Lord our Righteousness" is His name. The same is her portion, for it is 
    added, "The Lord our Righteousness" is her name too. </p>
<p align="justify">The bridegroom courts the <b>closest communion</b>. It is 
    even so with Jesus. By His Word, and through His messengers, He allures His 
    people to His side. He opens to them the purposes of His grace—the secrets 
    of His kingdom. He encourages them to tell out their every need, and fear, 
    and desire, and hope. He tenderly invites, "Let me see your countenance, let 
    me hear your voice, for sweet is your voice, and your countenance is 
    lovely." </p>
<p align="justify">Who can portray <i>a bridegroom's sympathy?</i> It is, 
    however, but a drop compared to the full ocean of a Savior's care. "We have 
    not a High Priest, who cannot be touched with the feeling of our 
    infirmities." "He who touches you, touches the very apple of His eye." "In 
    all our affliction He is afflicted." No suffering member can be pained on 
    earth, but the participating Head cries out in heaven, "Why are you 
    persecuting Me?" Reader! you have often heard these truths. Do they touch a 
    responsive chord within? If not, yours is not the bride-like spirit. </p>
<p align="justify">The bridegroom brings his <b>dowry</b>. And does not 
    Christ enrich with gifts? Angels may marvel, dazzled by the Church's wealth. 
    He holds back nothing from her. All His attributes are her grand 
    inheritance. His <i>wisdom</i> is hers to guide. His <i>power</i> is hers to 
    uphold. His <i>love</i> is as the sun to cheer. His <i>faithfulness</i> and
    <i>truth</i> are her shield and support. His <i>Spirit</i> is poured down in 
    unfailing measure to teach, to solace, and to bless her. His <i>
    righteousness</i> is hers, to be her spotless robe. His <i>heavens</i> are 
    hers, to be her home. His <i>throne</i> is hers, to be her seat. His <i>
    glory</i> is hers, to be her crown. His <i>eternity</i> is hers, that she 
    may joy forever. Happy the soul, which responds—All this I steadfastly 
    believe! </p>
<p align="justify">The bridegroom shrinks from no labors, which bring 
    support and plenty to his beloved. Thus Jesus lives a life of watchful work. 
    He rests not night and day. His outstretched hands are ever pleading, and 
    ever pouring down supplies of grace. He purchased all Heaven's blessing, 
    that His people may never lack. And as each need arises, He is all vigilance 
    to see—all bounty to bestow. Earthly union often knows the pang of 
    separation. <i>Duty's</i> stern voice may say—Depart. <i>Necessity</i> may 
    force to lonely distance.<i> But nothing in heaven, or earth, or hell, 
    unlocks the arms which cling around a divine Bridegroom! </i>At each moment 
    He is nearer than the shadow to the side. Life is but leaning on His arm. 
    Death is but sleeping on His breast. There is a never-failing bond in the 
    sure world, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." </p>
<p align="justify">In this cold world, affections cool. The day, which dawns 
    in love, may close in hate. Tastes vary and cause variance. Discordant 
    tempers make discordance. Far otherwise is the heavenly wedlock. It is ever 
    true, "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit." </p>
<p align="justify">When Jesus <i>calls</i> in love, He <i>changes</i> by His 
    spirit. He imparts a new nature, whose every pulse is unison with Himself. 
    It is heaven's own harmony, when Christ is all. Here a house is often tears, 
    because of godless offspring. Many a one has sighed, "O Absalom, my son, my 
    son!" But from <i>heavenly union</i> nothing springs but <i>heavenly seed.</i> 
    Believers are <i>married</i> to Christ, that they should bring forth <i>
    fruit</i> unto God. Apart from Him, the heart is the hotbed of evil. United 
    to Him, it is the holy parent of each holy grace. </p>
<p align="justify">But at present the Church sees her Bridegroom <i>only by 
    the eye of faith.</i> The veil of flesh impedes the meridian gaze. But yet a 
    little while and the day of visible espousals will arrive. A startled 
    universe will hear the shout, "Behold the Bridegroom comes." There will 
    resound, "as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of 
    many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Hallelujah, for 
    the Lord God omnipotent reigns. Let us be glad, and rejoice, and give honor 
    to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself 
    ready." Then shall He shine forth, "to be admired in His saints, and to be 
    glorified in all those who believe." The bride "shall be brought unto the 
    king in clothing of needlework; with gladness and rejoicing shall they be 
    brought, they shall enter into the king's palace." The nuptial song shall be 
    one ceaseless Hallelujah. Happy soul, which responds—All this I confidently 
    expect! </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! is it your happy privilege to know that a union, 
    which thus lives forever, cements your heart to Christ, and Christ to you? 
    Remember, then, that this blessed relationship demands your faithfulness. 
    The Lord is jealous of His people's love. You must not stray from Him for 
    one single moment, or in one single thought. The caution is needful; for 
    days are come, in which <i>strangers</i> are gone forth, professing to be 
    the Bridegroom's friends. They even stand in pulpits, and give instruction 
    in His name. By this sign you may know them. They exalt the bride rather 
    than her Lord. They magnify His ordinances rather than Himself. They beguile 
    her to admire herself, to lean on herself, to trust in herself, and to 
    decorate herself in the mock robes of false humility and superstition. Take 
    heed; the ground is slippery. It may seem pleasant to self-loving nature; 
    but it slopes towards Antichrist!</p>
<p align="justify">It may be that some worldling reads this whose life is 
    wedded to another lord. Would that such may turn and burst their fearful 
    bonds! There is indeed the prince of this world. His promises are lies. His 
    dowry is anguish. His embrace is death. His chamber is darkness. His bed is 
    flames of fire. His marriage-wail is agony's wild shriek. Worldling, can you 
    love this spouse?</p>
