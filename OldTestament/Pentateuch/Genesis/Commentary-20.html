<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">PENIEL</font></b></font><font size="4">
</font></p>
<p align="justify">Jacob named the place <b>Peniel</b>—"face of God"—for he 
    said, "I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared." Genesis 
    32:30</p>
<p align="justify">The happiest heart in the world is that in which faith 
    and prayer have undisturbed rule. The truth of this statement follows from 
    the fact, that <i>faith has the key of heaven; </i>and<i> prayer has the ear 
    of God.</i> And who is happy as the man who is always free to enter within 
    the veil, and hold communion there? </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! you would sincerely be happy among the happiest. 
    Beseech the Spirit, then, to fan these graces into brightest flame. With 
    this desire let us hasten to Peniel, the scene of their liveliest exercise: 
    and may we tarry there, until the holy fire kindle! </p>
<p align="justify">Jacob's hard servitude is ended. Home, with its fond 
    endearments, is again before him. But, when he reaches the borders of his 
    native land, he finds it garrisoned with perils. Esau, terrible in fury, 
    mighty in force, is armed to intercept, and to destroy. The wanderer, who 
    fled from death, returns to die. But many terrors quench not faith. Jacob, 
    urged by its impulse, flies directly to the mercy-seat. <i>He humbles 
    himself, as unworthy of grace's least crumb. </i>Thus faith strips itself of 
    all, that all the glory may be God's. He pleads that he is in obedience's 
    path. Faith has no other ground on which to stand. He meekly claims the 
    promises; for gracious promises are the title-deeds of hope. But <i>faith</i>, 
    busy in heaven, is not idle upon earth. In thoughtfulness and diligence it 
    sows the seed, from which successes spring. With upward eye it labors and 
    prevails; while <i>unbelief</i> looks inward—downward—and so fails. The 
    plans of Jacob are all wisely formed. Then darkness mantles the earth. But 
    it brings no pillow for his head. He stands, and stands alone, on Jabbok's 
    banks. We here see again, how grace gains oil for his lamp.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! be sure of this, he is not a thriving and a 
    well-stored saint, who is not much in solitary communion with God. No public 
    ordinances, no social worship, no Christian fellowship, no mutual 
    interchange of godly thought, can be a substitute for calm approach to God. 
    It is when all other things are banished, that the smiles of Jesus are most 
    sweet, His voice most clear, His comforts most supporting. Then it is, that 
    the Word reveals its treasures, and the promises teem with life. Many mourn 
    lifelessness of spirit, and fruitlessness in work. The withering cause may 
    be, that busy haunts are too busily frequented, and the quiet chamber is too 
    rarely sought. </p>
<p align="justify">But is the lonely Jacob long alone? Oh no. A <i>stranger</i> 
    suddenly draws near, and grapples with him, and strives with mighty energy 
    to stop his progress, and to lay him in the dust. But who thus wrestles in 
    the solemn stillness of this solemn night? The form is human, but the person 
    is Divine. We read, "As a prince you have power with God;" therefore the 
    wrestler is God. Jacob confirms the fact: "I have seen God face to face." 
    Thus, through the veil of apparent mortality, we trace the angel of the 
    everlasting covenant, our great Emmanuel, God manifest in the flesh. </p>
<p align="justify">As man, He spoke with Adam in the garden; as man, He 
    walked by Abraham's side; as man, He here struggles with the wandering 
    patriarch. It is indeed a rich display of grace, that Jesus thus should 
    stand in sinners' likeness on this sin-rank soil. But it is grace above 
    grace, that, in the fullness of time, He should take our manhood into God, 
    and wear it on the cross, and in the grave! and then bear it to heaven, as 
    His triumphal robe forever!</p>
<p align="justify">But why is this wrestling? Every act of Jesus is a volume 
    written within and without in golden letters of instruction. Thus Jacob, and 
    every successive pilgrim, learns that <i>the land of promise is only gained 
    by battling through opposing armies. </i>At the Lord's word, troops of 
    trials, and sorrows, and fears, and troubles arrange themselves against us. 
    They strive, with determined might, to stop our onward march. Behold <i>
    Joseph</i>. It was to him no easy task to escape entangling foes. Consider
    <i>Job, </i>and<i> David, </i>and<i> Paul</i>, and the <i>Apostles</i>, and 
    all the worthies who shine in Scripture-page. What struggles, what perils of 
    overthrow were theirs! They wrestled earnestly, and almost unto blood. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! if you know little of spiritual conflict, it may 
    be you know nothing of the camp of Christ. Examine yourself. Are you truly 
    in the faith? If so, at the cross you have drawn a sword, which never finds 
    a scabbard upon earth, and rarely finds a respite of repose. Those who win 
    the crown, fight a good fight. "the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully 
    advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it."</p>
<p align="justify">But perhaps the struggle, thus severe, was short? Not so. 
    It lasted until "the breaking of the day." Earth is a valley of darkness and 
    of gloom. But yet a little while the shadows will flee away. The brightness 
    of a cloudless eternity will dawn. The weary pilgrim will enter the city 
    which has "no need of sun or moon, for the glory of God illuminates the 
    city, and the Lamb is its light." <i>Then</i>, in a perfect place, there 
    will be perfect rest. </p>
<p align="justify">Next the <i>prowess</i> of Jacob claims our wonder. 
    Though nothing but a feeble worm, he is not crushed. He meets power with 
    power, might with might, strength with strength, skill with skill. He will 
    not, he cannot yield. He awakens again and again his energies. He exerts 
    again and again every vigor of every nerve. He is but flesh and blood, as we 
    are, yet he cannot be subdued. It is all-important that we rightly see what 
    was the grand <i>mainspring</i> of Jacob's indomitable heroism. It cannot be 
    too plainly urged, that it was <i>faith</i>. He was following the Lord 
    fully. He knew that the voice which called him, was victory. Hence he was 
    confident that it were easier to scale and storm the heavens, than to 
    frustrate his assured success. <i>Faith is a rock, when thus based on the 
    rock of promise.</i> It is not of earth, therefore it is imperishable. It is 
    of heaven, therefore its energies are Divine. It looks to Jesus, therefore 
    it overlooks all difficulties. It leans on Jesus, therefore it is as firm as 
    God. </p>
<p align="justify">But Jacob wrestled not in faith only, but in supplication 
    and in <i>tears</i>. Thus Hosea writes, and Hosea's pen was in the hand of 
    God, "Yes, he wrestled with the angel and won. He wept and pleaded for a 
    blessing from him. There at Bethel he met God face to face, and God spoke to 
    him." Hosea 12:4. We hence learn that faith is always in <i>earnest</i>, 
    therefore it prays. It is always <i>humble</i>, therefore it weeps. </p>
<p align="justify">Here, again, a door is opened in heaven; and we see <i>
    Jehovah vanquished by a praying saint! </i>True prayer is indeed bold. It 
    draws near to God, and closes with Him, and gives Him no rest, until an 
    approving smile testifies that the suit is granted. God neither can, nor 
    will, release Himself from the intensity of his efforts. He cannot, because 
    the truth is set up in heaven, that prayer shall prosper. He will not, 
    because <i>prayer is the moving of His Spirit in the heart, and the speaking 
    of His Spirit on the lips. </i>To deny prayer would be to deny Himself. To 
    be silent to it would be to be silent unto Himself. "If we ask anything 
    according to His will, He hears us: and if we know that He hears us, 
    whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him."
    </p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, examine well the Scripture's picture of 
    prayer. It is "to take hold" of Him. It is "taking hold of His strength." It 
    is to "give Him no rest." Learn these truths in their power. Use them as the 
    habit of your life. Then you will know prosperity and peace of soul. </p>
<p align="justify">But the heart strong in faith and prayer loses all 
    nature's hardness. It becomes soft, as the sympathy of Jesus; and tender, as 
    the whispers of His grace. Thus Jacob's streaming eye proclaimed with what 
    subdued sincerity he loved the Lord, whom he so tightly grasped—and how 
    deeply he was melted by inward consciousness of sin's demerit. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! remember, except you have faith, and prayer, and 
    brokenness of heart, you have no signs of spiritual life. Prove, then, 
    yourself at Peniel. Never leave it, until you hear these voices, "Great is 
    your faith, be it unto you even as you will." And again, "Behold, he prays." 
    And again, "She has washed My feet with tears; therefore, her sins, which 
    are many, are forgiven, for she loved much." </p>
<p align="justify">But we are so framed, that <i>spiritual greatness may be 
    a snare.</i> It may unduly exalt, and lead us unduly to exult. That is 
    destructive victory, which leaves the victor in <i>the chains of pride.</i> 
    Our guardian Lord knew this, and since it is better to prevent than to heal, 
    He "touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, and it was out of joint." Here we 
    have a mirror, which reflects many of the Lord's dealings with His favored 
    children. In prevailing they are crippled, lest by prevailing they should 
    perish. <i>Strong grace is checked by enfeebled flesh,</i> lest it should 
    climb the dizzy heights of self-esteem. Many halting infirmities convince 
    them that a yielding Lord has power to lay low. They learn that victory is 
    His gift, and not the wages of their might. They feel that they are broken 
    reeds, except God works with them to will and to do. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us behold once more <i>the triumphs of persevering 
    faith.</i> The angel concedes the victory, and sues to be released from the 
    unyielding arms. Jacob, with limb disjointed, but with faith confirmed, 
    seeks no advantage but an increase of heavenly favor. With holy boldness he 
    exclaims, "I will not let You go, except You bless me." He cares not for 
    healing of body, or for outward prosperity, he only asks for increased 
    tokens of God's love, and for increased health within. "Bless me," is his 
    prayer. Such noble yearnings are the Lord's delight. He honors them, because 
    they honor Him. He crowns them with all that God Himself can give. Count, if 
    you can, the spoil which Jacob won, when the Lord blessed him there! And 
    now, a new name shall give perpetual fame to this exploit. Heroic deeds have 
    endless life. Wherever the Word of God is preached or read, <i>Israel</i> is 
    a title, which tells of <i>Jacob's princely power</i> with God and men. The 
    record is true. As a prince, he constrained God to bless him. As a prince, 
    he drew the heart of Esau like a captive into his arms. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! be an <i>Israelite</i> indeed, and heaven is 
    yours, and earth is yours. Heaven is yours to bless you. Earth is yours to 
    serve you. Jacob receives a name, and gives a name. He calls the place <i>
    Peniel</i>, "for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." 
    Again I say, be an Israelite indeed, and every place will be your Peniel. In 
    every scene you will behold God near. Through life, in death, you will have 
    an eye to gaze undazzled on Him. Your secret chamber will be Peniel—as you 
    kneel, God will come down, and show His smiling face. The family-sanctuary 
    will be Peniel—you will see Him extending the wings of mercy over you and 
    yours. Every page of the Bible will be Peniel—bright with the radiance of 
    Him, who is "the Light of Life," and "the Sun of Righteousness." Your post 
    of daily toil will be Peniel—for you will set the Lord always before you. 
    His earthly temples will be Peniel—in the prayers and praises of the 
    assembled worshipers, in the proclamations of His truth, He will manifest 
    Himself unto you, as He does not unto the world. Your dying bed will still 
    be Peniel—Jesus will come again, to bear you safely to a Father's home. 
    Eternity will be a glorious Peniel—for it will be <i>one unclouded view of 
    God face to face! </i></p>

<p align="justify">Lord God of Israel, nothing is too hard for Your power, 
    nothing is too good for Your love. Will You give, by these poor lines, to 
    bring some soul to Peniel!</p>
