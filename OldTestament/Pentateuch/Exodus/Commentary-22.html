<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE WASHBASIN</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">"Make a <b>bronze basin</b>, with its bronze stand, <b>
    for washing</b>. Place it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put 
    water in it." Exodus 30:18</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! whatever your earthly lot may be, your outward 
    frame contains a priceless gem! You hold within you an immortal soul. No 
    matter what your condition, you are on an inevitable passage to a changeless 
    home! Our common portion is eternity! What, then, is man's grand concern? 
    Surely, to make safe provision for this wondrous soul. What should be the 
    first, the last of all his efforts? Surely to win endless happiness for 
    endless days. This point is clear. All who can think, admit it to be true. 
    God's Word directs us to life's only way. Oh! that His Spirit might give 
    eyes to see it. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The soul, both by nature and by practice, is one vile 
    mass of sin! Christ alone can remove these stains.</p></i> The everlasting hope 
    is lost through sad transgression. Christ only can restore it. Hence, <i>God</i> 
    from His high throne, <i>Jesus</i> in countless ways of love, the <i>Spirit</i> 
    by most gracious strivings, the <i>Bible</i> in its every page, call sinners 
    to accept<i> the one great cure.</i> Such is the aim which now knocks at 
    your heart's door. Such motive brings the holy washbasin to your sight. It 
    is a clear-toned witness of redeeming grace. It paints in vivid rays the 
    cleansing worth of Christ. Use it, and your soul is clean. Use it, and your 
    eternity is joy. 
<p align="justify">God bids His servant to construct the washbasin. 'Make a
    <b>bronze basin</b>, with its bronze stand, <b>for washing</b>. Place it 
    between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it.' Exodus 
    30:18</p>
<p align="justify">Observe <b>the choice material</b>. It is <b>bronze</b>. 
    This strongest metal shadows forth <i>the strength of Christ.</i> He came to 
    do the mightiest of mighty works. And He brings omnipotence in His hand. But 
    where is the bronze obtained? Whose hands supply it? The piety of females 
    furnishes it. They gladly give their mirrors for this holy use. 'The bronze 
    washbasin and its bronze pedestal were cast from bronze mirrors donated by 
    the women who served at the entrance of the Tabernacle.' Exodus 38:8</p>
<p align="justify">Faith seeks, nor seeks in vain, to gain instruction from 
    this fact. <b>Women</b> give aid to form this Gospel-type. Here seems to be 
    a bud of truth. The virgin-mother (Mary) holds the full-blown flower. Look 
    to Bethlehem's inn. There the meek Jesus lies, made of a woman, the kinsman 
    of our race.<i> The gift of gifts comes in through female means!</i> </p>
<p align="justify">They bring their mirrors. The bias of their hearts is 
    changed. New feelings bear new fruit. These mirrors recently were prized as 
    implements of vanity, and handmaids of self-love. But now the eyes are 
    opened to far nobler views. <i>Self has no charms, when once the wondering 
    gaze has caught some glimpse of things divine!</i> Reader! if your faith 
    sees the glorious beauties of the Lord, surely all other features are a 
    dismal blank. </p>
<p align="justify">The offering is not scorned. That which was framed to 
    cast back poor nature's image is accepted to form semblances of grace. <i>We 
    see to what high use our worldly vanities may rise. </i>Reader! you perhaps 
    have stores of needless extravagance. Turn them to real benefits. Devote 
    them to the Lord. Present them as the means to spread abroad some tidings of 
    His truth. Do not forget that the washbasin, which in these pages preaches 
    Christ, was <i>bronze from women's mirrors.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">It occupied <b>a midway space</b> between the bronze 
    altar and the tabernacle's door. A strict command was issued that no priest 
    should touch the one or pass the other until his hands and feet had been 
    here washed. Such is the ordinance. It sternly warns that <i>no defilement 
    may approach the Lord.</i> It sweetly adds that He who demands such purity 
    provides the purifying stream. The Lord who says that you must be cleansed, 
    brings near His cleansing Laver!</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, mark well your calling. It is to minister a 
    livelong service to the Lord. Life is not life, until each act serves our 
    God. Our feet should only move for Him. Our hands should know no work but 
    His. <i>But Ah! these feet, these hands, how soiled, how black they are! The 
    dust of earth forms a polluting path, and through it is our daily walk.</i> 
    The things of earth leave a defiling stain, and such we always handle. With 
    feet, with hands like these, can we bring the sacrifice of faith, or burn 
    the incense of devoted love? But a <i>washbasin</i> is prepared! It stands 
    beside us at each step. It has a voice loud as the roar of many waves, sweet 
    as the melody of heaven—Wash and be clean. </p>
<p align="justify">Eternal <i>love</i> devised the plan. Eternal <i>wisdom</i> 
    drew the model. Eternal <i>grace</i> comes down to build it. But<b> by whom 
    can it be filled?</b> Jesus Himself pours in the stream. He brings the rich 
    supply. It is blood, blood from His own veins, blood from His very heart! 
    Nothing in heaven or earth could help, but this. He bleeds, to fill the 
    washbasin. He dies, to open wide the pardoning fount. </p>
<p align="justify">But is there virtue in this flood to wash out sin? It is 
    a significant point. My soul, rest not until you grasp a clear reply. <i>Sin 
    is indeed a hell-dark stain! </i>Wash it with all that human nature knows or 
    man can bring, and its black dye becomes more black. If tears of penitence 
    could flow forever, they would not lessen the frightful filthiness. The 
    waters from the murky puddle of man's best resolves leave the stained soul 
    in aggravated stains. Let rivers after rivers of religious rites and forms, 
    and strictest self-denial and most severe observances pass over it, yet 
    still the deeply-grained pollution would be uncleansed. If all angelic hosts 
    could wash the spots with all the innocence of angels' tears, the crimson 
    would be crimson still. And why? Because of sin's intense malignity. 
    Infinity belongs to its polluting touch. Its slightest breath inflicts 
    irreparable soil. </p>
<p align="justify">If, then, the washbasin would cleanse sin, it must 
    contain a stream of more than human or angelic power. It must be perfectly 
    divine. It must have all the properties of God. My soul, now view this 
    washbasin. It holds a remedy, large as your every need. The blood therein is 
    Jesus's blood—and Jesus is Jehovah's fellow. It must suffice, because its 
    might is vast as He who shed it—and He who shed it is the God-man Jesus.</p>
<p align="justify">Your sins, indeed, are many, black and vile. They have 
    all aggravation and all filth. They have been acted and reacted, in defiance 
    of all light, all conscience, all rebukes, all checks. Their number leaves 
    the sands behind. Their color makes the night seem bright. But plunge them 
    into these waters. They meet an essence which is infinite to change their 
    hateful hue. No speck can now be found. It flees, as night before the face 
    of day. The sin-black soul becomes as white as wool, whiter than the whitest 
    snow. </p>
<p align="justify">Satan beholds, and can discern no remnant of a flaw. 
    Nothing is left which he can touch. God looks with an all-searching eye, but 
    sin has fled as far as the east is from the west. It has vanished in the 
    efficacy of this perfect cleansing. The blood, the all-powerful blood has 
    washed it out. The Christ-bathed soul is pure and clean and bright and 
    spotless and as fit for heaven, even as Christ Himself. It is so. It must be 
    so. Hear the Spirit's witness. 'The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses 
    us from all sin.' 1 John 1:7. </p>
<p align="justify">Lift up your eye! Behold the bright array which throng 
    the throne. Where is their title to the heavenly home? The blood which 
    bought them has removed all stains. Look down to that dark pit where 
    darkness spreads its ever-darkening pall. Ah! what a spectacle of filth and 
    woe! But why do these wretched spirits writhe in their polluted beds? They 
    never sought, they never found, they never used, the cleansing Laver of a 
    Savior's blood. Hell holds not one who found it. Unwashed souls must sink. 
    The washed must rise. Vile fetters chain the one. The others mount up with 
    silver wings, and feathers of yellow gold. </p>
<p align="justify">But sins forgiven in the court of <i>heaven</i> are not 
    soon forgotten in the court of <i>conscience</i>. Satan finds entrance here 
    in our conscience. With savage voice and clamorous demand, he drags our 
    bygone acts before its bar. If he cannot cast victims into hell, he will 
    affright the heaven-ward pilgrims with wild storms of fear. Thus he reads 
    out long scrolls of past transgressions. He argues that souls so black are 
    only fuel for his endless flames. Woe unto them who strive to reason with 
    this wily foe! Denial cannot be. The case is true. Memory bears tearful 
    witness. Excuses are in vain. These vessels are all full of leaks. They 
    cannot give any defense. </p>
<p align="justify">The only refuge is this washbasin! They who have 
    Gospel-light will cast themselves therein. Then peace resumes her peaceful 
    reign. Then Satan flees in disappointed rage. Then terrifying threats melt 
    into songs of safety. The adversary yields. He cannot destroy a 
    blood-supported peace. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! would you have conscience to be an unruffled 
    calm? Would you repose in pastures of heart-ease? Then heal all memory's 
    wounds in this pure washbasin! Beside its brink you may securely shout—"God 
    is appeased! my troubles shall not live! He sees my sins no more! they are 
    behind His back! they therefore shall not frown before my face."</p>
<p align="justify">But the washbasin holds more precious water yet. He, who 
    finds Christ, finds <i>every good</i> in one! Do you ask—Can more be needed, 
    if sin has lost its filth and guilt? Yes, its vile <b>seeds</b> remain. 
    There is the evil heart bent on all evil. The fire of lust burns strong. The 
    oven of impure desire is hot. But there is water here to purify the will. 
    Christ gives His Holy Spirit to work renewal and to conquer sin. What 
    streams of comfort flow in the channel of the Word. "Then I will sprinkle 
    clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, 
    and you will no longer worship idols. And I will give you a new heart with 
    new and right desires, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out 
    your stony heart of sin and give you a new, obedient heart." Ezekiel 
    36:25-26. The Gospel echoes: He is made unto us, not only wisdom and 
    righteousness, but <i>sanctification</i> too!</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! has this washbasin brought this change to you? 
    Are you a new-made creature in Christ Jesus? Mark well the solemn truth, 
    'Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.' There is no 
    heaven, but for newborn souls. Insuperable bars shut the old nature out. If 
    title to heaven must be found in Christ, so fitness for heaven must be 
    gotten from Him. </p>
<p align="justify">But steadily behold the washbasin. All is ready here. The 
    blood which buys all <i>pardon</i>, and confers all <i>peace</i>, earns all 
    supplies of <i>sanctifying grace</i>. The constant cry is: Wash and be clean 
    from every outward stain. Wash and be clean from all accusing fears. Wash 
    and be clean from the deep springs of inward evil. Wash and be clean from 
    this world's corrupting love. </p>
<p align="justify">There was only <b>one</b> washbasin. If Israel's priests 
    had sought some other fount, their case would have been hopeless; the wrath 
    would have consumed them. Reader! cast out the vain conceit that anything 
    but Christ can cleanse the soul. He is enough, He is at hand. But fail to 
    use Him, and your filth remains! Wash here; wash <b>only</b> here. No other 
    vessel can add merit where all merit thus abounds. So only will your walk be 
    clean on earth. So only will you reach the pure abodes where holy lips 
    forever sing, 'Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts.'</p>
