<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE WILLING SERVANT </b></font></p>

<p align="justify">"But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my 
    wife, and my children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his 
    master must present him before God. Then his master must take him to the 
    door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will 
    belong to his master forever." Exodus 21:5-6</p>
<p align="justify">As in <i>nature's</i> field, so in <i>Israel's</i> story, 
    almost every object reflects Christ. Happy the hand which holds a key to 
    open the rich treasure's door! Happy the soul which learns the art of 
    feasting at the hallowed table! To see Christ now by faith is heaven begun. 
    To see Christ soon in glory will be heaven complete. </p>
<p align="justify">The narrative before us seems at first glance to tell but 
    a simple incident of domestic life. A Hebrew slave is the subject of the 
    story. His period of servitude is past. All claims have therefore ceased. He 
    has now the option to breathe freedom's air. But freedom has no charms for 
    him. Attachment binds him to his master's home. His dearest joys are there. 
    His hearty language is, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I would 
    rather not go free.' A new ordinance is appointed to sanctify this <i>
    willing offer of perpetual service. </i>The judges must bear witness. An 
    inflicted wound must also be a visible and enduring seal: 'Then his master 
    must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After 
    that, the slave will belong to his master forever.' Willing consent is thus 
    proclaimed. The testifying brand is fixed. And a beloved work, while life 
    shall last, is grasped by self-devoting hands. </p>
<p align="justify">It may perhaps come as a new thought to some, that in 
    this servant's choice, and in this constant love, Jesus reveals Himself. But 
    doubts are worse than folly, when the Spirit speaks from His high seat. 
    Read, then, the 40th Psalm. There faith ascends in heaven-high flight. It 
    hears the eternal Son in close communion with the eternal Father. It catches 
    these wondrous notes. 'Sacrifice and offering you did not desire but <i>my 
    ears you have pierced.</i>' Jesus announces the amazing fact. Father, My 
    ears are pierced by Your hand. </p>
<p align="justify">Here is a grand truth. Read it, O sons of men. Read it, 
    my soul. Hell sees it and turns pale. Heaven sees it and resounds with 
    praise. These words state at once, that Jesus becomes man. They speak of <b>
    'ears.'</b> None can have these, except they wear the garments of our flesh. 
    We have the Spirit's comment. He writes in after pages, as a co-equal 
    clause, 'a <i>body</i> You have prepared Me.'</p>
<p align="justify">But more than this is taught. The ears are 'pierced.' 
    Here a clear finger points to the Willing Servant's pledge. We see the 
    God-man stooping to the lowest grade. He seeks a servant's office, and a 
    servant's toil. Jehovah's Fellow is Jehovah's workman in the labor-field of 
    grace. For God to take us into heaven, and on the throne of worlds, would be 
    grace beyond all thought. But for God to become man in lowest bonds of 
    servitude, is grace which none but Jesus' heart can know. </p>
<p align="justify">We have, then, in this abject state, <b>a speaking 
    portrait of Christ's love.</b> This image is the sweetest fountain of His 
    people's peace. It is the deepest mystery set forth in simplest terms. Hence 
    Scripture, laboring to reveal the Lord, presents <i>the Servant's motif</i> 
    in repeated terms. The Father's voice announces, 'Behold My Servant, whom I 
    uphold.' And again, 'Behold I will bring forth My Servant the Branch.' Jesus 
    meekly adds, 'I am among you as he that <i>serves</i>.' The Spirit echoes, 
    'Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with 
    God—but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a <i>
    Servant</i>.' He is a servant, whose time and toil are not his own. Strong 
    obligations bind Him to execute another's will.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! come now and mark <b>THE SERVICE</b> to which God 
    calls His Son. It is to build the fabric of salvation. What strength, what 
    zeal, what might, what wisdom, what patience, what endurance, what 
    self-sacrifice, are needed! Survey the <b>hindrances</b>. In depth they 
    reach to hell. In height they mount to heaven. Their breadth and length 
    extend illimitable arms. A countless multitude of immortal beings lie in the 
    vile quarry of vile sin. They must be rescued from this misery's cell. They 
    must be made fit with all-beauteous grace. Each soul is black with stains 
    more countless than the ocean's sands. These stains must disappear. Each 
    owes a debt of infinite amount. This must be cancelled. Each is most justly 
    sentenced to eternal woe. This sum of wrath must be endured. Each is weighed 
    down beneath the Law's stern curse. This burden must be borne away. Satan 
    has riveted his iron chains around each. These fetters must be broken off. 
    The walls of his dark prison-house enclose them. The mighty barrier must be 
    leveled. They are all loathsome in most filthy rags. White clothing must be 
    wrought for them. In each the nature is estranged from God. This must be 
    changed in every pulse and every feeling. A new heart must be implanted. Old 
    things must pass away. Grace must commence its new-born reign. They are as 
    scattered outcasts in a wide world's wilderness. All must be brought to hear 
    one Shepherd's voice, and feed in one most holy fold. All must be set before 
    the Father's throne, clear of all guilt, free from all charge, as pure as 
    God, as blameless as heaven, as bright as eternal day. </p>
<p align="justify">Such is Jehovah's gracious will. Not all the hosts of 
    angels or of men can render aid. Deity's whole might is needed to subserve 
    this cause. There is a train, also, of revealing <i>types</i>. They must be 
    accurately answered. There is a volume of prophetic <i>promise</i>. All must 
    be fulfilled. There is a fearful catalogue of righteous <i>threatenings</i>. 
    All must be executed. Each <i>holy attribute</i> presents strong claims. 
    Each must be fully satisfied. God would be cast down, His empire would be a 
    broken reed, His sovereignty would be a shadow's shade, unless justice 
    remains just, and truth continues true, and holiness shines forth inviolate. 
    It is no easy task to render these attributes their due honor. But such is 
    the service which must be performed. </p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, rejoice, be glad, give thanks, shout praises; 
    a willing Servant undertakes to do it! O my soul, rejoice, be glad, give 
    thanks, shout praises, while you draw nearer and behold the fulfillment. The 
    time to work arrives. Will Jesus now draw back? It cannot be. 'Lo, I come,' 
    is still the language of His willing heart. He must, then, stoop to put on 
    human flesh. He must be one in lowly nature with our race. He shrinks not. 
    He lies a babe of Adam's stock. He takes our kinsman's place. He, for whom 
    heaven is no worthy home, is cradled, as the lowest child of earth. 
    Jehovah's service, man's redemption, demands descent to depths thus low. 
    Salvation's Servant must go slowly on through every stage of suffering life. 
    Be it so. It is His food and drink to do His Father's will. We find not one 
    reluctant pause. He dwells unknown in a despised town. He toils, as workman, 
    with a workman's tools. Each cup of degradation is wrung out. The final 
    scene, the bitterest effort, comes. Will Jesus flinch? He hastens forward to 
    meet all. </p>
<p align="justify">Go with Him to the <b>garden</b> of woe. There torturing 
    agonies collect, which human thought is far too weak to grasp. The sufferer 
    stands laden with His people's guilt. He is not spared. Wrath rushes down 
    with outpouring fury. He meekly bows before the just infliction. The Willing 
    Servant pays the whole debt, bears the whole curse, receives each crushing 
    load, exhausts each vial of wrath. All heaven hears the voice, 'I have 
    glorified You on the earth—I have finished the work which You gave Me to 
    do.' </p>
<p align="justify">And now the cross is upraised. The scaffold stands. Will 
    Jesus hesitate? He is the Willing Servant to the end. <i>Man's bitter hate 
    drives in the nails.</i> Hell makes its direct assault. The Father hides His 
    smile. All earth, all heaven, desert Him. But Jesus willingly serves on, 
    until the mightiest of all mighty words sounds forth, 'It is finished.' Yes! 
    Salvation is accomplished! Redemption is secured! Each type is answered! 
    Every payment is paid! Each penalty is thoroughly endured! The curse is 
    drained! Satan is vanquished! Hell's borders are broken down! His people are 
    all free! The Father's will is done, the holy service is performed, 
    Jehovah's Servant has acted out the glorious work! 'It is finished!' </p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, you may indeed stand fearless on the rock of 
    this completed service. The work is <i>done</i>, is <i>fully</i> done, is 
    done <i>forever</i>. The heavens again receive Him. The Servant enters with 
    a Victor's crown. There He still serves. <i>Salvation's building</i> 
    consists of countless stones. All must be found, and fitly framed together. 
    They lie on many a mountain's brow, in many a hidden valley, on many a 
    distant plain. Each is a precious soul. Each must abhor the loathsomeness of 
    self, and rejoice in Jesus's blood, and cling with sincere faith to His 
    saving arms. </p>
<p align="justify">By day, by night, without one moment's pause, Jesus 
    pursues the work of winning souls. He sends His Spirit on the wings of love. 
    He calls and qualifies ministering pastors. At His command they raise the 
    beacon of the cross. Devoted missionaries break all endearing ties, and seek 
    the outcasts beneath tropic suns, in ice-clad rocks, and amid tribes which 
    Satan holds in death-cold bonds. Thus Christ still serves the purposes of 
    grace. A mighty voice cries, <i>Come!</i> And all who are ordained to life 
    obey. Onward the healing waves will roll until the blessed company is 
    complete. Then comes the end. The glorious plan is gloriously finished. The 
    kingdom is delivered to the Father. The Willing Servant shows the collected 
    mass all gathered in, all saved. Not one is lost. Not one is absent. Each 
    member of the mystic body fills its place. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! at that day where will be your place? Oh! pause. 
    Put not the question away from you. Perhaps you sigh, I would like to be 
    numbered with the saved, but how can I have hope? Tell me. Where is your 
    fear? Is it lest the tremendous billows of your sins should swell above His 
    willingness to save? If all the guilt of all the lost multiplied and 
    magnified beyond all power to count or measure, weighed heavily upon your 
    conscience, still venture to His feet. The willing Jesus will not cast you 
    out. His heart, His love, His zeal, His pity, His bleeding wounds, His 
    undertaken office, all forbid it. Let not His acts on earth, let not His 
    voice from heaven, be in vain. </p>
<p align="justify">Did misery ever seek relief from Him, and not receive 
    more than a ready welcome? Fly forth in spirit to the bright saints in 
    light. The testimony from each rejoicing heart is one. They all give glory 
    to a willing Jesus. With united voice they tell, that when they cast their 
    ruined souls upon Him, He <i>tenderly embraced, and sweetly cheered, and 
    fully pardoned, and entirely saved.</i> Hear now His voice. Throughout the 
    Bible, and from faithful lips, it still is sounding—Will you? Will you be 
    made whole? </p>
<p align="justify">Be persuaded then. Tarry not. Let this accepted moment 
    find you a willing suppliant at a willing Savior's cross. None ever perished 
    because Christ would not hear. None ever fell into the burning lake because 
    He turned from the beseeching cry. </p>
<p align="justify">But stay, there is another word. It seals perdition on 
    all who stand apart. Take heed, lest it enclose you in its hopeless doom. 
    'You will not come to me, that you might have life.' </p>
