<p align="justify"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">THE TABLE OF THE BREAD 
    OF THE PRESENCE</font></b></p>

<p align="justify">"You must always keep the special <b>Bread of the 
    Presence on the table</b> before me." Exodus 25:30</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! have you passed the threshold of the home of 
    grace? Is soul-death behind you? Is soul-life your portion? If so, <i>you 
    daily hunger for divine meal.</i> The proof of life is sure. <i>The new-born 
    craves for food. And no food satisfies, but Christ Himself. </i></p>

<p align="justify">These lines are written to commend such feast. A Table 
    here is spread, of which the whole provision is Christ's person and Christ's 
    work. The saints of old found their abundance here. Yet there is more. The 
    banquet still is rich. The Spirit's call is ever heard, 'Eat that which is 
    good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.' Our gracious God 
    directs, 'make a <b>table</b> of acacia wood, 3 feet long, 1 1/2 feet wide, 
    and 2 1/4 feet high. Overlay it with pure gold and run a molding of gold 
    around it.' Observe this. The <b>thought and plan</b> are wholly from above. 
    It is no human pattern or design. God loved, God willed, God spoke. As 
    Christ is the offspring of free grace, so grace contrives each image which 
    reveals Him. </p>
<p align="justify">In height it is co-equal with the Ark. The measure of its 
    length and breadth is less. Its substance is identically one. The inward 
    frame is that choice wood, of which the virtue could resist all taint. The 
    outside shines in the chaste splendor of pure gold. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! revolve the precious teaching of these chosen 
    signs. Their terms are plain. They show the redemption-wonder. <i>Wood</i> 
    is co-joined with <i>gold</i>. This is poor manhood taken into God. This is 
    the Godhead linked to our lowly flesh. God remains God, and yet is man. Man 
    remains man, and yet is one with God. Such is our Jesus; moving, working, 
    dying, upon <i>earth</i>. Such is our Jesus; sitting, working, reigning, in 
    the <i>heavens</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! let ceaseless praises prove that your gratitude 
    discerns this truth. Cry out and shout—Christ is man; His doings are put 
    down as mine. Christ is God; His doings must suffice. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The Table is well-stored</p></b>. Christ is the richness of 
    all rich supply. Count all the drops of ocean, and all the grains which form 
    our globe, and all the rays, which pour down from the sun. They are base 
    scantiness compared with Him. View other tables. The dainties of the WORLD 
    are choking dust. The hungry eat, and hunger bites with sharper tooth. SELF 
    is a barren waste. No soul of man can reap refreshment in that blighted 
    field. The mere outside of RELIGIOUS FORMS and RITES is as unsubstantial as 
    the passing cloud. Many, indeed, visit these tables; but disappointment 
    mocks them all. The same is true of every table but Christ. He is the one 
    abundance which abounds forever. He is the one full Table which is ever 
    full. 
<p align="justify">But what is the food? It is <b>bread</b>. 'You must 
    always keep <b>the special Bread of the Presence</b> on the table before 
    me.' Faith knows this emblem well. It has often sat in rapture at the feet 
    of Jesus, and heard His own lips say, 'I am the bread of life.' It knows, 
    also, the <b>reviving</b> taste. It has found Christ to be its staff of 
    strength, the healthful juice of its exhausted powers. </p>
<p align="justify">But bread is formed of grain, which <i>earth</i> brings 
    forth, and labor grinds, and culinary process kneads, and oven's heat 
    completes. Christ is all this. He is bone of our bones, flesh of our flesh. 
    The heavy burden of man's sins bruised Him to powder, crushed Him to the 
    grave. All hell put forth its endeavors to sift Him as the wheat is shaken. 
    And all the flames of God's wrath blazed fiercely round Him. Thus He became 
    the Bread of God—the saving food of souls! </p>
<p align="justify">Will <b>any grain</b> avail to make this consecrated 
    bread? What says the Lord? 'You shall take <b>fine flour</b>.' No unclean 
    grain, no refuse husk, no worthless chaff, can taint this holy lump. All its 
    material is pure perfection. Here is Christ's manhood, as free from evil as 
    God's life can be. This truth is precious. The anxious soul will often ask, 
    May I lie down and die, without one fear, on Christ? The Spirit uses sword 
    after sword to slay each doubt. He testifies by frequent <i>word</i>, in 
    frequent <i>type</i>, that <i>sin could no more touch Him, than man's hand 
    can reach God's throne, or soil the sun with stains.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">A <b>name</b> distinguishes this food. It is called 
    Show-bread. The term implies <i>Bread of faces</i>, or <b>Bread of the 
    Presence</b>. There is a length of truth wound up in Bible names and titles. 
    As we unfold them, there seems to be no end. We here are taught that <i>this 
    Bread was spread forth before Jehovah's face, laid out in His immediate 
    presence. </i>This is an emblem of our Lord. There never has been moment in 
    which He lived not the darling of the Father's eye. There never can be. He 
    says, 'Before the worlds were framed, I was by Him, and I was daily His 
    delight, rejoicing always before Him.' God viewed Him, then, as the one 
    center of His heart's desire. And never can His eye stray from Him. He views 
    Him still with loving gaze, as having executed all His purposes of grace, as 
    having magnified His name beyond all honor, as having vindicated the majesty 
    of truth and justice. All that God is, finds sweet refreshment in this<i> 
    Bread of the Presence.</i> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The number of the loaves is fixed.</p></b> They must be 
    twelve. 'Place the bread in the Lord's presence on the pure gold table, and 
    arrange the loaves in two rows, with six in each row.' Leviticus 24:6. There 
    is sweet meaning in this gracious rule. The twelve express the tribes of 
    Israel. Each has allotted place on the presenting table. These classes had 
    their differing marks. In size, in wealth, in promises, in privilege, in 
    heritage, their state was diverse. But here<i> not one</i> is overlooked—not 
    one is put aside. The Table sets all <i>equally</i> in order before God. 
<i>
<p align="justify">The numbered tribes of Israel are a clear picture of the 
    numbered Church. </p></i>Hence every child of faith is present in the 
    Presence-bread. They all are members of the Lord. <i>In Jesus, </i>they all<i>
</i>appear before the Father's eye. Degrees of faith may vary. Some may but 
    touch with trembling hand the very edge of Jesus' garment. Others may live 
    with their enraptured head upon His very breast. But if there is vital 
    faith, there is an oneness with the Lord which never, never can be parted. 
    Christ holds each one within Himself. He shows Himself to be made up of them 
    all. They lived in Him. They died in Him. They rose in Him. They sit 
    together in heavenly places in Him. God's look, which rests upon His Son, 
    sees them. The love which smiles on Jesus smiles on them. 
<p align="justify">Believer, whatever be your need, your misery, your sense 
    of sin, your loathing of vile self, turn to the <i>Bread of the Presence.</i> 
    Your image there is lovely. Christ lives to represent you. While God 
    delights in Him, He must delight in you. He perpetually sees you wrapped up 
    in His Son. </p>
<p align="justify">The Bread received a crown (or rim) upon its summit. The 
    crown was <b>frankincense</b>. Thus constant fragrance shed delight around. 
    Christ is sweet savor. The sin-removing blood, the interceding prayer, the 
    spotless righteousness, the incense of the finished work, are<i> heaven's 
    own myrrh.</i> O my soul, is Christ this frankincense to you? You hear the 
    voice, 'This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased.' Is there the 
    glad response, This is <i>my</i> beloved Savior—in Him, I am indeed well 
    pleased? </p>
<p align="justify">On the return of every Sabbath morn, the priests brought
    <b>fresh supplies</b>. At no moment was the Table empty. You ministers of 
    Christ, mark well this fact. It is a sign which teaches you how you must 
    teach your flocks. The Sabbath hours are golden time. The pulpit opens to 
    you. Assembled crowds hang on your lips. The hungry press round you to be 
    fed. What bread do you produce? <i>No food can satisfy which is not Christ.
    </i>This must be gathered in the fair fields of Scripture, where nothing 
    grows but holiest grain. It must be sifted with most anxious search. It must 
    be worked upon the knees. It must be <i>'mixed'</i> with agonizing prayer. 
    It must be always new, but always one. Its savor must be only Christ. </p>
<p align="justify">The Presence-bread was<b> still the same in substance and 
    in form</b>—but newly placed and newly prepared for its sacred use. O Sirs, 
    look well to this. A dwindled and decaying flock might move angelic 
    multitudes to tears. But dwindle and decay they must, if the bread you give 
    them is poison; or if the food is stale. Woe to the preacher who thus sins! 
    There can be no excuse! The Bible is before him. It is a storehouse in which 
    Christ is <i>All</i>—and <i>ever new.</i> Will he not take that he may give? 
    Will he not give that he may save from death? Listen to the moan of many a 
    famished soul—"I starve; this food is Christless. I starve; this food is 
    tasteless."</p>
<p align="justify">The Bread afterwards became <b>the priests' meal.</b> 
    Within the holy place they ate the holy food. There is especial care for 
    those who do especial work. And why? They have especial need. Such is the 
    pastor's case. What cares oppress! What toils exhaust! What anxious days and 
    nights beat down! But Jesus calls him to the secret chamber of His presence, 
    and feeds him with the first-fruits of His truth. Thus with new power he 
    runs anew his sun-like course. But woe, indeed, to him who sermonizes a 
    Savior whom he has never seen, and preaches Christ from Christless heart, 
    with Christless lips. O Sirs, there is a voice from <i>Balaam's bed of fire</i>, 
    there is a wail from the <i>low cell of Judas</i>, which warns with an 
    appalling note. <i>Let none take Christ upon the preaching lip, who do not 
    feed on Him with ravished heart!</i></p>

<p align="justify">But here is <b>food for the whole family of faith</b>. In 
    Gospel day, the lowest servant is a priest of God. 'He has made <i>us</i> 
    his kingdom and his <i>priests</i> who serve before God his Father.' Hence, 
    all are welcomed to the Bread of His Presence. Children of grace, know your 
    high privilege. The table with all its treasures is for you. Look to the 
    Bread of His Presence again. It tells you what is the true act of faith. Is 
    it enough to <i>hear</i> of food? Is it enough to <i>see</i>, to <i>smell</i>, 
    to <i>touch?</i> Oh, no! Hearing and sight remove no hunger and supply no 
    strength. To gain nourishment, the lips must taste, the food must circulate 
    throughout the frame. So Christ must be received in all His grace, in all 
    His truth, into each fiber of the heart and soul. He must be present in the 
    inner man, life of our life, strength of our strength, health of our health, 
    joy of our joy!</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! is your soul craving thus for Christ? Is it thus 
    feasting on Him? He is before you. You have not far to seek. Faith can 
    receive Him at any moment and in any place. It cries, 'Lord, evermore give 
    us this bread'—and as it cries, it takes—and as it takes, it rejoices—and as 
    it rejoices, it blesses—and as it blesses, it takes more, and strengthens 
    more, and shows its greater strength in greater labors and in louder praise.
    </p>
<p align="justify">But perhaps you care nothing for this gospel feast, this
    <i>Bread of His Presence</i>. May God the Spirit in mercy lead you to it! 
    Listen! He cries, 'Come! for all things are now ready.' Will you refuse? 
    Remember <i>Eve</i>. The tempter showed her the forbidden fruit. How easily 
    she yielded; how quickly she took! He now shows you the <i>husks and rubbish 
    of the world.</i> Will you be as easily enticed? Sin touched, sin tasted, 
    sin digested, is hell and all hell's pains. But come to this Feast! Take 
    Christ, love Christ, feed daily, hourly, on Christ—and yours is the fullness 
    of joy now, and all heaven's blessedness forever!</p>
