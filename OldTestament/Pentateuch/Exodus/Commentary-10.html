<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">PREVAILING 
    INTERCESSION</font></b></font></p>
<p align="justify">"As long as Moses held up the staff with his hands, the 
    Israelites had the advantage. But whenever he lowered his hands, the 
    Amalekites gained the upper hand." Exodus 17:11</p>
<p align="justify">Alarms soon trouble the advancing host. Amalek attacks 
    their rear. Esau's tribe has evil will against the house of Jacob. The 
    birthright sold, the blessing lost, had deeply laid the seeds of malice. And 
    now occasion ripens hatred into fierce assault. Believer, the race of Cain, 
    of Ishmael, of Esau still lives. Be ready. Their hate is sure. Their wily 
    steps are near. When least expected, they will plot their worst. How shall 
    such foes be met? He who follows Christ must neither flee nor yield nor 
    fear. He must stand fast in faith, and he must kneel in prayer. So Moses 
    teaches. He commands Joshua, 'Choose some men, and go out, <i>fight.'</i> 
    Heaven's crown sits only on a <i>warrior's</i> brow. </p>
<p align="justify">But carnal weapons are impotent alone. In fighting, <i>by 
    not fighting</i>, we prevail. So when Joshua struggles in the plain, Moses 
    wrestles on the hill. He seeks the summit, bearing the rod. Prayer brings 
    all heaven to the aid. Thus Israel's hands are strong or weak as those of 
    Moses rise or drop. Large Gospel lessons here expand before us. We may roam 
    up and down this field and find no end in gathering precious fruit. But one 
    especial tree calls us to shake its richly-laden boughs. <b>Moses 
    interceding on the hill shows Jesus interceding on the higher heights.</b>
</p>
<p align="justify">Come then, my soul, with joyful wing fly upward. It is 
    good, it is wise, it is blessed, to be much with Jesus in the <i>suffering</i> 
    valley. Faith visits often the manger, the garden, and the cross. It seeks 
    all sin's remission in the stripes, the wounds, the agony, the death of the 
    bleeding Lamb. But these amazing truths are but the <i>porch</i> of more 
    amazing glories. Hence it delights to follow Jesus in His <i>bright ascent</i>, 
    to gaze undazzled on the throne, to mark His present doings by His Father's 
    side. </p>
<p align="justify">What? Is He still engaged in work? Wondrous tidings! 
    Hear, all who call Him Lord—He ever loves you, and ever labors in your 
    cause. His eye is never turned away. His hands cannot hang down. His heavens 
    are the office-chamber of your soul's concerns. Do you ask, <i>What is His 
    work?</i> Listen, the Holy Spirit cries, <i>'He ever lives to make 
    Intercession.'</i> His every day and every hour is ceaseless energy of 
    interceding love. </p>
<p align="justify">Do you add, <i>But what is Intercession?</i> An 
    intercessor stands between two parties, pleading for the one to look with 
    favor on the other. The parties here are God the Father, and poor worms of 
    earth. 'If any man sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ 
    the righteous.' Before the Father, then, the Mediator pleads. But is not the 
    Father an overflowing ocean of free grace? Is it not His grand delight to 
    crown His sons with all heaven's blessings? Why, then, shall prayers, like 
    constant incense, move Him to give what He is unwilling to withhold? 
    Salvation's scheme is wholly ordered to show forth love in brightest rays. 
    It is to aid this end, that Intercession has its place. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, what kindles flames of comfort in your heart? 
    What decks your brow with smiles, when trials and temptations throng? Is it 
    not<i> a view of Jesus pleading at God's right hand?</i> The thought is 
    rapture, peace, and victory. Remove the Advocate, and all your hope goes 
    down in gloom. Christ prays, because He loves so much. He prays, because the 
    Father loves not less. Intercession is the fair fruit of their co-loving 
    heart. </p>
<p align="justify">Next, see <b>for whom</b> this Intercession strives. 
    Imagine a father begging for his much-loved son, a mother for her first-born 
    child, brother for brother, friend for friend, the ardent bridegroom for his 
    darling bride. What cries! What tears! What earnestness! What moving words! 
    What melting arguments! What strong appeals! What fervor of desire! What 
    bold resolve to gain the petition! But all these ties, with all their 
    warmth, converge in Jesus. In Him there is the <i>father's</i> deep 
    affection, the <i>mother's</i> tenderness, the <i>brother's</i> zeal, the <i>
    friend's</i> devoted sympathy, the <i>bridegroom's</i> burning love. He 
    urges, These are My children—the travail of My soul—the offspring of My 
    wounds—My sister—My spouse—My beloved, around whom My heart has been 
    entwined forever—the bride of My Father's gift, and of My loving choice—My 
    portion—My jewels—My crown—the sheep of My pasture—My wealth—My delight—the 
    members of My mystic body—the very apple of My eye. Such prayer is as the 
    heart-strings strained. Reader! are you one with Christ? Then all day long, 
    and all time long, He wrestles thus for you. </p>
<p align="justify">Mark, also, <b>how</b> Jesus executes this office. Come, 
    see the proceedings of <i>the heavenly court. </i>Jesus appears. This is the 
    opening act. The Spirit teaches, 'Christ has not entered into the holy 
    places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven 
    itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.' He presents His 
    person. The Father's eye rests on Him. Oh! with what love, what rapture, 
    what delight! It is His son, His only begotten Son, His well-beloved Son, 
    His elect One, His beauty, His express image, His glory, His treasure, 
    compared with whom the heavens are an empty void, and all worlds' charms a 
    vacant nothingness. It is Jesus—even the Servant, who has performed all His 
    will—who has brought all honor to His attributes—who has ransomed all His 
    people—who has filled heaven with all its song. Jesus Himself appears. O my 
    soul, your cause is in good hands!</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus appears. But <b>in what form?</b> A LAMB is seen, 
    'looking as if it had been slain.' What, then, does He show? His wounds, His 
    bruises, His scars, His pierced hands and feet, His open side. <i>There is 
    no eloquence like the eloquence of a slain Redeemer! </i>There is no 
    argument like the argument of a God-man's death. The blood of Abel cries. 
    Much more the blood of Jesus. It loudly proves that His people are all 
    bought with a worthy price, that their sins are all washed away, that they 
    are all whiter than snow, that the covenant is all fulfilled, and that every 
    grace is their purchased due. Thus Christ appears as 'He that lives and was 
    dead.' O my soul, your cause is in good hands!</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus appears. But <b>by what right? </b>He comes as one 
    whom office and duty bring. He is called and appointed and ordained to this 
    especial work. He comes, because He must be faithful to the trust received. 
    He comes, because it is His privilege to pass the veil. The great day in 
    which atonement must be pleaded has arrived. The High Priest cannot be 
    absent. O my soul, your cause is in good hands!</p>
<p align="justify">He comes, also, with <b>authority</b>. He prays as one 
    who may command. Equal addresses equal. O wondrous thought! what can the 
    language be? 'Father, I will.' Yes! It is even so. 'Father, I will.' 'I 
    will,' is God's petition to a granting God. The kingly Priest with king-like 
    power prays. O my soul, your cause is in good hands! </p>
<p align="justify">He enters, also, as <b>Advocate</b>. As such, His 
    Intercession has judicial force. He states the laws of the realm, the 
    statutes of the empire, the decrees of the sovereign, the rights of the 
    subject, the justice of the case, the demands of equity and truth. He 
    unfolds the volume of the covenant of grace. He claims a judgment in 
    accordance with well-counseled compact. Righteousness fails, heaven's edicts 
    must be rewritten, if such pleadings be cast out. O my soul, your cause is 
    in good hands!</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, perhaps next you anxiously enquire, what is the
    <b>significance</b> of such mighty Intercession? You sigh, Oh! that I surely 
    knew what are the blessings which He seeks for me. Draw near. His 
    interceding voice sounds in the Gospel-page. He cried boldly and clearly 
    from the cross, 'Father, <b>forgive</b> them.' He cries as boldly and as 
    clearly from the throne, 'Father, forgive them.' As king He reigns, taking 
    away sin.<i> As quick as the sin-stain defiles, He spreads His wounded 
    hands.</i> Pardon cannot linger. Sins and iniquities are remembered no more.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Listen! He pleads again. It is, that His flock may be <b>
    kept</b>. 'Holy Father, keep through Your own name those whom You have given 
    Me.' The prayer is heard. Jehovah's wings become their shield. Omnipotence 
    defends them. Angels encamp around them. All things work together for their 
    good. Each foe is foiled. The chosen seed gets safely to heaven. </p>
<p align="justify">His word, also, is gone forth, 'I will ask the Father, 
    and He shall give you another <b>Comforter</b>, that He may abide with you 
    forever, even the Spirit of truth.' The eternal Spirit hastens to comply. He 
    flies with conquering wing into the willing heart. He shows the cross in its 
    attractive glory. He shines upon the sacred page. He lifts up Jesus to the 
    enraptured gaze. Without Christ's prayer the Spirit never comes. Without the 
    Spirit, there is no faith, no truth, no godliness on earth. </p>
<p align="justify">He next <b>gains acceptance for our prayers.</b> What 
    feeble babbling is our holiest worship? But answers come, surpassing our 
    largest hopes. How can it be? The incense of Christ's merits fills the 
    censer. Thus more is granted than the suppliant sought. We coldly plan, we 
    feebly work, to magnify His name. But we succeed, and He is glorified in us. 
    But how? His voice wins help and help we receive. Believer, pray much. Pray 
    more. Think <i>whose</i> prayers are mixed with yours. Work much—work more. 
    Think who obtains for you the strength to prosper. </p>
<p align="justify">Will Christ ask more? He surely asks, until God's 
    treasury is drained. He speaks again, 'Father, I will that those also, whom 
    You have given Me, be with Me where I am.' This is the summit of His love. 
    This is the summit of His people's joy. He has no heaven without them. They 
    have no heaven but with Him. His throne is for them. Their throne is by His 
    side. Believer, mark it, you must ever be with the Lord. <i>This 
    Intercession is the golden chain which draws and binds you to Him. </i>It is
    <i>uttered</i>. It is <i>continued</i>. It is <i>heard</i>. It is <i>granted</i>. 
    His presence is your endless heritage.</p>
<p align="justify">It must be so. This Intercession must <b>prevail</b>. 
    Mark the ascending steps by which the Spirit leads up to the proof. Read 
    Romans 8:34. Christ's death is full redemption. 'Who is he that condemns? It 
    is Christ who <i>died</i>.' His resurrection rises higher. It manifests in 
    clearer light the acceptance of the finished work. 'Yes, rather, that has <i>
    risen again</i>.' His ascension soars yet higher. It crowns assurance with a 
    heaven-high crown. 'Who is even <i>at the right hand of God</i>.' But 
    Intercession reaches heights more lofty. It consummates, it perfects, it 
    applies, it secures complete salvation. 'Who also makes Intercession for 
    us.' Blessed <i>death! </i>it reconciles. More blessed <i>life!</i> it much 
    more saves. Blessed<i> blood! </i>it redeems. More blessed<i> Intercession!</i> 
    It saves to the uttermost. O my soul, your cause is in good hands. </p>
<p align="justify">Let others seek their mediators many, who are mediators 
    none. Let others fly to intercessors many, who are intercessors none. Will 
    not you shout that Christ is enough—Christ is All!</p>
