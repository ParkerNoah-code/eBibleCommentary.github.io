<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">MOUNT SINAI</font></b></font><font size="4">
</font></p>
<p align="justify">"God spoke all these words." Exodus 20:1</p>
<p align="justify">Mount Sinai is not rightly seen until the Gospel-sun 
    shines brightly on it. The total aspect then is changed. Its terrors 
    disappear. The darkness melts into the light of life. The angry roar is 
    hushed in notes of peace. Reader! approach this scene with humble prayer. If 
    the Spirit guide your steps, it will open, as a gate, to Zion's blissful 
    slopes. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Who brings the sons of Israel to Sinai's base? </p></b>It is 
    the God of everlasting grace. His mercy looked on their enslaved estate. He 
    burst their bonds and crushed their cruel foes. He was feeding them morn 
    after morn with food from heaven. He was sending streams to supply their 
    thirst. And now, by beckoning cloud, He leads them to this spot. They may 
    advance, then, without fear. His counsels will bud forth in blessings. This 
    mount will be a platform to show Christ to souls. Grace must continue to be 
    grace. 
<p align="justify">When the host reached these heights, they are addressed 
    from heaven. <b>Who is the speaker?</b> The voice is that of JESUS. The 
    Spirit clears this fact. He tells us, that the Angel, the messenger of the 
    eternal Covenant, communed with Moses on the Mount. If Jesus speaks, the 
    accents will be tender love. It is so here. His prelude thus brings peace 
    into their hearts, 'You have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I 
    bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.' This preface does 
    not look like a door to woe. It seems the first drops of a fresh shower of 
    goodness. An especial mandate is next heard. The Lord announces that new 
    revelations are at hand. Especial preparation, then, must now be made. The 
    people are sin-soiled. Their bodies know pollution's touch. Purifying rites, 
    therefore, must prepare them for God's approach.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! you cannot learn too deeply, that <i>we are all 
    infected and impure with sin, and all our righteous acts are but filthy 
    rags! </i>Do you see self as one mire-heap of filth? Do you loathe human 
    merit as a plague-spot? Have you received the warning word, 'If I wash you 
    not, you have no part with Me?' Pause before Sinai, and weigh well your need 
    of cleansing before you can meet God. </p>
<p align="justify">The third day comes. The mount is fenced. Then clouds of 
    terror thicken. Dismay stalks forth in most appalling form. Each sight 
    amazes, and each sound affrights. Is thunder terrible?—peal upon peal cracks 
    in increasing roar. Are lightnings plumed with wings of swiftly-flying 
    awe?—a forked blaze pours its incessant darts. Is it a cheerless time when 
    light is absent?—night with its blackest pall mantles the heights. Do 
    stoutest hearts wax cold when clanging trumpets yell?—echo now maddens with 
    their din. Was Sodom's smoking plain a frightful destruction?—the range of 
    hills flares, as a murky furnace. Is it terrific to see cloud-capped summits 
    tottering to the fall?—the rocky mass now shivers as a wind-tossed reed. </p>
<p align="justify">But <b>why</b> do all terrors settle on the mount? The 
    answer is a page of solemn truth. The Spirit's mouth shall give it. 'The 
    Lord came from Sinai. From his right hand went a fiery law for them.' The 
    Lord wills now to manifest His Law. The hand which holds it shakes terror 
    over a transgressing world. We thus are led to ask <b>the purpose of the Law</b>. 
    Until the soul discerns the nature of this code, God is not truly known. His 
    Gospel is a sealed book. His holiness is an unsubstantial name.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The Law reveals Jehovah's majesty</p></b>. It sets Him on the 
    throne of spotless purity. It unveils the stature of His boundless 
    righteousness. It crowns Him with the diadem, 'Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of 
    Hosts.' It cries with trumpet-tongue that <i>holiness</i> is the pavement of 
    His heavens, the atmosphere of His kingdom, the portals of His palace, the 
    delight of His heart. <b>It shows what God is, and what they must become who 
    would appear before Him.</b> Where is the sinner who will now draw near 
    without some better righteousness than <i>self</i> can weave? Well might 
    Mount Sinai quake, when on its pedestal a Law like this is given. 
<p align="justify">But was the Law now first shown? Far otherwise. On 
    creation's morn it was inwrought in Adam's heart. The parent of our race set 
    his first steps on earth in the very likeness of the great Creator. <i>The 
    Maker's hand could only plant a perfect plant.</i> Man's new-born eye thus 
    looked unmoved on God. He trod this soil in happy innocence. His soul was 
    purity. His voice was perfect praise. <i>Evil</i> was a weed unplucked. <i>
    Transgression</i> was a path untrod. <i>Guilt</i> was a torture yet unborn. 
    The law of love was in each fiber of his heart. Adam thus stood. The Law was 
    in him. He knew that to obey was life, to disobey was death. </p>
<p align="justify">But sinlessness soon withered in his hands. The tempter 
    came. The tempted yielded. The beauteous fabric of the Law was shivered. Its 
    promised life expired. Its dreadful curse became our heritage. </p>
<p align="justify">This Law, implanted in the <i>heart</i> of our first 
    parents, must now be heard again on Sinai. It is God's will to show it as a
    <i>written</i> statute. Its voice, however, is the same. There is no change 
    in its exact requirements. Its measure seems to be more vividly displayed. 
    Its breadth and length are more distinctly marked. But its essence is all 
    one. Two tables now contain it. Ten separate edicts open out its claims. But 
    these brief words admit a summary more brief. The one <b>sum</b> of the 
    demand is simply this—<i>pure</i> <i>love</i>. Without it none can see God's 
    face. But why is it thus renewed? Is it God's will to cancel now the many 
    promises which cheered the elders of the house of faith? Shall the fair page 
    of hope, based on the blood of cleansing, be scattered to the winds? Shall 
    Adam's race again be sent to <i>work</i> for life? <i>Must their own hands 
    erect a tower of safety from rubbish of earth's quarry?</i> Away with such a 
    fearful thought! It would lead headlong to despair's foul depths. Can the 
    poor cripple run? Can the broken wing expand? Can the withered tree bear 
    fruit? Can the sentenced culprit burst his chains? Can the dead arise and 
    walk? Enfeebled nature might more easily do this, than man's lost strength 
    fulfill one mandate of the righteous Law. To send him to pluck innocence in 
    guilt's wild wilderness; to <i>patch a righteousness with shreds and rags of 
    sin</i>; to mount to heaven by a broken ladder's crumbling rounds; would be 
    to mock his ruin and deride his woe. The Law is not republished with designs 
    so vain. </p>
<p align="justify">Look steadfastly at Sinai. Amid all the terrors, angels' 
    forms are seen.<i> A mediator's hands receive the tables. </i>These signs 
    establish that <i>grace</i> is there. Such is the truth. God states His 
    claims, that we, with open eye, may see our need.<i> Our sense of ruin makes 
    the Gospel prized. To those who have no help in self, God's love appears 
    more lovely, His mercy more merciful, His pity more pitiful, His tenderness 
    more tender, His forbearance more forbearing, God more Godlike, Christ more 
    precious, His blood more cleansing, His righteousness more beauteous, His 
    cross more glorious, His pardons dearer, His salvation surer, His Gospel the 
    one home, His wounds the only refuge. </i>Is it not grace to urge us onward 
    towards the cross? This work is never truly done, until <i>the Law displays 
    God's holiness, sin's sinfulness, and hell gaping at our feet.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Satan is ever ready to persuade that a heavenly Father is 
    too gentle to cause woe. Sinai dashes this error to the ground. It shows 
    that <i>God's whole nature abhors evil, and is pledged to execute just 
    wrath.</i> The conscious sinner looks, then, for help. There is such help in 
    Christ, and Christ alone. Thus Sinai drives him to a Savior's arms. This 
    work is grace. Sinai shows sin to be exceeding sinful and exceeding strong.
    </p>
<p align="justify">In the world's school, and by deceiving lips, disguise is 
    spread around the monster's forms. It is but faintly blamed as nature's 
    blemish without power to hurt. But<i> as light manifests a chamber's filth</i>; 
    as heat revives the frozen viper; as the sun's rays draw out the offensive 
    vapor; as barriers cause the rushing stream to overflow; so the <i>Law's 
    restraints make sin to show its hideousness and giant-size!</i> A sinner 
    thus convinced of sin looks with horror on himself. Where shall he flee? 
    Jesus draws near. His blood obliterates. His grace makes free. Thus Sinai 
    magnifies a Savior's saving worth. This work is grace. </p>
<p align="justify">It is at Sinai that the Law makes bare its vengeful arm.<i> 
    It must have sinless purity.</i> But if offence occurs, there is no pity, 
    there is no escape. The curse points sternly towards perdition's lake. When 
    this is known, how precious are the sheltering arms of Jesus! Thus Sinai's 
    truth endears the Gospel-hope. This work is grace. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! has Sinai proved this Gospel-blessing unto you? 
    If not, come now and have close dealings with it. It states its claim. You 
    show your moral principles, your upright life, your inoffensive walk. But 
    this is not one course of love. You startle. You are undone. The thunder 
    roars; the lightnings flash; the mountain quakes; hell is before you. But 
    stop. This is a warning to seek help in Jesus. You cry for mercy with 
    imploring tears. On bended knee, with broken heart, you plead for <i>pardon</i>. 
    How vain! The Law cannot relent. No agony of grief can move its iron breast. 
    The thunder roars; the lightnings flash; the mountain quakes; hell is before 
    you. But stop. This is a warning to seek help in Jesus. </p>
<p align="justify">You urge that your transgressions were but rare, your 
    penitence most deep, your reformation most sincere. If this were true, (but 
    true it is not), yet it cannot undo what has already been done; or cancel 
    what is past; or build again your fallen innocence. Oh, no! The curse must 
    have its course. The thunder roars; the lightnings flash; the mountain 
    quakes; hell is before you. But stop. This is a warning to seek help in 
    Jesus. </p>
<p align="justify">You perhaps think religion's holy rites most punctually 
    discharged. That hope, you think, will surely stand, which rests on the 
    baptismal font, the hallowed feast, the constant service, and a strict train 
    of unremitted forms. How good, how precious are all these, as <i>signs</i> 
    of inward life, and <i>proofs</i> of a devoted heart! But what is their 
    power to give unblemished righteousness? It this your best defense? The 
    thunder roars; the lightnings flash; the mountain quakes; hell is before 
    you. But stop. This is a warning to seek help in Jesus. </p>
<p align="justify">We here discern why multitudes seek peace in Rome, and 
    Rome's poor flimsy fabric of deceits: they never saw with open eye Mount 
    Sinai's terror. Its thunder never rolled through their awakened conscience. 
    They know nothing of the Law's pure code. Its curse has never struck them to 
    the ground. Their wound seems slight. A slight remedy will therefore cure. 
    Their need seems little. Human absolution, and human sprinklings, and human 
    prayers, will therefore make them safe. Oh! it will be dreadful to awake 
    from such a dream, when the great white throne is set, and God requires a 
    righteousness as vast as God. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! if you have fled from Sinai to the cross, this 
    righteousness you have. Christ has fulfilled for you its utmost demand. 
    Christ has endured for you the total of its direst curse. <i>The Law, 
    completely satisfied, claims heaven for you.</i> Mount Sinai's steps exalt 
    you to the heights of glory. Its voice of thunder hymns you to salvation's 
    rest.</p>
