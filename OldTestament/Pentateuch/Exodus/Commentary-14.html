<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">THE ARK OF THE 
    COVENANT</font></b></font><font size="4"> </font></p>
<p align="justify">"Make an <b>Ark</b> of acacia wood—a sacred chest 3 3/4 
    feet long, 2 1/4 feet wide, and 2 1/4 feet high. Overlay it inside and 
    outside with pure gold, and put a molding of gold all around it." Exodus 
    25:10-11</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! come see the chief wonder of the wondrous 
    Tabernacle. It is the Ark. For this the holy tent was upraised. For this the 
    holiest place was set apart. This is the richest jewel of the sacred casket. 
    The topstone of the hallowed Tabernacle. Its form was first displayed in 
    heaven. God gave the plan to Moses. In heaven it still is visible to faith. 
    John saw it with enraptured eye. We read, 'The temple of God was opened in 
    heaven, and there was seen in His temple the Ark of His testament.' Rev. 
    11:19</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">All this exhibits Christ.</p></i> He is the <b>ARK of 
    redemption</b>, the scheme of which was drawn above. In fullness of time it 
    was set up below. And now it shines, and ever shall shine, the glorious 
    glory of the new Jerusalem. When God describes the holy vessels, observe, 
    this Ark takes precedence. He first shows that which shows His Son most 
    clearly. It is His will that Christ should be set forth without a cloud, in 
    full-orbed splendor. May the same mind be ours! May He fill up the 
    foreground of each thought and work! Let no reserve, let no unworthy veil 
    obscure the brightness of His brightest smile. God puts the glories of His 
    Firstborn first. Woe to the man who hides Him in the rear! 
<p align="justify">The Ark is <b>a plain chest</b>. Its length is less than 
    four feet. Its height and breadth are scarcely more than two.<i> Jesus is 
    simple majesty.</i> He needs no art to decorate His grace. It is impure and 
    pitiable taste which craves for outside show. </p>
<p align="justify">The substance of the Ark is <b>wood</b>. This proves<i> 
    an earthly birth.</i> Trees spring from this our lower soil. Here Jesus is 
    portrayed the woman's Seed—the kinsman of our race. O my soul, ponder more 
    and more Christ's visit to our low abode. He takes our prison rags, that He 
    may bear our prison woe. He becomes man, that with man's lips He may exhaust 
    our cup of wrath. Christ's sufferings in the flesh leave us no sufferings to 
    pay. This is no common wood. Corruption cannot soil it. It defies decay. So 
    human nature, as put on by Christ, is human nature without spot of sin. It 
    is a lovely sight to see man treading earth, and no mire cleaving to the 
    feet; and breathing our polluted air, without infection's taint. </p>
<p align="justify">The Ark is more than wood. Its every part is <b>covered 
    with pure gold. </b>This metal, put over the coarse wood, shows that our 
    Jesus is much more than man. Grand truth! Sing, O heavens, and rejoice, O 
    earth. <i>The lowly Savior is the mighty God!</i> Vain were the wounds, the 
    blood, the agony, the death, unless the <i>merit</i> had a boundless worth. 
    One soul which never sinned might buy one sinning soul from curse. But Jesus 
    satisfies for multitudes, as many as the sea-shore grains, and countless as 
    the stars of night.<i> His Deity enables Him for the stupendous work.</i> 
    His every act and every pain is as measureless as God can be. Infinite <i>
    deaths</i> are died upon His <i>cross</i>. Infinite <i>obedience</i> is 
    wrought out in His <i>life</i>. O my soul, look often at the Ark. It 
    witnesses that Christ is very man, a <i>spotless man</i>, and man co-joined 
    with <i>perfect Deity</i> and so the Savior whom your case requires. </p>
<p align="justify">A crown (or molding) of gold surrounds the summit. This 
    speaks of kingly state. And is not Christ a king? The Father's voice decides 
    it; 'Yet have I set My King upon My holy hill of Zion.' The Spirit cries 
    aloud, 'He has on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of 
    Kings, and Lord of Lords.' Who will not add, Lift up your heads, O portals 
    of my heart, and let the King of Glory enter in? Happy they, who give Him 
    the throne of every thought, and crown Him daily with high crowns of praise! 
    Let the ungodly pierce Him with mockery's thorns. Reader! place on His brow 
    the jewel of your ransomed soul. </p>
<p align="justify">Coffers are made to <b>hold some treasure</b>. They have 
    the custody of precious things. That surely, then, must be a priceless 
    prize, which shall be guarded within walls like these! And so it is. The Ark 
    receives the <b>Tables of the Law</b>. God had revealed His will. He had 
    drawn on a chart His own transcendent holiness. This transcript of the 
    eternal mind was folded in this chest. Now look to<i> Christ. He is the 
    Law-containing Ark. </i>The Spirit, not the letter, dwells in Him. The world 
    reviled this code. Man cast it from him. Christ gave Himself to be its 
    sacred home. He hid it in the chambers of His breast. Hear His appeal, 'I 
    delight to do Your will, O My God! yes, Your law is within My heart.' Christ 
    is embodied Law. </p>
<p align="justify">Next, the Ark is <b>covered</b>. A lid of solid gold is 
    placed for especial purpose, and with especial name. The purpose is to hide 
    the Law from every eye. This brings us to the glorious work of Christ. The 
    Law has a stern voice. Mark its <i>requirements</i>. They are very long and 
    very wide. Their breadth embraces the whole of each man's life. They rigidly 
    exact obedience, without one falter or one flaw. Mark, also, its <i>curse</i>. 
    It has one fearful threat. Eternal ruin is transgression's doom.<i> Christ 
    comes to hide these terrible demands.</i> He spreads Himself along the vast 
    dimensions of the requiring and the condemning code. His life is 
    satisfaction to the whole. So, also, He bears its utmost penalties. He 
    suffers until its wrath can take no more. God looks upon His Son. He finds 
    obedience rendered and the curse endured. An exact covering conceals all 
    claims. No part appears to ask for further dues. </p>
<p align="justify">The lid has <b>an especial name</b>. It is the <b>
    Mercy-seat</b>. We now are taught why pure gold, without any admixture, is 
    its substance. Mercy has no birth-place but in heaven. It yearns, indeed, 
    over our fallen race. It speeds, indeed, to earth. But its high origin is 
    far above. <i>Hence nothing but pure gold, God's emblem, can form this 
    Mercy-seat.</i> It is a fitting name. For what is mercy, but Christ in His 
    finished work? Christ is the <i>ocean</i> of mercy, in which every drop is 
    infinite compassion. He is the <i>mountain</i> of mercy, towering above 
    mountains, in which every grain is God's own goodness. He is the mirror of 
    God's loving heart, the pinnacle of tender grace. O my soul, know the full 
    comfort of the Mercy-seat. When your short-comings fill you with dismay, see 
    Christ, your mercy-seat, spreading His own robe around you; when threatening 
    thunders peal, seek safety in His covering side. Bless Jesus more and more. 
    His mercy <i>shelters</i>. His mercy <i>saves</i>. His mercy <i>endures 
    forever</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Can more be added to the Ark? Faith would see some<b> 
    token of redeemed souls.</b> It looks again. Nor looks in vain. At either 
    end a <b>cherubim</b> has its place. No foreign metal frames this glittering 
    pair. They and the Mercy-seat are of one piece. Aloft they spread their 
    wings, thus shadowing the lid. Their faces turn towards each other, but look 
    intently on the seat below. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! come learn some obvious lessons from these 
    cherubim. They <b>rest</b> upon the Mercy-seat. The heirs of life have no 
    dependence but on Christ. On Him they lean for every help. On Him they cast 
    the burden of their sins. 'Other foundation can no man lay, than that is 
    laid, which is Jesus Christ.' </p>
<p align="justify">They are, also, <b>part and parcel of the Lord. </b>He is 
    the Head—they are the members. One sap pervades the stem and branch. 
    Christ's Spirit animates each fiber of the Church. All are 'partakers of the 
    divine nature.' </p>
<p align="justify">Their <b>expanded wings</b> proclaim their readiness for 
    instant work. The cry of grateful love is always one—'Lord, what will You 
    have me to do?' Speak but the word, and swiftly I will fly. My plumes 
    delight to speed in Your behalf. </p>
<p align="justify">They <b>turn towards each other</b>. Oneness of purpose, 
    oneness of heart, oneness of action, is the pure mark of God's pure sons. 
    They look not to their own, but to the common good. Without diverging 
    glance, in harmony and love, they seek the glory of their glorious Lord.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But every eye is riveted on Christ! </p></b>They dwell with 
    prying gaze on the mysteries of the Mercy-seat. They have no look for other 
    objects, nor mind for other knowledge. Their sigh is, Oh! that we might know 
    Him more and more, and see with clearer view the wonders of His person, His 
    grace, His love, His work. The more they search the more they learn. The 
    more they learn the more they crave. Eternity must end before the end of 
    Christ be reached. 
<p align="justify">A <b>promise</b>, bringing heaven down to earth, 
    surmounts the whole. God adds, 'There will I meet with you, and I will 
    commune with you from above the Mercy-seat. The anxious soul will often 
    breathe the longing thought, 'Oh! that I knew where I might find Him.' </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! there is no doubt. The spot is fixed. Come to the 
    Mercy-seat! There God is present to hear, to answer, and to bless. There He 
    will open all His heart, and deal as friend with friend, in all the freeness 
    of intimate love. Then linger not. Plead Christ, your law-fulfilling 
    righteousness. Claim Christ, your law-appeasing victim. Show Christ as set 
    forth of God to be an atoning sacrifice, or Mercy-seat, 'through faith in 
    His blood.' As you draw near, God will draw near to you. In Christ you come. 
    In Christ He meets you. The Mercy-seat joins you to God. The Mercy-seat 
    joins God to you. </p>
<p align="justify">Will any say that the Ark of Moses no more exists? True. 
    When the Temple fell, this <i>framework</i> disappeared. But Christ, the <i>
    substance</i>, ever lives. In heaven the Throne of Grace cannot be moved. 
    The name is changed, but the reality is one. Material <i>forms</i> are lost. 
    Substantial blessings have eternal life. Yes! While needs lasts we may go 
    boldly to a ready throne. God waits with open hand. With open hand His 
    people take. O my soul, pass often through the parted veil. You will return 
    laden with mercies, rich in grace, refreshed with heavenly communion, and 
    made fit for a heavenly home. </p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, the Ark had <b>poles</b>. By these the priests 
    carried it. It was the constant center of the marching host. It moved or 
    tarried as they moved or stayed. Thus Christ abides, the inhabitant of the 
    faithful heart. At home, abroad, in solitude, in work, indwelling Deity 
    gives dignity and peace. The poles might not be taken out. They kept their 
    place in readiness for instant movement. It is true that Christ never 
    finally deserts His own who once have welcomed Him. But let them watch and 
    pray, and hold Him fast with clinging love and fervency of zeal. For <i>if 
    the world creeps in, and rival lusts are fondled</i>, His gracious smile 
    will cease to cheer, His precious presence will <i>seem</i> to vanish. Let 
    congregations, also, and churches fear. The poles give <i>warning, that 
    departure may be near. </i>The Gospel comes. It calls. It is not heeded. 
    What then? It passes on, and may be no more heard. The true Light has shone 
    on many a spot which now is dark as death's dark valley. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! let not the Ark thus speak to you in vain. 
    Receive it, prize it, and Obed-edom's blessings will enrich you. 'The Ark of 
    the Lord remained there with the family of Obed-edom for three months, and 
    the Lord blessed him and his entire household.' 2 Samuel 6:11</p>
<p align="justify">Enshrine it in your heart. Then all strongholds of sin, 
    like Jericho, will fall before it. The idols of <i>self-righteous forms</i> 
    will lie, like shattered Dagons, at its feet. And when you reach the stream 
    of Jordan, Christ, the true Ark, will lead you onward, and parting waters 
    will be your passage to the land of rest!</p>
