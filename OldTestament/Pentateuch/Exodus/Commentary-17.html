<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">THE TABERNACLE</font></b></font><font size="4">
</font></p>
<p align="justify">"Moreover you shall make the <b>Tabernacle</b>." Exodus 
    26:1</p>
<p align="justify">The worship of the living God was well known to Israel's 
    sons. They had raised altars to His name. The slaughtered victim and the 
    curling smoke had often declared acquaintance with the way of peace. In holy 
    rites, at many a bloodstained stone, their faith had used the ordered means. 
    But until they reached the base of Sinai, no stated house for stated service 
    had been reared. Here first the gracious word went forth, "I want the people 
    of Israel to build me<b> a sacred residence </b>where I can live among 
    them." Exodus 25:8. Here mercy planted the earliest symbol of God's constant 
    presence. Here earth received her eldest model of a consecrated sanctuary. 
    Happy the day throughout the camp when this Tent showed its new-born head. 
    What thrilling joy would beat in every heart? What anxious scrutiny would 
    scan each part! </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! draw near in spirit. Take your stand amid the 
    wondering crowd. Admire with them the progress of the work. First, a 
    measure-line is drawn. The length extends to forty-five feet—the breadth to 
    fifteen. Solid foundations then are placed. A belt of silver sockets is laid 
    down. Into this base the sides are fixed. These much exceed in preciousness. 
    They are composed of choicest wood, and clad in purest gold. Their height 
    ascends to fifteen feet. Especial care joins the corners together. And bars 
    of gold stretch out their binding arms, to make the walls secure. Five 
    shining pillars guard the eastern entrance. Rich drapery thence hangs. Such 
    is the <i>outward</i> frame. </p>
<p align="justify">Four pillars rise within, to separate <i>an inner chamber</i>. 
    These pillars hold a veil of costly work, to screen the Holiest from all 
    view. This room is fifteen feet in each extent. The breadth, the length, the 
    height, are one in uniform dimension. The house thus shaped is covered by 
    four curtains. The first is wrought with brilliant hues, and sparkles with 
    cherubic forms. A starry canopy thus vaults the roof. Next, a stronger skin 
    of red is spread. The outward garment is a coarse sheet of rough material. 
    This last completes the structure. Such is the front which meets the eye.
    </p>
<p align="justify">But mark, God Himself gave this gracious blessing. He 
    drew the plan. He gave the model. He inspired the skill. Each part, then, is 
    His wisdom. Each has a Gospel-tongue. Each heard aright reveals that 'Christ 
    is All.' This is not fancy's dream. It is the Spirit's clear-toned lesson. 
    He cries to all the family of faith—Look to the Tabernacle, and behold your 
    Lord. There is a pulpit from which no voice is heard but His. It is the 
    Bible. Its pages teach, 'Here is the main point: Our High Priest sat down in 
    the place of highest honor in heaven, at God's right hand. There he 
    ministers in the sacred tent, the true place of worship that was built by 
    the Lord and not by human hands.' Hebrews 8:1-2</p>
<p align="justify">This <i>earthly</i> Tabernacle, then, is but a sketch of 
    that gorgeous frame of Christ, which God, the Holy Spirit, wrought and 
    planted in this earth. Again, like testimony sounds: 'So Christ has now 
    become the High Priest over all the good things that have come. He has 
    entered that great, perfect sanctuary in heaven, not made by human hands and 
    not part of this created world.' Hebrews 9:11. The word is plain. The <i>
    earthly</i> Tabernacle points to a <i>spiritual</i> Tabernacle, which human 
    hands produce not, which human skill erects not, which human imperfection 
    taints not. What can this be but Christ in the flesh, but not of flesh? 
    Surely all doubts take wing. Divine authority decides the fact. Christ is 
    discerned, the end and excellence of the predictive house. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! pursue the clue thus found—and steep your soul in 
    depths of heaven-born truth. View through this glass the various parts.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Bright silver forms the base</p></b>. Where does this wealth 
    come from? By whom and with what purpose is it given? It is the ransom-price 
    of souls. Each numbered child of Israel brought a redemption-sum. It was a 
    silver coin. Wealth might not add, nor poverty subtract. This holy tax 
    supplied the base. My soul, what lessons cluster here! We see how sin 
    destroys, how grace redeems. Our liberty is gone, our life is lost. A tyrant 
    claims us. Justice demands its dues. But Jesus is laid low. The earth drinks 
    in His blood. His merits are our ransom-price. His death is ransom paid. The 
    Father testifies content—'Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have 
    found a ransom.' The <b>sockets</b> add the echo of their proof. The 
    Gospel-structure rests on a ransom. Remove it, and redemption falls. Without 
    a price, the Savior has no saved ones. But the foundation is most sure. The 
    Tabernacle firmly stands. Our Gospel-sockets never can be moved. 
<p align="justify">Next mark what splendid <b>boards</b> are tightly 
    fastened to these pure supports. Two substances are here combined. They show 
    a double nature—and thus proclaim the Incarnate God. Yes! Christ is here in 
    Deity's transcendent blaze, in manhood's spotless purity. O my soul, how 
    great, how perfectly fit is your redeeming Lord! All power is His to rescue 
    and to satisfy, for what can resist the boundless might of God? He is 
    entirely fit to take your place. He bears your flesh. He wears your form. 
    This is the fact which wins for Him salvation's throne. This is the truth on 
    which faith lives and joys and dies and soars to glory. Hence, types 
    prefigure it, and prophets sing it, and Gospel narrative records it. </p>
<p align="justify">Hence, at each step of Jesus' life, the Spirit points, 
    Behold the <i>man</i>—Behold the <i>God!</i> A <i>babe</i> is cradled in a 
    manger-bed, while wondering angels announce 'Christ the <i>Lord</i>.' A 
    lowly abode scarcely shelters the young child; while a special STAR brings 
    distant sages to His feet. He sleeps as weary man; He arises as the mighty 
    God, and stills the raging storm. He sits a worn-out traveler by the well, 
    but speaks eternal life to a dead sinner's soul. He weeps in human sympathy 
    at the grave but utters the sovereign mandate, 'Lazarus, come forth.' He 
    moves about as lowliest of our lowly race but at His word, mute sing, lame 
    leap, blind see, deaf hear, the weeping smile, each malady departs, and 
    homes of anguish brighten with delight!</p>
<p align="justify">As <i>dying worm</i>, He hangs upon the cross—as <i>Lord 
    of life</i> <i>and glory</i>, He snatches a poor lost one from the jaws of 
    hell. As a weak corpse, the tomb receives Him. As conqueror of the grave, He 
    strides forth in the strength of God. As friend, He gives last counsels to 
    His friends—as God He mounts to heaven's high throne. Thus Scripture labors 
    to fix the deep truth, that <i>a God-man redeems us! </i>O my soul, grasp 
    tight the glad tidings. In face of sin and guilt and death and hell and 
    judgment, cry out and shout, Christ is my All, for He is God—Christ is my 
    All, for He is God in my own form. His manhood qualifies. His Godhead gives 
    Him power. He is a perfect Savior!</p>
<p align="justify">Look now upon the <b>wood co-joined with gold</b>, and 
    see how the bright Tabernacle's wall reflects this Gospel of God's grace. 
    All skill was used to tighten and to brace the work. The corners were most 
    carefully made fast. Five binding bars cemented the whole frame. Thus it was 
    compact in solidity. This shows our Jesus as <i>redemption's Samson.</i> 
    What arms of might are needed for His task! <i>Hell's gates</i> are strong; 
    they must be borne away. <i>Heaven's portals</i> move not at a slender 
    touch—they must be opened wide. The blows of Satan have terrific force—they 
    must be all sustained. The weight of one least sin would crush a million 
    worlds—all must be carried far from the sight of God. The cares and needs of 
    the redeemed are burdens of unmeasured mass. Beneath this load, Christ 
    stands unshaken as these mystic walls. Reader! you may confide in Him. He 
    cannot collapse. Omnipotence cements His skill. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The Tent was divided.</p></b> There was a lower and a second 
    room. Faith hence is taught that <i>there are diverse grades in the 
    knowledge of the Lord. </i>They who see much may yet see more. They who dive 
    deep may still go deeper. They who soar high find higher heights. My soul, 
    let not your wings hang down. Let each moment be an onward flight. The veil 
    will soon be passed, and heaven display <i>full glories</i> to your view.
    
<p align="justify">The entrance-curtain hangs from five pillars. Only four 
    hold the inner veil. The lessening number seems to teach that opening space 
    expands to welcome the advancing saint. If any find the first gate to be 
    strait, let them press on. Each progress leaves some hindrance behind. <i>
    The end of holy conflict and unflinching faith is wide admission to the 
    courts of heaven.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, the <b>coverings</b> have a voice to speak to us. 
    Spirit of Truth, speak by them to our hearts. The <u>first</u> has no 
    inviting look. Its color shines not. Its texture is CRUDE. Thus to the 
    worldling, Jesus shows no charms. The eye which seeks some tinsel-glitter 
    will turn away in scorn. But there is much folly and peril here. Offence at 
    the meek Savior's lowly appearance may be a rapid downfall into hell's worst 
    depths. But while faith gazes, the features change. </p>
<p align="justify">The <u>second</u> covering is RED. The sign is not 
    ambiguous. It testifies of blood. He who would save must die. From wounded 
    sides and pierced hands a crimson stream must flow. This cries for pardon. 
    This atones for guilt. This pays all debts. True Gospel-hope is a rich 
    treasure from a blood-stained field. Pure Gospel-light shines from behind a 
    blood-red cloud. </p>
<p align="justify">Beneath the red a SNOW-WHITE pure sheet appears. This 
    sign, also, is a Bible-leaf. We read the spotless purity which shone in 
    Christ. He bears man's flesh without one stain of sin. We see, also, the 
    cleansing power of His blood. All washed therein are whiter than the 
    snow-clad hills.</p>
<p align="justify">But look again. The tent now sparkles in variety of hues. 
    The dazzling forms of shining cherubim adorn it. My soul, look onward to the 
    day when Christ your Lord shall come. All faithful eyes shall see Him, fair 
    in salvation's beauty, bright in salvation's glory, crowned with salvation's 
    crown, praised with salvation's hymns. Reader! in that day will you shout 
    and sing? </p>
<p align="justify">We cannot leave the Tent, and not observe the <b>absence 
    of a floor. </b>Solemn the warning! Nothing which pictures Christ may lie 
    beneath heedless feet. No paschal blood was wasted on the threshold. No type 
    of Christ is trodden down. Let the poor scoffer fear. The wages of their 
    contempt are paid in hell. </p>
<p align="justify">Another lesson craves our hearing. <b>No door is closed</b>. 
    All day, all night, the Tabernacle stands open. No bolts, no bars obstruct. 
    It seems to invite <i>approach</i>. Such is the Savior with His outstretched 
    arms, calling poor sinners to His very heart. The lips of ever-willing love 
    are ever open. Why will you perish? Come to Me. </p>
<p align="justify">The Tent was a token of <b>a present God.</b> There He 
    was pledged to commune with His sons—to show His face—to hear their cry—so 
    in Christ Jesus heaven meets earth, and earth ascends to heaven. The Father 
    comes and clasps the guilty to His arms. The guilty come and find a home in 
    God. Eternal smiles chase fears away, and reconciliation claps her hands. 
    The sinner asks, the Father gives. The Father gives, the sinner asks yet 
    more. And more bestowed calls forth the louder praise. Here mercy sings, and 
    grace exults, and happy concord reigns, and love waves high an olive-branch 
    of peace. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! Do not leave these humble lines until you find 
    that Christ, the Tabernacle, makes you thus one with God forever!</p>
