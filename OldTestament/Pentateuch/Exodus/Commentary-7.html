<p align="justify">by Henry Law<br/> </p>
<p align="justify">"I am the Lord who <b>heals</b> you." Exodus 15:26 </p>
<p align="justify">These words first cheered the heart of Moses. But they 
    are the common heritage of the Church of God. This day they reach our ears. 
    May they bring healing on their wings! </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! in thought survey the porches of <i>Bethesda's 
    pool.</i> Can earth present a sight of deeper woe? Malady makes every form 
    its prey. Each sound is burdened with a sufferer's groan. The heart is hard 
    which can repress the sigh, Oh! that these pains might end! But vain may be 
    the wish. For <i>human ailment often baffles human skill.</i> It knows no 
    certain cure. Are you prepared to see your own case in those cells? Transfer 
    the sickness from the <i>body</i> to the <i>soul</i>, and then your couch is 
    surely spread among these sufferers. <i><b>Sin</b> makes this world a 
    universal hospital. It drives earth's millions into one Bethesda. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Reader! do you sigh here, Oh! that these deeper pains 
    might end! This speedily may be. There is <i>one sure relief.</i> <b>Jesus</b> 
    stands near, a spiritual Healer, mighty to cause the blind to see, the deaf 
    to hear, the lame to walk, the leprous to be clean, and every wound to 
    close. <i>No case exceeds His healing power! </i>These lines are written, 
    that <i>sin-diseased souls</i> may now be led to drink at this truth's 
    fount. </p>
<p align="justify">Holy Spirit! grant Your aid. Show that the <i>malady</i> 
    of sin abounds throughout man's tribes. Show that all <i>remedy</i> much 
    more abounds in Christ. The cure will be more prized, if first we mark the 
    many features of our deep disease. Let us remove the mask, then, and behold 
    the multiform malignity of this fiend—sin. Sin is a universal taint. No 
    child of man escapes it. We tread this earth diverse in climate, in station, 
    in mental power, in mold of temper, and in frame of body. But all who 
    breathe life's breath are spotted with this plague. Adam's foul fall infused 
    the evil poison into nature's veins. Each parent sows this seed. No 
    offspring is infection-free. Cain was conceived in sin. The last babe must 
    be corruption's heir. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! your cradle may have been wealth's downy pillow, 
    or poverty's harsh provisions. You may have intellect to command a gazing 
    world's applause, or you may crawl unknown to an unknown grave. In these 
    externals no two may be the same. But all are one in oneness of distempered 
    soul. Each mother's infant is transgression's child. Sin is an all-spoiling 
    evil. It is a weed which overruns the garden. It stains all men, and every 
    part in each. </p>
<p align="justify">It enters to <b>pervade</b>. Its root is in the soul. 
    Eden saw it planted there. But its fibers and its branches spread through 
    each faculty of mind and body. See how it masters the whole inner frame. The 
    heart first sickens. This becomes harder than the nether millstone, the nest 
    of every unclean bird, the den of lust's vile brood. The head soon grows 
    distempered. Hence error and ignorance expel right judgment. The world is 
    worshiped as a rightful lord. Hell is derided as some weak fable. Repentance 
    is reserved for dying moments. The glorious Word is scorned as the 
    bewildered page in which the brain-sick and fanatic glean delusions. The eye 
    is blind to see the 'chief among ten thousand, the altogether lovely One.' 
    The ear hears nothing but discord in the Gospel-note. The palate has no 
    relish of healthful food. The lips, the mouth, the throat, the tongue, are 
    festered with contaminating sores. Alas! how many words go forth to spread 
    contagion and to scatter death. Thus the disease runs wildly through the 
    whole man</p>
<p align="justify">Sin is the union of all spiritual maladies in one 
    compacted mass. It is no solitary evil. It comes in troops, in flocks, in 
    swarms. In our frames one member may be weak, the others strong. But in this 
    hospital, all sufferings at once make every sufferer their prey. One ailment 
    is all ailments. One part infected leaves no part in health. Sin never 
    yields to earth-born cure. All trials have been tried. But failure is the 
    end of each. Self has ransacked the stores of <i>self</i>. Wounds have been 
    washed with tears, and bound with bands of a strict moral life. The cup of 
    penance and of rigid religious vows has often been drunk with eager lip. But 
    remedy is not in these. A feather cannot halt the fast-rushing stream. A 
    little pruning will not kill the branch. Oil will not quench a flame. </p>
<p align="justify">Shall then the sin-sick fly to religious forms and 
    ceremonies and hallowed rites? Alas! their anguish lies too deep for 
    superficial cure. Uplifted hands and bended knees, and all the sacredness of 
    sacred things, have in themselves <i>no virtue to choke evil's fount!</i> 
    The love of holy service is a <i>sign</i> of health. But it cannot <i>bestow</i> 
    health. Restored cripples leap and walk and praise as <i>evidence</i> of 
    strength, but not to gain it. No human medicines give soul-health. </p>
<p align="justify">Sin's end is endless death. Its course is sure. The 
    falling stone rolls downward to the lowest depths. The stream flows on until 
    the ocean's bed is reached. Thus <i>sin's strong bias rushes to the pit of 
    hell. Oh! mark those writhing sufferers in the burning lake! </i>Ask them 
    what brought them to their woe. One wild shriek answers, Sin! Sin uncured, 
    unchecked. Ah! sinner, your inward malady seems little now. What will it 
    prove, hereafter? Its present touch gives little pain, but it has <i>iron 
    arms.</i> The embrace seems gentle now. But it will tighten into 
    ever-tightening torture. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">This sketch is dark. The reality is darker far. </p></i>But 
    why are these black colors laid? The purpose is, to form a background for 
    the Scripture-light. The malady's malignity is drawn to show that one 
    Physician alone can avail. Look now toward the chambers of the Gospel-feast. 
    The horizon gleams with rays. The Sun of Righteousness appears; and there is 
    'healing in his wings.' Amid Bethesda's crowded seats, the blessed Jesus 
    stood, omnipotent to heal. Amid the soul-sick, He as surely stands with like 
    omnipotence. He comes, and His voice is, 'I am the Lord who heals you.' 
    Behold His outstretched hands. They bear a perfect remedy. He takes away 
    sin's poison, and it cannot kill. He soothes its wounds, and they can no 
    more pain. He cuts its roots, and they can no more spread. Come, hear these 
    tidings from His Word of Truth. 
<p align="justify">Your first complaint is, that your sickness is the seed 
    of everlasting death. True! It is dragging you with rapid force towards a 
    gaping grave!<i> But Jesus takes your sins and nails them to His cross!</i> 
    Then in His death they die. Then in His wounds they disappear. He washes you 
    with His heart's blood. He bathes you in this precious stream. And never, 
    never are your sins found again. Thus condemnation is forever gone. </p>
<p align="justify">Is not that sickness healed which has no power to harm? 
    Thus Jesus is the sinner's Healer. He brings in pardon. Pardon changes 
    malady to health, because it changes death to life. Believer, you are thus 
    relieved. Let your song ever be, He forgives all my iniquities—and so He 
    heals all my diseases.</p>
<p align="justify">But you still sigh that, though future punishment is 
    gone, yet present pain still gnaws. The scar may cause pain, which is not 
    unto death. You are a guilt-touched wretch. And sense of guilt is an 
    unceasing ache. Truly these tears are bitter. But in Jesus there is solace 
    for these pangs. No ease can come, but by the Spirit's hand. He only takes 
    it from the Savior's blood. But He brings soothing virtue thence and lulls 
    the accusing conscience into rest. He can present, as an assuaging cup, the 
    tender promise, 'I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their 
    sin no more.' He can apply the calming argument—Why should memory dwell 
    sobbingly on what God casts behind His back forever? He can teach, that <i>a 
    head crowned with pardon's crown should not hang down. </i>Thus Jesus 
    fulfils the word; He gives 'unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for 
    mourning.' Thus sin is cured because its pain is soothed. Believer, will you 
    not confess it? He 'is sent to heal the broken-hearted'? </p>
<p align="justify">But you may add, that more is needed to restore full 
    health. <i>You mourn that the vile roots lie deep within. </i>No child of 
    God is unconscious of the lurking evil. While the flesh is flesh, it is the 
    hot-bed of corruption. <b>But Jesus can subdue the plague!</b> By 
    sanctifying grace He can create a clean heart and renew a right spirit. He 
    can implant a counteracting principle of godly love. He can give strength to 
    fight the good fight of faith, to run with patience in pure paths, and to 
    find no delight but in God's will.<i> O my soul, cling then to the cross! In 
    its atmosphere evil withers, and holiness grows firm! </i></p>

<p align="justify">Thus Jesus cures all sin. It can no more condemn nor vex 
    nor rule. They walk in healthy peace with God, in healthy peace within, in 
    healthy paths of holy life, whose hearts have heard, 'I am the Lord that 
    heals you.' </p>
<p align="justify">Perhaps you still fear, lest <i>the extreme malignity of 
    your case</i> should baffle all this skill. It would be so, except the 
    Healer were Jehovah-Jesus. But mark. His title shivers all such doubts. He 
    cries 'I am the Lord who heals you.' <i>Almightiness is the property of this 
    arm!</i> He wills, and it is done. He works, and none can thwart. If all the 
    maladies of all the sufferers in earth and hell formed one huge sickness 
    centering on your soul, let Christ the Lord but speak, and perfect is your 
    cure!</p>
<p align="justify">Are you distressed, lest <i>long lying on sin's couch</i> 
    should bar against you every door of hope? Consider well, <b>the Healer</b>. 
    At Bethesda's pool he singles out the wretchedness of him who 'had been now
    <i>a long time</i> in that case.' <i>Extremity of misery</i> was a melting 
    plea to Jesus. His heart is still the same. Take courage. If, from the day 
    of Adam's fall, your malady had rolled onward as a swelling stream, His 
    tender love could turn it all to health!</p>
<p align="justify">Does conscience groan beneath the load of prominent 
    provocations? You may have turned from many a gracious call. This very case 
    is met by mercy's sweet voice. Read your sure welcome in the page of life. 
    'I was angry and punished these greedy people. I withdrew myself from them, 
    but <i>they went right on sinning</i>. I have seen what they do, but<i> I 
    will heal them anyway!</i> I will lead them and comfort those who mourn.' 
    Isaiah 57:17-18</p>
<p align="justify">You reply, that <i>the hand of faith alone can take the 
    remedy.</i> But your faith so trembles that it scarcely lives. Behold the <i>
    timid woman</i> of the Gospel. With down-cast eye, with tottering step, she 
    comes, and instantly the touch was life. Do but the same—and you will hear, 
    'Your faith has made you whole; go in peace.' </p>
<p align="justify">Shall all this earnest pleading fail? It only remains, 
    then, to pray again that the all-conquering Spirit would make you willing to 
    be among the Healer's healed ones<i>. Oh! look to Jesus's cross. </i>It was 
    ordained of old. It was erected on Calvary. It is uplifted in the Gospel. It 
    is magnified in every faithful pulpit. But why? Surely that miseries may 
    end, and spiritual diseases may be cured! <i>On it the Heavenly Healer dies 
    Himself, that His death may be the death of sin!</i> On it He <i>bleeds</i>, 
    that His blood may drop health. On it He <i>suffers</i> wounds, that the 
    wounded may be whole. On it He gives His body to most painful pains, that 
    ease may be His people's portion. On it He lays down His life, that they may 
    have life. </p>
<p align="justify">And now He cries, Come, without money, without price. 
    Come, leave your sickness, and return with health! Will you not join the 
    blessed company, who sing in renewed strength, 'With His stripes we are 
    healed'? Will you not enter the land in which no inhabitant mourns, 'I am 
    sick—the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity'?</p>
