</font></p>
<p align="justify">"Take unto you Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, 
    from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto Me, in the <b>
    Priest's</b> office." Exodus 28:1</p>
<p align="justify">No pencil's art can represent the sun. No image can 
    portray Christ's riches. He leaves all boundaries behind. But still His 
    knowledge is the soul's choice food. It is the joy of joys, it is the life 
    of life. The tabernacle stood to be the witness of His truth. The Altar was 
    upraised, the victims died, the incense curled, the lamps were lighted, the 
    Bread of the Presence was presented, to paint in varied ways <b>His varied 
    worth.</b> These many types taught much. But this full cluster is not a full 
    picture. A living office, therefore, receives birth. An active order is now 
    added. The Priest appears, to be an ever-moving type of redeeming work. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! we live in times when erring lips misrepresent 
    our Lord. But err we cannot, when we behold Him in the Priestly ordinance. 
    Our Priest is not on earth. The Spirit witnesses, 'We have a great 
    High-priest, who has passed into the heavens.' Who can this be but Christ? 
    Thus Christ is the Priest who ministers for us. Ignorance makes many 
    priests. Faith knows but one. </p>
<p align="justify">First, mark the call. It is most clear. No human mind 
    selects <b>THE PRIEST</b>. No <i>self-called</i> man usurps the work. The 
    service is <i>ordained by God. </i>The sacred order has a door which none 
    can pass but by divine command. The heavenly will thus speaks—'Take unto you 
    Aaron your brother, and his sons with him.' The purporse is distinct: 'No 
    man takes this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was 
    Aaron.' In Christ the fulfillment is found. 'That is why Christ did not 
    exalt himself to become High Priest. No, he was chosen by God.'</p>
<p align="justify">There is a volume of instruction here. Christ swiftly 
    flies on outstretched wings of love. But all the flight, and all the course 
    are in <i>the path which God marked out. </i>The Father <i>chooses</i> and 
    the Father <i>sends</i>. The Son obeys and hastens to the work. Hence all 
    poor sinners may repose, without one fear, on Christ. He comes commissioned 
    to discharge a settled service. He saves according to <i>decree</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">The office is protected by another fence. <i>None can 
    pass through who have <b>defect</b>. </i>The mandate is stern. All who draw 
    near must show completeness in complete perfection. Thus says the Lord, 
    'Whoever he be of your seed in their generations that has any blemish, let 
    him not approach to offer the bread of his God.' This leads us to explore <i>
    the all-surpassing <b>worthiness</b> of Christ. </i>He is beauty in its 
    full-blown blaze, and grace in its most graceful form. He is as bright as 
    God is bright. He is as perfect as God is perfect. Righteousness is His 
    belt. Glory is His robe. The very heavens are unclean beside Him. <i>Reader! 
    keep Jesus always in your sight. The world in all its tinsel-show will then 
    no more be seen.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">This admiration has <b>transforming power</b>. Faith 
    looks, and as it looks, an inward likeness to Jesus grows. We 'are changed 
    into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.' 
    He is the holiest man who sees by faith the most of Christ. Let Christ, 
    then, take the Priesthood for His people. He has full worthiness. No sin 
    ever stained Him. </p>
<p align="justify">Through this vestibule, we may press on to view <b>THE 
    PRIESTLY WORK</b> itself. It is a tree of many branches. The main are thus 
    described—'Every High-priest taken from among men is ordained for men in 
    things pertaining to God, that he may <i>offer both gifts and sacrifices for 
    sins.'</i> At the altar the chief functions were discharged. There is an 
    altar, then, at which Jesus served. Calvary shows it. Let faith, with open 
    and adoring eye, survey that scene.<i> It gladdens heaven and affrights all 
    hell. </i>It should be meditation's happiest seat. </p>
<p align="justify">The promised Lamb appears. The victim chosen before time 
    began, the theme of prophet's song, the crown of patriarchal hope, the jewel 
    in each typifying casket, is now led forth. It is the God-man Jesus, 
    Jehovah's fellow, creation's author, the Lord of all things, the Prince of 
    life. He comes to die, that He may save; to bleed, that He may make 
    atonement; to lay down life, that sin may be destroyed. An altar is 
    prepared. <i>It is sufficient for the mighty load. Its pillars are the 
    strength of Deity.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">But <i>what Priest</i> leads this Lamb and binds Him to 
    the Altar? The Priest is <i>Jesus</i>. He teaches this when speaking of His 
    life. He says, 'No man takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.' The 
    Spirit bids us mark the Sacrificer's hand, when He adds, He 'through the 
    eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God.' Jesus well knew that 
    nothing but His blood could satisfy the holiness of God, and He did not 
    withhold it. He loved to save, and therefore loved to die. He joyed to do 
    His Father's will, and therefore joyed to give Himself. The language of the 
    cross is loud and clear. All that <i>my Father's glory</i> asks—all that <i>
    My people's need</i> requires—I willingly present. I gladly die to <i>honor 
    God and bring redemption to My flock. </i>My soul, turn often to this 
    self-sacrificing act. Do you seek proof that He desires your pardon? Behold 
    it in His arm stretched out to give Himself. You must be spared. He will not 
    spare Himself. </p>
<p align="justify">But when the blood was shed, the Priestly work was not 
    concluded. On the most solemn day of Israel's year, the High-priest passed 
    within the veil. He stood before the mercy-seat. But not without the proof 
    of sacrifice enacted. He brought the blood. He <i>sprinkled it before the 
    ark.</i> Is Jesus here? What is the Spirit's comment. 'By His own blood, He 
    entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for 
    us.' We thus gain vision of the courts above. Our eyes are opened to a 
    wondrous sight. We see our Jesus transacting still the priestly functions.
    </p>
<p align="justify">My soul, be much in spirit, and by faith, in heaven. It 
    is a sin, a shame, a folly, and a loss, to live apart from Him who ever 
    lives for you. Abide by Jesus. He is never absent from the Father's side. He 
    ever shows His soul-redeeming blood. It has an eloquence which must prevail. 
    It has a plea which no accusing rage can answer. It is full price for all 
    the ransomed race. It fills the scales which justice brings. It gives to 
    truth its every demand. It silences the Law's stern curse. It claims all 
    pardon, and all sins are pardoned. What now can Satan say? The High-priest 
    shows the blood. All charge is answered, all guilt removed, the blood-bought 
    are absolved. </p>
<p align="justify">The High-priest bears a <b>censer</b>, also. From it a 
    cloud of rising incense covers all the mercy-seat. Thus Jesus fills the 
    heavens with fragrance. His precious intercession sheds precious aromas 
    round. He pleads that all His work on earth is done. He spreads His wounded 
    hands. He shows His wounded side. He proves that every term of the vast 
    covenant of grace is kept, that sin is punished, and His people free. Oh! 
    the rich savor of such rich pleas! All attributes take up the shout, 'Who 
    shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?' </p>
<p align="justify">The High-priest exercised another function. It was his 
    happy province to strew blessings round. 'Instruct Aaron and his sons to <i>
    bless the people</i> of Israel with this special blessing.' Jesus is called 
    to be a blessing Lord. Mark His departing act—'He led them out as far as to 
    Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.' And now He lives in 
    heaven a blessing-life, and opens there His blessing-hands, and utters there 
    His blessing-voice, and displays there His blessing-smile. </p>
<p align="justify">Poor sinners feel their sin. They see the Savior. They 
    flee to wash in His all-cleansing blood. They hide beneath His glorious 
    righteousness. This is a blessing. They burst the bonds of sin and Satan; 
    they love the sacred feasts of Bible-truth and holy ordinances. This is a 
    blessing. They rejoice with joy unspeakable; they trample on the world, and 
    all its snares, and all its baits. They see hell vanquished, heaven their 
    home, saints their brethren, angels their ministering guardians, Jesus their 
    all. This is a blessing! Life is theirs; Death is theirs; Christ is theirs; 
    Heaven is theirs; Glory is theirs; Eternity is theirs. This is a blessing! 
    All these streams flow down from Jesus our High-priest, who ever lives to 
    execute this blessing work. </p>
<p align="justify">It is the Spirit's solemn will that we should know and 
    use this Great High-priest. Hence, by repeated contrasts, He magnifies His 
    worth. This teaching bids us give ear. Let us advance, then, and pluck some 
    fruit from these luxuriant boughs.</p>
<p align="justify">"There were many priests under the old system. When one 
    priest died, another had to take his place. But Jesus remains a priest 
    forever; his priesthood will never end." Hebrews 7:23-24. The priests who 
    ministered to Israel's sons were only men. Dust was their substance and to 
    dust they soon returned. Death soon removed them from their post. Our Great 
    High-priest is very God. His life is immortality. Eternity is His day. No 
    time can bring decay to Him. No age makes His seat void. So long as 
    mediating work remains, His mediating office lives. </p>
<p align="justify">"He does not need to offer sacrifices every day like the 
    other high priests. They did this for their own sins first and then for the 
    sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he sacrificed 
    himself on the cross." Hebrews 7:27. The high priests were of corruption's 
    seed. Sin cleaved to their most holy service. Their very best was vile and 
    black. They must make offerings for themselves. They needed blood to wash 
    away their guilt. Jesus is pure as God is pure. He breathed no atmosphere 
    but perfect holiness. Poor sinners have a sinless Priest in Him. </p>
<p align="justify">"But only the high priest goes into the Most Holy Place, 
    and only once a year, and always with blood, which he offers to God to cover 
    his own sins and the sins the people have committed in ignorance." Hebrews 
    9:7. The high priests passed the veil but once in every year. He entered 
    heaven as His own abode. There, day and night He pleads, and will present 
    incessant pleas, until the last saint be safely gathered home. </p>
<p align="justify">"Once for all time he took blood into that Most Holy 
    Place, but not the blood of goats and calves. He took his own blood, and 
    with it he secured our salvation forever." Hebrews 9:12. The high priests' 
    victims were but creatures of this lower world. The blood was only blood of 
    beasts. It had no saving power. It could not touch transgression's infinite 
    pollution. Jesus presents Himself to God. He brings the very blood of God. 
    All worlds are worthless when compared to this. Believer, this is your full 
    salvation. </p>
<p align="justify">"Under the old covenant, the priest stands before the 
    altar day after day, offering sacrifices that can never take away sins. But 
    our High Priest offered himself to God as one sacrifice for sins, good for 
    all time. Then he sat down at the place of highest honor at God's right 
    hand." Hebrews 10:11-12. The high priests offered often. The victims died, 
    the altars blazed, the incense burned from year to year, from day to day. 
    Jesus presents one victim once. His death once died, His life once given, 
    His blood once shed, fully and forever washed out His people's sins, 
    redeemed His people's lives, and saved His people's souls. His one surrender 
    of Himself as the atoning Lamb, forever quenched all wrath, forever took 
    away all curse, forever satisfied all claims, forever saved the family of 
    faith, forever opened heaven, forever vanquished hell. To add to infinite 
    perfection is impossible. Woe be to them who think such offering incomplete!
    </p>
<p align="justify">The Spirit cries, 'fix your thoughts on Jesus, the 
    apostle and high priest whom we confess.' Hebrews 3:1. Reader! obey. Make 
    Him the center of your every thought, the home of your adoring mind, the 
    first, the last of meditation's joys. Christ's Priesthood is a theme which 
    time cannot exhaust. It is a theme for which eternity is short!</p>
