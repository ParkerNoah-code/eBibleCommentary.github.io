<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>MARAH</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">When they came to <b>Marah</b>, they could not drink its 
    water because it was <b>bitter</b>. (That is why the place is called Marah.) 
    So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, "What are we to drink?" Then 
    Moses cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a piece of wood. He 
    threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There the Lord made a 
    decree and a law for them, and there he tested them. Exodus 15:23-25</p>
<p align="justify">Perhaps joy's bright flame was never brighter than in 
    Israel's sons, when they moved onwards from <i>the marvels of the sea.</i> 
    Slavery's chain was wholly broken. Their foes lay prostrate. The Lord was 
    for them. The Lord was with them. What more could be desired? Can it be, 
    that a people thus guarded, and thus guided, shall find trouble? Where the 
    Lord precedes, can the path be other than the sunny slope of unalloyed 
    delight? True it is, that <i>heavenly leading is always a right way. </i>But 
    true it is, that <i>the right way may be sharp with thorns, and rough with 
    difficulties, and beset with storms.</i> Paul's voyage was ordered, but he 
    was sorely tossed, and barely reached the shore. </p>
<p align="justify">This truth is on the forefront of Israel's truth-teaching 
    story. 'They went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.' Here 
    was <i>a sudden check to hope's high tide. </i>They then advanced to Marah. 
    Water there flowed. It was, however, but a <i>mocking</i> stream. The taste 
    was bitter, and they could not drink. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! behold <b>two stages in the Christian journey</b>. 
    A grievous need occurs. A grievous disappointment presses in its rear. But 
    let not such things move you, nor excite surprise. Are you not called to be 
    as a richly-laden tree? Your every branch must bend with fruits of faith and 
    hope and patience. But <i>faith thrives most in trouble's soil.</i> Hope's 
    note is sweetest in the tempest's roar. Patience gains strength beneath the 
    cross's weight. The diamond sparkles because the file is rough. Trials are 
    needful, or they would not be. Trials are needful, therefore they abound. 
    They walk as sisters beside goodness and mercy. They attend the believer, as 
    appointed guards to heaven's gate. No saint sinks in these wholesome waves. 
    But many a thoughtless soul sleeps fatally, because <i>the downy pillow</i> 
    is not shaken. Learn, then, from Marah, to <i>expect some bitter draught.</i>
</p>
<p align="justify">Next, Marah withdraws a veil, and we can <b>trace the 
    line between a graceless and a gracious heart.</b> The multitude turns <i>
    from</i> God. Moses flees <i>to</i> Him. One looks to <i>earth</i> and 
    frets. The other looks <i>above</i> and hopes. Believer, let me ask you, why 
    is a <i>throne of grace</i> so near? Why have you open access to it? It is, 
    that burdens may not crush you. It is, that fears may die as soon as 
    born—that doubts may wither as a blighted bud. Mercy and grace are always 
    strewed in rich abundance round it. Faith may take empty vessels and fill 
    them until they overflow. The case of Moses teaches this. He knocks. The 
    door flies open. A ready ear hears. A ready hand supplies. The people's hard 
    and thankless thoughts present no bar. A faithful servant cries. A loving 
    Father grants. 'The Lord showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the 
    waters, the waters were made sweet.' </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! learn next, that <b>it is the Lord's wisdom to 
    give relief in the use of means.</b> He whose word called all things out of 
    nothing could in one moment have caused healthful springs to bubble forth. 
    But no. A <i>remedy</i> is announced. Faith must trust. Obedience must 
    comply. Diligence must work. Effort must be up and doing. The poisoned 
    Israelites must <i>look</i> to the uplifted pole. The leprous Naaman must <i>
    wash</i> in Jordan seven times. The perishing sinner must <i>flee</i> to the 
    crucified Jesus. The needy saint must <i>hasten</i> to the mercy-seat.<i> 
    Sloth's couch is at the gate of hell.</i> Activities and energies scale 
    heaven. Striving enters the strait gate. The fighting warrior receives the 
    prize. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! you are thus prepared to hear, that in following 
    Jesus, <i>your pilgrim-steps will often reach a bitter well.</i> But murmur 
    not. At every Marah there is <b>a tree</b> whose leaves drop sweetness and 
    whose taste is balm. But bear in mind, the eye of faith alone can see it—the 
    hand of faith alone can touch it. </p>
<p align="justify">Holy Spirit of the living God, we look to You. Increase 
    our faith. Help us to discern, help us to apply the remedy which grace 
    provides. Shine on this lowly effort to commend the sweetness of the 'plant 
    of renown.' May all who read experience its healing worth!</p>
<p align="justify">Let us now take the cases most familiar to each pilgrim's 
    route. The bitterest Marah is <b>bitterness of heart</b>. Each heaven-bound 
    traveler well knows this spot. The downcast Heman pitched his tent beside 
    it. The prolific fountain where these waters spring is <i>an accusing 
    memory. </i>It causes all the past to live again. At its command a train of 
    buried sins appear in frightful freshness. They seem as young as the deeds 
    of yesterday, and hideous as the fiends of darkness. Each tells a tale which 
    cannot be denied. Each points to fiery death as the wages of its work. Each 
    shows an open prison-door. Each shakes the chain of ruin's cell. Well may 
    the stricken conscience quake. A stern voice, also, is heard, 'Can he who 
    sinned these sins have hope of life? Hell's jailer sneers, You will be mine 
    at last!' Who can drink this wormwood and survive?</p>
<p align="justify">But sweet relief is near. <b>Jesus, the tree of life</b>, 
    extends His bending branches to the anxious touch. Let the poor sinner 
    boldly shake it. A shower of healing leaves falls thick. Each yields the 
    honey of these honeyed tidings, 'I, even, I, am He, that blots out your 
    transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember your sins.' 'As far as 
    the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from 
    us.' When such relief is intermixed, the hateful and bitter taste goes away.
    <i>The virtue of a Savior's death extracts all poison from the cup.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Another Marah soon appears. <b>The believer is tempted to 
    seek refreshment from some inward source.</b> Then nothing meets him but a 
    brackish pool. What is man's heart, but the loathsome depths of the Dead 
    Sea? Adam's first sin defiled the fountain-head, and poisoned <i>springs</i> 
    give nothing but poisoned <i>streams</i>. Alas! what ceaseless currents of 
    corruptions force their way! Who has not cause to mourn with Paul, 'When I 
    would do good, evil is present with me'? <i>What raging passions, what 
    unruly tempers, what vile desires, what godless thoughts, what vain 
    conceits, pollute our cisterns with their noxious fluid! </i>The best of 
    fallen human nature is a miry ditch. </p>
<p align="justify">Is there no help? There is, in <b>the all-sweetening 
    tree! </b>Jesus presents His cure. Welcome the hallowing Savior, and grace 
    will distill from Him, to make each stagnant marsh a rivulet of health. He 
    can create a new heart, and renew a right spirit. He can sanctify wholly. He 
    can preserve pure and blameless. He can work in us both to will and to do of 
    His good pleasure. No Marah is so bitter, as the heart when Christ is 
    absent. No spring is so health-giving as the heart which Christ inhabits.
    </p>
<p align="justify">There is another Marah in <b>the world's biting hate</b>. 
    Enmity still separates the seed of the serpent and the seed of Christ. The 
    race of <i>Ishmael</i> still persecutes the child of promise. Motives are 
    mistaken. Words are distorted. Love for souls is reviled as airs of 
    superiority. To warn of danger seems to boast of self. Zeal for truth is 
    termed a party-strife. To depart from evil is pharisaic pride. This draught 
    is bitter to a tender spirit. But Christ can make it sweet. His arms of love 
    especially embrace His suffering witnesses. The music of His whispers drowns 
    the harsh thunder of the hardest threats. <i>Daniel</i> will tell you that 
    his sweetest night was in the lion's den. The <i>captive children</i> never 
    felt heaven nearer than in the chamber of the flames. <i>Paul</i> never sang 
    more joyously than in the inner prison cell. View, also, the glorious <i>
    martyrs</i> of our blessed church. They clasped the stake. They reveled in 
    the fires. Jesus was with them. They drank of the bitterest brook. But there 
    was no bitterness therein. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, perhaps you go heavily because of some <b>
    personal or domestic ordeal.</b> Few are unused to this affliction's gloom. 
    Is it your case, that nights are pain, and the returning light brings 
    langour? Does your frame totter as a reed? Is sickness your consuming guest? 
    This is your Marah. Bitter indeed it is to nature's palate. But I am bold to 
    uplift Jesus, as ready to make even this well all sweet. Failing strength is 
    not a sign of failing interest in a Savior's heart. Lazarus was loved. Yet 
    Lazarus was sick. Feeble may be the cry. But feeble cries are strong to move 
    our sympathizing Savior. His precious cordials will revive the drooping 
    spirit. Can He be present, and joy not sit beside Him? How many languid 
    smiles attest that<i> hours of pain are pledges of the painless heaven! </i></p>

<p align="justify">Perhaps <b>poverty</b> may touch your inventory with 
    withering hand? You once were full; you now are empty. This is your Marah. 
    Who will deny that the trial is most grievous? But experience in God's Word 
    and ways will prove, that this cup may run over in abundance of content. 
    There is no empty coffer to him who sings, 'The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall 
    not lack.' <i>Elijah</i> had no bursting barns. But heaven-sent messengers 
    supplied his earliest and his lattermost needs. <i>The faith which finds all 
    things in Christ extracts all gall from poverty.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Do you sit in <b>bereavement's</b> solitude? Is a 
    much-loved form no longer seen? Is a much-loved voice no longer heard? This 
    is your Marah. The cup is bitter. But Jesus's comforts blossom most, when 
    earthly flowers die. He lives, and lives to heal your weeping wounds. Ask 
    the mourning widow of Nain who changed her sorrow into joy. Ask the 
    disconsolate sisters of Bethany who dried their tears. The quick reply 
    is—Jesus. Has He ceased to pity? Can His tenderness grow hard? It cannot be. 
    His presence can fill, and more than fill each void. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! there is another Marah. The brink of it is at 
    your feet. Another step may reach the stream of <b>death</b>. The waters 
    here seem often to be very bitter. But Jesus has efficacy to make them 
    sweet. Approach, then, leaning on His arm, trusting in His cross, hidden in 
    His wounds, covered by His righteousness, and you will find the taste be all 
    joy.<i> The bitterness of death is sin unpardoned.</i> But the blood which 
    takes away all sin, takes out all poison. </p>
<p align="justify">When you have passed this brook, all Marahs are behind 
    you. But what is the ocean which now stretches onward and onward, without 
    limit, without shore? It is the heaven of God's pleasures. It is the ocean 
    of God's glory. The redeemed drink forever. And as they drink, the depth 
    seems deeper, and the sweetness sweeter. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! are you <i>a stranger to a Savior's grace? </i>If 
    so, your dwelling now is always at a Marah's side. Your daily well holds the 
    bitter water of vanity, vexation, sorrow, disappointment, discontent. Time 
    bears you swiftly to the final stage. What then? There is the cup of 
    trembling and of wrath. Your hands must take it. Your mouth must drink. But 
    you can never drain it. There is no last drop. <i>Infinite vengeance</i> 
    ever fills it to the brim. Eternal wrath is ever bringing more. The 
    merciless tormentor, with unwearied savageness, presents it to the lips. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! think of the rich man and his uncooled tongue. 
    Think of the redeemed. 'The Lamb, who is in the midst of the throne shall 
    feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters.'</p>
