</font></p>
<p align="justify">"I am that I am." Exodus 3:14 </p>
<p align="justify">The believer is called to wayfaring and warfaring 
    struggles. He has to bear a daily cross and to fight a daily fight. But in 
    every hour of need a sure support is near. Behold Moses. The ground which he 
    must tread is very slippery. The hill of his difficulties is very steep. A 
    foe opposes every step. But a staff and a sword are provided for him in the 
    name of his guiding and protecting Lord. 'I AM THAT I AM.' On this he can 
    lean the whole burden of his cares, and fears, and pains. By this he can 
    scatter kings as dust. This support is still the same, ever mighty, ever 
    near. The feeblest pilgrim may grasp it by the hand of faith. And whoever 
    grasps it is 'as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abides forever.'
    </p>
<p align="justify">'I AM THAT I AM.' Such is the voice from the burning 
    bush. The Speaker, then, is hidden in no mask of mystery. It is the Angel of 
    the everlasting Covenant. It is the great Redeemer. He would establish His 
    people on the firm rock of comfort. Therefore with trumpet-tongue He thus 
    assures them that <i>all the majesty, all the supremacy, all the glory of 
    absolute and essential Deity, are His inherent right.</i> O my soul, <i>into 
    what a speck must poor man dwindle before such greatness!</i> The limits of 
    the mind cannot scan it. The arms of the heart cannot embrace it. Words are 
    mere skeletons before it. Intellect would desire to fly on eagle's wing 
    around the ever-widening circle. But vain is the effort. Its height is on 
    heaven's summit. What mortal arm can reach it? It is as space which has no 
    bounds. What human line can measure it? Our mortal eyes cannot pierce 
    unlimited expanse. Our scales cannot weigh the mountains. Our vessels cannot 
    measure the ocean's depths. So our faculties are too short to probe the 
    immensities of God. To grasp divine essence requires divine largeness. 'I AM 
    THAT I AM' alone can read the volume of that title. </p>
<p align="justify">Shall we then repine? What! repine because our God is so 
    great? Where is the subject who frets because he cannot count his prince's 
    treasures? Let us rather bow our heads in pious adoration. Let us rather 
    give thanks that<i> a mine is open in which the very dust is gold!</i> Let 
    us rather humble ourselves, that we are so slow and careless to gather up 
    the <i>manna of rich truth</i> which falls at the tent-door. Let us rather 
    pray the Spirit to illumine more clearly the written page. Let us rather 
    long for the day when every cloud which veils our God shall brighten into 
    perfect light; and when His people 'shall be like Him, for they shall see 
    Him as He is.' Come then, and with such loving teachableness let us take our 
    seat beside <i>this sea of truth</i>, and strive with reverence to touch the 
    spray which sparkles on the shore. </p>
<p align="justify">'I AM THAT I AM.' Here the first sound is <b>eternity</b>. 
    Jesus, as God, here puts on eternity as His robe. He knows no past. He knows 
    no future. He lives unmoved in one unmoving present. He stretches through 
    all the ages which are gone and which are yet to come. His only bounds are 
    immeasurable boundlessness. Before time was born, He is 'I AM THAT I AM.' 
    When time shall have expired, He still is 'I AM THAT I AM.' If there had 
    been the moment when His being dawned, His name would be, 'I am what I was 
    not.' If there could be a moment when His being must have end, His name 
    would be, 'I am what I shall not be.' But He is, 'I AM THAT I AM.' Thus He 
    treads first and last beneath His feet. He sits on the unbroken 
    circumference of existence, as He who ever was, and ever is, and ever shall 
    be. Let thought fly back, until in weariness it faint; let it look onward 
    until all vision fail; it ever finds Him the same 'I AM.'</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! look down now from this astounding glory and fix 
    your eye on <i>Bethlehem's manger</i>. A lowly Babe lies in the lowly cradle 
    of a lowly town, the offspring of a lowly mother. Look again. That child is 
    the eternal 'I AM.' He whose Deity never had birth, is born 'the woman's 
    Seed.' He, whom no infinitudes can hold, is contained within Infant's age, 
    and Infant's form. He, who never began to be, as God, here begins to be, as
    <b>man</b>. And can it be, that the great 'I AM THAT I AM' shrinks into our 
    flesh, and is little upon our earth, as one newborn of yesterday? It is so! 
    The Lord promised it. Prophets foretold it. Types prefigured it. An angel 
    announces it. Heaven rings with rapture at it. Faith sees it. The redeemed 
    rejoice in it. </p>
<p align="justify">But why is this wonder of wonders? Why is eternity's Lord 
    a Child of time? He thus stoops, that He may save poor wretched sinners such 
    as we are. Could He not do so by His will or by His word? Ah! no. He willed, 
    and all things were. He speaks, and all obey. But he must die, as man, that 
    a lost soul may live. To rescue from one stain of sin, the Eternal must take 
    the sinner's place, and bear sin's curse and pay sin's debt, and suffer 
    sin's penalty, and wash out sin's filth, and atone for sin's malignity. 'I 
    AM THAT I AM' alone could do this. 'I AM THAT I AM' alone has done it. </p>
<p align="justify">What self-denial, what self-abasement, what self-emptying 
    is here! Surely, royalty in rags, angels in cells, is no <i>descent</i> 
    compared to Deity in flesh! But mighty love moves Jesus to despise all 
    shame, and to lie low in misery's lowest mire. Through ages past His 
    'delights were with the sons of men.' Eternity to come is but a void, unless 
    his people share His glory. Therefore He humbles Himself to earth, that 
    specks of earth may rise to heaven's immortality. Believer, you rejoice in 
    prospect of thus living with Him forever. But why is there full rapture in 
    the thought? Do not you feel that the crowning ecstasy is in this? Eternity 
    will afford you time to gaze with steady look on a Savior's glories, to sing 
    with unwearied hymn a Savior's praise, to bless with perpetual blessing a 
    Savior's name, and to learn with ever-expanding knowledge a Savior's worth!
    </p>
<p align="justify">There is another note in this loud chorus of truth, which 
    is especial sweetness to the believer's ear. It tells melodiously that <b>
    Jesus cannot change</b>. He is as constant as He is great. As surely as He 
    ever lives, so surely He ever lives the same. He is an infinity of 
    never-varying <i>oneness. He sits on the calm throne of eternal serenity.</i> 
    Change is the defect of things below—for things below are all defective. 
    Immutability reigns above—for immutability is perfection's essence. Our 
    brightest morn often ends in storm. Summer's radiance gives place to 
    winter's gloom. The smiling flower soon lies withered. The babbling brook is 
    soon a parched-up channel. The friend who smiled, smiles no more friendly 
    welcomes. Bereavement weeps where once the family beamed with domestic joy. 
    Gardens wither into deserts. Babylons crumble into unsightly ruins. On all 
    things a sad inscription writes 'fleeting—transient—vanishing.' Time flaps a 
    ceaseless wing, and from the wings decay and death drop down. 'I AM THAT I 
    AM' sits high above all this. He is 'the same yesterday, and today, and 
    forever.' </p>
<p align="justify">The unchangeableness of Jesus is the unchangeableness of 
    His <b>attributes</b>. Each shines brightly in this bright mirror. But a 
    rapid glance at His love and power must suffice. His <b>love</b> is in 
    perpetual bloom. It is always in summertime. The roots are deeply buried in 
    Himself; therefore the branches cannot fade. Believer, drink hourly of this 
    cup of joy. Do not allow Satan to infuse a poisonous doubt. Christ loved you 
    fully when, in the councils of eternity, He received you into His heart. He 
    loved you truly when, in the fullness of time, He took upon Himself your 
    curse, and drained your hell-deep dues. He loved you tenderly when He showed 
    you, by the Spirit, His hands and His feet, and whispered to you that you 
    were His. He loves you faithfully while He ceases not to intercede in your 
    behalf, and to scatter blessings on your person and your soul. He will love 
    you intensely in heaven when you are manifested as His precious purchase and 
    crowned as His bride! </p>
<p align="justify">To each enquiry—has He loved? does He love? and will He 
    love?—the one reply is, 'I AM THAT I AM.' Do not raise the objection, if He 
    thus loves, why am I thus? why is my path so rugged, and my heart like 
    flint? You will soon know that your bitterest trials and your sorest pains 
    are sure tokens of His love. The father corrects because he loves. In 
    attentive care the physician deeply probes the wounds. Thus Jesus makes 
    earth <i>hard</i>, that you may long for heaven's holy rest. He shows you 
    your self-vileness that you may prize His cleansing blood. He allows you to 
    stumble that you may cleave more closely to His side. He makes the world a 
    blank that you may seek all comfort in Himself. If He seems to change, it is 
    that you may change. He hides His face, that you may look for Him. He is 
    silent, that you may cry more loudly. His desertion prevents your desertion.
    <i>He saves from real hell, by casting into seeming hell.</i> But love fails 
    not. All His dealings are its everflowing, overflowing tide. On each the eye 
    of faith can read, 'I AM THAT I AM.' </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Power</p></b> goes hand in hand with love. They co-exist and 
    co-endure. It was a mighty voice which said, 'Be'—and all things were. It 
    was a mighty hand which framed this so wondrous universe. It is a mighty arm 
    which turns the wheel of <i>providence</i>. This power still is, and ever 
    will be, what it always has been. No age enfeebles, and no use exhausts it. 
    This is the Church's rock. The Bible, blazing with its exploits, encourages 
    the 'worm Jacob' to 'be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might.' 
    He can still bid the <i>seas of difficulty</i> to recede. He can cause 
    hurricanes and tempests to cease. He can make straight, the crooked paths of 
    evil. He can level the mountains of high-towering corruption. He can stop 
    the lion-mouth of persecution. He can quench the scorching flames of every 
    lust. In the face of all Goliaths, He cheers His followers to victory, under 
    the banner of 'I AM THAT I AM.' 
<p align="justify">Reader! these thoughts scarcely touch the boundary line 
    of the <i>shadow</i> of this glorious name. But surely they show the 
    blessedness of those who, guided by the Spirit, repose beneath the wings of 
    Jesus. 'The eternal God is your refuge and underneath are the everlasting 
    arms.' 'I AM THAT I AM' must perish or must change, before their names can 
    be cast from His heart. Some greater power must arise, before they can be 
    plucked from His tight-grasping hand. The bare idea is folly. Happy flock! 
    'I AM THAT I AM' loves them, and they are loved—calls them, and they follow 
    Him—sanctifies them, and they are sanctified—blesses them, and they are 
    blessed—gives them life, and they live—gives them glory, and they are 
    glorified. </p>
<p align="justify">But perhaps it is your wretched case to live unsprinkled 
    by His saving blood. Will you die thus? What! thus appear before His great 
    white throne? His <i>truth</i> condemns you—and it cannot change. His <i>
    wrath</i> burns hotly against you—and it cannot relent. His <i>power</i> has 
    commission to destroy you—and it cannot be withstood. 'I AM THAT I AM' 
    becomes an idle fable, if truth and wrath and power war not eternally with 
    sin. And can they war and not prevail? </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, the eternity and unchangeableness of 'I AM THAT 
    I AM' makes heaven to be heaven forever. Sinner, the eternity and 
    unchangeableness of 'I AM THAT I AM' makes hell to be hell forever.</p>
