<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE PASSOVER</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">"It is the Lord's Passover." Exodus 12:11</p>
<p align="justify">These words send us back to the last night of Israel's 
    bondage in the land of Egypt. The captives had suffered much and long. The 
    iron furnace had been heated by unpitying hate and by unsparing hands. But 
    God, in His high council, had decreed that a morn of deliverance should 
    dawn. The appointed hour came. No power can now detain. Mad opposition 
    becomes weak. The chosen people must go free. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, stay your soul on the rock of the promises. 
    They are as immovable as He who speaks them. At the set moment you shall 
    march in triumph to your Canaan. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us, in thought, intermingle in the solemn scene. It 
    was a night black in dismays, terrible in judgments, wild in affrights, keen 
    in anguish. Throughout the whole of Egypt's empire every house was woe, 
    every face was horror, every heart was misery. Death forced all doors. <i>
    Each eldest child was a lifeless corpse. </i>There was no exception. The 
    monarch and the slave alike bewailed, in bitter cry, their first-born's 
    sudden and untimely slaughter. </p>
<p align="justify">It was a night memorable, also, in sweet displays of 
    tender love. Israel's favored sons were all assembled. But neither death nor 
    fear was in their dwellings. They were equipped for departure from all 
    cruelties and pains. They were feasting at a heaven-appointed table. They 
    were rejoicing in a Gospel ordinance. They were partaking of a slain lamb. 
    This exhibited, in loudly-speaking rites, all the certainties and all the 
    mercies of spiritual redemption. They realized present escape. They looked 
    forward to future safety. They had much in hand. They had more in view.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! let us with joy join these joyous companies. And 
    may the Christ-revealing Spirit show Christ to us, as the substance and 
    truth and glory of the spread feast! God Himself selects the offering. His 
    voice says, 'They shall take to them every man <b>A LAMB</b>.' Thus Jesus is 
    appointed by heavenly wisdom to be the one redeeming sacrifice. An elected 
    Savior is the strong foundation of salvation's pyramid. Blessed provision of 
    our blessing God! Where could we turn, if bidden to find a guilt-removing 
    victim? But grace meets every need. Hearken to the sure tidings, 'Behold my 
    servant, whom I uphold—my elect, in whom my soul delights.'</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! God's only begotten Son is God's only appointed 
    Redeemer. He only is called to bear His people's sins. For He alone can 
    sustain such load. He alone is sent to make atonement. For He alone has 
    worthy blood to shed. He alone is commissioned to bring in reconciliation. 
    For He alone can covenant with God. Obey God—present Jesus in the arms of 
    faith. Then your crimson stain is whiter than snow. Your soul is saved. 
    Reject Him, and there remains no more sacrifice for sins. </p>
<p align="justify">The lamb must be <b>a male of the earliest age</b>—'Your 
    lamb shall be <i>a male of the first year.' </i>These are signs of vigor in 
    unbroken perfection. Truly He who is to save must be mighty in strength. For 
    think <i>what mighty hindrances oppose. </i>Whose arm can hold back the 
    descending arm of divine wrath? Whose shoulder can sustain the weight of 
    countless sins? Whose force can close hell? Whose power can open heaven? 
    Whose prowess can trample down satanic rage, satanic spirits, and satanic 
    men? In none but Jesus can such sufficiency be found. In Him it abounds to 
    the overflowing of almightiness. The Father's voice proclaims, 'I have laid 
    help upon one that is mighty.' The pledge is given, 'He shall send them a 
    Savior, and a great one.' The fulfillment is in Jesus, 'The great God and 
    our Savior.' He is the Lamb in all the energy of perfect strength. </p>
<p align="justify">The Lamb must be <b>without blemish</b>—<i>'Your lamb 
    shall be without blemish</i>, a male of the first year.' Jesus, while man 
    below, was pure as God in heaven's brightness. Sin strove in vain to soil 
    Him. Foul temptations thickly fell, but left Him spotless as the light of 
    day. The Father's eye, which cannot look upon uncleanness, delighted in Him 
    as the clear mirror of His own glory. In Him, human nature shone in the 
    luster of divine holiness. In Him was sinlessness which could atone for sin. 
    In Him was righteousness which satisfied the law. </p>
<p align="justify">The lamb must be<b> 'set apart for four days.'</b> Thus 
    in heaven, through eternal days, Jehovah's eye inspected Jesus, as the 
    fore-ordained expiation for the foreseen evil. Thus on earth, through the 
    days preceding the cross, He was tested by every judge—and thus, universal 
    consent crowned Him with the crown of untarnished blamelessness. Even Satan, 
    speaking by blood-guilty lips, proclaimed that there was no fault in Him.</p>
<p align="justify">The lamb must be <b>'slain by the whole assembly of the 
    congregation.'</b> Not one voice was silent, when the dreadful cry went 
    forth, 'Crucify Him, crucify Him.' Believer, not one sin of all your life 
    was absent, when Jesus was dragged to the cross. All your transgressions 
    strained the cords. They concurred to drive in the nails, and to make deep 
    the wounds. Your iniquities brought in His death. His death brings in your 
    life. </p>
<p align="justify">The <b>'blood must be sprinkled on the lintel, and on the 
    doorposts of each dwelling.'</b> The shed blood must be used. It must be 
    openly exhibited as a distinguishing sign. If the destroyer finds the 
    preserving mark, the foot of vengeance must pass over. If there be no shield 
    of blood, the arrows of death must do their work. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! the Gospel moves poor sinners to appropriating 
    efforts. Christ is uplifted, that <i>eyes</i> may look to Him. He is an open 
    refuge, that <i>feet</i> may fly to Him. His blood flowed, that it may be 
    taken by the <i>hand</i> of faith. Do you live a blood-besprinkled life? Is 
    your soul at all times fresh dripping from this stream? If so, you safely 
    dwell beneath salvation's wings. Justice cannot drag you to execution. The 
    curse cannot blight you. The law cannot condemn you. Vengeance cannot slay 
    you. The blood upon you cries—Away! stand back! no foe can touch, where I 
    protect. But are you thus marked as Christ's? If not, arise speedily and 
    flee unto the wounded Lamb. The day is far spent: the night of ruin is at 
    hand. The destroyer is at your heels. Each house unmarked was a house 
    unspared. Each soul unwashed will be a soul undone. An applied remedy alone 
    can heal. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Not one drop stained the floor.</p></b> The blood of Jesus is 
    the most precious thing in heaven and in earth. The Father honors it with 
    all heaven's honors. The saints in light praise it with all heaven's 
    praises. The saints on earth rejoice in it with all heart's rapture. Satan 
    flees before it. Shall godless men treat it with rejecting scorn? Let them 
    beware—on the heart it is a seal of life—beneath the feet it is the stamp of 
    hell. 
<b>
<p align="justify">The flesh must be roasted with fire. </p></b>We have here the 
    keenest image of the keenest torture. The pain of pains is to be slowly 
    devoured by the scorching flames. But this is a faint image of what Jesus 
    verily endured. O my soul, deal closely with the sufferings of your 
    suffering Lamb. Let the amazing facts be the very fibers of your constant 
    thought. Daily visit the <i>garden</i>. Hourly study the <i>cross</i>. What 
    is the sight, what are the sounds, which there confront you? The God-man 
    Jesus lies crushed to the earth. He bends beneath a weight of woe. The 
    saddest groans proclaim the writhings of a tortured soul. Each pore weeps 
    blood. Agony could not more agonize. A piteous cry confesses that the black 
    horrors of desertion blackened around Him. These marks of extremest anguish 
    have clear meaning. <i>The Passover Lamb is roasted with fire. 
</i>
<p align="justify">Believer, Jesus was tormented in your stead. All the 
    wrath which all your sins deserved was outpoured on Him. The vengeance of 
    God descended in all its fury on Him. The curse of the law exacted its 
    utmost on Him. The flames of hell tightly grasped Him. He endured the very 
    miseries which all His people must have endured if they had wailed forever 
    in the lake of fire. Faith sees it and exclaims—I live, for Jesus died. I 
    cannot suffer. Jesus has exhausted all. Wrath cannot touch me, because it 
    has touched Him!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Each inhabitant of the house must feed upon the lamb</p></b>. 
    So every one who would be saved must verily partake of Christ. To hear of 
    Him, to touch the emblems of His dying love, to know His merits, to commend 
    His worth, will profit little. Faith takes Christ, Christ Himself, as its 
    own. It makes Him the very juice and substance of the inner man. Jesus is 
    the believer's never-ending banquet. He feasts on Christ now. He will feast 
    with Christ forever. 
<b>
<p align="justify">A bone of the lamb may not be broken. </p></b>Jesus indeed 
    was harshly treated. But no wounds marred His bones. They weakened not the 
    pillars of His strength. He lives all-vigorous in salvation's might. He 
    stands the unbroken, the unblemished column of His people's hopes. The 
    marvelous fulfillment, also, of this command, proves Jesus of Nazareth to be 
    the true Passover of God. When the soldiers 'came to Jesus and saw that He 
    was dead already, they broke not His legs.' The unwitting heathen 
    unwittingly accomplished the Jewish type. Infidelity, what can you reply? 
    Know, that as no ignorance is like yours, so no ruin will be like yours. 
<b>
<p align="justify">The lamb must be eaten with bitter herbs and unleavened 
    bread.</p></b> These requirements shadow out the combined graces of <i>penitence 
    and sincerity</i>. Reader, do you boast of hope in Christ? It only dwells in 
    a heart ground to powder under a sense of sin. <i>Tears are the magnifying 
    medium through which the cross attracts.</i> Faith has no root in rocky 
    soil. It only blossoms in the moist garden of a weeping spirit. They come in 
    sorrow's sackcloth who receive Christ's justifying robe.
<p align="justify">Do you boast that Christ is your feast? Where is your 
    unleavened bread? Sin loved, sin cherished, sin retained, turns heaven's 
    food into hell's poison. A searching eye comes in to see the guests. Leaven 
    in their hands, leaven in their mouths, leaven in their hearts, is a fatal 
    mark. They must go away to the cell of hypocrites.</p>
<p align="justify">The lamb must be eaten <b>'in the attitude of haste, and 
    with equipment for departure.' </b>The loins must be girded. The feet must 
    be shod. The hands must hold the staff. Here is the believer waiting for his 
    summons, with wings expanded towards his far-off home. Earth's ties are all 
    severed. Anchors are weighed. The eye is strained for the signal, 'Come up 
    here!' Reader, are you thus ready? It is miserable to have ought to do, when 
    doing-time is past. He is a foolish <i>servant</i> who has to seek the key 
    when his Lord knocks. He is a poor <i>advocate</i>, who has to find a plea 
    when he is called to plead. <i>When death comes, have nothing to do, but 
    just to die.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Believer, may you hear, in these poor lines, the Spirit 
    calling you to this Gospel feast. It is His voice, 'Christ, our Passover 
    lamb, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the 
    old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, 
    the bread of sincerity and truth.' I deeply feel that without His light, His 
    grace, His power, we cannot see or know or love or serve or glorify our 
    Lord. But may He be pleased to open our eyes, that we may behold the rich 
    plenteousness of our paschal-feast! May He show us the glories of Jesus, as 
    the Lamb slain! May He enable us to receive Him as our All! May He fill our 
    hearts with the longing prayer, 'Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.'</p>
