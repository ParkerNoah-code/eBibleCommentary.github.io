<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">THE NAME</font></b></font><font size="4">
</font></p>
<p align="justify">Then Moses said, "I beseech You, show me Your glory." And 
    the Lord said, "I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I 
    will proclaim My <b>Name</b>, the Lord, in your presence. I will have mercy 
    on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have 
    compassion." Exodus 33:18-19</p>
<p align="justify">Then the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with 
    him and proclaimed His <b>Name</b>, the Lord. And He passed in front of 
    Moses, proclaiming, "The Lord, the Lord God, the compassionate and gracious 
    God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to 
    thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not 
    leave the guilty unpunished." Exodus 34:5-7</p>
<p align="justify">Earth owes much to supplicating lips. Abundant harvests 
    have been reaped from a little seed of interceding grace. An instance meets 
    us here. A tree of glorious truth rears its high head. Its wide-spread 
    branches have been refreshing shade to multitudes of every age. But where 
    its birth? A hearty prayer was breathed. The noble plant sprang up. 
    Believer, in every place, and at every time drop seeds of prayer. The crop 
    may live when your short race is run. </p>
<p align="justify">The <b>suppliant</b> here is Moses. <i>He thirsts for 
    clearer knowledge of his God. </i>He had seen much, and therefore burns for 
    more. He cries, 'I beseech You, show me Your glory.' It is a large desire. 
    But <i>gracious souls crave all that God can give.</i> It is a large 
    petition. But large petitions honor the Giver and are honored by Him. </p>
<p align="justify">Mark the <b>reply</b>. "I will cause all my goodness to 
    pass in front of you, and I will proclaim My <b>Name</b>, the Lord, in your 
    presence." God's <i>glory</i> is His <i>goodness</i>. His goodness is His 
    glory. His Name is the page in which these wonders shine. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! have you this holy wish? Do you long to see this 
    glory, to taste this goodness, to feast at the banquet of this knowledge? 
    Come then in faith. Come in the lowliness of humble awe. The Lord is passing 
    by. He speaks. Heed His proclaiming voice. "The Lord, the Lord, the 
    compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and 
    faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, 
    rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished."</p>
<p align="justify">A retinue of glory issues from the courts of heaven. Each 
    image shows some glimpse of Him, whose full display would blind our mortal 
    sight. The foremost in the group utters the name, 'Lord' or '<b>Jehovah</b>.' 
    Oh! wondrous sound! It casts the mind back through the ages of eternity gone 
    by; it bears it forward through eternity to come. It loudly tells that 
    through the past, the present, and the future, <b>One is.</b> It pictures 
    Him as 'I am,' <i>before time</i> wasâ€”'I am,' <i>when time shall be no more.
    </i>It robes Him in all the majesty and dignity and grandeur and 
    boundlessness of changeless unity. It exhibits Him as the sole great fount 
    of every stream of life. </p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, such is your Lord. Great beyond thought! vast 
    beyond grasp! immeasurable by human line! untraceable by human search! But 
    from this lofty throne His eye was ever fixed on you! Through all 
    infinities, your image filled His heart. His age is immortality; He grants 
    the same to you. Will you not adore and reverence and bless Him, and love 
    and praise and serve Him? </p>
<p align="justify">Before another sound is heard, Jehovah's name is <b>
    doubled</b>. 'The Lord, the Lord.' The repetition bids us look again. It 
    tells us that thought upon thought must search the mysteries of the great 'I 
    am.' The soaring wing must soar still higher. Our praise must only pause, to 
    recommence its endless work. </p>
<p align="justify">'The Lord, the Lord <b>God</b>.' The title 'God' is now 
    co-joined. This speaks of power and strength. God is unbounded in His 
    sovereignty! He sits indeed upon an omnipotent throne! He wields the scepter 
    of unlimited control! His right hand is all power! He speaks, and it must 
    be! He works, and who can hinder? Pile worlds on worlds, His mere breath can 
    drive them into nothingness. Collect all multitudes from earth and hell, His 
    foot can drive the mass to dust. Shall then powerless man vaunt against God? 
    How can a rebel stand when God shall gird Himself with wrath? Sinner, be 
    wise in time. Vengeance comes on apace. It strides resistless in its force. 
    There is no refuge but at Calvary's cross! </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, this name flies down on wings of peace to you. 
    Know the full might, which is your full support. This God is your <i>shield</i>. 
    What foes can harm? He is your <i>sword</i>. Who can assail? He is your <i>
    fortress</i>. Are you not safe? He is the <i>wall of fire</i> round about 
    you. Who can break through to wound you? He has promised life eternal as 
    your portion. Who can prevent it? He is bearing you in His own arms to 
    heaven. Who can pluck you from His grasp? This God is your full salvation. 
    Therefore you shall be fully saved. </p>
<p align="justify">'The Lord, the Lord God, <b>merciful</b>.' The voice 
    proceeds to open out Jehovah's heart. This heart is mercy. As the sun 
    abounds in sparkling rays, the sea in drops, the sky in glittering orbs, so 
    God is one vast treasure-house of mercy. This is the brightest jewel of His 
    crown. It overtops the heavens. It outlives all time. It outshines all 
    perfections. It is the riches of His riches. </p>
<p align="justify">But <b>what is mercy?</b> It is that sweet and tender 
    love which has a tear for all distress, which grieves in grief, and sorrows 
    in sorrow, and yearns over misery, and only lives in healing wounds, and 
    calming anguish, and converting sighs to joy. This Mercy looked on man in 
    his lost estate. It marked the present suffering and the future woe. It 
    tarried not. It found a full and perfect remedy, even a God-man's life and 
    death!</p>
<p align="justify">The <b>Father</b> is all mercy. A Savior <i>called</i>, a 
    Savior <i>sent</i>, a Savior <i>accepted</i> is the proof.<i> </i><b>Jesus</b> 
    is all mercy!<i> </i>The manger, the garden, the cross, the blood, the 
    righteousness, the never-ceasing prayer, proclaim it. The <b>Spirit</b> is 
    all mercy. His striving in the heart, His light-diffusing presence, His 
    guidance to the Savior's arms, His many visits of consoling love, His rich 
    outpourings of renewing grace, bear witness to this truth. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! whatever be your misery, come to this God, and 
    mercy will relieve it! <i>Paul</i> knew the burden of tremendous guilt, but 
    he 'obtained mercy.' The <i>penitent</i> pleaded, 'God, be merciful to me a 
    sinner.' Floods of peace over-flowed. The <i>wretched blind beggar</i> 
    cried, 'Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.' Jesus stood still. The 
    answer lingered not. 'Go your way, your faith has made you whole.' The <i>
    sorrowing mother</i> supplicated, 'Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David,' 
    and all relief was given. </p>
<p align="justify">Mercy still reigns in heaven. Bring then your <i>sins</i>, 
    they shall be pardoned! Bring your <i>tears</i>, they shall be wiped away! 
    Bring your <i>conscience-wounds</i>, they shall be healed! Bring your <i>
    sighs</i>, they shall be lulled to rest! Bring your <i>need</i>, it shall be 
    all supplied! Bring your <i>difficulties</i>, they shall be smoothed. </p>
<p align="justify">'Merciful and <b>gracious</b>.' The view is changed. 
    Another facet courts the eye. Grace shows its beauteous form. As<b> mercy 
    pities misery</b>, so <b>grace is helpful to unworthiness</b>. Mercy brings 
    balm for wretchedness. Grace hastens to demerit's aid. Mercy finds tender 
    motive in man's woe. Grace has no impulse but from God. The world presents a 
    hateful front. The wide-spread field is rank with mad rebellion's weeds. 
    There is no shame, no penitence, no downcast look, no weeping eye, no 
    sobbing breast, no wringing hand, no prayer for pardon, and no cry for pity.
    <b>Sin</b> follows sin as wave on wave. But <b>grace</b> springs forth, free 
    as God's freeness, vast as God's vastness. It says, 'I love because I love. 
    I will save because I will save. I will redeem from hell because I will 
    redeem.'</p>
<p align="justify">It has no cradle but God's own heart. It has no spring 
    but God's own purpose. But it is a worthy offspring of that worthy source. 
    It girds itself to wondrous work. It draws Salvation's plan. It leads forth 
    Salvation's captain. It chooses Salvation's heirs. It consummates 
    Salvation's scheme. It lays the <i>first</i> stone. It adds the <i>top</i>-stone. 
    It cannot rest, until the shout be heard, Grace to it, Grace to it, forever!</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! <i>merit</i> is as far from you as east from 
    west. Your only possession is sin. But you may shine in glory, because God 
    is grace. Oh! hasten to Him. Take pardon as a free-grace gift. Seek heaven 
    as a free-grace prize. But if your pride rejects free grace, your own 
    deserts will be the undying worm. </p>
<p align="justify">"Merciful and gracious,<b> long-suffering</b> (slow to 
    anger)." The citizens of Zion sometimes quake, lest grievous guilt should 
    drain all mercy and exhaust all grace. A ray next shines to dissipate these 
    clouds. Behold Me, says the Lord, I am long-suffering. Here is a plank, on 
    which the wave-tossed soul may rest. What! though the annals of the heart 
    are but a sin-vile tale. What! though each day, each hour, is but the 
    hot-bed of provoking evil. What! though the holiest prayers are often solemn 
    mockery, the holiest works but incense to self-love. Still, vengeance stops 
    its hand, and blessings pour their blessing-showers down. </p>
<p align="justify">If <i>angels' patience</i> ruled for one hour, would it 
    be so? No! Man's whole race would be a shattered ruin.<i> But He who reigns 
    is a patient God. </i>Hence, where offence abounds, His patience rises 
    higher. We live because our God forbears. But the day comes when boundless 
    patience finds its bounds. Sinner, when God's patience can no more bear, 
    then your long sufferings will no more cease. </p>
<p align="justify">'Merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and<b> abundant 
    in goodness and truth.</b>' But while patience still is patient, may not the 
    stores of <b>goodness</b> fail? It cannot be. God's goodness is Himself. 
    While He has life, it is His life to scatter goodness round. Believer, come 
    to this <i>tree</i>. Its boughs forever bend, and all its fruits are 
    goodness. Drink of these <i>waters</i>. They ever flow, and all the stream 
    is goodness. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Truth</p></b> is the handmaid which provides and scatters far 
    these never-failing gifts. A covenant oath is pledged, "I will certainly 
    bless you richly." Hebrews 6:14. Truth then must die before the hand of 
    goodness can hang down. Abundant truth secures abundant goodness. 
<p align="justify">'Keeping mercy <b>for thousands</b>.' O my soul, hearken 
    to the melody of this sweet note. The thought may sometimes rise, that mercy 
    visits but a favored few, that the rare gift enriches but rare souls. No! 
    mercy's <i>arms</i> are very wide. Mercy's <i>heart</i> is very large. 
    Mercy's <i>mansions</i> are very many. It has brought saving joy to 
    countless multitudes. It has saving joy for countless yet. The doors stand 
    open. Thousands have found. But there are stores for thousands yet. </p>
<p align="justify">Will any hesitate? Will any sigh, 'There cannot be this 
    hope for me?' Why this fear? Is the reply, 'My iniquity forbids it'? This 
    Name sweeps down such obstacle. It cries, The Lord is a God, 'forgiving 
    iniquity.' Is it added, 'But my transgressions are so vile'? The Name still 
    speaks, The Lord is a God forgiving iniquity and transgression. Is it 
    further said, 'But my sins appear in countless multitudes'? The Name 
    continues, Our Lord is a God forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.
    </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">If all the sins of all the lost, if all the filth of all 
    the fiends in hell, </p></i>were piled on your one conscience, flee to the 
    cross, plead this sure word, and as our God is true, He will be found 
    forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin. 
<p align="justify">But if you fail to cast yourself on Christ, there is no 
    other refuge. This word of richest comfort is stern condemnation to all who 
    stand in their own guilt.<b> "He will by no means clear the guilty."</b> No 
    sinner can take unpardoned sins to heaven. No soul unwashed can enter there. 
    Evil must have what evil earns. Christ our Surety appeared bearing our sins. 
    He was not spared. Wrath seized Him. Vengeance took its due. <i>In Him</i>, 
    all who are His are cleared, because His death is theirs. <i>Out of Him</i>, 
    all who have sin must die, because their sins are theirs. </p>
<p align="justify">"The Lord, the Lord God, the compassionate and gracious 
    God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to 
    thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not 
    leave the guilty unpunished." Reader! such is God's saving Name. Oh! hear it 
    now, and with the ear of faith. It is not heard in hell.</p>
