<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">THE INCENSE ALTAR</font></b></font><font size="4">
</font></p>
<p align="justify">"Make an <b>altar</b> of acacia wood for burning <b>
    incense</b>. It is to be square, a cubit long and a cubit wide, and two 
    cubits high—its horns of one piece with it. Overlay the top and all the 
    sides and the horns with pure gold, and make a gold molding around it." 
    Exodus 30:1-3</p>
<p align="justify">He whose daily life is an upward flight to Christ has 
    heaven on his way to heaven. Wide indeed are these fields of light. We may 
    journey far, but they stretch farther. From every point more lofty heights 
    appear. The subject is a book whose pages end not. The more it occupies us, 
    the less it wearies. It richly feeds, but ever leaves an appetite for more. 
    The Redeemer's image is embodied in the Tabernacle-service. 'Behold Him! 
    behold Him!' is the one universal cry. But nowhere is this voice more 
    plainly heard than at the Golden Altar. This filled the tent with richest 
    streams of fragrance. So it preached Him who is the Incense of the courts 
    above. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! this now invites our notice. In mercy may the 
    Spirit cause the sacred odor to arise. The <b>position</b> of this Altar 
    first claims thought. The Lord, who orders all things with wise end, 
    especially enjoins, 'Place the incense altar just outside the inner curtain, 
    opposite the Ark's cover—the place of atonement—that rests on the Ark of the 
    Covenant. I will meet with you there.' Exodus 30:6. Mark where he stands, 
    then, who discharges service at this sanctuary. The expiating altar is 
    behind. His steps have brought him to the borders of the holiest place. He 
    has passed the spot where dying victims bleed (the bronze atoning altar). 
    Heaven's clearest emblem (the Ark of the Covenant) is now close by. Thus the 
    Incense Altar's chosen position seems as a link to join the cross and crown.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! the spot calls you to pause and look within. Say, 
    have your feet attained this position? Has the <i>first altar</i> seen you 
    humble, guilt-stricken, smiting on your breast, and confessing all your 
    miserable sins before it? Has eager faith there touched the atoning Lamb? Is 
    pardon in your hand? Is your soul calm in knowledge of the curse removed and 
    full remission given? </p>
<p align="justify">Have you thus pressed towards this inner Altar, where the 
    incense burns? If so, the veil is almost touched. This screens the 
    sanctuary, which pictures heaven's bright rest. The space is narrow now, 
    which parts you from eternal bliss. The ever-smiling smile of God, the 
    ever-present presence of the Lamb is your near portion. Swift-flying moments 
    will soon waft you to the kingdom from all eternity prepared, throughout all 
    eternity prolonged. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! is such in very truth your place? If so, <i>adore 
    the grace which led you to it! </i>You may have <i>wealth</i>. It cannot 
    profit long. You may have <i>health</i>. Decay will cause its flower to 
    fade. You may have <i>strength</i>. It soon will totter to the grave. You 
    may have <i>honors</i>. A breath will blast them. You may have flattering <i>
    friends</i>. They are but as a summer brook. These boasted joys often cover 
    now an aching heart. They never gave a grain of solid peace. They never 
    healed a conscience-wound. They never won approving looks from heaven. They 
    never crushed the sting of sin. But floods of peace surround this golden 
    incense altar! Its worshipers grasp mercy and survey glory. They look back 
    on all transgression blotted out. Heaven's rays are breaking on their 
    blood-washed souls. The Incense Altar is so set that these truths sparkle 
    from its instant sight. </p>
<p align="justify">Next, let this altar's parts be viewed. No human mind 
    designs this incense altar. God, who gives Christ, gives each foreshadowing 
    sign. His voice directs, 'Let <b>gold</b> be joined to <b>wood</b>.' Christ 
    is the corresponding wonder. He is equal to God in Godhead's greatness, and 
    fellow to man in humanity's low state. He is bold to ascend to Jehovah's 
    throne, and willing to share the sinner's rags. Such is the Savior whom God 
    sends. Such is the Savior whom sin needs. More cannot be. Less would be 
    nothing worth. Would that all tribes of men could form one audience, to hear 
    one word from these poor lips. It should be this—A God-man only can redeem a 
    sinner's soul. A God-man, even Jesus, <i>undertakes</i> the work. A God-man, 
    even Jesus, <i>finishes</i> the whole. </p>
<p align="justify">Its <b>form is square</b>. Such is the shape, also, of 
    the atoning altar. We thus are taught again, that <i>our salvation is 
    exceeding strong.</i> It is support which cannot fail. It is most firmly 
    based on God's own might forever. We further learn that one inviting picture 
    is turned to every comer. From every quarter, then, let sinners flee here. 
    Christ never did, He never will, He never can reject. One face, arrayed in 
    ready welcomes, smiles on all. </p>
<p align="justify">It had its crown, its horns, its poles. Each sounds glad 
    tidings to faith's listening ear. The <b>crown</b> is a <i>royal</i> emblem. 
    Let Jesus take it, then. It is His right. The prophet sings, 'The government 
    shall be upon His shoulder.' Isaiah 9:6. The Father cries, 'Yet have I set 
    my King upon My holy hill of Zion.' Psalm 2:6. Once, indeed, derision mocked 
    Him with its circling thorns. But now in heaven He wears redemption's 
    everlasting diadem. But though He rules thus high, <i>His darling throne is 
    the poor sinner's heart! </i>His brightest crown is jeweled with saved 
    souls. </p>
<p align="justify">The <b>horns</b> speak <i>mighty</i> <i>prowess</i>. They 
    prove that victory is on His brow. It is so. No strength can stand before 
    Christ! He speaks and He prevails. Hell quakes. The captives come forth 
    free. Sin's chain is shattered. Opposing lusts lie down subdued. The baffled 
    world is trodden under foot. Believer, at this Altar, then, cast out all 
    fear. A conquered kingdom cannot conquer you<i>. A horn has pierced each 
    adversary's heart. </i>You stride to triumphs over death-stricken ranks. </p>
<p align="justify">The <b>poles</b> were signs of readiness to move. The 
    Gospel-sound must go into all the earth. Place has no power to shut out 
    Christ. He penetrates the lonely wastes. He cheers <i>Elijah</i> by the 
    desert brook. No bars give effectual hindrance. He wakes a song within <i>
    Paul's</i> inmost cell. He watches by the wandering <i>Jacob</i>. He walks 
    beside the faithful <i>youths</i> in the furnace-heat. He animates the 
    warring <i>Joshua</i>. He stoops to <i>poverty's</i> most squalid mire, and 
    sits beside the outcast <i>Lazarus</i>. He mounts the steps of lofty 
    palaces, and guards His followers in Caesar's household. There is no pilgrim 
    in the fleet, the camp, the rustic hut, the lordly fort, the hall of 
    science, whose heart Christ cannot reach. His swiftly-flying love calls all 
    His children in from east, from west, from north, from south. They all draw 
    near to Him because He first draws near to them. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, at this altar learn that in life's busiest 
    haunts, in retreat's solitary hours, <i>Christ is an attending friend. </i>
    It is true that here no victim died. But is it true, that here no blood was 
    seen? Oh, no! On solemn days, which saw atoning rites so solemnly performed, 
    blood was here largely scattered. The high-priest dyed these horns, and 
    sprinkled this holy vessel seven times. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! be wise, and learn the heaven-taught art of <b>
    mixing blood with every service. </b>Let prayer be mighty in the plea of 
    Jesus's death. Let praise ascend from blood-cleansed lips. Let love be as a 
    flame from blood-besprinkled hearts. Let every work be worked with 
    blood-washed hands. God's eye looks for this sign (the blood of Jesus). When 
    it is seen, mercy's wide door flies open, and acceptance cannot delay. But 
    woe is theirs whose offerings are not so washed. Cain's miserable end gives 
    warning that we bring no sacrifice without atonement. </p>
<p align="justify">But this Altar's main use was to receive and inflame the 
    incense. Here the sacred spice was burned. When the morning lamps were 
    trimmed, and when the evening lights were lit, the perfumed flame was 
    kindled. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! observe the process. The fire was first brought. 
    The holy powder was then spread. The streams of aroma then flew high. And 
    the whole tent was fragrant as the garden of the Lord. The Spirit has 
    selected <b>incense</b> as the type of <b>prayer</b>. 'Let my <i>prayer</i> 
    be set forth before You as <i>incense</i>.' Psalm 141:2. We here, then, have 
    a graphic image of the prayer of prayers, <b>the intercession of the 
    King-priest Jesus.</b> </p>
<p align="justify">Mark <b>where</b> the kindling fire was brought from. It 
    came not from a human hearth. The outer atoning altar gave the supply. It 
    was the very fire from heaven. It was the very fire which consumed each 
    offering. Great truth is here involved. The atoning-altar feeds the 
    Incense-altar.<i> The prayer of Christ receives its life, its power, its 
    vigor, from His blood-stained cross! </i>The prayer which prevails is drawn 
    from justice satisfied, from payment made, from wrath appeased, from law 
    fulfilled, from curse endured, from covenant discharged. Christ's <i>
    intercession</i> rests upon His <i>death</i>. Thus incense never ceases to 
    ascend. Heaven is ever fragrant with its precious savor!</p>
<p align="justify">Compare all other knowledge with this truth. It flees and 
    vanishes as an unsubstantial mist. This is the brightest jewel in the crown 
    of grace. This is the fullest cordial in the Gospel-cup. Where is there joy 
    like realizing views of the great work, which Christ now acts on high? He 
    pleads. He lives to plead. He ever lives to plead. He shows His finished 
    work. He stretches forth His pierced hands. He claims fulfillment of 
    redemption's contract. Our heavenly Father rejoices in the grateful streams. 
    His every attribute has infinite delight. He smiles approval. His ready 
    hands are opened. All blessings are poured out. Pardons are sealed. The 
    Spirit is bestowed. Ministering angels hasten to their guardian-work. The 
    happy flock are gathered into the one fold of grace, and prepared for the 
    one fold of glory. </p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, may this sweet incense be your constant joy! 
    Shall heaven be glad, and you not clap the hand, and shout all praise? Learn 
    more and more your high and privileged estate. <i>Grasping these horns,</i> 
    you may cast back all doubts and fears which Satan would suggest. He often 
    will whisper that our prayers are weak and worthless, and nothing but 
    insults to the ears of God. Alas! this is too often true. But hope relies 
    not on <i>our</i> holiest work. Christ prays. Christ prays most worthily. 
    And <i>in His prayers</i> acceptance stands. Our praises are often as a dull 
    smouldering smoke. Alas! here is our sin, our shame, our base ingratitude! 
    But Jesus' voice is heard. His merits sweeten our short-coming utterance. 
    Our hearts are cold and dead. But Christ ever loves, and proves His love by 
    unceasing prayers.</p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, think how prevailingly Christ works for you. 
    Shall the king say to Esther, 'What is your request? it shall be even given 
    you to the half of the kingdom.' And can the cry of God's co-equal Son be 
    coldly met? Is the promise pledged, 'Whatever you shall ask of the Father in 
    My name, He will give it to you?' And shall there be less acceptance when 
    Christ in His own person supplicates? This cannot be. </p>
<p align="justify">Prize, then, your Incense Altar. Delight in it. Use it 
    until you pass the veil. But listen! A word of solemn warning sounds. <i>The 
    incense is most hallowed. </i>God adds, 'Whoever makes <i>any like it</i> to 
    enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from his people.' Exodus 30:38. The type 
    profaned was hopeless death. Will any trifle with the grand reality? If 
    common use were sacrilege, what must the rejection be? Some join with it the 
    fancied prayers of mediating saints. What! is there not enough in Christ? 
    Can He be undervalued, and God pleased? Can they reach glory who rob Him of 
    His crown?</p>
