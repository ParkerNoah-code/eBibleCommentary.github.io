<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE BRONZE ALTAR</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">"Using acacia wood, make a square <b>altar</b> 7 1/2 feet 
    wide, 7 1/2 feet long, and 4 1/2 feet high. Make a horn at each of the four 
    corners of the altar so the horns and altar are all one piece. Overlay the 
    altar and its horns with <b>bronze</b>." Exodus 27:1-2</p>
<p align="justify">A spacious court enclosed the Tabernacle. There was 
    admittance by one only gate. All worshipers must pass one door. Immediately 
    in front of this the Bronze Altar stood. This object first arrested view. 
    Each eye must first behold, each step must first approach its hallowed 
    structure. All heaven-taught souls acknowledge <i>Jesus as the Altar</i> of 
    the Church. Most plain instruction flows, then, from this prominent position<i>. 
    Christ should be foremost in the heart's desires. </i>Each thought should 
    first go forth towards Him. He should receive the first-fruits of our love. 
    His ear should hear our earliest praise. He should be felt, the Alpha of 
    life's every move. </p>
<p align="justify">Parents and ministers mark this. In all your teaching 
    make Christ the morning-star. Let His sweet rays precede all other light. 
    Let other knowledge follow behind Him, and be the lowly handmaid of pure 
    wisdom's Lord!</p>
<p align="justify">"Each day you must sacrifice a young bull as an offering 
    for the atonement of sin." Ex. 29:36. The Bronze Altar faced the 
    entrance-gate. It was a solemn sight. Perpetual fire blazed. Perpetual smoke 
    went up. Perpetual victims died. Perpetual blood was shed. Perpetual 
    offerings came. Why must this carnage be? Who slew all these? What kindled 
    such devouring flames? These questions lead us to a dreadful truth. Fire is 
    the dreadful sign of wrath. The Altar smokes, then, because wrath is gone 
    forth—because transgressions must pay death. These flames write glaringly, 
    'See what sin earns.'</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! you cannot weigh enough the misery and guilt of 
    sin. It wakes eternal fury. It is the fuel of the quenchless fire. And what 
    are you but one vile mass of sin? How, then, can you escape? There is one 
    only hope. This Altar shows it. Come, now, and see its saving wonders. Come, 
    seek its refuge. Come, receive pardon from its blood-stained horns. Depart 
    from it—and you pass to bear, unsheltered, the thunderbolts of wrath. </p>
<p align="justify">The Altar's <b>component parts</b> first bid us pause. <i>
    Its twofold substance presents the twofold nature of our Lord.</i> If 
    frequent types show forth this truth, it is that frequent thoughts may 
    cluster round it. If this sweet flower be fragrant in all spots of 
    Scripture's field, it is that grateful hands may pluck it at each turn. The 
    frame is choicest <b>wood</b> combined with <b>bronze</b>. The wood alone 
    could not suffice. The flames would quickly give it, as ashes, to the 
    sporting winds. A mass, also, of unmingled brass would be a weight too 
    cumbrous for a journeying host. The union fits the Altar for its destined 
    use. </p>
<p align="justify">Here is our Jesus, the <i>mighty God, </i>the<i> lowly 
    man</i>. As God, He deals with God. As man, He takes the sinner's place. The 
    God-man saves because the God-man suffers. The pains sufficed for they are 
    infinite. He touches heaven and earth and makes both one. <i>The double 
    substance aptly shows how this rare suitableness combines in Christ. </i></p>

<p align="justify">The form is <b>square</b>. It stands the massive symbol 
    of <i>solidity</i>. It resists all efforts to overthrow it. Faith sees this 
    and exults in its stronghold. Christ is Salvation's Rock. The raging billows 
    of hell's fury lash Him in vain. Earth's ceaseless hate can not jar it. He 
    sits in triumph on the shattered fragments of opposing weapons. The wit, the 
    arguments, the sneers of man, have all fallen harmless at His feet. The 
    cause of Christ still rears its conquering head. He reigns, and ever will 
    reign, immovable in might. Reader! this image calls us to deeper trust. 
    Christ's truth, Christ's word, Christ's work, can never be cast down. </p>
<p align="justify">This shape presents to every quarter the same appearance. 
    Be the approach from east, from west, from north, from south, the appearance 
    does not change. Thus Jesus meets the sinner's eye, in every age, in every 
    place; <i>the same.</i> There is no averted look by Him. There is no half 
    reception. There is one broad display of manifested and inviting grace. 
    Sinner, four equal sides face every point. They meet you at each turn. 
    Expanded arms bid you draw near. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Horns</p></b> branch, also, from each quarter. These are a 
    well-known sign. They speak of <i>all-subduing might.</i> The horned beasts 
    (rhinoceros) move as the forest's terror. When they assail, they triumph. 
    Christ is thus armed for conquest. The thought is precious. My soul, revolve 
    it often. SELF is a broken arm, a pointless dart, a crumbling staff. But 
    strong assaults must be repelled, and strong corruptions trodden down, and 
    strong temptations baffled, and heavy trials borne. Man's sinews cannot 
    wrestle with such foes. But Christ is near. Receive Him as your sword of 
    strength. Leaning on Him, poor worms thresh mountains, and earth's feeblest 
    things do valiantly. Hence the grand power of that wondrous word, 'I can do 
    all things through Christ who strengthens me.' It is the horn of Jesus, 
    which prevails. It never can be broken. Therefore His people raise their 
    heads—and victory is their crown. 
<p align="justify">These horns were more than types of strength. They were 
    realities of <b>refuge</b>. The criminals who reach it must not die, but 
    live. The sword of vengeance lost its power here. All peril died. The spot 
    was hallowed SAFETY. This is the full security of Christ's protecting arms. 
    Satan can no more harm. Can He seize Christ, and drag Him from His throne? 
    He must do this before he can pluck the weakest sinner from the breast of 
    Christ. O my soul, let nothing part you from salvation's horns. Let all your 
    guilt, let every view of sin, let the dread thunder of the threatening law, 
    let the swift darts of wrath quicken your flight to Him. Adhere to Him. Hold 
    fast by Him. Live in His wounds. There is no other spot of peace. </p>
<p align="justify">The Altar's <b>main design</b> <i>was to receive 
    burnt-offerings. </i>At early morn, throughout the day, at evening's close, 
    the flames were bright, the spire of smoke ascended. He has no Gospel-light 
    who sees not Christ in all this blaze. Each fire-made offering typified His 
    death. But on what Altar can Christ place Himself? The promised God-man 
    comes to die—what arms are able to bear Him up? All things below are worse 
    than worthless for such glorious use. If structure could be raised, in which 
    each stone were brighter than a million suns, it would be black beside Him.
    <i>Creation</i> has no fit support. When Jehovah's fellow dies, Jehovah's 
    fellow <i>must sustain Himself. </i>Men little think what burdens pressed 
    Him down. The least transgression of God's righteous law is load beyond all 
    thought. Its weight would sink the sinner deeper and deeper through unending 
    ages in unfathomable gulfs. But this holy victim bears the countless sins of 
    countless multitudes. What can support Him when the avenging fire falls? 
    Angels have no sufficient arms. The help of worlds would crumble into dust. 
    Earth can supply no prop or pillar. Christ alone can now uphold Himself. His 
    Deity alone can keep humanity uncrushed. Christ's only Altar is Himself. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! pause now. Behold God's Altar and God's Offering. 
    Christ stands, the fire-applying Priest. Christ comes, the fire-receiving 
    Lamb. Christ lies, the fire-sustaining Altar. All is sufficient, for all is 
    divine. There is enough in all, for there is God in all. The wrath breaks 
    forth. The fury is outpoured. Vengeance demands her due. The Law exacts its 
    curse. But the burnt-offering fails not. Each attribute of God exults. Each 
    sin of the whole family is expiated. Christ bears the whole, because an 
    Altar, strong as His Godhead, bears Him to the end. There is no sweeter 
    thought on earth, there is no louder song in heaven, than praise to the 
    Priest who offered, to the Lamb who suffered, to the Altar who sustained.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! survey again salvation's fabric in its wondrous 
    parts. Extend your hand. Write <i>glory</i> on each stone. It is all worthy 
    of Him who willed, of Him who planned, of Him who wrought it out. God comes. 
    God comes in flesh to die. God upholds the victim in His dying. <i>Christ is 
    the gift, the Altar, the All.</i> My soul, here is a remedy for all your 
    sins. Your need is great, but the atonement is far greater. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! this Altar still stands high in heaven. It 
    stands, and sinners may draw near and use it. Heed, then, a solemn word. Do 
    you discern it with faith's clear eye? Do you cling to it with faith's 
    strong hand? Do you prize it, as God's best gift? Do you frequent it, as 
    your soul's loved home? Is life's main work transacted here? Need, urgent 
    need there is, that hearts should be thus probed. </p>
<p align="justify">TIME is, at most, but very <i>short</i>, and <i>rapid</i> 
    is its ceaseless flight. Eternity with all its magnitudes is at the door. 
    The last breath may be quivering on the lip. Undying souls are on the 
    threshold of eternal doom! And SATAN strives, with every art, to close our 
    eyes and lure us to his nets. The WORLD surrounds us with its poisoned 
    baits. It checks us with its sneers and frowns. It courts us with its 
    treacherous smiles. SELF, also, is no friend to the soul. It acts a 
    traitor's part. It opens to the murderous foe. Hence there is need that 
    honest lips should press home honest truth. Say, then, is Christ the 
    precious Altar of your faith, your joy, your hope, your love, your zeal? 
    Look inward. Search yourself. </p>
<p align="justify">In every age, not least in this, <i>Satan erects his many 
    counterfeits, and calls them Christ.</i> He decks them with false disguises. 
    He slopes a flowery path into the bewitching snare. He smooths with skillful 
    hand the slippery descent. He plants the altar of <i>man's imagined worth.</i> 
    He prompts the dream, that rubbish dug from nature's quarry, and shaped by 
    sin-soiled hands, and worked by sin-soiled tools, may form a sufficient 
    base. He bids men to offer Christ on this altar, and then lie down content.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! cast such coiled vipers from your breast. What! 
    pile sin on sin, add filth to filth, and call it a fit pedestal for Christ! 
    The very thought is hell's worst lie. No!<i> Christ must be all, or nothing!</i> 
    He must do all the WORK, have all the MERIT, and possess all the GLORY. 
    Would that they whose hearts turn fondly towards Rome's religious frauds, 
    would hear. They often sound the Altar's name—but they tread down the 
    Altar's truth. They build, indeed, a Babel-tower. They raise high steps, as 
    an ascent to heaven. But is Christ there, the First, the Last, the All? Far 
    otherwise. <i>Man's merit</i> lays the broad foundation. His tears of 
    self-wrought penitence, his long array of self-denials, his train of vaunted 
    charities, his ritual postures, and his external rites, construct the 
    fabric. Such is their altar. Christ then, in name only, is added, as a fair 
    jewel to <i>an earth-made crown. </i>Thus proud conceit and Satan's fraud, 
    join hand in hand to cast down Christ. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! such altars stand on ruin's ground. They decorate 
    a downward path. Think what the end must be of Christ-denying creeds, and 
    Christ-rejecting worship, and Christ-ignoring forms? Are you this dreamer? 
    Awake! Awake<i>! Hell has its altar, also! </i>On it lost souls lie down 
    forever. Satan's bellows will not cease to blow. Tormenting anguish will not 
    cease to flare. But imperishable victims cannot be consumed. Awake! Awake! 
    Behold! heaven's saving Altar is not yet beyond your reach!</p>
