<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">THE HOLY GARMENTS</font></b></font><font size="4">
</font></p>
<p align="justify">Henry Law</p> <p align="justify"><br/>    "You shall make <b>Holy Garments</b> for Aaron your 
    brother, for glory and for beauty." Exodus 28:2 </p>
<p align="justify">If ever eyes beheld an object in which splendor shone, it 
    was the high-priest in his Holy Garments. God planned each part 'for glory 
    and for beauty.' Hence every brilliant color sparkled. Hence richest jewels 
    cast back dazzling rays. The rainbow's varied hues, the sun's meridian 
    light, seemed to concentrate in a human form. Earth brought her best. Art 
    framed them with a Spirit-given skill.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! such is the figure to which these humble pages 
    would now invite your gaze. But you will look in vain if you see nothing but 
    the costly robes. Here is delight for faith's enraptured heart. Jesus is 
    here! What is <i>beauty</i>, but His form, His grace, His work! What is <i>
    glory</i>, but His manifested sight! This workmanship would never have seen 
    birth, except to show His all-surpassing worth. </p>
<p align="justify">Spirit of Truth, look down! We long for clearer vision of 
    the Lord. It is Your sovereign province to display Him. Cause, then, these 
    Holy Garments to fulfill their office. </p>
<p align="justify">First, there was the <b>inmost coat</b>. Its texture was 
    of <i>finest linen</i>. Exodus 28:39. It covered the whole frame. It clothed 
    the arms and flowed down to the ground. It thus showed <i>purity</i> from 
    head to foot. Do any ask—Where can such full-length purity be found? The 
    Gospel answers by revealing Christ. He is one blaze of spotless 
    righteousness. This truth is the firm pedestal of all our hopes. If one 
    defect had touched Him, He must have needed an atonement for Himself. But 
    being sinless, He can take the sinner's place. He hangs a sinless body on 
    the cross. He gives a sinless soul to bear God's wrath. Thus wrath is 
    satisfied!</p>
<p align="justify">This snow-white tunic exhibits, also, the <i>
    righteousness</i> which Christ wrought out on earth. His active obedience 
    covers the whole surface of the law. Heaven's palace must have heaven-pure 
    garments. Christ weaves them. Christ bestows them. Faith takes them, and is 
    thus made fit for the throne of God. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! think well; you must sink low in hell, except a 
    righteous Savior cleanses your guilt. You cannot stand before God's eye, 
    except you face Him righteous as He is righteous. You cannot breathe in 
    heaven, except a newborn nature love its holy climate. The hands of Jesus 
    hold all this mercy for you. His holy blood is perfect atonement for sin. 
    His full obedience is your royal robe. His Spirit can impart all grace. 
    Behold the High-priest in this inner tunic, and let its snow-white hue teach 
    you these truths. </p>
<p align="justify">The coat was tightly fastened by a <b>belt</b>. To gird 
    the loins was to prepare for toil. <i>Activity</i> is thus insured. This 
    sign, then, shows our Jesus equipped for all the labors of redeeming 
    service. It was no light task to save souls. Mountains of difficulty must be 
    overcome. Untiring strength must be put forth. He promptly exerts all of His 
    energy. He meets each foe. He clears each obstacle. He rests not until the 
    path from earth to heaven is free. Yet He will work until His flock is 
    safely gathered home. He worked on earth because He greatly loved. He works 
    in heaven because He loves as greatly.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader! see Jesus all activity to save. He never weakens 
    nor loiters nor desists. One thing He does. He girds His loins for labor. 
    Are you as earnest to be saved? Are you as active to seek Him? Are you as 
    zealous to subserve His cause? His persevering zeal should shame man's 
    listless indolence. His belt is reproach to our ungirded loins. </p>
<p align="justify">Above the coat a <b>robe</b> was placed. Exodus 28:31. In 
    measure it was less. It had no covering for the arms. It scarcely reached 
    below the knees. But its chief difference was its lovely hue, and the 
    magnificence of the bordering hem. The color was pure blue. It thus 
    reflected the clear canopy of heaven. The high-priest ministered in a 
    sky-blue robe. Thus Jesus brings all heaven to our thought. Heaven is in His 
    every word. His hands extend the gift of heaven. To see Him now is heaven 
    begun. To be with Him forever is heaven complete. Faith knows no heaven but 
    Him. Reader! see Jesus as your High-priest in azure robe, and you will die 
    to earth, and earth will die to you. A brighter scene will win you to love 
    brighter things. </p>
<p align="justify">This robe had a <b>rich hem</b>. Its hem was a broad 
    belt of pomegranates and golden bells. </p> <p align="justify">These <i>pomegranates</i> were richly 
    worked in purple, blue, and scarlet. Of all the fruits, this is most <i>rich 
    in seed</i>. Therefore it is fit emblem of <i>luxuriant shoots</i>. Here 
    Jesus is portrayed, as the 'Everlasting Father' of a countless race. His 
    blood is sown on earth; a harvest of saved souls springs up. Mark the crowds 
    who throng the throne of glory. They all are produce of redeeming love. Mark 
    all who in the wilderness of earth show signs of new-imparted being. They 
    all derive existence from one stem; they all are fruit of one regenerating 
    Spirit. We see the ornamented edge, and we adore the truth, 'So shall your 
    seed be.' Gen. 15:5. </p>
<p align="justify">The pomegranates were intermingled with <i>golden bells</i>. 
    The high-priest could not stir but <i>melody</i> announced that he was near. 
    Israel's sons found special comfort in this ordinance. Their high-priest 
    passed the veil. He stood before the ark. It was a solemn moment. The spot 
    was tremendous in awe. The thought might rise, Can man draw near to symbols 
    of God's glory and not die? But a sweet note lulls all such fears to rest. 
    The golden bells are heard. All hearts rejoiced. The high-priest faced the 
    mercy-seat and yet he lived. The golden bells still sound. Faith is no 
    stranger to their voice. Jesus, indeed, is no more seen by mortal sense. The 
    heavens hide Him. He prosecutes His work before a throne unseen by us. And 
    there He lives. The proof is clear and sweet as music from the golden bells. 
    Each tender whisper of His love, each soothing application of His word, each 
    sweet assurance of unfailing care, are sounds which evidence that Jesus 
    lives. The golden bells forever ring the joyful tidings, 'Because I live, 
    you shall live also.' </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, look often to the fringe of the blue robe. 
    Jesus is there, the fruitful author of your every grace. Jesus is there, 
    assuring that He lives to give you life. </p>
<p align="justify">The <b>ephod</b> was next added. Exodus 28:6. This was a 
    tunic, shorter in form than the preceding robe. But while the robe was 
    simple in one azure shade, this ephod was all radiant in diversity of hue. 
    They shall make it, said the Lord, 'of gold, of blue, of purple, of scarlet, 
    and fine twined linen, with skillful work.' Earth brought its choicest 
    produce. Art used its utmost effort. The purpose is most clear. We thus are 
    taught that<i> all rare graces are combined in Christ</i>. His <u>person</u>, 
    which is God and man; His <u>work</u>, which fills all heaven with glory; 
    His tender dealings; His loving heart; His faithful truth; these are the 
    perfection of all charms. None ever see true beauty until Christ appears in 
    His salvation's robes. </p>
<p align="justify">Two <b>shoulder-pieces </b>fixed it. No common skill 
    prepared them. Sockets of gold were formed. In each an onyx stone was 
    placed. These stones were <i>engraved with the names of Israel's tribes. </i>
    O my soul, what streams of comfort issue from this sight! Your name, your 
    very name appears on high, uplifted on the shoulders of your Lord. How then 
    can foes work harm? They may assail, they will assail. But you are high 
    above their reach. Can they scale heaven? The thought is folly. Yet they 
    must lay Christ low before they can touch you. Your seat is safety. Your 
    prop is Deity. Rejoice, be glad. High is your Lord—are you less high? Thus, 
    weak in yourself, you soar above all peril, and sit as more than conqueror 
    on eminence of Almightiness!</p>
<p align="justify">Rich is this comfort. But the Lord of comfort yet gives 
    more. It is His will that joy unspeakable should fill His people's souls. A
    <b>breast-plate</b> therefore is inserted in this ephod's front. No words 
    can show its matchless splendor. Richly embroidered like the ephod, twelve 
    precious jewels were set upon it. Each glittering stone exhibited the name 
    of one of Israel's tribes. This work is all arranged to prove <i>how dearly 
    Jesus loves His own people. </i>The world may scorn them as the vilest dust. 
    But Jesus guards them as His choicest treasure, and put them on as the 
    delight of His delights. Redeemed souls are His chief ornament. He wears 
    them on His heart. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, look to Christ. Mark, He displays His very 
    heart. What do you read there? Your name! Your very name! Do you ask, And 
    can He love <i>me?</i> Surely the manger, the garden, and the cross are 
    proof. But lest such evidence should not suffice, His<i> breast-plate</i> is 
    shown as a scroll written with your name. Be then persuaded. His life is 
    love for you. His heart has never been, and never will be, without your 
    image. You dwell entwined amid His affection's fibers. Your High-priest ever 
    wears this precious breast-plate. He ever shows your name before God's 
    throne. You are inseparable portion of His heart. </p>
<p align="justify">This is not all. The breast-plate holds more wondrous 
    treasure yet. But here is mystery which we cannot scan. We know, and it is 
    much to know, that the <b>Urim and Thummin</b> were adjoined. The meaning of 
    the terms is clear. Their meaning is 'light and perfection.' Their holy use 
    is also known. By means of these the Lord <i>revealed His will</i>, and gave 
    responses to the consulting priest. The Gospel of the ordinance is likewise 
    clear. Christ is our light. He is our full perfection. Do we need wisdom? Do 
    we seek guidance? We may draw near. From His heart pure light will shine. Do 
    we mourn that imperfection cleaves as our very skin? He only can relieve. 
    His blood, His righteousness, His Spirit, His dealings, are perfect and make 
    perfect. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! seek Christ, and light is yours. Seek Christ, and 
    all perfection is your portion. Our Urim and our Thummin are His smile. </p>
<p align="justify">The Holy Garments are not yet complete. The head must now 
    receive its crowning grace. For this a <b>mitre</b> is prepared. Fair linen 
    is the substance. A belt of blue surrounds it. On this a golden plate is 
    fixed. And then the glorious name, 'Holiness to the Lord,' shines forth. 
    Exodus 28:36. My soul, look up to heaven. Jesus there ministers to 
    consummate salvation. What is it that His <b>mitre</b> declares? 'Holiness 
    to the Lord.' Adore Him—for such is His just title. His <b>person</b> is 
    'Holiness to the Lord.' Unspotted purity is His essence. If it were 
    otherwise, He could not take a Savior's place. His <b>work</b> is 'Holiness 
    to the Lord.' He came to set Himself apart, that He might do His Father's 
    will. His <b>blood</b>, His <b>righteousness</b>, His <b>prayers</b>, are 
    'Holiness to the Lord.' His <b>people</b>, in their souls, their walk, their 
    ways, are 'Holiness to the Lord.' He found them sinners. He made them holy. 
    He gave them new hearts, new lives, to be forever 'Holiness to the Lord.'
    </p>
<p align="justify">Such is our robed High-priest. Is He not glory? Is He not 
    beauty? Who will not love Him? Who will not praise Him? Who will not pray, 
    Glorify me in Your glory! Beautify me in Your beauty! for I am Yours!</p>
