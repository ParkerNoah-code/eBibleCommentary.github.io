<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b><font size="4">THE BANNER</font></b></font><font size="4">
</font></p>
<p align="justify">"Moses built an altar, and called the name of it <b>
    Jehovah-nissi</b>." (<b>The Lord is my Banner</b>) Exodus 17:15 </p>
<p align="justify">The fight with Amalek is past. He is given as the dust to 
    Israel's sword, as driven stubble to his bow. Let mad assailants learn that 
    no weapon formed against the Church of God can prosper. The arrow shot 
    against the sun falls back upon the head. The oak rebounds upon the slashing 
    hands.</p>
<p align="justify">But <b>why</b> was sure victory on Israel's side? Because 
    the Lord was with them. He braced their courage—they were girded with 
    strength. He frowned—the foe can no more stand. He smiled—His people can no 
    more fall. To whom, then, shall the praise be given? Shall worms of earth in 
    vaunting vanity ascribe it to their worth, their counsels, the leader's 
    leading, or the soldier's might? The thought is anguish to a pious mind. 
    Without the Lord, what is the best man's best? He only prevails when the 
    Lord supplies the wisdom, implants the prowess, and commands the outcome. 
    And shall not He who is the first, the last, the whole, in all success, have 
    all the glory? </p>
<p align="justify">So Moses judged. He hastens to put the crown on the real 
    Victor's head. He raises a building, not to man, but God. He adds a truthful 
    name. He calls the altar 'Jehovah-nissi—the Lord is my Banner.' This is 
    right. This is wise. Let God have God's place—the highest of the high. Let 
    man have man's place—the lowest of the low. If there be baseless pretension, 
    it is when dust claims honor, as the worker of Jehovah's works. The <i>tool</i> 
    is not the worker. The <i>pen</i> is not the spring of thought. The 
    laborer's <i>spade</i> makes not the crop to grow. The steps towards this 
    altar give such warning. </p>
<p align="justify">But the structure itself is a far brighter lesson. The 
    Spirit shows by it new features of our precious Savior. He plainly states 
    that the root of Jesse, David's son, is the ensign (banner) of the Redeemed. 
    Hence, in Jehovah-nissi, faith adores Christ Jesus as its Banner. Who hears 
    of a Banner, and thinks not of a battle-cry? Its stand is among 
    warrior-ranks. It tells of conflicts and of struggles. It reminds of foes 
    assaulting, and of shocks to be sustained. </p>
<p align="justify">And is not the believer's hope a camp? He drinks indeed 
    deep draughts of heavenly peace, but still the hand which takes the cup 
    holds high the sword. His calm is like the calm of Jesus, who slept while 
    billows tossed around. Experience proves this truth. The sandals of the 
    Gospel are bare-worn on a battle plain. Hope rears its helmet battered by 
    many a blow. Faith shields a heart which surely rests, but rarely knows 
    repose. The Spirit's sword is corroded by no scabbard's rust. Can it be 
    otherwise? </p>
<p align="justify">Are not God's children met by an Amalek who neither dies, 
    nor sleeps, nor spares, nor pities? This foe is Satan. His <i>might</i> is 
    such, that Almightiness alone exceeds. His <i>knowledge</i> such, that it 
    nears the confines of omniscience. His <i>skill</i> is sharpened by 
    observance of every heart in every climate and every age. His <i>wrath</i> 
    is barbed by knowing that His time is short. His <i>hopes</i> are plumed by 
    slaughtered millions beneath his feet.<i> He assails each inlet of each 
    sense. </i>He raises barriers before the throne of grace. No knee ever bows 
    but his shaft flies. He aims at every worshiper in every pew—at every hearer 
    of the sacred truth—at every reader of the Word of God—at every hand which 
    takes the sacramental food—at every tongue which tells of Jesus's love—at 
    every eye which sheds the tear of penitence. </p>
<p align="justify">But <i>Satan</i> has a <b>world</b> to aid him. He 
    strives to slay each man by each, and all men by all. He can paint brilliant 
    prospects. He can raise piles of <i>wealth</i>. He can deck <i>honor's</i> 
    crown with dazzling jewels. He sets the <i>secret ambush</i>. He digs the 
    fearful pitfall. Like Jael, he shows the dainty dish, but hides the hammer 
    and the nail. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Satan</p></i> also has <b>fallen nature</b> on his side. 
    There is 'the <i>body</i> of this death.' From this there is no escape. Self 
    cannot separate from self. And self has a traitor's hand to introduce the 
    foe. Self murders self, when it can work its will. Such are the troops of 
    Amalek. But let not the believer fear. Jehovah-nissi is God's pledge, that 
    their enemies shall be put out forever. 
<b>
<p align="justify">This Banner leads to VICTORY.</p></b> In earthly fight, the 
    end is doubtful. The brave, the strong, may fall. The few may chase the 
    many. Hostile hands may seize the standard. But they who cling to Christ 
    must surely triumph. Before they strike one blow the day is won. They 
    venture forth with <i>conqueror's crowns</i>, unseen indeed by eye of sense, 
    but firmly fixed upon their brows. Do any ask how this can be? The Banner is 
    Jehovah. All strength, all multitudes, are feeble nothingness before it. 
    Believer, trust to your Leader, and go forward. He has led through countless 
    conflicts, but He never lost a battle. He never left a follower slain. The 
    plains, though blood-stained, have never been the grave of faith. 
<p align="justify">Each soldier may suffer much in mortifying sin. But 
    triumph is His portion. Is it not said, 'My sheep shall never perish, 
    neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand'? <i>Jacob</i> had many 
    conflicts—but his aged lips bear witness to 'the Angel which redeemed me 
    from all evil.' <i>David's</i> was a struggling life, but his last song 
    extolled a never-failing help. 'I beat them as small as the dust of the 
    earth; I stamped them as the mire of the street.' <i>Paul</i> leaves earth 
    with the shout, 'I have fought a good fight—henceforth there is laid up for 
    me a crown of righteousness.' Search all hell's borders. There is not one 
    amid the lost who really fought beneath Jehovah-nissi.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The Banner is EXALTED.</p></b> It waves high. It courts the 
    gaze of earth. 'Go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every 
    creature.' When man fell, it was unfurled in Eden. Abel embraced it, and 
    flew swift to heaven. Prophets and seers unfurled it more; widening hosts 
    saw it and lived. In due time the Lord Himself appears, and plants the 
    standard on the cross of Calvary. That was a noble eminence. That was a 
    height which Satan could not reach. A dying malefactor discerned its 
    clearness from the very jaws of hell, and found the gate of Paradise in 
    dying. And from that day no sinner ever turned a longing eye to it in vain. 
    And now the faithful <i>preacher's</i> voice, the toiling <i>missionary's</i> 
    love for souls, and every true <i>disciple's</i> holy walk, uplifts it still 
    with ceaseless zeal. In pulpits, in heathen wilds, in filthy haunts of 
    ignorance and vice, in thronging crowds, by dying beds, in lonely cottages 
    where sickness preys and trials vex, they cry, 'Behold Him, Behold Him!' No 
    distance intervenes. No mists obscure. To the opened eye the beauteous 
    Banner is both near and bright. Believer, will you not strive by every 
    effort, at every cost, in every place, at every moment, to make the Banner 
    more conspicuous? Live, labor, die, pointing to it. Wave it while you can 
    raise an arm. Earn the high glory of a standard-bearer's crown. 
<b>
<p align="justify">The Banner is ATTRACTIVE. </p></b>It wins a willing troop. 
    Jacob with dying gaze beheld a thronging multitude, and he bore record, 
    'Unto Him, shall the gathering of the people be.' Isaiah's rapturous notes 
    enquire, 'Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their 
    windows?' And He who is the Truth has pledged, 'And I, if I be lifted up, 
    will draw all men unto Me.' So it has ever been—so it must be. There is a <i>
    magnetic power</i> in the uplifted cross! An influence subjugates the 
    charmed mind. Its streaming scroll exhibits all which needy souls can need. 
    The <i>conscience-stricken </i>sigh for ease. The <i>guilty</i> long for 
    pardon. The <i>weary</i> and the heavy-laden seek repose. The Banner 
    promises that <i>beneath this standard everything is yours! </i>Here is 
    blood to <i>cleanse</i>; righteousness to <i>clothe</i>; strength to <i>help</i>; 
    mercy to pity; grace for <i>demerit</i>; life for <i>death</i>; 
    all-sufficiency for <i>all-deficiency</i>. The sinner sees, believes, 
    enlists. He cannot help but listen. <i>Opposing friends, a sneering world, 
    and all the wiles of Satan, are weak to stop him.</i> Thus every day and 
    every hour the numbers swell. And angels never cease to sing, because on 
    earth fresh converts vow, We are the Lord's. So it shall be until heaven's 
    army is complete. 
<p align="justify">The Banner is a worthy theme of boast. Let the vile 
    sinner be ashamed of sin. Let the weak worldling blush at this silly world. 
    Let unbelief hang down its childish head. Let Popery mutter its base 
    impostures in the dark. But let the believer with pure pride, exult in his 
    high standard. <i>Think</i>—but thoughts fail—<i>say</i>, but words 
    fail—what noble glories cluster here. Men boast of what is great and good 
    and wise and lovely. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Greatness? </p></b>it vanishes when Christ is named. He is 
    the mighty God. He is Jehovah's equal. He is more ancient than the eternal 
    ages. He endures when time is gone. He spoke and all worlds were. The wheels 
    of providence subserve His will. He ever sat, and will sit, omnipotent on 
    Omnipotence's throne. Great is the Banner. Let it be greatly praised. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Goodness? </p></b>He who would learn what goodness is, must 
    read it in the face of Christ. Is it goodness to deck nature with all things 
    suitable to please each sense—to robe the sun with light, the air with 
    purity, the fields with verdure, and man with faculties to enjoy? Is it 
    goodness to look with mercy on a race undone, to lay down life to save? This 
    is poor outline of a Savior's goodness. Believer, boldly shout, Good is the 
    Lord. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Wisdom?</p></b> It is Christ's name. All its treasures lie 
    hidden in Him. His plans, His work, His words, are wisdom in the highest. 
    True wisdom never was, but as a stream from the deep fountain of His mind. 
    Believer, wave your Banner; there is no wisdom but beside these colors. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Loveliness?</p></b> The Spirit, who sees Him as He is, 
    proclaims Him as <i>altogether lovely</i>. He must be lovely who is God's 
    brightness. Mark His sweet smiles of gentle grace. Who can withdraw the 
    admiring eye? Who can restrain the adoring tongue? Beside Him the sun hangs 
    a black orb, and nature's charms are but a withered leaf. Sweet is it now to 
    savingly know Him. What will it be to see Him as He is? Let, then, faith's 
    soldier cry aloud for joy; let him take up his manly boast before all heaven 
    and all earth, Christ is a beauteous Banner, which surpasses praise, exceeds 
    all worth, and soars above renown. 
<p align="justify">Believer, in conclusion, allow an exhorting word. In 
    every place, in every company, boldly display your Banner. Away with weak 
    timidities. Tread down unworthy fears. Reserve is treason. Let all who know 
    you, know Whose you are and Whom you serve. The world would tremble, 
    unbelief would flee, if Christian warriors would rally as a compact band, 
    'fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with Banners.' 
    Take home this warning. Let no shame cloak your Banner. </p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, unfurl it in the eyes of all the scorn, and 
    all the hate of all the world. Unfurl it in the face of all the threats and 
    all the malice of all hell. Unfurl it—and all sins vanish, and 
    conscience-accusations cease. Unfurl it—and the flames of hell curl back 
    before it. Unfurl it—and heaven's portals open. Unfurl it—and you march to 
    heaven's throne of victory. </p>
<p align="justify">You are now brought to the banqueting-house, where the 
    Banner over you is love. The palace is in sight, where the Banner over you 
    will be glory! </p>
