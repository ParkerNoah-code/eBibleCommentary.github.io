<p align="justify"><font color="#FF0000"><b><font size="4">MANNA</font></b></font></p>
<p align="justify">"It is <b>Manna</b>." Exodus 16:15 </p>
<p align="justify">Food was provided for the chosen tribes, unseen before by 
    human eye, untouched before by human hand. 'They knew not what it was.' 
    Reader! when here the Manna is presented to your view, I hope it comes as a 
    familiar thought. It is faith's way to lay it up in <i>memory's ark</i>, as 
    the rich <b>emblem of Salvation's feast. </b></p>

<p align="justify">Manna has many tongues. But its first sound proclaims, 
    that <b>God is gracious</b>. Mark the occasion of these showers of bread. 
    Hunger pressed sore upon the journeying host, and pressed vile murmurs from 
    their fretful hearts. The deep-toned mutters reached the courts on high. 
    Will the swift lightning check rebellious madness? Oh, no! The Lord is full 
    of pity, and delights in love. He opens heaven to pour down supplies. The 
    supply is a miracle. The miracle is a wreath of combined wonders. Each 
    wonder is a rich display of Jesus, and <i>teaches</i> now, as clearly as it
    <i>fed</i> of old. Thus God puts on a diadem of <b>grace</b>, and <i>crowns 
    the thankless with most tender mercies. </i></p>

<p align="justify">But goodness in bestowing food is mere <i>candle</i>-grace 
    beside the bright shinings of redemption's gift. They who would see grace in 
    its zenith must trace it in the Gospel-scheme. When the whole family of man, 
    in Adam's loins, stood before God, lost, ruined, and undone—<i>one leprous 
    mass of misery and sin—</i>shameless, tearless, prayerless—<b>mercy</b> took 
    up the song, and promised that a Savior should descend, even an incarnate 
    God! Reader! your heart is rock indeed, if you hear this, and give no 
    praises to Jehovah's grace. </p>
<p align="justify">It was all dark around, when this soft shower reached our 
    earth. We read, 'When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the Manna 
    fell upon it.' In like manner, spiritual blindness was the world's thick 
    shroud when Jesus came, distilling blessing from His wings. So when His 
    gentle droppings first touch <i>the sinner's heart</i>, He finds it<i> a 
    black mass of midnight gloom. </i></p>

<p align="justify">When <i>morning</i> came, the dew dissolved and left the 
    Manna obvious to the sight. Thus for a while Jesus lies hidden in the Word, 
    and ordinances, and Gospel-rites, which fall in thick and sparkling 
    abundance around our homes. It is not until the Sun of Righteousness arises, 
    that the real treasure is discerned. Then unsubstantial privileges fade off, 
    and Christ remains the whole of soul-support. Reader! the dew was a fit 
    mantle for this heaven-sent food. But it has neither taste nor vital juice. 
    Just so <i>the means of grace</i> are lovely caskets of the heavenly 
    treasure. But he who would have life must pass beyond them to the Lord 
    Himself. </p>
<p align="justify">The Manna was <i>small, </i>and<i> round, </i>and<i> 
    white, </i>and<i> sweet</i>. Each property tells much of Jesus's worth into 
    the ear of faith. </p>
<p align="justify">It was <b>small</b>. It lay a little seed upon the bare 
    earth. Pride would take up a ready sneer. Can this <i>simple mite</i> 
    proceed from <i>heaven's</i> store? Jesus appears. No royal state surrounds. 
    No royal home receives. No royal retinue attends. In lowly guise, He appears 
    as the lowliest of lowly men. His highest station upon earth is in 
    humility's deep valley. But <i>meekness is His Majesty</i>. Abasement is His 
    Glory. Believer, He puts on your flesh, that He may clothe you in His 
    brightest glory. He sinks to nothingness, to exalt you above all greatness. 
    He lives and dies in shame, contempt, and pain, that you may reign in all 
    the honors of the highest heavens. Your blessings bud forth from His 
    despicable estate. </p>
<p align="justify">The Manna was <b>round</b>. The hand which handled found 
    no first and no last point. It was <i>a surface without beginning, without 
    end.</i> Behold the wondrous Jesus. Who can ascend to the spring-head of His 
    birth? Who can stretch forward to the boundary of His life? Who can discern 
    a limit in the circles upon circles of His being? Look through the ages of
    <i>eternity past.</i> In all He lives unchanged, unchangeable. Look through 
    the ages of <i>eternity to come.</i> He still lives unchanged, unchangeable. 
    Believer, is not this thought <i>an ocean of delight</i>, as wide as the 
    breadth and length of your Savior's love? He never was, but with your image 
    on His heart. And while He lives, your image will be there. </p>
<p align="justify">The Manna was <b>white</b>. <i>It covered the mire of 
    earth</i>, a bright contrast to surrounding stains. Its spotless hue proved 
    its descent to be from a pure home. Turn now to Jesus. His every look and 
    word and step are as dazzling, as the holiness of heaven. <i>He was the 
    Righteousness of God embodied in the flesh of man. </i>He trod this earth, 
    as perfect as God is perfect. He ever shined untainted, as the beam from the 
    mid-day sun. It could not be otherwise. Deity forbade anything else. <i>
    Impossibility of sin</i> is Jehovah's essence. It must be so. Redemption 
    needed it. <i>He who would save a soul from sin must give the offering of a 
    sinless soul. </i>Reader! would you be blameless before God? Put on Christ 
    Jesus. </p>
<p align="justify">The Manna was <b>sweet</b>. The palate tasted, and 
    delighted in the luscious savor. It <b>nourished</b>, and the nourishment 
    brought pleasure to the lips. This is the Savior's emblem. <i>He is all 
    sweetness to the feasting soul. </i>Is it not heaven's own luxury to feed 
    upon divine assurances that all sins are fully and forever pardoned—all 
    guilt fully and forever cancelled—all debts fully and forever paid—all 
    pledges of glory faithfully and forever pledged? Is it not sweet to gaze 
    with open eye on a reconciled Father's smile—to receive unmeasured comfort, 
    instruction, strength, and guidance from the indwelling Spirit—to realize, 
    that ministering angels encamp around—that holy men love us, evil men serve 
    us, and all things present and to come are our sure heritage? <i>Jesus is 
    this sweet Manna!</i> Is it not sweet to be regaled all day at <i>such a 
    banquet</i>, to repose all night on <i>such a pillow</i>, to walk through 
    life in <i>such green pastures?</i> This is the believer's Manna. Worldling, 
    is your meal thus sweet? </p>
<p align="justify">Each day the multitude was busy in the field. The 
    constant food fell thick, the constant hand collected. O my soul, let <i>
    gathering</i> be your daily work. Time is prolonged, that you may thrive. 
    And what is thriving, but to gain more truth? <i>The worldling toils a 
    life-long drudgery in gleaning mere husks!</i> Can you sit still, when 
    Christ is to be won? Believe me—that is your richest day which accumulates 
    the most of Jesus. Your best, without Him, is an empty blank. </p>
<p align="justify">They went forth <b>early</b>. The sun's first beams 
    illumined them to their happy task. Here mark, how <i>morning diligence 
    succeeds.</i> It is the truest wisdom, the surest peace, the largest profit, 
    when opening day finds you with <i>open heart</i> before the mercy-seat, 
    with <i>open lip </i>adoring God, with <i>open Bible </i>seeking the Lord. 
    The arrow long retains the first direction of the hand that propels it. The 
    vessel rarely loses the savor of its first contents. <i>The day-break 
    blessing is a day-long gain.</i> Let Jesus draw back your <i>morning</i>-curtain, 
    and He will sanctify the <i>mid-day</i> labor, and lull you to the <i>
    night's</i> repose. </p>
<p align="justify">Perhaps some <i>youthful</i> eye is resting on this page. 
    Beloved, turn not from a wise entreaty. Give to the Lord the first fruits of 
    your being. He is worthy, for He is all worthiness. He calls you with 
    especial grace—'Those who seek me early, shall find me.' And finding Him, 
    you find an ever-blessing portion. Apart from Him, you must be lost. In Him 
    you shall be saved.<i> All is a wilderness of woe without Him. All is a 
    Paradise of joy with Him.</i> If angels sing with sweeter song, methinks it 
    must be round a Christian youth. Come early. Come now. None ever came too 
    soon. Many, alas, have sought too late! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For every hand there was exact sufficiency.</p></b> 'By 
    gathering two quarts for each person, everyone had just enough. Those who 
    gathered a lot had nothing left over, and those who gathered only a little 
    had enough. Each family had just what it needed.' <i>Infinite are each poor 
    sinner's sins; and each sin has infinite demerit! </i>Boundless is the 
    unrighteousness of every soul, boundless the covering which is needed. 
    Countless are the needs which cry for countless helps. But he who lives <i>
    bathing in a Savior's blood</i>, and suing out a Savior's righteousness, and 
    wrestling for a Savior's grace, will never say that the blood, the 
    righteousness, the grace, exceed his daily need.<i> He gets enough, but he 
    has nothing to spare. 
</i>
<p align="justify">He, also, who flees at the last, and only touches with a 
    trembling hand the extremest edge of Jesus's robe, if it be but the touch of
    <i>heaven-born faith</i>, receives full pardon and eternal life. <i>A crumb</i> 
    of Jesus's merits is the saving of the soul forever! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The daily food was only for that same day.</p></b> To <i>
    hoard</i> was to distrust the daily-giving hand. If kept until the next day, 
    it became corruption, to be buried out of sight. So, also, in grace, <i>the 
    present handful is for present use! </i>The morrow's necessity will have the 
    morrow's shower. Away with chilly fears. The Manna came as <b>surely</b> as 
    the light. Jesus never fails to pour His plenties down. Trade, then, with 
    the <i>present</i> stock. The worst of cases is the case of grace misused. 
    The <i>buried talent</i> cries with condemning voice. Christ not diffused, 
    is Christ misused. Treasure is not enjoyed, until it be well employed. He is 
    most rich, who most enriches others. 
<b>
<p align="justify">For every state and age, the Manna was the one remedy.</p></b> 
    There is only one dreadful plague. There is only one precious cure. The 
    highest palace and the humblest cot; the lettered hall and the unlettered 
    cabin; the aged bed, the cradle of the young; <i>all alike are tainted with 
    one leprous spot.</i> One only remedy meets the one malady—the remedy of the 
    life and death of Christ. 
<b>
<p align="justify">The Manna came not through man's toil. </p></b>But still it 
    came not to encourage sloth. Active labor must grind and sweeten for the 
    use. Vain is it that Christ with all salvation is at the door, vain is the 
    Bible-store, vain is the pulpit-food, except the eager soul gird up the 
    loins of eager doing. <i>Faith labors all the day to draw out sweetness from 
    the Gospel-page. </i>With skillful care it sifts each word. With anxious 
    appetite it sucks the sweet. 
<b>
<p align="justify">The Manna preaches, also, with wisdom's voice.</p></b> It 
    cries, Keep holy the Sabbath-day. It comes from heaven, therefore it 
    proclaims God's law. It comes to be a blessing, therefore it points to 
    obedience as the path. When will man's blindness learn that there is no 
    profit, and no peace, but in the ways and will of God? Who ever gained in 
    Sabbath-shops, or by a Sabbath-spade? From the seed of Sabbath-work springs 
    up a harvest of soul-piercing woe. Israel's rest was never Israel's loss.
    
<p align="justify">The Manna sustained the body for a little while. But it 
    was weak to blunt the shafts of death. In the wilderness they ate and died. 
    But Christ gives endless life to each partaking soul. Reader! drink in the 
    tidings, 'I am the living bread, which came down from heaven—if any man eat 
    of this bread, he shall live forever—and the bread that I will give is My 
    flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.'</p>
<p align="justify">Lord, increase my faith! Help me to see in Your broken 
    body, all that I need for strength, for vigor, and for joy of heart. The 
    more we crave, the more we get. The more we get, the more we crave. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The Manna lasted through the wilderness-march</p></b>. Thus 
    Jesus is an enduring supply for all life's weary way. And when <i>time's 
    crumbs</i> are no more needed, <i>eternity's full feast</i> begins. Sweet is 
    the present <i>taste</i> of grace—but what will be <i>the heavenly feast?
    </i>My soul, press onward—and you soon will know!
