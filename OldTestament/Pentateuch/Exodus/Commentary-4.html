<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE PILLAR</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">"The Lord went before them by day in a <b>pillar</b> <i>
    of a cloud</i> to lead them the way; and by night in a <b>pillar</b> <i>of 
    fire</i>, to give them light; to go by day and night." Exodus 13:21</p>
<p align="justify">The children of Israel are about to tread an unknown 
    path. A desert is before them, wide and desolate and trackless. They have no 
    chart to show the way. There are no friendly lips to counsel or to warn. 
    They must proceed, and yet they fear to stir. </p>
<p align="justify">This is a common need. Perhaps you, who read, discern 
    your very case. You have left Egypt. The hated bonds are burst. But Canaan's 
    rest is far away. An intervening wilderness extends. Hence the sigh rises in 
    your breast, Oh! that some guide were near! How can the distant end be 
    safely reached? </p>
<p align="justify">Israel's story gives the glad reply. Were they allowed to 
    wander without beckoning support? Oh, no! Whose hand, then, waved them 
    forward? Did the Lord send some natives of the wilderness to teach where the 
    paths were safe? No! Did He inspire their ruler's mind with instinct of the 
    untrodden land? No! He comes Himself. He stoops to take the office of their 
    guide. But by what method is His directing aid made clear? A visible form, 
    which every eye might see, reveals the wondrous guide. A pillar descends, 
    and rests upon the camp. When the <i>day</i> shines, it is a cloudy column. 
    When <i>darkness</i> comes, its mass is fire. Its presence never is 
    withdrawn. It moves, a signal for advance. It rests, to bid them pause. Such 
    is the protection and guidance of the desert-march. </p>
<p align="justify">Do you now ask, what is the Gospel significance of this 
    type? The type distinctly shows that <b>no believer ever moves unled.</b> 
    The prophet proves this, when he selects this emblem to portray Christ's 
    care—'Then the Lord will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who 
    assemble there a <i>cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by 
    night</i>; over all the glory will be a canopy.' The conclusion, then, is 
    sound. The <i>Pillar</i> preaches <i>Christ</i>, the preceding Shepherd of 
    His flock. Faith gazes on it, and drinks in the comfort of an ever-leading, 
    never-leaving God. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! come now, and seek some comfort for your 
    pilgrim-days, from Israel's Pillar. Especial circumstances marked it. It was 
    but one. In midday brightness, and in night's deep gloom, the substance was 
    the same. Thus Christ is ever one. He who was shadowed out in Eden; He to 
    whom Abel looked; He who was Abraham's seed and David's offspring and the 
    sweet theme of every prophet's harp; He who was pierced on Calvary and laid 
    in the grave; is the same Jesus who shall shortly come again. </p>
<p align="justify">No sinner escapes death, but through one victim, one 
    righteousness, one faith, one hope, one clinging to one cross, one cleaving 
    to one Lord, one journeying in one blood-stained path. There is one only 
    Savior of all the saved, one only door of heaven, one only plea before the 
    judgment-seat, one only ransom of a guilty soul. If Israel had turned to 
    other guidance, they would have rushed to sure destruction. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! deluded men, with Cain-like pride, frame other 
    saviors, and find no Savior. Take heed. Look only to the one Christ, and to 
    the one Bible, and to the true church. He is not divided. Do not be divided 
    from Him. </p>
<p align="justify">The Pillar ever rose in <b>firm solidity</b>. Cloudy 
    masses bend quickly before a driving breath of wind. The storm beats on 
    them, and they vanish. But <i>this</i> <i>Pillar</i> mocked the lash of 
    hurricanes and watery floods. Amid the roar of elements, it smiled unmoved, 
    immovable. It was quiet, as a rock among unquiet waves. Thus no assaults can 
    shake salvation's <i>Pillar</i>. Satan has done his worst. Each weapon which 
    hell can point has been hurled at Him. The might and craft of man have 
    marshaled all their forces. But every shaft of shrewdness, ridicule, and 
    wit; the strong man's strength, the great man's greatness, the prince's 
    power, and all plotting wiles; have fallen baffled at His feet. Reader! you 
    can have confidence in your Guide's strength. The heavens may crumble into 
    dust. But He cannot be shaken. </p>
<p align="justify">But the Pillar, though firm and solid, yet <b>changed its 
    appearance</b>. In day its look was dark. In night it shone in brilliant 
    blaze. It put on the fittest garb to gain observance. Here is <i>the tender 
    grace of Jesus!</i> Mark His unwearied efforts to draw minds towards 
    Himself. It is with this design that every Bible-page proclaims some feature 
    of His saving truth. For this, heaven-born, heaven-taught, heaven-sent 
    heralds in pulpits and by dying-beds, in public teaching and in private 
    converse, call and beseech men to behold Him, as the only way of life. What 
    more can Jesus do to cause His mercy to be fully seen? </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! if your eyes turns elsewhere, the blame is not 
    with the conspicuous Pillar. When night's mantle wrapped the earth, the 
    Pillar clad itself in robes of fire. It shone, that <i>all</i> might see. It 
    shone, that all in seeing might rejoice. Such is the love of Jesus. When is 
    His presence most clear, most cheering? Surely in the <i>dark hour</i> of 
    need. When gloom oppresses, when mists of horror rise, when prospects 
    blacken, when the beclouded eye discerns no safety and no peace in earth, 
    then the smile of Jesus gives light. Unusual glories then illumine the road.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The Pillar had an upraised arm.</p></b> Its ascending spire 
    directed to the skies. So Jesus calls us to an upward flight. How solemnly 
    He warns to rise above the mire and filth of a soul-murdering world! How 
    faithfully He tells that all its baits are poison, its touch pollution, and 
    its wages death! How tenderly He cries—Come unto Me, and leave such vanities 
    below—lean on My arm, and climb the hill of peace—mount by My side, and I 
    will bring you to a reconciled Father's throne, and the high mansions of 
    your God! Thus Jesus points to the heavens. Reader! be wise. To look to 
    Jesus is to soar to heaven. 
<p align="justify">Such were its peculiar properties. But <b>its main 
    purpose was to lead.</b> When it preceded, the willing host advanced. When 
    it stood still, their camps were fixed. They were not called to reason, or 
    to ask, or doubt. All who wish to go or tarry submitted to the ruling 
    column. Their guide was God. His will was love. His way was knowledge. His 
    end was safety. Nothing was left for them, but to observe and follow. </p>
<p align="justify">Shall twilight types outshine the Gospel sun? It cannot 
    be. The heirs of grace are cared for, as truly now as then. Their Leader is 
    the same. Be it so, that Christ directs not now by <i>visible display</i> of 
    manifested presence. Be it so, that the eye of nature sees not a moving or a 
    halting pillar. Still faith can trace an unseen hand, and the enlightened 
    mind can read the warnings of a heavenly Lord. <i>Christ guides now by His
    </i><b>Word</b><i>. </i>The Book of books is always by our side. It is a 
    present and a perfect chart. The upward path, the downward slopes, the 
    hidden snares, the plains of safety, the meadows of repose, are all here 
    pencilled with inspired skill. This is the blessed handbook of the blessed 
    route. The humble pilgrim meekly prays, 'Speak, Lord, for your servant 
    hears.' The answer tarries not—'This is the way, walk in it. Is it not 
    pledged, 'When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall keep you; 
    and when you awake, it shall talk with you; for the commandment is a lamp 
    and the law is light.' The believer's daily walk attests the truth. When 
    perils have been near, and pitfalls have gaped, and by-ways have enticed the 
    steps, a beacon from the Word has warned and saved. </p>
<p align="justify">Reader! would you reach Canaan? Then cling to this 
    ever-living guide. Search it day and night. Make it your chosen friend of 
    every hour. Engraft it by prayer into the soul of every thought. Let it 
    direct the helm of each desire. Think, as it thinks—speak, as it 
    speaks—move, as it beckons—rest, as it counsels. Your steps will then be 
    safe and pure. For the light of Scripture is the light of life. It is 
    Christ's hand, Christ's heart. What was Israel's Pillar to our open Bible's 
    page? </p>
<p align="justify">But Jesus multiplies His guiding help. He also extends 
    the <b>hand of Providence</b>. He moves the ever-moving wheels of 
    circumstances. No sparrow falls, no leaf decays, but in accordance with His 
    ordering mind. He wills, and things occur. <i>Chance</i> is a figment of a 
    dreaming pillow. It never was. It never can be. Thus to the child of God 
    there is no trifle or unimportant event. Momentous issues often hang on 
    rapid words, on sudden looks, on unintended steps. It is so, because the 
    Lord's direction plans and overrules life's every concern. </p>
<p align="justify">Hear <i>Eleazar's</i> grateful witness, 'I being in the 
    way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren.' When <i>Joseph's</i> 
    brethren thirsted for his blood, who caused the pit to be unoccupied with 
    water? Who brought the Ishmaelites to bear him into Egypt? Who gave the 
    sleepless night to Persia's <i>King</i>? Who brought the aged <i>Simeon</i>, 
    the pious <i>Anna</i>, at the exact moment, to the temple? Who led <i>
    Onesimus</i> to hear Paul's saving words at Rome?</p>
<p align="justify">But perhaps some mind may sometimes ask—Is <i>this</i> 
    event the leading of my Lord? There are sure rules. No opening is safe which 
    contradicts the Word. Christ's voice abroad, at home, without, within, is 
    always one. It calls to <i>seek God's glory, to promote redemption's 
    kingdom, to conquer self, to tread down sloth, to flee the world's applause 
    and lusts, to lift the standard of the cross, and to march boldly in the 
    path of righteousness.</i> If the path leaves these lines, avoid it. Christ 
    leads not here. Some foe misleads. </p>
<p align="justify">But Christ is a Pillar <b>with more than skill to guide.</b> 
    There is a virtue in Him to open eyes, that they may see—to quicken feet, 
    that they may follow—to tear reluctance from reluctant hearts. All this He 
    effects by His almighty Spirit. Without such light, the Bible-page is a dark 
    chaos, and wheels of Providence an intricate confusion. Sin has benumbed 
    right sense in souls. Sin has brought blindness on the inner man. But Jesus 
    speaks. The Spirit heals. Sight is restored. A new creation lives—and 
    new-born powers perceive and love and tread the heavenly road. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The Pillar had power to screen</p></b>. It is written, 'He 
    spread a cloud for <i>a covering.' </i>The scorching rays of the sandy 
    desert were thus warded from the journeying host. Reader! I trust that you 
    well know <i>the cool retreat and sheltering covert of a Savior's wings.</i> 
    The pilgrim's day is often long and hot, and darts of Satan burn with fiery 
    sting. How soon the heart would faint, how soon the worn-out strength would 
    fail, unless our Pillar cast a grateful shade. It is still true, 'The sun 
    shall not smite you by day, nor the moon by night.'
<b>
<p align="justify">The Pillar never failed</p></b>. Provoking sins abounded. 
    Ungrateful murmurs sent forth hateful sound. But still no wrath withdrew the 
    guidance. It only vanished when Jordan's stream was reached. Here is the 
    boundless grace of Jesus. If severe iniquity could quench His love, who 
    would not long ago have mourned His absence, and found life to be a starless 
    night? But no! He loves, and lovingly He guides unto the end. The Pillar 
    leaves not until the full blaze of heaven breaks forth. Like Bethlehem's 
    star, it brings to the very place where Jesus is. The beacon shines until 
    the haven is attained. Christ leads to where Christ reigns.
<p align="justify">Reader! whom do you follow? Think, Oh! think, whom do you 
    follow? There are hell-ward leaders—not a few. There are downward ways, 
    alas!—too many.</p>
