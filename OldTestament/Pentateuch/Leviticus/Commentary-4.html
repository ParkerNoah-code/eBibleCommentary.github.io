<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana" size="4"><b>THE 
    GUILT OFFERING</b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana"><i>
<p align="justify">"When a person commits a violation and sins 
    unintentionally in regard to any of the Lord's holy things, he is to bring 
    to the Lord as a penalty a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the 
    proper value in silver, according to the sanctuary shekel. It is a <b>guilt 
    offering</b>. He must make restitution for what he has failed to do in 
    regard to the holy things, add a fifth of the value to that and give it all 
    to the priest, who will make atonement for him with the ram as a <b>guilt 
    offering</b>, and he will be forgiven." </p></i>Leviticus 5:15-16
<i>
<p align="justify">Sin is a monster which has many forms! Each form has many 
    hands. Each hand deals wounds. Each wound is death. It touches to destroy. 
    But for each wound help is prepared. Jesus appears omnipotent to heal.</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">This is the truth, which Eden heard; which types 
    displayed; which prophets sang; which cheered the saints of old; which 
    martyrs sealed with blood; which faithful pastors still proclaim. This is 
    the truth, which Satan hates; which infidelity derides; which worldlings 
    tread beneath contemptuous feet. But it lives throughout the Bible-page; and 
    will live forever—the joy of heaven and the rage of hell. This is the 
    prospect, to which the Guilt offering calls. It shows a pillar with a 
    two-fold front. One indeed sternly asks for penalty. But the other brightens 
    with atonement made.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, the verses, which here meet your eye, state the 
    first case of Guilt offering. It will suffice to ponder this. The other 
    instances in name may vary, but in principle are one.</p>
<p align="justify">A soul commits a trespass, and sins through ignorance in 
    holy things. God's law is thus infringed—His will transgressed. The rewards 
    of heaven are withheld. Such are the features of offence.</p>
<p align="justify">Can unintentional sins be but trifles? Shall no wrath 
    arise? Shall deeds unholy cause no holy frown? This cannot be. Iniquity is 
    hated by our God. Can he be clean who loathes not filth? Can he be pure, who 
    shrinks not from impurity? Would not God's throne be tarnished, if sin be 
    not condemned?</p>
<p align="justify">Let this ordinance be heard. First, <b>the Guilt offering 
    unveils God's wrath.</b> Offence is dealt with terribly. The trespasser must 
    seek the altar with a ram. The victim must lay down his life. The blood must 
    flow. The costliest parts must be the food of flames. Where trespass has 
    been, death must flow. So speaks this witness, with no faltering voice.</p>
<p align="justify">Is the question asked, why is the life thus taken? What 
    means such a sacrifice, terrible in death and gore. The answer loudly 
    thunders, <i>Trespass brings death! </i>No soul can sin and live. Such is 
    the language of this solemn rite. Let all, who hear take heed.</p>
<p align="justify">Ignorance of this truth is the dark veil, which blinds 
    our race. It is the downward path, which slopes to hell. Alas! how few 
    believe, that <i>all</i> the streams of trespass flow to ruin's gulf.</p>
<p align="justify">Survey the giddy crowds, who throng earth's path. The 
    mirth—the levity—the godless words—the silly unconcern, prove, that they 
    little know the peril of their state. The current of their thoughts—the bias 
    of their being—the channel of their words and works, widely transgress the 
    law's strict rule, and still they sport, as moths around a flame. They fall 
    to sleep, as Sisera in Jael's tent. Judges 4:21. They take the dainties from 
    a treacherous hand, but neither see the hammer nor the nails. Like Amasa, 
    they seek a friend's embrace; but heed not the sword which Joab holds. 2 
    Sam. 20:10. Thus multitudes unconsciously are slain.</p>
<p align="justify">But this rite specially condemns transgression in God's
    <i>holy</i> <i>things</i>. Alas! this is a frequent case. Many 
    sacrilegiously invent a religion of their own conceit. God plainly speaks 
    from His high throne. He states His will. He shows the only path to heaven. 
    But man's indifference refuses to be taught. He pursues the light, which 
    erring reason kindles. He chooses the rags of sinful human nature, rather 
    than the Gospel-robe. But none reach heaven by such Babel-steps. This 
    trespass cloaked in a fair guise, allures a Cain-like crowd. But it is 
    trespass, and it slays the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">Some would buy heaven by the price of 'religious forms'. 
    They bring the offering of 'external rites' duly kept. They diligently tread 
    the 'ceremonial round'. They never doubt, that 'ritual strictness' will 
    secure the crown.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, take heed of error here. Truth is a narrow line. 
    Men easily diverge. On either side there is a foul descent. In Satan's creed 
    there are opposing falsehoods. One lowers 'forms' to dust. The other raises 
    them to saving worth. He cares not which delusion is embraced. But each 
    delusion is soul-peril. Forms are not nothing. They are ordained of God. 
    They feed the soul. They fan the flame of faith. Their due observance proves 
    the inward life. This is their Scripture-place.</p>
<p align="justify">But means will never cleanse one sin. They have no 
    strength to hold back vengeance. Woe then is theirs, who use them as their 
    only plea, and clasp them, as their only hope. Would that each eye discerned 
    this snare! Would that each pulpit gave a warning note! This error only 
    lives in dens of ignorance. It cannot breathe when dragged to light. But it 
    is sin. Therefore it is death. The Gospel slighted, leaves no hope.</p>
<p align="justify">But when heaven's rays in mercy dissipate these 
    mists—when error, as a murderer, is seen—then the deep sigh is heard, "Is 
    there no remedy—no refuge—no escape? Must everlasting vengeance seize me as 
    its prey?"</p>
<p align="justify">Now view the Trespass offering again. While faith 
    beholds, a saving gleam breaks forth. A dying victim comes. A substituted 
    life is taken. Another suffers in the offender's place. Pardon is granted 
    through a proxy's blood.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, here is the picture, in which faith delights. A 
    Guilt offering is prepared in Christ. He is made all your sin. He drinks 
    your every drop of woe. Amazing grace! Astounding love! This is God's way to 
    save. This is the song of all the saved—the joy of all, who really joy—the 
    hope of all, who have true hope. This is the fact, which conquers death, and 
    tramples on the grave, and gives enduring peace, and furnishes resistless 
    pleas, and satisfies each attribute of God, and crowns Jehovah with His 
    brightest crown. Look clearly at this ordinance. <i>The Guilt offering 
    bleeds, and guilt is forgiven. So Jesus dies, and His whole family is saved.</i> 
    It is a heaven-taught challenge, "Who can lay anything to the charge of 
    God's elect?" It is a heaven-brought answer, "It is God who justifies." The 
    Spirit prompts the question, "Who is He, that condemns?" The same voice 
    sounds the triumph-note, "It is Christ who died." Each Guilt offering shouts 
    aloud this truth.</p>
<p align="justify">This cup of grace is not exhausted yet. The sinner's need 
    is a vast varied field. No single image can depict its breadth. But Jesus's 
    work completely covers all. His life is laid down as guilt expiation. But <i>
    death alone</i> crowns not salvation's pyramid. More is required. More is 
    performed by Christ. More is pre-figured here. The value of the trespass 
    must be reckoned. Scales must be brought. The offender must pay down the 
    estimated cost according to the sanctuary's weight. Further addition of a 
    fifth part must be made. Equivalent will not suffice. Excess is superfluous. 
    Lev. 5:16. This rule sets guilt in a clearer light. <i>Death</i> is 
    entailed—that is the misery. <i>Debt</i> is incurred—that is the penalty and 
    shame.</p>
<p align="justify">We thus are taught, that sin defrauds God. <i>Creation's 
    law</i> makes us His sole possession. No faculty of mind or frame—no power 
    of intellect or thought—no talent of influence or time—no opportunity—no 
    gift—no grace, is property of our own. All then should serve the cause of 
    the one sovereign Lord. Reason should plan, and eyes should see, and hands 
    should work, and feet should run, to do Him honor and augment His praise. 
    Our every energy should fly abroad with morning light, to gather fruits of 
    glory for His name. Each night should prove, that faith and love have 
    labored to advance His kingdom upon earth.</p>
<p align="justify">But is it so? What is the witness of each hour? Alas! 
    SELF mounts the great Creator's throne. We rise, we enter on the day, we 
    journey on, as if self-seeking were legitimate employ. Whether we rest or 
    toil it is unto ourselves. Is not this trespass? Such is its lightest name. 
    It robs our God. It wastes His remuneration. Reader, this is a solemn 
    thought. It fixes on our souls the blackest dye of wrong. It brands us, as
    <i>purloining from a Father's and a Benefactor's treasury!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Some perhaps may ask, "can no amends be made? Can no 
    devotedness repay?" That is a vain conceit. If not one thought of any moment 
    ever swerved from a pure effort for the Lord, it would but be, that moment's 
    due. <i>Surplus of merit</i> is the papist's dream. But our best acts are 
    only increase of our debt. Hence all our works make bankruptcy more deep. 
    When justice calls to the white throne, the fairest reckoning is one huge 
    debt. Who then can stay arrest?</p>
<p align="justify">Here the true Guilt offering again presents relief. Jesus 
    is salvation to the full. Hence <i>death for sin is not the whole of his 
    grand work.</i> This decks us with no merit. It fills no hands with fruits 
    of righteousness. He must also pay<i> a whole life's homage</i> to the Law. 
    He gives compliance to its largest rule. It asked for one undeviating course 
    of love. Jesus was love without one straying step.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, if you are Christ's, this pure fulfillment of the 
    Law is for you. For you Christ wrought it. To your account He puts it. 
    Ponder its wondrous worth. Since Christ is God, Deity embodies all His acts. 
    When He obeys, it is Divine obedience. Unsullied righteousness is sought 
    from man. The righteousness cast over him is <i>the righteousness of God.</i></p>

<p align="justify">The Guilt-offerer <i>added a surplus</i>. But who can 
    weigh the surplus, which Christ brings? Jesus piles the scales, until God 
    can give, and God can take no more.</p>
<p align="justify">Such is the Gospel, which pervades this rite. It is 
    clear, and full, and rich, and precious, and divine. Reader, it comes to you 
    this day. It deals most lovingly, most closely with you. It tells you in 
    emphatic terms, that sin and guilt stain your heart, your soul, your mind, 
    your life, your every day, your every hour. It warns, that every trespass 
    strengthens Satan's claims, and fans the flames of hell. It strips off every 
    self-framed hope. It places a vast barrier between you and God. </p>
<p align="justify">But next it sweetly shows a full recovery. Christ's <i>
    cross</i> and <i>life</i> are pictured in the brightest hues. You see Him 
    dying to pay the guilt-penalty. You see His righteousness supplying 
    guilt-wrongs. He tenderly persuades, "only believe, and take My overflowing 
    cup of merit. Come, cling by faith to Me, and all your trespasses are buried 
    in My wounds—and all your guilt is covered by My robe—Come, and by faith be 
    one with Me—here is full pardon—no charge against you can be found—here is 
    full beauty—no speck of filth remains. Here is My cross—your all-sufficient 
    expiation. Here is My surplus payment—as your wealth."</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, what answer do you give? Can you reject the only 
    Guilt offering?</p>
