    STRANGE FIRE</b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana"><i>
<p align="justify">"Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put 
    fire in them and added incense; and they offered strange fire (unauthorized) 
    before the Lord, contrary to his command. So fire came out from the presence 
    of the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord."</p></i> Leviticus 
    10:1-2
<p align="justify">Sounds of high joy had just been swelling through the 
    holy court. Sure tokens of approving love had rested on the typifying altar. 
    The flame, which might not die, and which alone might now be used, witnessed 
    God's smile on the appointed victims. The Covenant of Grace was sealed anew 
    with blazing seal. The obedient worshiper had proof, that God was near 
    him—with him—for him.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, this sight is opening heaven unto us. Who would 
    not ever gaze? But earth is yet our home. Here a vile foe is always near. He 
    writhes, when souls are safely climbing Zion's hill. He saw the joys of 
    Eden, and he flew to mar. He sees the Gospel of this heaven-sent fire, and 
    he will strive to quench. So now he comes. The place is sacred, and the 
    office holy. But <i>he has keys for every gate</i>. No station is too high 
    for his foul wing. No consecrated functions scare him back.</p>
<p align="justify">He seeks the side of Aaron's first-born sons. Their 
    calling to be priests is no protecting shield. He can ascend the 
    altar-steps. He knows the fit temptation for the holiest place. So now he 
    fosters self-exalting zeal. He leads to worship; but the worship must be 
    'unauthorized'. He prompts an offering; but the offering is not God's.</p>
<p align="justify">Such was his bait. Mark its success. Nadab and Abihu take 
    each his censer. Was this God's will? Did He require this act? Their first 
    step strays. They next add fire. Whence was it brought? God had provided 
    what alone He would receive. It was not distant. An outstretched hand might 
    instantly obtain. They madly reason, What, will no other flame avail? Will 
    this alone cause incense to ascend? Impious self-will thus reasons into 
    ruin.</p>
<p align="justify">Unauthorized fire is seized, and a unauthorized service 
    acted. Oh! miserable men! their hands simulate holy work, but rebel feet 
    tread down God's ordinance. Oh! terrible result! To despise God is rapid 
    downfall. His frown is withering blight. It arms each creature with 
    destructive sting. Behold a proof. The pledge of favor inflicts sudden 
    death. The symbol of accepted service now hurls the disobedient into ruin's 
    gulf. The fire thus scorned, puts forth its mighty strength. It vindicates 
    its sacred significance. They, who rejected, cannot now cast off. It wraps 
    them in its burning arms, and lays their blackened corpses in the dust. Thus 
    Nadab and Abihu perish from the earth.</p>
<p align="justify">But still the judgment lives. This story stands, as a 
    dark beacon on a rocky coast. It cries, 'Beware, to all despisers of the 
    Gospel-scheme!' It shows, that those who stray from God's appointed path, 
    fall into quicksands of tremendous wrath.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, these lines draw near bringing this counsel to 
    your heart. Listen, with humble mind—with earnest prayer. And may the Lord 
    of mercy mercifully bless!</p>
<p align="justify">The Bible-page stands open. It courts your eyes. It 
    craves attention. It wears no dark disguise. It is an azure sky of truth. It 
    writes with an unerring pen, the mission and the work of Christ. It tells 
    you, that when you were ruined and undone—when condemnation's thunder 
    roared—the Father sent His Son, to bear the curse—to die the death—to suffer 
    in the sinner's stead, and save with uttermost salvation. These tidings 
    loudly sound their silver note. The testimony is distinct, 'Behold the Lamb 
    of God—Look to His cross—Hide in His wounds—Enter the refuge of His 
    merits—Cement yourself by faith to Him. Grasp Him as your all-prevailing 
    plea.' A train of faithful promises assures, that none thus seeking are cast 
    out. But threats re-echo, There is no other name; no other sacrifice 
    remains; despise, reject, neglect, and death without a remedy is near—and 
    hell without escapes gapes for you.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, a question meets you here—let honest truth reply. 
    Did the attesting fire on Israel's altar blaze with more brightness, than 
    this clear mind of God? Oh, no! The fact defies denial. Such is the way 
    marked out by God. Here is the door, which mercy opens. Here is the refuge 
    raised by sovereign love. Here is the cure of all sin's wounds. God gives, 
    and God authenticates, His Son, as full redemption for the lost.</p>
<p align="justify">How is such wondrous news received? Surely all earth will 
    throb with one ecstatic pulse of joy. Surely each sinew will be strained to 
    grasp the gift of gifts. But is it so? Draw back the curtains of man's 
    inmost soul. Enter the chambers, in which hidden thoughts dwell. In many 
    corners many Nadabs and Abihus lurk. They hear of Christ, and sneer. They 
    see the cross, and count it a vain thing. The fire of their own hearths is 
    their delight. They rather choose self-kindled sparks.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, draw near, and mark some leaders of this blinded 
    troop. SELF-RIGHTEOUS PRIDE claims foremost place. It is a bold unblushing 
    rebel in earth's camp. It lifts a daring head, and wears a helmet plumed 
    with nature's gaudy crest. Its mouth abounds with self-invented pleas. What 
    are they? Fancied innocence of grievous sins—a fancied treasury of virtue's 
    deeds—a train of duties towards God—a train of charity towards man. It views 
    this household flame, and fondly asks, 'What lack I more?' Ah! the rash 
    madness! Ah! the wreck of soul! Take nature's best, what is it, but a 
    noxious plant, rooted in filthy mire—laden with poison-berries—plucked by 
    polluted hand! Uplift self's purest clothing to the light of heaven. It is a 
    tattered rag. No thread is clean—no part is whole. But still for this God's 
    well-beloved Son is scorned—for this His righteousness is put aside.</p>
<p align="justify">What is the end? The judgment comes. The great white 
    throne is set. How will these Nadabs and Abihus stand? He, who alone could 
    save, is now the Judge. Where is the blood, which once flowed near? There 
    was a plea, which might have fully saved, but this was cast behind them. Can 
    a rejected Jesus, screen rejecting foes from judgement? Can a refused 
    shield, ward off death-blows? Vengeance descends, and human merit takes its 
    own wages with the lost.</p>
<p align="justify">Others confess the evil of their early years. When they 
    look back, the traversed path seems foul. They readily allow, that vile 
    transgressions soiled their hands—their feet—their hearts. But they now flee 
    all 'flagrant fault'. They have sown reformation-seeds, and gathered 
    reformation-fruits, and Cain-like, bring the produce of their fields. Here 
    Nadab and Abihu re-appear in a patched-up garb. Amendments pile their 
    censers high. This is the fire of their choice. But it is unauthorized. 
    God's altar gave not such supply.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, do not think that 'reformation' is of any worth. 
    You must be born again. None but new-born can enter heaven, or be happy 
    there. But <i>outward changes are not always grace. </i>Lot's wife left 
    Sodom, but she perished by the way. A new dress may be worn without new 
    heart. A painted surface will not purify a tomb. A Herod may reform without 
    new-birth.</p>
<p align="justify">Besides, where grace is real, it is no covering for <i>
    past</i> offences. This year's honesty has no receipts for last year's 
    debts. Again, a trust in 'reformation of life' is evidence of an unchanged 
    heart. The Spirit leads not to such rotten ground. He never prompts such 
    arrogant conceits. The saintliest man increasingly sees evil cleaving to 
    himself, as the bark to trees—as feathers to the fowl. He knows no hope, but 
    Jesus' life, and Jesus' death. This is the fire, which God prescribes. And 
    this alone the child of God will bring.</p>
<p align="justify">Some Nadabs and Abihus come with streaming eyes. Sin has 
    brought loss. Some worldly prospect has been crushed. Thus Esau weeps. 
    Conscience sometimes is quick to see the misery of guilt. Saul's flowing 
    tears own this. So, also, the Gospel's melody will often melt a heart. It 
    falls, as tender dew upon a moistening soil. Feelings relax, as ice beneath 
    the sun. In these relaxing moments, Satan whispers, 'there is merit here.' 
    The mourning spirit fondly hopes, that 'mourning' can buy peace with God. 
    The tearful eye sees virtue in its drops. Thus signs of penitence are 
    offered, as a ransom-price. Doubtless, no heart loves Christ, which hates 
    not self, and bitterly bewails its grievous state. Doubtless the arms of 
    penitence twine tightly round the cross. But seas of grief cannot wash out 
    soul-stains. Sorrow, when brought as pardon's price, is but strange fire. 
    And all unauthorized fire calls vengeance down.</p>
<p align="justify">The class of formalists may not be overlooked. They crowd 
    God's courts. Each attitude—each look—is studied reverence. Their lips drop 
    holiest words. Their hands touch holiest symbols. Their souls seem rapt to 
    heaven on devotion's wing. If <i>services</i> discharged—if <i>rites</i> 
    observed—if <i>outward show</i> were Christ, their cup of safety would be 
    full. But these are only means. In their right place, they are most salutary 
    helps—but decked as saviors—they impose; mislead; destroy. To use them, as 
    meek handmaids of the Lord, is piety's delight; to trust in them, as 
    reconciliation's price, is superstition's blind conceit. Then they become 
    strange fire. These worshipers reject the substance, and repose on signs. 
    But ritual services have in themselves no saving power. Such planks span not 
    the gaping gulf. Such ladders reach not to the throne of God. Their office 
    is to lead to Christ; and witness of His love. They are the channels of His 
    precious grace. But they wash out no sin; they satisfy no wrath; they stay 
    no vengeance; they have no key of heaven; they snatch not from the grasp of 
    Satan; they are no plea for pardon; they hold no title-deeds of glory's 
    kingdom. Christ is Salvation—Christ alone. Such is the work, which God 
    commissioned Him to work. He undertook it. And He gloriously achieved. The 
    mighty truth is ever true, "I have finished the work, which You gave Me to 
    do." They, then, who now present another sacrifice, like Nadab and Abihu 
    sin—like Nadab and Abihu die.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, now view your censer; now say, what are its 
    contents. Surely you hold some 'offering' in your hands. Surely some 
    confidence keeps conscience still. What is it? God has sent forth His 
    Son—the only way—the only truth—the only life—the only ransom-price—the one 
    atonement, for all sin. Is He the rock, on which you rest? Is He the center 
    of your hopes? Is He the one foundation of your trust? Is He your only 
    argument for mercy? One sun illuminates the world. One ark delivered from 
    the flood. One Joseph fed in times of famine. One brazen-serpent healed the 
    poison's sting. One fire came down for tabernacle-use. One Savior saves the 
    saved. One Christ is first and last to merit life. God sends, anoints, 
    accepts, proclaims Him. If you plead Him in real faith, you cannot fail. To 
    grasp another savior, is to grasp a straw.</p>
<p align="justify">Hark, Abel and all saints of old, and all believers of 
    all times, and the one shout around the throne, tell, that eternal safety is 
    beneath His wings. Hark, the wild wails of Cains, and Nadabs, and Abihus, 
    warn, that other fire kindles a quenchless flame. Christ, by God's will, is 
    heaven's gate. Strange offerings are hopeless hope. And hopeless hope must 
    plunge in black despair.</p>
