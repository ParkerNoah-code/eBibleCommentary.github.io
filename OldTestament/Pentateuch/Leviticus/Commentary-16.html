    Drink Offering</b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">Henry Law, 1855<i><br/> <br/>    "You must also offer one quart of wine as a drink 
    offering."</i> Leviticus 23:13</p>
<p align="justify">What a changed scene would earth become, if every heart 
    yielded its throne to Christ! His smile is life. His lips drop grace. His 
    rule is purity and peace. To realize—I am the Lord's—the Lord is mine—is 
    remedy for every care.</p>
<p align="justify">That there is true happiness in piety is among the 
    lessons of the Tabernacle-rites. On most occasions wine is outpoured, within 
    these courts; and a Drink offering completes the worship. This seems 
    intended to express, that gladness thrills throughout the soul, which 
    renders homage to a reconciled God.</p>
<p align="justify">Eternal Spirit, grant Your revealing rays, that so the 
    Drink offering may shed enlivening savor round!</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, begin by viewing well the offering now brought. 
    There is a cup produced. The contents of this are wine. Can faith hear this, 
    and not fly swiftly to the last Paschal-feast? Oh! wondrous sight! The time 
    is fully come for shadows to recede. The mighty substance brightly shines. 
    He, to whom all types point, at this grand moment, takes a cup full of the 
    juice of vine. Ponder His action—feast upon His words. He uplifts thanks, 
    then gives the vessel to His little flock. "This is my blood of the New 
    Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins." Matt. 26:28.</p>
<p align="justify">At this hallowed feast we safely reach one eminence of 
    truth. Wine is here chosen as a Gospel-sign. It henceforth bears divine 
    inscription. It takes its place among the holiest symbols. "This is my 
    blood." Our hands thus find a key, which opens the mystic treasure-house of 
    the Drink offering. The vessel holds the choicest emblem of redeeming grace. 
    We may no more behold it, without the prominent remembrance of blood.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, mark the Drink offering now, and let deep 
    reverence deepen. Its fluid shows that stream from Calvary, which is 
    exceeding preciousness in heaven and earth. Jesus has blood, or else He is 
    not man. Without it, He is no kinsman to our race. He must be man, if He 
    will be man's surety. He must have blood, if He will verily be man. But He 
    assumes it without ceasing to be God. His blood is man's, and yet divine. 
    His blood is God's, and yet human. Mystery of grace! Angels marvel, while 
    they view it. Saints in heaven record its power. Saints on earth plead it, 
    and are saved. My soul, rejoice in it! Love, praise, and use it more. The 
    wine within the cup touches at once these strings of thought.</p>
<p align="justify">Next, what is the offerer's act? More is here seen than a 
    cup brought. It is poured out for a sweet savor unto the Lord. Num. 15:7.</p>
<p align="justify">We thus advance to see Christ pouring forth the blood, 
    which He adopts. Until it flows, remission is not bought. Heb. 9:22. But His 
    blood is not withheld. See in the garden, how it falls in showers. Behold 
    the sufferer on the cross. His brow—His hands—His feet—His side—His heart, 
    weep as an open torrent. Oh! blessed proof of full atonement made! Without 
    this sight the trembling heart can find no peace. But in these drops we read 
    Salvation finished. The trickling stream sends forth its voice; the Son of 
    God thus dies—a death divine is thus endured—the Lamb from all eternity 
    ordained is thus vicariously slain.</p>
<p align="justify">Children of men, none perish, because Jesus bowed not the 
    head. Myriads rush hell-ward trampling on His cross. Take heed. The blood is 
    shed, that souls may live. But its neglect is all despair. The outpoured 
    wine thus preaches the atoning death.</p>
<p align="justify">We now approach the peculiar instruction from this 
    offerer's cup. Wine is the sign of gladness. It speaks of lively, happy 
    feeling. It is not an unmeaning word, "Wine, which cheers God and man." 
    Judges 9:13. Thus this one symbol connects blood and joy.</p>
<p align="justify">We now are led to the <b>delights</b>, which flow from 
    the redeeming cross. It is expansive joy in heaven and earth.</p>
<p align="justify">In <i>heaven</i>—because it clears the way for grace to 
    execute its plans. From all eternity, <i>God</i> willed to people heaven 
    with exulting souls. Before man was, salvation was decreed. But mighty 
    barriers interposed. How can they disappear? Sin sank a fathomless abyss. 
    How can sin-fettered spirits pass to heaven? God's council-chamber heard 
    conflicting claims. While mercy wept; stern justice frowned. Truth closed 
    the door, which love would sincerely expand. But Jesus smooths each 
    hindrance. He brings all attributes to one consent. God now beholds His 
    chosen race complete in Christ, all ready for admission to His throne. His 
    heart desires no more. His banished ones are all brought back. His loved 
    ones are all fully saved. He sits a glorious Father, at a crowded table. 
    Each seat is occupied. The chorus lacks no voice. This is the noble triumph 
    of the cross. God is well pleased. The word is true. The Drink offering of 
    redeeming blood cheers God.</p>
<p align="justify">And do not <i>angels</i> find their share of joy? Their 
    tender hearts yearn tenderly for man. When but one sinner turns to God, 
    there is loud swell in the celestial song. Luke 15:10. How must the praise 
    roll on, when, one by one, a countless multitude flocks to the cross? This 
    blessedness comes all through Christ. Without His death—without His 
    work—Satan retains his sway. Angels might pity, but they could not help. If 
    they should all consent to die, their suffering would leave man lost. But 
    where they fail, Christ gloriously prevails. He saves 
    fully—wholly—everlastingly—a world of souls. Deep is the rapture, then, when 
    heaven's bright inhabitants shout, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain." O my 
    soul, it will be sweet to hear that song. It will be sweeter to respond, 
    'Amen!' Thus Christ is heaven's delight.</p>
<p align="justify">The Drink offering next shows, that here is <i>man's</i> 
    unfathomable flood of bliss. But where are words to testify the joy of 
    faith? The Spirit pauses, and exclaims, "Unspeakable." 1 Pet. 1:8. What 
    lips, then, will attempt to speak it? It is far easier to count earth's 
    flowers, than the rich jewel of this diadem. But gratitude will strive, 
    where power must fail. God Himself is the believer's overflowing cup. The 
    great Creator—the sovereign Lord of all—becomes the portion of the family of 
    faith. At all times there is access to His smile. The weary head may always 
    rest upon a loving breast. When the lips plead, My Father and my God—my God 
    and Father—then the full heart can throb no happier throb.</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus is in this cup. He invites us to read all His 
    heart. It is a volume of firm love. He loved before the worlds were made. He 
    loves, when worlds have ceased to be. He loves so largely, that He gladly 
    gives Himself. He loves so fervently, that heaven seems vacant, until the 
    redeemed sit enthroned beside Him. The soul, assured of a saving interest in 
    this love, is on a solid pedestal of joy.</p>
<p align="justify">The Holy Spirit is not absent. He is sent forth to bless. 
    He finds the heart dead, cold, vile, profuse with nature's weeds. The eyes 
    now open to discern self's filth, and to adore the beauties of the Lord. 
    Faith springs to being, and bounds rapidly to Christ. It nestles in the 
    willing arms. It washes in the streaming side. Each day now dawns a grand 
    reality of bliss. Life is not life, unless thus Spirit-born, and 
    Spirit-taught, and Spirit-led, and Spirit-fed.</p>
<p align="justify">Angels hover round. They count it honor to subserve God's 
    blood-bought flock. They shelter with their ministering wings. They cease 
    not guardian-service, until they escort the liberated spirit in its upward 
    flight. Let them exult, who are surrounded by this host of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Heaven super-adds its prospects of delight. It is a 
    purchased home. From all eternity it was prepared. Jesus still works to make 
    each mansion suitable. As flesh and blood cannot inherit: so mortal mind 
    cannot conceive the awaiting bliss. But there are thrones, and crowns, and 
    robes of white, and palms of victory, and songs of triumph. There is the 
    tree of life, and living fountains, and hidden manna, and no more going out. 
    Faith holds the keys of glory's palace. Shall it not pour out the Drink 
    offering of joy?</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Providence</p></i> contributes daily peace. To many eyes this 
    is a misty whirl. All seems confusion, without aim, or cause, or 
    significance. Such thought is vanity's fond dream. No sparrow falls without 
    our Father's hand. Each incident acts out a wise decree. Prosperity awakens 
    praise, and brings God nearer to the view. Adversity shows earth's poor 
    emptiness, and self's dependence, and so deepens filial trust. Wealth gives 
    ability to glorify the Giver. Constricted means endear the heavenly prize. 
    Life is the season to gain grace. Death lands on the eternal shore. Thus all 
    events sow seed of good. Such is faith's Drink offering cup. It holds all 
    this—and more—much more.
<p align="justify">Believer, your Gospel-right is joy like this. God opens 
    wide the gate, and calls you to your heritage. No, He commands you to 
    partake. Hark! it is His voice, "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say 
    rejoice." Phil. 4:4. If then your head sinks down, when thus enjoined to 
    lift it up, you scorn the Word, and wrong your soul.</p>
<p align="justify">The Drink offering was duly brought by Israel's sons. To 
    have refused, would have been bold rebellion. Is it less evil to go 
    mourning, when God invites to gladness? Would not the angels raise 
    triumphant songs, if Gospel-hopes were placed within their reach? Would they 
    be sad, if called to your estate?</p>
<p align="justify">But may not cases be, when joy hangs withered in the 
    Christian hand? It is so, when erring steps stray from the Gospel-path. Joys 
    are luxuriant flowers beside the way of life. But if forbidden ground is 
    sought, the feet are pierced by thorns, and gathering clouds obscure the 
    cheering light. If Satan gain advantage, through prayer checked, or means of 
    grace forsaken, or evil thoughts retained, then gloom and darkness follow.</p>
<p align="justify">But there may be return. Child of God, if you have 
    entered evil climate, marvel not, that flowers fade. But still give thanks, 
    that yet you live to mourn. Utter the prayer—which never can go forth in 
    vain—"Restore unto me, the joy of Your Salvation, and uphold me with Your 
    free Spirit."</p></font><font face="Verdana"> Ps. 51:12.
<p align="justify">Reader, you thus see the truth, that joys walk closely by 
    the side of Christ. But they walk only there. We cannot breathe without the 
    air. We cannot see without the light. Fruits ripen not without the sun. The 
    soul is joyless, if it deserts joy's only home.</p>
<p align="justify">We see much misery, and hear sad moans. The cause is 
    evident. Christ dwells not in the heart, and therefore sorrow holds it as 
    his own. Learn, that all search for happiness is vain, except in Christ. 
    Apart from Him, God gives it not. He then is a consuming fire. Heaven cannot 
    grant it, for out of Christ there is no channel of conveyance. Some dig for 
    it in the LAW'S mine. Nothing but curse can thence be brought. So, also, 
    SELF is a stream, whence bitter waters flow. The WORLD allures to 
    disappoint. Riches bring cares, and often stretch departing wings. Health, 
    friends, and honors, drop the mask, and show a mocking skeleton.</p>
<p align="justify">Who can read this, and turn again to vain pursuits? You, 
    who know Christ, and long to drive distress and anguish from our earth, the 
    means are ready. Use them—use them. Diffuse the knowledge of Christ's saving 
    name. Open a door, that God's word may have freer course. Enlarge the 
    Missionary-band. Convey glad tidings to the lost at home—abroad. Let your 
    one effort be to <i>expel sorrow by admitting Christ.</i></p>
