<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">by Henry Law, 1855<i><br/> <br/>    "Then he will burn it on top of the wood fire on the 
    altar. It is a whole <b>burnt offering</b> made by fire, very pleasing to 
    the Lord."</i> Leviticus 1:17</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, you are invited here to take your stand within 
    the tabernacle's court. A crowded and a busy scene appears. Many worshipers 
    bring many offerings. All is activity. But all the active zeal has one great 
    object—to honor God in God's appointed way.</p>
<p align="justify">Each offering in this court is a full page of 
    Gospel-truth. Christ in His grace and work is the golden key to open every 
    part. Leviticus is Calvary fore-shown. Calvary is Leviticus unfolded. The 
    one casts forward the morning ray. The other pours down the mid-day blaze. 
    But the early and the brighter beams stream from one Sun—Christ Jesus. The 
    brazen altar is the herald of the cross. The cross re-echoes to the brazen 
    altar's voice.</p>
<p align="justify">In a long train of ceremonial teaching the Burnt offering 
    takes the lead. Let this, then, first be noticed.</p>
<p align="justify">An offerer comes. Mark what he brings. If his offering be 
    from the herd, it must be an unblemished male. Lev. 1:3. It must be the <i>
    choicest</i> produce from his pastures—the primest flower from his fields. 
    There must be <i>strength</i> in fullest vigor, and <i>beauty</i> without 
    one alloy. Such are the properties required.</p>
<p align="justify">The meaning is distinct. Jesus is here. The victim chosen 
    before worlds were framed is thus portrayed. <b>Strength</b> and perfection 
    are main colors in His portrait. He is as strong as God can be. The shield 
    of omnipotence is on His arm. Hence He is able to achieve the grandest of 
    all victories—even to tread down Satan and his empire. Hence He is able to 
    bear away the weightiest of all burdens—even the vast mass of all His 
    people's sin!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Perfection</p></b> finds embodiment in Him. His every aspect 
    is beauty, without one flaw. All evil buffeted Him, but it left no stain. 
    Sin could not touch Him, though He sojourned in its home. Earth saw in Him 
    one sinless inhabitant. From the manger to the cross, He shone one ray of 
    godlike purity.
<p align="justify">O my soul, you need strong help. Repose on Jesus: His 
    strength suffices, and it cannot fail. You need a perfect ransom and a 
    perfect robe. Repose on Jesus; He gave to God a spotless life, a spotless 
    soul, to be your price. He gives to you a spotless righteousness to be your 
    clothing. Thus the unblemished male pictures the beauteous and the strong 
    Redeemer.</p>
<p align="justify">We next approach the chambers of the offerer's heart. We 
    read, "He shall offer it of his own voluntary will." Lev. 1:3. There is no 
    compulsion. There is no reluctance. His step is willingness.</p>
<p align="justify">This is a picture of faith's happy actings. Its 
    chariot-wheels move swiftly. It feels sin's miserable need. It knows the 
    value of redeeming blood. So it flies, with rapid wing, to plead it at the 
    mercy-seat. Formalists may frequent God's courts. Habit's cold chains may 
    drag them. Self-righteousness may urge them to the heartless task. But faith 
    is a willing grace.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The eager offerer puts his hand upon the victim's head</p></b>. 
    Lev. 1:4. Do any ask the meaning of this rite? It graphically shows a 
    transfer. Some load oppresses, which is thus cast on the victim. Some burden 
    passes to another's person. Here is again the happy work of faith. It brings 
    all guilt, and heaps it on the Savior's head. One sin retained is misery 
    now, and hell at last. All must be pardoned by being brought to Christ. And 
    He is waiting to receive. His office is to be this burden-bearer. His love 
    constrains, and He cannot draw back.
<p align="justify">Do any read this, who never have thus dealt with Christ? 
    Sirs, where are your sins? They adhere tighter than your very skin. They 
    have a millstone weight. They press to misery's unfathomable depths. But 
    flee to Jesus. He can remove them all, and He alone.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, where are your sins? On Jesus they are placed, 
    and you are free. I ask again, Where are your sins? You answer, "As far as 
    the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from 
    us." Ps. 103:12. You may rejoice and sing aloud, Christ is accepted as a 
    substitute for me; I shall not be condemned. Thus with one hand faith casts 
    away all misery, and with the other grasps all joy.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The victim</p></b>, to which sins thus typically pass, <b>
    must</b> <b>DIE</b>. "He shall kill the young bull before the Lord." Lev. 
    1:5. Can Jesus, who in reality receives our guilt, not lay down life? It 
    cannot be. The holy Word stands sure; "In the day that you eat thereof, you 
    shall surely die." Gen. 2:17. The sinner's surety, then, cannot be spared. 
    He gives His life to pay the debt—to satisfy the wrath—to bear the curse—to 
    expiate the guilt.
<p align="justify">O my soul, "Christ died" is all your hope—your plea—your 
    remedy—your life. "Christ died" opens your path to God. "Christ died" turns 
    every frown into approving smiles. When the law thunders, and conscience 
    quakes, and Satan accuses, interpose "Christ died," and fear no more. When 
    the grave opens, whisper "Christ died," and sleep in peace. When the white 
    throne is set, shout "Christ died," and take the crown of righteousness!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The victim's blood is SPRINKLED "round about upon the 
    altar."</p></b> Lev. 1:5. The <i>blood</i> is evidence that <i>life</i> is paid. 
    This token then is profusely scattered. The priestly hands bedewed the altar 
    with it. Thus Jesus enters with His own blood into the holy place. Heb. 
    9:12. He strews it round, and claims the purchased flock, the covenanted 
    blessings—the full reward, the fruit of His completed work.
<p align="justify">O my soul, you are bought, and cleansed, and comforted by 
    blood. Your every blessing is a blood-bought gift. Let every prayer, and 
    praise, and work, and service, be a blood-sprinkled offering.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The victim is next SKINNED</p></b>. Lev. 1:6. The skin is 
    torn away. The sacrificing priest received this, as his portion. It gave 
    supplies of clothing. Is there no Gospel here?—say you, who joy in Jesus as 
    "the Lord your righteousness." Yes, here is a picture of that heaven-pure 
    robe, in which Christ decks each child of faith. His blood, indeed, removes 
    all curse. But it is His obedience, which merits all glory. Because He died, 
    we live. Because He lived, we reign.
<p align="justify">The piercing knife divides the limbs.<b> </b>Members are 
    torn from members, and <b>all the parts</b>, without, within, to which 
    defilement usually adheres, are diligently <b>washed</b>. Lev. 1:9. The type 
    of Jesus must be clean. No shadow of impurity may darken it. Again and again 
    the truth resounds, that God's eye can only rest on perfect purity. How, 
    then, shall the sinner stand, who ventures near apart from Christ? Reader, 
    consider this at once! Oh! never rest until you know, that you are cleansed 
    without by cleansing blood, and cleansed within by sanctifying grace.</p>
<p align="justify">The parts thus severed, and thus washed, are placed upon 
    the altar. <b>Consuming fire is brought. </b>It preys on every limb. The 
    raging flame devours, until this fuel is reduced to ashes. Lev. 1:9.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us now seek the truth, which echoes from this blazing 
    fire. The garden and the cross unfold it. There Jesus presents Himself, 
    laden with all the sins of all His chosen race. O my soul, have you a saving 
    interest in Him? If it be so, He there appears, bearing the guilt of all 
    your guilty life. <i>The Sinless is accounted sinful, that the sinful may be 
    spared as sinless.</i></p>

<p align="justify">What then occurs? Sin merits wrath. This wrath must fall. 
    Justice must claim its due. Truth must be true. Holiness must show how evil 
    is abhorred. The majesty and honor of God's empire cannot descend from their 
    high throne. Sinner, be sure that sin cannot be spared. You must take woe, 
    except this Surety take it for you.</p>
<p align="justify">What then occurs? See Jesus crushed to the earth beneath 
    the load of anguish. Each bleeding pore proclaims, that more cannot be 
    borne.</p>
<p align="justify">But whence is the God-man's mighty agony? The fire of 
    heaven's wrath has fallen on Him. Vengeance has seized its prey. He 
    undergoes the every pang, which would have tortured His redeemed people, if 
    they had tossed in hottest flames forever. The fire burns—the anger 
    rages—until each sin has infinitely suffered what it infinitely earned. No 
    fuel then remains. All is consumed. The fire dies. The wrath expires. Hark! 
    Jesus utters the wondrous word, "It is finished!"</p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, in calm and holy reverence, survey this 
    dreadful scene. It is your ransom. It is your escape. It is your rescue from 
    eternal ruin. It is another draining hell's cup for you. This one Burnt 
    offering receives all vengeance. The fire of justice, that died in Christ, 
    cannot revive to injure you.</p>
<p align="justify">The Spirit seals the record with this approving seal—"It 
    is a Burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the 
    Lord." Lev. 1:9. Here is witness worth ten thousand worlds. Here is the 
    sweetest cordial, which the lips of faith can drink. The dying Jesus is 
    heaven's "sweet savor." When the God-man victim burns upon the altar of the 
    cross, each attribute is <i>satisfied</i>; no more, <i>exults</i> with 
    ever-exulting joy; no more, is <i>magnified</i> to the highest heights; no 
    more, is <i>glorified</i> until glory overflows.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, the type blazes to win you to the saving cross. 
    Whatever be your state or grade, be wise, and seek your richest pleasures 
    here. The rite distinctly shows, that rich and poor alike need pardon, and 
    alike must come. Sin has soiled all. All, then, must wash in expiating 
    blood. The wealthy brought their victim from the herd. He, who had less of 
    worldly wealth, offered his lamb or kid. The poorest inhabitant of the 
    poorest hut gave the young pigeon or the turtle-dove. All placed upon the 
    altar a burnt-sacrifice. A Savior is the one need of rich and poor. The 
    richest is most poor, until Christ be found. The poorest is most rich, when 
    once this pearl be clasped.</p>
<p align="justify">Such is the Gospel of the Burnt offering. Reader, leave 
    it not without three solemn thoughts deep written in your heart.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. Fire burns there. </p></b>It burns to tell us what is 
    sin's due. It frightfully portrays what all must bear, on whom that plague 
    abides. Look at the consuming blaze and meditate on the tossings of the 
    fiery lake—the flames, which cannot die—the gnawings of the ever-gnawing 
    worm—the raging of relentless wrath—the agony, which tortures mind, and 
    soul, and body. See in this sight God's utmost power put forth to inflict 
    utmost pains through endless ages. See sin's sure doom. May the sight drive 
    you rapidly to Christ!
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Mark here God's wondrous grace.</p></b> To save lost souls 
    He gives the Son of His love to the fury of His wrath. He heaps all woe on 
    Him, that no woe may remain for the redeemed. His frown is pitiless towards 
    Him, that He may smile unceasingly on them. How dear must they be to His 
    heart! He, who is the preciousness of heaven, descends to bear the worst of 
    their vile doom. The Burnt offering sweetly cries, Abundant grace exceeds 
    abundant sin.
<b>
<p align="justify">3. What shall the ransomed render to salvation's Lord?
    </p></b>The Burnt offering demands from them self offering. Let all heaven 
    hear—let all earth take knowledge, that they give themselves, their souls, 
    their bodies, their every faculty and gift, all influence, all means, their 
    morning, midday, evening hours, to be a free-will sacrifice to free grace. 
    Let the high altar of self-consecrating gratitude be raised. Let the whole 
    life be one clear blaze of flaming love and ever-brightening service!
