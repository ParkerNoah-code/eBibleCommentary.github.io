    PLAGUE OF LEPROSY</b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">Henry Law, 1855<i><br/> <br/>    And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be 
    torn, and his head bare. Then, as they go from place to place, they must 
    cover their mouth and call out, 'Unclean! Unclean!' </i>Leviticus 13:45</p>
<p align="justify">The mercy of mercies is a Savior given. But a Savior 
    given is a Savior scorned, <i>until deep need is felt.</i> Hence mercy 
    super-adds a gracious work. It paints a man's malady in hideous tints. It 
    drags the lurking monster to clear light. The conscious sufferer thus sees 
    his plague, and hastens to the healing fount. The Leprosy subserved this 
    end.</p>
<p align="justify">They err, then, who see nothing but judgment in this foul 
    disease. Keen was its woe. No cup of misery held more bitter drops. But 
    still its voice allured to peace. It showed, in a long train of emblem, the 
    complex loathsomeness of sin, that hence the evil might be more abhorred. 
    Thus when the time was come for Israel's sons to gain new insight of 
    redemption's scheme, this malady appeared, as admonition of soul-sense. 
    Thus, also, when the great Healer trod our earth, the frequent Leper 
    received aid. The outward misery taught a deeper plague, while ready cure 
    cast light on saving grace.</p>
<p align="justify">This malady crept on with stealthy step. It was not 
    easily discerned. Here human skill was blind. The art most conversant in 
    signs of sickness, traced not these symptoms. Wisdom from on high was 
    needed. The sanctuary must be sought. The anointed Priest must search. His 
    mind alone could ascertain. His lips alone could manifest the case.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, turn now to that deep evil—sin. Its poison lurks 
    within the veins. Its deadly venom spreads throughout the frame. Its 
    deathful work is running on. But nature feels it not. The world has no 
    detecting eye. Poor reason views it with no shuddering glance. The 
    self-pleased soul boasts of fancied health. Death is begun, when all seems 
    life. The plague devours, but ignorance sees not.</p>
<p align="justify">The dream must last, until a power beyond man's shall 
    rouse the sleeper. This is the Spirit's sole prerogative. He only can 
    convince of sin. He only can reveal the inborn and defiling sore. He works 
    this knowledge mainly by the Word. In sanctuary hours, or in the stillness 
    of retired thought, he sets the soul before the mirror of God's law. He 
    tears away the blinding scales. He opens sightless eyes. What follows? The 
    sinner startles. A frightful spectacle appears. It is the hideousness of 
    polluted SELF. Soundness is fled. Health and fresh beauty lie, as a withered 
    leaf. He stands revealed one noisome mass of wide-spread misery. The light 
    from heaven shows Leprosy throughout. The unsuspected filth is no more 
    hidden. Thus when God's voice is heard within, the conscience answers, 'I am 
    vile.'</p>
<p align="justify">Was it not so with <i>Job</i>? He plumed himself on moral 
    rectitude, and upright walk. By outward hearing he had some surface-notions 
    of his God, and therefore only surface-notions of himself. But when his 
    opened eye beheld heaven's truth, he quickly saw the loathsomeness of self. 
    His Leprosy was clear. His piteous cry confessed, "I abhor myself, and 
    repent in dust and ashes." Job 42:6. <i>Isaiah's</i> case bears further 
    witness. In soul he was a Leper but he knew it not, until revelations met 
    him from above. The brightness of the Lord shone forth. The blackness of 
    poor man was the dark contrast. Hear the contrition of his humbled spirit, 
    "Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell 
    in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, 
    the Lord of Hosts." Is. 6:5.</p>
<p align="justify">Through many years <i>Paul</i> boasted of his blameless 
    life. He felt no conscience pains. He seemed some lovely tree, whose 
    branches bowed with golden fruit. He thus portrays himself, "I was alive 
    without the law once." I knew not my Leprous state. But the Priest searched 
    me with a penetrating eye. "The commandment came." It probed me to the soul. 
    Then "sin revived." The malady, which slept, started to giant life, "and I 
    died." He felt the Leprosy's entwining grasp. In agony he sighs, "O wretched 
    man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death." Rom. 7:24.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, it may be, that self-ignorance locks you in its 
    dark cell. Listen, I beg you, to this warning voice. Oh! perish not 
    self-murdered. Reject the opiate of 'imagined' soundness. Sleep not to death 
    on poppied pillows of false health. Think of the multitudes, who knew not, 
    that the plague had seized them, until they awoke in dungeons, where cure 
    never comes. Bring heart, and thoughts, and ways, and life, to the true 
    standard of the Word. Sit down beneath its all-revealing beams. Consult not 
    the world's counsel. Take not its faulty measure. Call in the faithful 
    witness, which neither errs nor leads astray. View self in Scripture-mirror. 
    What, though the sight shall humble you to dust? Go on. Shrink not. 
    Self-knowledge is a step towards Christ. The malady perceived leads to the 
    malady relieved. Sin, when thus felt, extorts the cry, "Heal me, and I shall 
    be healed."</p>
<p align="justify">The sufferer hears the Priest's condemning voice. He is 
    pronounced Unclean. He goes forth. He tastes no more the joy of social 
    scenes. Shunning and shunned, he hides himself in gloom. His face, his whole 
    demeanor, proclaim the misery of his downcast heart. Earth cannot find a 
    picture of more woeful woe. His clothes are torn. His head is bare. A 
    covering hides his upper lip. And when the hollow voice must speak, it 
    sounds the plaintive knell, "Unclean, unclean."</p>
<p align="justify">These marks write fearfully the wretchedness of sin.<b> 
    The clothes are torn.</b><i> </i>This meaning is distinct. It is the signal 
    of the bitterest grief. The Scripture-page gives many proofs. <i>Jacob</i> 
    beholds the blood-stained coat of Joseph. His son, his much-beloved son, is 
    surely slain. Did ever heart so bleed? All comfort fails. In token of his 
    live-long woe, he tears his clothes.</p>
<p align="justify">It was a mournful day, when <i>David</i> and his subjects 
    followed Abner's casket. The public sorrow must be publicly displayed. The 
    king's command was, "Tear your clothes." 2 Sam. 3:31.</p>
<p align="justify">Message on message followed fast to <i>Job</i>, and each 
    was burdened with a heavier note. His goods are a wild wreck—his sons all 
    slain. Deep waters overflow his soul, and a torn mantle proves a heart 
    forlorn. Job. 1:20. Thus where sorrow's wounds were deep, the tattered robe 
    proclaimed the inward state.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, should not he grieve, who feels the burden of his 
    guilt? What sorrow is like his? The loss of righteousness is more than loss 
    of property and friends. There is no ruin like the frown of God. Shall not 
    his eyes then weep, who hates himself—who dares not look to God—who has no 
    resting-place on earth—no resting-place beyond? There is no Leprosy like 
    sin. There is no Leper like the sinner. Shall the Leprosy be clad in 
    tattered garments—and shall not sin sit mourning in the dust?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The head must bend uncovered.</p></b> This was the attitude 
    of lowly shame. Job felt abasement and bewailed, "He has stripped me of my 
    glory, and taken the crown from my head." Job. 19:9. The bereaved Aaron may 
    show no sign of degradation. Therefore the command is, "Uncover not your 
    heads." Lev. 10:6.
<p align="justify">In the poor Leper thus despoiled, we see how sin inflicts 
    an ignominious brand. Should not shame's home be on the sinner's brow? Hear 
    Ezra's piteous wail, "O my God, I am ashamed, and blush to lift up myself to 
    You, my God." But why this shame? "Our iniquities are increased over our 
    head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens." Ezra 9:6.</p>
<p align="justify">Is there disgrace in folly—in rebellion—in ingratitude—in 
    disobedience to a tender Father's rule? These lines all center in the 
    sinner's heart. His life is one mistake. Is not that folly? His rebel hands 
    are raised against the King of kings. His hardness hates a blessing God. His 
    impious feet tread down a loving Father's will. Thus sin and shame are 
    linked. Our guilty parents hasten to hide themselves; and Paul's bold 
    challenge is, "What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now 
    ashamed?" Rom. 6:21.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">A covering hides his upper lip. </p></b>The muffled mouth is 
    sign, that silence is enjoined. The sorrowing and the shame-stricken find 
    their utterance choked. This marked the prophets, from whom God withdrew. 
    "Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded; yes, they 
    shall all cover their lips, for there is no answer of God." Mic. 3:7. Sin 
    should be mute. While faithful lips abound in prayer, and send forth songs 
    of praise, and tell in gladsome strains the wonders of redeeming grace; what 
    are the sinner's sounds? His throat is an open sepulcher. Let, then, that 
    sepulcher be closed. His words sow seeds of evil. Let, then, those words be 
    checked.
<p align="justify">But if some passing steps draw near, a piteous warning 
    must be heard. A doleful mutter sounds the repelling note, <b>"Unclean, 
    unclean."</b> Approach not. There is pollution here, "Unclean, unclean."</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, close not your eyes to sin's intense malignity. 
    It is unutterable filth. See the priest Joshua before iniquity passed from 
    him. He stood filth-soiled before the Angel. Zech. 3:3. A true word paints 
    our nature state, "We are all as an unclean thing, and all our 
    righteousnesses are as filthy rags." Is. 64:6. The heart is every foul 
    bird's cage—the spring of every impure desire. The waters, which flow forth, 
    are filthy pollution. The hands touch but to soil, The feet leave impress of 
    defilement. The sinner speaks, and noxious blight flies round. His words, 
    his looks, his ways, his life, bear one black stamp, "Unclean, unclean."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The Leper is cast out from social life.</p></b> No home may 
    welcome him. No friendly hearth may cheer. His dwelling is far off from men. 
    In solitary loneliness he pines. No station gains exemption. A Miriam must 
    be shut out. Num. 12:14. Kingly Uzziah must dwell alone. 2 Kings 15:5. Ah! 
    sin, what have you done? Let sinning angels, driven from heaven's light, 
    reply. Let multitudes, who know not the ecstacy of close communion with 
    their God—who walk not in sweet company with Zion's sons—whose hearts ascend 
    not on the wing of social praise—who share not the holy fellowship of common 
    prayer—who kneel not delighted at the consecrated table; let these sad 
    exiles from the heaven-bound flock, tell the lone miseries of their 
    desert-life.
<p align="justify">But is this all? Death is at hand. Eternity is near; a 
    gulf will then forever part the filthy sinner from salvation's blessed 
    throng. God is afar off; He cannot be reached. Jesus is high above. There is 
    no longer access to His arms. Heaven's gates are barred. The saved are all 
    within—within forever. The lost are all outside—outside forever. Thus the 
    Leper stands an emblem of sin's deathful plague.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, why are these frightful colors laid? Why is the 
    sight thus brought before your eyes? Is it, that hopeless horror may 
    affright? Is it, to sink you in despair's abyss? Far otherwise. Mercy here 
    scares you; but it is to mercy's arms. The great High Priest is near. He 
    comes to earth with "healing on His wings." He cries to every weary, 
    heavy-laden soul, "Come unto Me, and I will give you rest." You need not be 
    an outcast from His flock. He bids you nestle in His wounded side. He gives 
    His blood to purify each taint. His remedy is ready and is sure. Take it. 
    Oh! take it, and be whole. Turn not from His outstretched hand. Harken to 
    His cry, 'I will make you clean.' Rest not, until adoring lips reply, 'Great 
    Lord, Your touch has touched me, and my plague is stopped.'</p>
