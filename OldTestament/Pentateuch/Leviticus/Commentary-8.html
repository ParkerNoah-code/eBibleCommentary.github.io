<p align="justify">"To make a difference between the unclean and the clean."</p></i> 
    Lev. 11:47.
<i>
<p align="justify">"You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean."</p></i> 
    Leviticus 11:47
<p align="justify">Where is the spectacle, which can compare with the true 
    child of God? He once was as a withered branch. No loveliness—no worth 
    adorned him. But in due time a gracious eye looked on his ruined state; a 
    gracious hand transferred him to the garden of the Lord. And now unfailing 
    grace continues its preserving care. Old things are gone. All things are 
    fresh in verdure—fragrance—bloom.</p>
<p align="justify">The believer is a new-born heir of heaven. As such he 
    journeys in new companionship along new paths to his new home. He is no 
    longer of the earth and earthly. While his hands hold the title-deeds of 
    heavenly life, his separated walk is worthy of his lofty prospects. His 
    demeanor is as distinguished, as his hope. His heart is far away; and an 
    uplifted heart uplifts the thoughts, and words, and works. An impulse from 
    on high compels high motives and desires. The stream must seek its native 
    level. The attracted steel must tend towards the magnet. Thus the new man is 
    drawn towards God, and thus he soars above the world's debasing plain. </p>
<p align="justify">No doubtful text proclaims this truth. 'Come', is the 
    constant Gospel-cry. What is it to come, but to <i>leave sin, the world, and 
    self, and enter fenced pastures, where Jesus guides His guarded flock?</i></p>

<p align="justify">But more than precept teaches separation. A nation stands 
    its living type. Israel's children picture the family of grace. Were they 
    commingled with the common race of man? Far otherwise. Peculiar ordinances 
    set them apart. Peculiar institutions were a broad barrier around. Peculiar 
    laws raised the high pathway, in which they walked alone.</p>
<p align="justify">Their every act in every day was a distinction. Their 
    code was a sign-post guiding from open thoroughfare. Many rules enclosed 
    them within holy bounds. Many commands secured a differing life.</p>
<p align="justify">But one especial instance here claims notice. Their 
    tables were hedged around. A garrison of prohibitions circled them. Their 
    diet was most rigidly confined. Were <i>all</i> the beasts, which browsed in 
    meadows, or which climbed the hills, or lurked in forests, their allotted 
    food? Might they partake of <i>all</i> the watery tribe, which sported in 
    the lakes, or hid in the sea's depths? Did <i>all</i> the winged creation 
    minister regalement to their palate? Might choice select <i>all</i> creeping 
    reptiles, at its will? It was not so. Only certain ones might be touched. 
    The rest must be most scrupulously shunned. A mark was fixed on each. There 
    was no animal—no fish—no bird—no insect of the soil, which was not Clean or 
    Unclean—permitted or forbidden. Each had its voice. Taste or taste not.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, it is well to delve the mine of this extensive 
    law. It must be wise; the God all-wise ordains it. It must be good; the hand 
    of love dictates it. What then is the significance of the law? May the 
    Spirit's light reveal!</p>
<p align="justify">They stop far short who limit the design to some 
    intrinsic difference in created flesh, or only find a guidance to nutritious 
    food. The palate needed not such heaven-sent aid. Luxury would soon discern 
    the luscious and the vile. Besides, the mark is not, healthy—unhealthy; 
    tasteful—tasteless; but Clean—Unclean. No. These instructions teach the wing 
    of faith to stretch to higher regions of exalted thought. Here is a school 
    to benefit the soul. The mind is hereby disciplined to spiritual advance. 
    The need of inward purity is here prescribed.</p>
<p align="justify">The first result is far removal from all heathen contact. 
    God's chosen tribes could hold no social fellowship with idol-worshipers. 
    There was no common eating-table. The foods of the nations were unclean. The 
    Jew could have no seat at impure tables. The dish, there presented, might 
    contain polluted food. Thus a wide gulf divided. Thus a strict ordinance 
    prevented intermixing union. Reader, this law commands God's people to be 
    separate.</p>
<p align="justify">The literal code indeed has ceased. All shadows vanish. 
    The Gospel-substance is revealed. But <i>still the principle is divine</i>. 
    It cannot die. The holy significance lives, and will live on, until the last 
    saint shall pass through glory's porch.</p>
<p align="justify">The need remains, because the world is still the world. 
    Its baits, its filth, its vile corruptions, are unchanged. It still extends 
    a net for the unwary soul. It still is the broad road going down to hell. It 
    still is the wide gate courting the giddy multitude. Hence Scripture's voice 
    still cries, Beware. Beacons still show a coast bestrewed with wrecks, and 
    wisdom calls the holy pilgrim from a treacherous path.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, you grant, that a clear precept prohibits the 
    world. But perhaps the term conveys no definite idea. Some shrouded phantom 
    passes in shadowy guise. No features broadly stare you in the face. Be not 
    deceived. The world, though masked, has still its own most fearful form. The 
    mass of mankind, strangers to God, and rebels to His grace, are its 
    material. They, whose chief good resides in things of time and sense; they, 
    whose horizon stretches not beyond this fleeting scene; they, whose one 
    object is to press most earthly joy into earth's little day; they, who dance 
    after pleasure's bubble, and scorn the cross, and make not Christ their all, 
    are the vile stones which form the worthless pile. All, who bear Satan's 
    yoke, and do his work, and wear his badge, and heed his will, are subjects 
    of that wide empire—world. The line is really broad. Enlightened eyes 
    discern it. Believers may not cross it. They must be separate, as light from 
    darkness—filth from purity—life from the dreary grave.</p>
<p align="justify">There is much mercy in the strict command. Come, mark 
    this. The climate of the world checks growth in grace. True godliness is a 
    tender plant. It cannot thrive, when nipped with chilling winds. A clinging 
    weed destroys the opening flower. A coiling serpent sucks the heart-blood. 
    Rough contact blunts an edge. Thus the world injures souls. It must be left, 
    or holiness will sicken, and wither, and die. The sun of Solomon goes down 
    in clouds of shame, because his swerving heart declined to pleasure's lure. 
    Love therefore warns. "Be not conformed to the world." Rom. 12:2.</p>
<p align="justify">The world stands forward, as Christ's open foe. It wages 
    an incessant war against pure truth. Is it not then a traitor's part to hold 
    close converse with the adversaries camp? Is it not shame, and worse than 
    shame, to take familiar counsel with a rebel host? He cannot raise the 
    banner of the cross, or march to victory by Jesus' side, who wavers between 
    hostile ranks. Love cries again, "Come out,"—"Be separate." The true 
    believer glories in his Lord. In every company, act, and step, he is to show 
    the livery of his King. It is false witness to adopt the language of an 
    alien race. It is desertion of the holy service, to take the garb of a 
    strange household. Can Moses live, as an Egyptian prince? He chooses 
    hardships, that he may testify allegiance to the cause of God. "We are the 
    salt of the earth." But mixed with filth, the salt will lose its savor.</p>
<p align="justify">All usefulness is slain, when Christ is left. It is a 
    common sneer, that saintliness is a mere pretense, and faith is but 
    hypocrisy's disguise. Suspicion fastens on the wavering steps. The world, 
    with all its blindness, quickly reads the language of the life. It slowly 
    credits a consistent saint. But soon, how soon, it derides inconsistent 
    walk! In such cases, zeal is a pointless arrow and a broken bow. No 
    argument—no eloquence—no diligence prevails. Words, which seem insincere, 
    touch not the heart. No teacher really teaches with a doubtful fame. 
    Therefore Jesus says, "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the 
    world." John 17:14.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, ponder well these obvious thoughts. Would you 
    know peace, as an unfailing stream? Would you pluck joys from ever-verdant 
    boughs? Would you from morn until night bask in the sunshine of Christ's 
    smile? Would you have happy consciousness, that every step is an ascent 
    towards heaven? Would you be cheered with the sweet hope, that life is not a 
    barren field, or summer brook? Would you pour comfort into many hearts, and 
    wear at last a diadem of saved souls? If such be your desires, avoid the 
    poison of the world. If you tread down the barrier line, if you stray out 
    beyond the fold's wide fence, you wrong your soul—you bring reproach upon 
    the Lord—your days will be uncertain sound—your memory will be no 
    instructive page. Cling to the confines of the cross. There is no 
    blessedness without.</p>
<p align="justify">But this rule of unclean foods did more than cause the 
    Jews to dwell alone. It forced UNCEASING VIGILANCE. It placed them in the 
    tower of constant circumspection. It always whispered in their ears, 
    'Beware!' Their eyes could scarcely look around, without the thought of 
    God's dividing line. Each object of their touch was "Clean or Unclean."</p>
<p align="justify">The lesson is most obvious. We thus are taught at every 
    step to ask God's will—at every moment to inquire, 'Is this a lawful path?' 
    It is a grievous error to suppose, that each minutest matter is not the seed 
    of some results. The circumstance of every moment affects the soul, and so 
    affects the endless state. The stamp, "Clean or Unclean," belongs to every 
    movement of each mind—to every act throughout each day. Reader, learn hence 
    to cultivate a watchful course. Apply a constant test.</p>
<p align="justify">When <b>thoughts</b> arise, (and multitudes, which baffle 
    number, hourly pass the threshold of the heart) examine them in 
    Gospel-light, and let none linger, which are found to be unclean. In 
    converse, <b>words</b> roll forth—many as drops in the fast-flowing 
    tide—each is according to God's will, or adverse to His mind. Pause, and 
    reflect. Pause, and uplift the prayer, "Set a watch upon my mouth, and keep 
    the door of my lips." Let all be checked, which go not forth, as 'Clean', to 
    minister pure grace.</p>
<p align="justify">No ground is neutral. We always stand in right or in 
    wrong path. Hence the enquiry should often sift the soul, "What are you 
    doing here?" Is "Clean or Unclean" God's judgment of this place? This line, 
    when drawn by Scripture-rule, would sweep God's children from many a 
    contaminating <b>place</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">No <b>book</b> is so insipid, as to have no character, 
    and leave no tinge. How many trifling offsprings of the worldly pen would 
    find an early and unknown grave, if the enquiry, "Clean or Unclean," were 
    solemnly applied. Let, then, the truth be settled in each mind, that there 
    is no indifferency on earth. Each moment flies on high, recording, "Clean or 
    Unclean," concerning life's employ.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, another thought demands reply. Your <b>soul</b>, 
    your precious soul, your never-dying soul, Is it "Clean or Unclean?" By 
    nature it is the vilest filth. All Adam's race flow forth, as unclean waters 
    from an unclean spring. But are you cleansed? Do you live bathing in a 
    Savior's blood? Are you the mansion of His purifying Spirit? Jesus can 
    cleanse from every sin, and He alone. Cleave then to Him. The Spirit 
    sanctifies, and He alone. Seek His indwelling. Now is the only cleansing 
    day. The door will soon be closed. "He that is filthy, let him be filthy 
    still." Rev. 22:11.</p>
