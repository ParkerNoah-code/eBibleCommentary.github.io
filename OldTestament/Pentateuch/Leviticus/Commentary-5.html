    ACCEPTED OFFERING</b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">Henry Law, 1855<i><br/> <br/>    "Fire blazed forth from the Lord's presence and consumed 
    the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When the people saw all this, 
    they shouted with joy and fell face down on the ground."</i> Leviticus 9:24</p>
<p align="justify">A train of solemn rites preceded the priests' admission 
    to their functions. The entrance-path was long and holy. None might draw 
    near uncalled—uncleansed—without atonement made through blood—without the 
    sprinklings of anointing oil. Lev. 8:6, 24, 30.</p>
<p align="justify">Through a whole week the victims died, and consecrating 
    services flowed on. During these days the sacred tent enclosed the devoted 
    band. They might not pass its separating gate. The world was left. A barrier 
    parted them from common life. They dwelt shut out from man—shut in with God. 
    Lev. 8:33.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is a teaching voice for all, who boast, that they 
    are Christ's. The priestly office shadows out their calling. They have a 
    high employ. Their rank is "royal priesthood." 1 Pet. 2:9. They have new 
    natures, and they do new work. All in God's household minister.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, have you approached by rightful steps the 
    servant's place? The path is here marked out. Is the blood used as your 
    atoning plea? Is there the Spirit's inward witness of adoption to the family 
    of grace? Is the world shunned, as mire? Is life regarded, as a dedicated 
    walk? They, who are truly called, pass this admission-gate.</p>
<p align="justify">In heaven a perfect priesthood serves in perfect praise. 
    But consecration here is prelude to that bliss. Say, have you more than 
    empty name? God's service is reality. Is your heart really His? Perhaps you 
    doubt. Oh! then awake and strive to enter by the only door. Space is yet 
    yours. But it is on the wing. It may be almost sped. Alas the woe, if death 
    shall find you not a priest of Christ! Are your signs clear? All, who serve 
    Him, wear livery—washed in his blood—bright in world-shunning grace.</p>
<p align="justify">The seven days of dedication passed. The eighth dawn saw 
    the services complete. Lev. 9:1. There is no more delay. The holy office is 
    assumed. The life is now one cloud of incense to the Lord. From morn to 
    night the willing priests discharge foreshadowing forms.</p>
<p align="justify">Ministers of Christ, your work may differ, but should 
    your zeal be less? Altars no more are raised. All vanished in the cross. 
    Victims no longer die. No lights are lighted, and no incense burns. The Sun 
    of Righteousness is risen. Twilight ordinances fled from its glorious orb. 
    But still wide fields of labor open. Your life is to proclaim the Lamb of 
    God—the blood once and forever shed. Souls are undone, because they know not 
    Christ—the true end of rites. Your voice must never cease the cry. Behold 
    the truth—bathe in this stream—trust in this death—plead this atoning cross. 
    Shame would it be, if legal priests relaxed not typifying work, and your 
    hands wearied in uplifting the grand substance—Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">In this first day of priestly work, a striking 
    circumstance occurs. When all the offerings had been duly made, Moses and 
    Aaron seek the holy tent. Lev. 9:23. For a short season they retire. They 
    leave the busy scene. It is their wish in stillness to seek God's clearer 
    face. He was before them in the public rite. But calm retreat would give 
    more calm approach.</p>
<p align="justify">The true believer labors in the open day. In busy haunts 
    of busy men he strains the toiling nerve. The world is the wide field. There 
    are the precious souls, which need the wholesome warning and the faithful 
    word. There sin abounds; and misery dwells; and ignorance spreads its 
    blinding veil. There Satan rules with deathful sway. In this wild waste the 
    good seed must be cast. In graceless crowds grace must be manfully 
    displayed. But private hours gain strength for public zeal. When all is 
    still the opening heavens pour down their dew.</p>
<p align="justify">In quietude the soul draws nearer to Christ's arms. Then 
    tender whispers testify of love. Then truth unfolds the wondrous page; and 
    promises assume substantial form; and distant prospects brighten to the 
    view. It is apart from men that grace takes deeper root; temptations wither; 
    the world's false glitter fades; the inner man is strengthened to resist and 
    loins are girded for the battle field. The soldier of the cross goes forth 
    from solitude to fight his fight. He, who seeks God alone, has God in public 
    by his side.</p>
<p align="justify">Moses and Aaron soon return. But they come not with empty 
    hands—they are enriched with the best gifts. Here is sweet evidence of 
    gainful commerce with the Lord. Laden with good, they haste to scatter good 
    around. Their souls are redolent of heaven. "They blessed the people." Lev. 
    9:23.</p>
<p align="justify">The blessed of the Lord bless earth. And they are the 
    most blessed, who most throng the mercy seat. The wise, the rich, the 
    learned, and the strong, are tools employed by God to move the world's 
    machine. But it is piety, which strews real weal, on men. They, who descend 
    from Zion's heights, are, as the clouds, which drop refreshing rain.</p>
<p align="justify">And now a sudden marvel fills all minds with awe. While 
    blessings fall from blessing saints, heaven brightens with resplendent 
    signs. Glory shines round. Fire is sent forth. But why? Is it to seize the 
    guilty sons of men? Is it to hurl on them deserved wrath? Far otherwise. It 
    comes with olive branch of peace. It seals with heaven's own seal the 
    atoning rites. It settles on the altar. It feeds on the victim, as its 
    feast. Thus it brings evidence of God's delight. Thus it fills hearts with 
    tranquil peace. The flame with blazing tongue proclaims, here is the 
    sacrifice, which God selects—approves—calls men to bring—and never will 
    refuse.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, this is the fact which now addresses you. The 
    altar-victims were the shade of Christ. The attesting fire speaks God's 
    acceptance of His dying Son. Faith, therefore, loves this scene. It is one 
    of the wells, from which it gladly draws new joy. It is one of the meadows 
    of its richest food.</p>
<p align="justify">But faith soon asks, what is the antitype of the 
    descending flame? It opens the clear Gospel-page. There distinct testimonies 
    answer to this approving sign. Let some now pass before delighted gaze.</p>
<p align="justify">The mighty God has scarcely taken human frame, when 
    heralds speed from the high courts. An angel's shout announces tidings of 
    transcendent joy—a Savior given—a Savior born—a Savior in man's home. The 
    host of heaven take up the wondrous strain. The echoing skies cast back the 
    chorus—"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards 
    men." Luke 2:14.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, the sealing fire here falls. Can evidence be more 
    complete? Here is the assurance, that the infant lives, sent by the Father 
    to save souls. It must be so, or why do those joyful wings expand? It must 
    be so—that messenger cannot mislead. Then venture on the Incarnate God. 
    Commit your soul to Him. You may appeal to God—I take Him, because Your 
    signet stamps Him, as Your chosen Lamb.</p>
<p align="justify">The day arrives, when Christ must be distinctly shown. As 
    surety of His flock, He must fulfill each righteous ordinance. Therefore He 
    hastens to the baptismal stream. Let all eyes now behold. While He uplifts 
    His soul in prayer, the heavens above cast back their gates. The Spirit, 
    like a dove, flies to the lowly suppliant, and the Father's sovereign voice 
    is heard, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Luke 3:21, 
    22. The fire again descends. Oh precious token! The Father and the Spirit 
    join to seal and to anoint our Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">Rich in the mercy of this pledge. The thought will 
    sometimes rise, Is Christ indeed sufficient? Sins are a mighty load. Can He 
    sustain them? The claims of justice are a long roll. Can He pay all? The 
    Father's voice decides. It leaves no spot, on which a tottering doubt can 
    rest. He cries, "well-pleased."</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, and will not you respond, "well-pleased?" Receive 
    Him with adoring love. Cling to Him with most holy rapture. In Him you 
    cannot fail. In Him you must prevail. He is Salvation by the Father's 
    will—the Father's word. Cleaving to Him, you cannot be cast out. He is the 
    Father's chief joy. And seen in Him, the Father loves you, as He loves His 
    Son.</p>
<p align="justify">As time rolls on, select disciples view a wondrous sight. 
    Jesus withdraws the veil, which hides His glory. He stands before them in 
    more than brightness of the mid-day sun. His visage and His robes outvie all 
    light. Here is full proof, that Deity is His right—Jesus transfigured must 
    be very God. But now a super-added testimony sounds. The fire again 
    descends. The Father again speaks. The note is still the same, "This is my 
    beloved Son."</p>
<p align="justify">My soul, here is another call to you. Take Christ as your 
    beloved one. Haste to respond—Great Lord, each inmost fiber is pure love to 
    You. Each pulse is an adoring throb.—The voice adjoins, "Hear Him." Heed the 
    wise counsel. He, whom the Father thus attests, is worthy of all notice of 
    all ears. Happy, thrice happy he, who can reply, I hear the good Shepherd's 
    voice. I gladly follow. He leads me to His wounds; and I am clean. He calls 
    me to His side, and whispers peace. He bids me climb a heavenward path. He 
    soon will seat me by His side.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, approach the bitter garden scene. Here all the 
    waves of anguish beat on the Redeemer's soul. His every look and every cry 
    make known, that He is wrestling with extremest pangs. Each pore weeps 
    blood. But whence this overwhelming grief? The hour is still. The place is 
    deep retreat. No hostile bands appear. None but His loved-ones are in view. 
    It is an unseen arm, which now arrests Him. The sword of hidden wrath now 
    really pierces to the quick. The fire from God's right hand now truly falls, 
    and fiercely deals with the self-offered Lamb. Each inward travail shows, 
    that God is now exacting debts from Him, until the boundless price is paid. 
    My soul intently gaze. You see wrath visibly outpoured on Christ. Then be 
    content—the cup is drained. No drop remains for you.</p>
<p align="justify">Another scene is near. The death is died. The grave 
    contains its precious captive. The stone is rolled. The seal is fixed. The 
    guard is set. The hand of justice has borne Jesus off. The prison gates are 
    closed. Where are our hopes?</p>
<p align="justify">Are claims all satisfied? Will God declare, that He 
    demands no more? Will there be manifested proof, that all His people are 
    redeemed? Draw near and witness. The grave restores the mighty dead. Jesus 
    appears released—alive. Here the fire of satisfaction falls. The topstone of 
    acceptance is brought forth. The pyramid of God's approval is complete. 
    Christ is accredited, as the full Savior of the fully saved.</p>
<p align="justify">When Israel's host beheld the fire from God, what was 
    their feeling? "They shouted and fell on their faces." Lev. 9:24. Sweet joy 
    was theirs. Deep adoration warmed each heart. Exulting praise burst forth. 
    Profoundest worship was their instant act.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, do the like. God sends His Son to seek—to save. 
    He lays on Him your every sin. He gives you every pledge, that He 
    approves—attests—receives—delights in the Accepted offering. Witness after 
    witness from His courts assures, that pardon, acquittal, release from every 
    woe, admission to the home of heaven, are y ours. Oh! then, let every breath 
    praise God. Let every hour of every day be inward worship.</p>
