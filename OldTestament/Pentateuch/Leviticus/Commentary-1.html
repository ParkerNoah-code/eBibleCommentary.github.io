<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">by Henry Law, 1855<i><br/> <br/>    "When you bring a <b>grain offering</b> to the Lord, the 
    offering must consist of choice flour. You are to pour olive oil on it and 
    sprinkle it with incense."</i> Leviticus 2:1</p>
<p align="justify">Faith gleans rich lessons in the tabernacle's court. 
    Rapid variety marks the scene. But every change still shows a changeless 
    object. The varied rites have one grand purpose. Their several parts have 
    one mind—and that, the mind of God. Each has an end—to illustrate 
    redemption. Each has an office—to unfold the Gospel. Each is a witness to 
    life-giving truth. Scoffers are blind to Calvary's cross. It is no marvel, 
    that they find no Savior here. But truly <i>Scripture contains more of 
    Christ than human eye has ever yet discerned.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Reader, pause now, and ponder the Grain offering. It 
    holds the second place in the display of these Christ-teaching rites. May 
    the great Spirit's rays so brightly shine upon it, that some new view of 
    Jesus may appear!</p>
<p align="justify">God's wisdom terms it "The Grain offering;" and justly 
    so, because its larger part supplied the priest with food. Its <i>substance</i> 
    and its <i>use</i> are the chief points, which claim attention.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Its main material is FLOUR.</p></b> Ver. 1. Is there no 
    meaning in this choice? Mark, God's own mind selects it. His mind is the 
    abode of wondrous thought. Examine flour. By what process is it formed? 
    Earth yields the grain; repeated blows thresh it from the husks; the 
    grinding mill reduces it to powder.
<p align="justify">Reader, this thought glides easily to Christ. He stoops 
    to be the poor offspring of poor earth. He, whom no heavens can hold, is 
    born the woman's seed. And then what batterings assail Him! The earliest 
    prophecy predicts His bruised heel. Hell spares no blow. Earth's fury lashes 
    Him with ceaseless rage. The strokes of Justice crush Him to the dust of 
    death.</p>
<p align="justify">O my soul, a suffering Jesus is your full salvation. A 
    bruised God-man is your blessed hope. His wounds are your safe refuge. His 
    stripes heal you. He was broken to make you whole. He was crushed to raise 
    you up. He groaned to bring you ease. He died, that you may live.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The QUALITY of the flour</p></b> is distinctly marked. It 
    must be FINE. All coarseness must be sifted out. No impure speck may stain 
    it.
<p align="justify">Reader, see the lovely beauties of the Lord. His charms 
    bring comfort to the anxious soul. Let but one flaw be found in Him, and 
    salvation's pillar moulders into dust. Then cleansing would be needed for 
    His own defects. No blood would then remain for others' guilt. But He comes 
    forth in all the glory of pure sinlessness. Thus He can take the sinner's 
    place, and pay the sinner's debt, and cast a spotless mantle round His 
    church. Thus we are beauteous in His beauty; fair in His fairness; lovely in 
    his loveliness; robed in His grace. The pure Grain offering sounds the 
    Gospel-note, "He has made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we 
    might be made the righteousness of God in Him." 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">OIL is added</p></b>. Lev. 2:1. Its many properties are 
    emblems of the Spirit's grace. Christ's very name imports, that all the 
    Spirit was outpoured on Him. His life attests this truth. When He appeared 
    in earthly frame, it was the Spirit's workmanship. Luke 1:35. When He 
    ascended from the streams of Jordan, the Spirit, as a dove, descended on 
    Him. Luke 3:22. When He approached His direst conflict with the power of 
    hell, the Spirit led Him by the hand. Luke 4:1. When, on the altar of the 
    cross, He gave His soul an offering for sin, the Spirit's might upheld Him. 
    Heb. 9:14. When He burst the fetters of the grave, the quickening Spirit 
    aided. 1 Peter 3:18. His <i>lips</i> dropped wisdom—His <i>steps</i> were 
    goodness—His <i>hand</i> was boundless power—His <i>heart</i> was 
    overflowing love. It must be so. The God-man was the Spirit's home. God gave 
    not the Sprit by measure unto Him. John 3:34. The Grain offering was rich in 
    oil. Jesus abounded with the Spirit's grace.
<p align="justify">Believer, are you conformed to your anointed head? Are 
    you the living temple of the Holy Spirit? "Be filled with the Spirit," is 
    his trumpet-tongued command. Eph. 5:18. Can He thus speak and not be ready 
    to dwell fully in you? Can He be ready, and will you exclude Him? Oh! grieve 
    Him not—wrong not your needy soul. Admit Him in His every gift. <i>He is no 
    Christian, who is unlike Christ.</i> He is unlike, in whom the Spirit works 
    no likeness.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">INCENSE is sprinkled on the mass.</p></b> Lev. 2:1. Thus the 
    Grain offering scatters fragrance round, and as the senses with delicious 
    joy.
<p align="justify">And is not Christ the incense of delight, in heaven, in 
    earth? The precious merits of His work regale each attribute of God. He 
    brings full honor to their every claim. No Christ-saved soul sits down in 
    bliss, but to add glory to Jehovah's name, and to bring brightness to 
    Jehovah's crown, and to deck justice, mercy, truth, in more resplendent 
    rays.</p>
<p align="justify">He, also, is perfume to His people's hearts. Say, you who 
    know Christ Jesus, is not His name "as perfume poured out?" Is He not your 
    sachet of myrrh?—your "bouquet of flowers?" Song 1:13, 14. He blots out 
    every sin. He bears away all curse. He heals all wounds. He dries all tears. 
    He stills all conscience-fears. He shows God reconciled—hell 
    vanquished—heaven won. In Him the past has lost its terror. In Him the 
    present is hope's clear watchtower. In Him the future is an expanse of 
    glory. Can there be incense more gladdening, than these refreshing truths? 
    Reader, grasp Him, and refresh yourself in this garden of sweet joy.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">No LEAVEN and no HONEY may be added. </p></b>Lev. 2:11. The
    <b>leaven</b> is quick to change and taint the meal. It rapidly pervades. It 
    casts a savor into every part. Hence, leaven is evil's emblem. For sin 
    admitted will run wildly through the heart. Its course pollutes. Its touch 
    leaves all impure.
<b>
<p align="justify">Honey</p></b> is most luscious to the palate. But is it 
    harmless? No, it soon proves a sickening and fermenting pest. Its sweetness 
    tempts. But bitterness ensues. Here is a symbol of sin's flattering bait. It 
    shows enticements in its front. It seems to call to rich delights. It 
    promises a honied feast. But ah! the juice is gall. The dregs are wormwood. 
    Sin's smiles end in hell-pains.
<p align="justify">No such admixtures may defile this type. To paint the 
    sun, we use our brightest tints. To show forth Christ, we must have pure and 
    purifying signs.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But SALT must be infused.</p></b> Lev. 2:13. Its properties
    <i>repel corruption and defy decay</i>. Where it is sprinkled freshness 
    lives. At its approach time drops its spoiling hand. Again behold the Lord. 
    His essence and His work are purity's bright blaze. He soars above 
    defilement, high as the heavens excel the earth. He washes, and His saints 
    are cleansed. He breathes within them, and corruptions cease.
<p align="justify">Believer, you too are called to be this vile earth's 
    salt. Mat. 5:13. When you go forth may purity walk hand in hand! When your 
    lips speak may purity's best seed be dropped! May your whole life be 
    counter-active of sin's taint! May many an error die when you are near!</p>
<p align="justify">Salt, also, portrays the <i>perpetuity of grace.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Believer, you know that Jesus loves you. You read it in 
    His cross. You see it in the Word—that mirror of His heart. You hear it in 
    His Spirit's call. Know, that this love is as eternal as Himself. The 
    covenant of salt precedes the birth—survives the death, of time.</p>
<p align="justify">The Grain offering is thus significantly formed. Its <b>
    USE</b> is next distinctly shown. The offerer is to "Bring this offering to 
    one of Aaron's sons, and he will take a handful of the flour mixed with 
    olive oil, together with all the incense, and burn this token portion on the 
    altar fire. It is an offering made by fire, very pleasing to the Lord." Lev. 
    2:2. A part is cast upon the altar's hearth. The fire enwraps it in 
    devouring folds. It is the prey of the consuming blaze.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith knows full well the Gospel of this act. It sees 
    wrath falling on the spotless and anointed victim. The burning grain 
    exhibits Jesus in the furnace of acute anguish. What <i>awe</i>, what <i>
    peace</i>, live in this wondrous sight!</p>
<p align="justify">What AWE! Here is full evidence of sin's deserts. Sin 
    rouses the just vengeance of our righteous God. It is an outrage to His 
    honor, to His nature, and His name. It must have torment. An adamantine 
    chain unites it to excruciating woe. If it escapes, God's majesty is 
    wronged. The God-man in the garden and on the cross shows how God's anger 
    deals with this foul foe.</p>
<p align="justify">What PEACE! Jesus consents to suffer all. Each vial is 
    outpoured on Him. The fire finds its prey, and spares not. Believer, see the 
    Grain offering on the altar, and let your every fear subside. Gaze, and let 
    tranquil peace lull every anxious thought. Wrath ends in Jesus. It takes its 
    dues from Him. It leaves Him not until all is paid. Its sting then dies. No 
    penal woe remains for you. Justice forbids, that punishment should twice be 
    asked. You may look calmly on the fiery lake. A suffering Christ has 
    quenched its flames for you. Happy believer, your sins, though many, have 
    endured their death. Happy believer, where are hell's pains for you? Your 
    Surety has exhausted all.</p>
<p align="justify">The Grain offering had further use. "The rest of the 
    grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: it is a most holy part of the 
    offerings made to the Lord by fire." Lev. 2:3.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is another view of Christ. It shows most tender and 
    providing love. The Gospel truth is bread of life to hungry souls. They, who 
    serve Christ, sit down at a rich table. A feast is spread to nourish and to 
    regale. Christ gives Himself—heaven's richest produce—as substantial food. 
    He is the bread of life. His flesh is food indeed: His blood is drink 
    indeed. The Spirit is ever calling to the banquet-house, "Eat O friends," 
    "Eat that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness." Faith 
    hears, faith hastens, faith partakes, and thrives, and feasts again, and 
    gains recruited energies for new work.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Poor worldlings snatch at miscalled pleasure's husk. They 
    eat, and fret, and pine, and perish.</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">In preparing the Grain offering account was made of 
    varying grades of outward circumstance. Diverse utensils were enjoined to 
    meet diversity of rank and state. The rich must use their best. The poor 
    must humbly bring from their more humble hearths. But rich and poor alike 
    must offer. Lev. 2:4, 5, 7.</p>
<p align="justify">One Christ is the one plea at heaven's gate. The rich 
    man's riches open not the door. The poor man's poverty has no moving voice. 
    Hear this, you RICH. Earthly pelf is little now, and nothing to buy pardon. 
    But Christ enriches in present and in endless time. His treasure is 
    ennobling gain, enduring joy, a crown of life, a throne of glory. Bring this 
    Grain offering, and you are rich indeed.</p>
<p align="justify">You POOR, draw near. Especial welcomes beckon you. Your 
    toil-worn hands may clasp the cross. Your lowly huts may entertain the Lord 
    of lords. Without Him poverty is hard indeed. But He can make you kings and 
    priests to God. By His side, work is light. In His arms rest is sweet. In 
    His love, life has few frowns. In His faith, death sweetly smiles. Bring 
    this Grain offering, and you are no more poor.</p>
<p align="justify">Spirit of God, great Teacher of the Church, blessings be 
    Yours, for thus revealing Christ.</p>
