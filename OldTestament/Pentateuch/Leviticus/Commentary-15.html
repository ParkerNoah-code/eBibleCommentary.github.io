    SHEAF OF THE FIRST-FRUITS</b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">Henry Law, 1855<i><br/> <br/>    "When you enter the land I am going to give you and you 
    reap its harvest, bring to the priest a sheaf of the first-fruits you 
    harvest. He is to wave the sheaf before the Lord so it will be accepted on 
    your behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath."</i> 
    Leviticus 23:10-11</p>
<p align="justify">The book of nature is a fruitful study. That heart is 
    dull indeed, which marks unmoved the varied beauties of recurring seasons. 
    But they, who ascribe these lovely scenes to nature's course, pause at the 
    threshold of delight. The infidel's cold creed can thus praise verdant and 
    luxuriant charms. He only gleams real joy, who everywhere beholds the hand, 
    the care, the love, the power, the truth, the wise decree of God.</p>
<p align="justify">My soul, bring God into your every view; and then the 
    view is elevating rapture. Trace God in all the produce of the soil, and 
    then the produce is a step towards heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">Our tender Father knows, that happiness thrives not, 
    where He is hidden. Therefore in all His works He strives to fix attention 
    on Himself. In feeding the body, He would show Himself unto the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">But goodness, as in nature's constant stream, may fail to 
    impress. The regularity may rather lull than rouse. Hence in the case of 
    harvest, a solemn rite is added to the Jewish code, to obviate the evil of 
    indifference.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, the teaching of this ordinance now claims your 
    mind. Come listen to its voice. Mark well its apt solemnities. Receive its 
    sanctifying moral.</p>
<p align="justify">When the season of the Paschal-feast returns, the 
    appointed harvest tarries not. The early promise is fulfilled. Gen. 8:22. 
    The firstlings of the grain are ripe. The fields of barley wave their golden 
    heads.</p>
<p align="justify">But shall the gatherers now heedlessly collect their 
    treasure? Shall thoughtless hands now bear the riches to the garner? Oh! no. 
    The Altar must unlock the reaping gate. Hence the first ears are bound, as 
    holy, into a holy Sheaf. The priest with reverence receives, and heaves it 
    aloft towards heaven. He waves it to and fro. A victim is next slain, and 
    then the happy reapers hasten to the crops. Such is the rite. God is thus 
    sought. Then man begins the blessed toil.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, survey this rite more closely. The harvest's 
    first act adores the harvest's Lord. The first grains feed the altar. The 
    first sickle cuts an offering for God. The lesson is plain. The thought of 
    God should precede every work.</p>
<p align="justify">Let morning dawn with Him—to Him—for Him. Let prayer be 
    the foundation-stone of each design. Nothing is well done, except begun in 
    God. All is disorder, unless the First be first.</p>
<p align="justify">The priest uplifts the Sheaf on high. The First-fruits 
    represent the entire produce of the fields. This is confession, that all 
    earth's yielding is the property of God. Without His will no seed takes 
    root—no blade appears—no stalk ascends—no grains mature. Man's toil and care 
    may be employed, but all the power is divine. Where then is foolishness like 
    his, who fondly dreams, that he is lord of lands? The richest hands hold 
    nothing but a loan. Let that, then, which is God's, and only His, be wholly 
    His.</p>
<p align="justify">The Sheaf is then waved to and fro. It floats from east 
    to west—from north to south—as traversing the globe. This motion warns, that 
    every spot, in every climate, is God's. His is an universal sway. In every 
    land one sovereign owner reigns.</p>
<p align="justify">In this solemnity the offering is small. He, who might 
    justly claim the whole, takes but one Sheaf. The large abundance remains for 
    man's supply.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus, while a bounteous hand fills our garners; while 
    valleys bend with corn; and clouds distill their fatness; the Giver makes 
    His small demand. All must not be consumed on self. The poor need food. The 
    shivering cry for clothing. The famine of the Word must be relieved. The 
    heathen perish for the bread of life. Such are the claims on our 
    First-fruits. Will any rush to copious crops, and grudgingly withhold God's 
    Sheaf?</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, mark next, the Paschal sacrifice introduces the 
    Wave-sheaf. A firstling of the flock, also, without blemish, accompanies the 
    offering. A Gospel-truth here shows its light. <i>The hand, which would 
    bring gifts to God, must first be washed in the atoning stream.</i> In every     service God's eye looks for His Son's blood. If this be present, sure     acceptance smiles. If this be absent, stern rejection frowns. The     worldling's heart may throb a grateful throb. But it cannot approach in     nature's filth. He must be cleansed, or he can gain no access. And nothing     cleanses, but the blood of Christ. Cain would not live without some homage.     But Cain despised the victim. He and his offering were cast out. Reader, let     the sweet savor of the cross perfume your thanksgiving. Then all your gifts, and all your life will 
    mount, as welcome fragrance, to your God.</p>
<p align="justify">Already we have found rich teaching. But faith asks more. 
    It has an eye, which ever searches for one object. It has a thirst, which 
    Gospel-wells alone assuage. But here Christ's person quickly meets the 
    seeking heart. The name of First-fruits—the day of offering—lead by straight 
    paths to Him. The Spirit's voice is very clear. "Now is Christ risen from 
    the dead, and become the First-fruits of those who slept." "Christ the 
    First-fruits; afterwards those who are Christ's, at His coming." 1 Cor. 
    15:20, 23. These First-fruits, then, distinctly picture Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">The day of offering next seals this truth. On the 
    morning, which succeeds the Paschal Sabbath, the Sheaf is waved. On this 
    same dawn Jesus arose, avowing himself the antitype. Faith, then, has solid 
    ground, when here it chiefly sees the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">Following this clue, let us now gaze on Jesus in this 
    type. The Sheaf relates a tale of triumph. It brings back thought to a seed 
    cast into the ground. To view, it was a dry and worthless husk. Earth's tomb 
    then buried it. Mighty hindrances assailed it. The frost retained it with 
    iron grasp, and many storms repressed it. At last it raised a living head. 
    Here life gains victory over death.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus Christ descended to the grave. Life seemed to be 
    extinct. Corruption threatened to devour its prey. The grave made fast its 
    bars. But every foe is foiled. Death and hell yield. The tomb throws back 
    its portal. The mighty conqueror strides forth alive. He shows himself to 
    God—the First-fruits from the dead.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, now in this Sheaf discern redemption finished 
    by your rising Lord. It was an anxious moment, when the dying Jesus bowed 
    His head. Justice had seized Him. To the prison He was dragged. In the 
    conflict Satan was strong, while He expired. The anxious heart would 
    anxiously enquire, will He now suffice to pay the countless debts of 
    countless souls? He came—He died—to save; but may He not have failed? But 
    before the question can be fully asked, behold, He rises; He lives; He comes 
    forth again to God. All claims then must be satisfied; all enemies must be 
    subdued. His resurrection manifests, that all hell's worst is now a broken 
    reed.</p>
<p align="justify">Clap then the hands of joy. Raise high the voice of your 
    ecstatic praise. Exult and glory in your waving Sheaf. The book of justice 
    has no charge against you. The dying Lamb has washed the pages clean. Can 
    the stern jailer now detain you? His scepter lies the shadow of a shade. 
    Jesus, appearing on the third day, is full assurance of redemption finished, 
    and Satan's empire spoiled.</p>
<p align="justify">Again behold the Sheaf. It stands alone—but it is not 
    alone. It enters first, but a long train will surely follow. It is the 
    earnest of the coming crop. It tells, that countless grains will soon 
    succeed. Thus Christ is waved, the Head of His blood-purchased flock. His 
    many members all gain life in His life, and triumph in His triumph. The 
    Spirit sees this harvest, when He cries, God "has raised us up together, and 
    made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Eph. 2:6.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, this mystic-resurrection is long passed. When 
    the Redeemer burst the bands, you rose arrayed in clothing of eternal life. 
    God's eye beams on you, as brought back in Jesus to His home.</p>
<p align="justify">Know, also, that the reality is near. Doubt not. Death is 
    to you a conquered foe. It will indeed approach. It will extend an icy hand. 
    It will take down your tottering house. It will consign you to a narrow 
    cell. It will call worms to do their work. Your body is sin-soiled; let it 
    then be dissolved. But cast away all fears. Death's seeming triumph is a 
    real defeat. It lays you low, that you may rise the higher. It wounds to 
    heal. It weakens to give strength. It mars to bring in fresher beauty. The 
    grave must part asunder. A clarion note will wake the sleeping clay. Those 
    who are Christ's, will rise as portions of His body. But, oh! how changed! 
    The crumbling dust will then shine brighter than the mid-day sun. Decay will 
    bloom into unfading youth. The mortal will be robed in immortality. The 
    fleshy clog will be all spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, our present thought cannot conceive such a state. 
    But it is true, and it is near. The trumpet is prepared to sound. The Lord 
    of life is at the door. Hear these sure tidings in the First-sheaf's voice, 
    and glory in your resurrection-hopes.</p>
<p align="justify">But there is more than future rising—there is constant 
    presentation here. This is one marvel of all the Bible-types; each form 
    gives multiform instruction; each ray will split into a variety of color. So 
    here a changing view reveals the never-failing work of Christ above. The 
    great High-priest is ever standing before God. He there presents—not blood 
    alone—He shows the Sheaf of First-fruits. He displays the many members, who 
    compose His body. Upon His shoulders and His breast the names of all His 
    Israel appear. He pleads, that they are gathered from the world. He offers 
    them, as consecrated for His Father's use. If there is rapturous joy, it is 
    when we look up, and see a Savior's hands waving our persons and our work to 
    God. If, also, there is glorious prospect, it is the thought, that a great 
    day is flying onward, when the whole mass shall really be reaped from 
    earth's wide field, as holy as God—and fit for the eternal throne.</p>
<p align="justify">Another thought remains. They, who make boast of 
    Gospel-joys, confirm their right by Gospel-signs. They, who are safe in 
    Jesus's hands, display His mind. They, who rise in Him to a 
    resurrection-state, rise with Him to a resurrection-walk. They move in this 
    world, as "begotten with the word of truth, to be a kind of First-fruits of 
    His creatures." James 1:18. They are no more their own. If God is 
    theirs—they, also, are God's. They love and seek His glory. They wear His 
    livery, and do His service. You who profess that you are First-fruits unto 
    God, have you these First-fruit marks?</p>
<p align="justify">This offering sanctified the crop. "If the First-fruit be 
    holy, the lump is also holy." Rom. 11:16. Thus the little handful of 
    Christ's band leavens the mass of human race. Believer, see your calling. 
    You are blessed above men, and you must be a blessing unto men. Your family, 
    your friends, your country, the world, must be the better for your being. 
    Your light must lighten—your salt must sprinkle savor—your grace must 
    scatter grace.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, are you these First-fruits unto God?</p>
