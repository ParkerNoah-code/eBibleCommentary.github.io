<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana" size="4"><b>THE 
    SABBATH</b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana"><i>
<p align="justify">"Six days shall work be done; but the seventh day is the 
    Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; you shall do no work therein; it is 
    the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings."</p></i> Lev. 23:3.
<p align="justify">Leviticus enacts a train of rites. But their immediate 
    purpose is brief and transient. Their life is short. They find an early 
    grave. And now they teach, as records of a by-gone time—as text-books of the 
    Church's infancy.</p>
<p align="justify">There is, however, a grand exception. In this code the 
    Sabbath holds conspicuous place. But Gospel-beams have not obscured its 
    light. It is no star, which waned before the orb of day. Far otherwise. It 
    arose not as a ceremony among ceremonies. Sinai was not its birth-place. The 
    wilderness was not its cradle. Therefore Calvary is not its tomb.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, write this among undoubted truths. The Sabbath is 
    as old as man. Adam's first day was hallowed rest.</p>
<p align="justify">The thought may here occur, why was Creation a six-days' 
    work? Omnipotence requires no time. To will—to do—are one with God. Why was 
    a gradual progress used? The reply is, God is wise love. Step succeeds step 
    in forming worlds to sanctify our patient toil. God then announces, that He 
    rests, to sanctify required rest.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus with high sanction, and benevolent intent, the 
    Sabbath entered Eden by man's side. In its origin, it stands the firstborn 
    of all ordinances. It is a portion of primary law. Its date precedes the 
    date of sin. Away with the vain thought, that it is a short-lived flower of 
    ritual field.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, next mark how it endured. It flowed a blessing 
    through the patriarchal age. That period was a foul hot-bed of iniquity. 
    Rebellious hands were raised against God's will. Incessant blows were aimed 
    at righteous law. But all this darkness failed to put out the Sabbath-light. 
    Survey the chain from Adam until Noah. Adam received it. Intimations tell 
    us, that Noah knew it. Therefore the intermediate links must have 
    transmitted it. Eden received the seed. The ark upon the waters held the 
    plant. Noah sends out the dove at intervals of seven days. Hence the 
    conclusion is most sound, that antediluvian times observed the Sabbath-day. 
    It lived, then, a long life before Judaic rites came in.</p>
<p align="justify">After the flood, there was extensive space before 
    peculiar ordinances separated Israel's race. Noah and Moses are the extreme 
    points of this line. The first, before the ark is left, recognizes, as has 
    been seen, a weekly period. The latter taught, why manna fell not on the 
    seventh day. Hear his clear testimony, "Tomorrow is the rest of the holy 
    Sabbath unto the Lord." Ex. 16:23. This interval then dawns and closes with 
    recognition of this day. The truth is thus confirmed. The Sabbath ever kept 
    its unimpaired existence. Its stream rolled onward from the ark to Sinai's 
    base. Again observe, its life is long, before Judaic rites come in.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, advance to Sinai. A scene of more tremendous awe 
    cannot be found. The thunder roars. The lightning glares. The mountain 
    totters to its base. Appalling sights—appalling sounds—announce the present 
    majesty of God. He comes to speak, as moral ruler of the world. The law, 
    originally written on man's heart, is re-enacted amid prodigies of terrible 
    display. Now mark what occupies the tables' central spot. It is the 
    Sabbath-day. Thus God's own finger writes it, a portion of His unalterable 
    will.</p>
<p align="justify">As such the golden ark within the veil received it. As 
    such a curse attends its least infringement. Who now can turn from Sinai's 
    fiery height, to pluck the Sabbath from its glorious place? It is no passing 
    rite. It is the transcript of Jehovah's mind. It shines a jewel in the high 
    crown of moral law.</p>
<p align="justify">When Prophets subsequently taught, did they remit its 
    claims? Their lips denounce each violation, as a heinous sin. Their fervent 
    eloquence repels intruders from the holy ground. They pull not down what God 
    had raised so high. They cannot desecrate what God has permanently hallowed.</p>
<p align="justify">Next Jesus comes Himself. The mighty God instructs in 
    human form. Are now the land-marks of this day removed? Is it laid open for 
    promiscuous use. He has authority to bind or loose. As "Lord of the 
    Sabbath," He is supreme. But He puts forth no abrogating power, when He 
    states its purport to be the good of man. "The Sabbath was made for man." 
    Mark 2:27. This is a mighty word. It looks backward, and forward. It seems 
    to say, It always has been, for man always had need. It always shall be, for 
    man will always need. Thus Jesus decks the Sabbath with undying freshness.</p>
<p align="justify">He finishes His work, and rises victor from the dead. 
    Prefiguring ceremonies vanish. If the Sabbath's mission be fulfilled, it now 
    will disappear. Is such the case? Far otherwise. A change indeed is made, 
    but only to set the edifice on firmer base, and to bind it more closely to 
    our living Head. The resurrection-day becomes the Christian rest. The same 
    memorial records creation ended, and redemption finished. The same repose 
    reminds of two completed works. The Lord's day tells of rest, when worlds 
    were made—of rest, when souls were saved.</p>
<p align="justify">Next call Apostles to bear witness. They were most 
    jealous of the Gospel-truth. With open mouth they warn, that the Judaic 
    forms had fallen, as autumnal leaves. But no word from their lips—no thought 
    in their pages—chases the Sabbath from our sight. Oh! no. They keep—they 
    reverence—they commend it. As soon would they deny the Lord, as undervalue 
    the Lord's day.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, review now its position. It is God's first 
    command. The Patriarchs kept it. Sinai preached it. The holy tables gave it 
    central place. The holy Ark encased it. The Jewish church revered it. 
    Prophets enforced it. Jesus upheld it. The Apostles sanctioned it. The 
    Christian church throughout all time has prized it. The prophetic finger 
    still points to it as a last-day blessing. Is. 66:23. Eternity waits to be 
    an eternity of Sabbath.</p>
<p align="justify">What, if profane indifference would tread it down? Vain 
    is the effort. It still must live. It has an innate life. The will, which 
    made it, is divine. As in the ark, it rode triumphant over ungodly graves, 
    so now it strides above ungodly foes. It must march on, until time is lost 
    in one Sabbatic rest.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, thus holy is the tree. Come sit awhile beneath 
    its shade. Much precious fruit descends. It showers down rest upon a 
    work-worn world.</p>
<p align="justify">Man's body is a wondrous fabric. Its various parts are 
    exquisitely wrought. They are designed for toil. But toil brings strain. 
    Rest must repair the waste. Rest must renew the vigor. Rest must bring oil 
    to the wheels. The Sabbath day supplies it. "The seventh-day is the Sabbath 
    of the Lord your God, in it you shall not do any work." Ex. 20:10.</p>
<p align="justify">Would man give this indulgence to <i>himself?</i> The 
    love of gain—the reckless lust of profit—grudges each moment unemployed. It 
    counts it to be miserable loss. Man would work self to early wreck, and 
    drive self an early skeleton to dust.</p>
<p align="justify">Would man grant this repose to <i>other men?</i> 
    Heartless taskmasters would lash their victims to a ceaseless mill. Work! 
    work! would be the only cry. Work! work! until the enfeebled dying hands 
    could no more move. If God's most positive command scarcely restrains, what 
    would earth be, if left unchecked to human mercy? A dwindled race would fall 
    as blighted buds. Incessant labor would be incessant woe.</p>
<p align="justify">Is renewed energy of <b>body</b> the fruit of seasonable 
    rest? Let every tongue, then, bless the Sabbath's Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">But fleshy material is not the whole of man. There is 
    that wondrous inner gift—the <b>mind</b>. There is the chamber, in which 
    thought resides—the cradle, in which ideas are nursed. Here is our moving 
    mainspring. These fibers are fine. Their edge soon loses point. To overwork 
    them is to destroy. But overworked they will be, unless the Sabbath 
    interpose its calm. Experience often shows the stream of thought run dry, 
    because the seventh-day barrier has been broken down. This respite saves our 
    noblest faculties from pre-mature decay. Let, then, each healthy intellect 
    sing praises to the Sabbath's Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">But this day is more than resting-place for body and for 
    mind. It brings refreshing nurture to the <b>soul</b>. It makes not a 
    vacancy to leave it void. It shuts out the world only to make clear room for 
    God. True it is, that the new-born heart lives habitually above. Its whole 
    employ flows in a holy course. But when the Sabbath comes, God is not only 
    mixed in every thought, but God and His work alone are present. The 
    Scripture is the only Book. Things heavenly are the only converse. God's 
    service is the one concern. This day, then, is the school of spiritual 
    well-being. It keeps alive religion in the world. It checks the hand, which 
    would expel devotion. Now countless multitudes learn the plague of a 
    sin-fettered heart, and hear of Jesus, and turn from misery to joy—from 
    Satan's chain to glorious liberty. These are the hours, when crowds rejoice 
    in views of dying love—in deeper draughts of sanctifying grace—and in larger 
    visions of the eternal weight of glory. Can there be one, who would divert 
    these channels of pure joy? Vain man forbear! Earth, spoiled of Sabbaths, is 
    a rapid road to hell.</p>
<p align="justify">The Sabbath serves a higher value yet. It is much more 
    than outward health. It provides more than leisure to gain grace. Its name 
    and use are <b>emblems of Christ Jesus</b>. As a mirror it reflects His 
    work—His truth. It is a scroll, in which faith reads from age to age, the 
    grandest lessons of redeeming love. What is the Sabbath? It is rest. What is 
    Jesus? He is rest. God rests in Him. Souls rest in Him. Eternity is rest 
    with Him.</p>
<p align="justify">God rests in Him. Each attribute here gains repose. 
    Justice has claims. Each sin is debt, which must be paid. Jesus pays all; 
    and justice is content. Truth finds in Him complete fulfillment of its every 
    word—and asks no more. Holiness is more than satisfied; for every sin is 
    washed from the redeemed, and all shine bright in righteousness divine. 
    Mercy and love here trace a passage for their fullest exercise. Their arms 
    embrace a family of ransomed souls. In Christ they sing an endless hymn, and 
    enjoy an endless joy. No more is sought. God is well pleased. Christ is this 
    Sabbath throughout heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">Souls rest in Him. When once the eyes are open to the 
    realities of sin, the torpor of indifference ceases. "What must I do to be 
    saved?" absorbs the man. Duties, and penitence, and ritual strictness, 
    present no mountains, which the feet refuse to scale. But efforts like these 
    remove no load of guilt. They guide to no peaceful haven of repose. The 
    wearied soul becomes more weary. But when the Spirit leads the anxious 
    trembler to the cross, then all disquietude is gone. Here is the needed 
    rest. What more can be required? Jesus brings in one flood of peace. The 
    search is over. All is obtained. Jesus is all for everlasting rest. The 
    husks are left. Refreshing food is found. Faith ceases from all empty 
    drudgery, to take up healthy toil for Him.</p>
<p align="justify">Heaven is one ocean of repose. No billow heaves. No storm 
    affrights. No foe can enter. No change can cloud the calm expanse of the 
    unruffled sky. But what is heaven, but to see Christ, as He is—to gaze 
    forever on His unveiled beauty—to sit with Him—to realize, that never for 
    one moment can there be absence from Salvation's home? Heaven is heaven, 
    because it is an eternal Sabbath by the side of Jesus.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, you see the varied blessings of this day. If 
    every breath were praise, it could not adequately hymn the love, which gave 
    it. Be wise; be wise; and let not Satan rob you of your treasure. He hates 
    the ordinance. He hates its profitable use. He knows, that it stands high, a 
    barrier to beat him back. By many wiles he strives to disfigure it, as a 
    dull and gloomy check to joy. Be not deceived. Can it be dull to walk with 
    God? Can it be gloom to hold communion with the center of delights? Oh! no. 
    The Sabbath-breaker is the wretched man. His heart condemns him. His 
    unhallowed merriment is gall. His foreboding mind sees pains and tortures, 
    which no rest relieves. The holy Sabbath keeper lives with God—for God. Can 
    happiness be more?</p>
