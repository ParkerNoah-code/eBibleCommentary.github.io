<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana" size="4"><b>GRAPES 
    OF ESHCOL</b></font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Henry Law<i><br/> <br/>    "When they came to what is now known as the valley of 
    Eshcol, they cut down a cluster of grapes so large that it took two of them 
    to carry it on a pole between them!"</i> Numbers 13:23</font></p>
<p align="justify">We reach the valley of Eshcol through a humbling path. 
    Before we touch its clustering grapes, let the dark steps be traced. The 
    story shows, how vile is man–and how gracious is our God! It proves our 
    proneness to transgress. It then presents an emblem of the heavenly bliss.</p>
<p align="justify">When Sinai is left, the march of Israel advances 
    prosperously. There is no check. No enemy annoys. No difficulties hinder. 
    Each day the intervening wilderness decreases; and the desired land is 
    neared. And now the very borders are in view. A few more steps will plant 
    the pilgrim-host in Canaan.</p>
<p align="justify">Surely courage will now brace each nerve—joy will beat 
    high in every heart—and with triumphant praise they will plant conquering 
    banners. But is it so? Alas! they pause—they hesitate. Jehovah's ancient 
    covenant fades from their view. The pledged support—the daily help—the 
    experienced favor—are forgotten, as an unsubstantial dream. The unworthy 
    thought creeps in—perchance the nations are too strong for us—their walled 
    cities, and their iron gates may beat back our assault.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus they distrust—and tremblingly propose to search the 
    country by spies. They take weak counsel with their carnal minds. They 
    follow sight—not faith. They cast behind their backs the oath to 
    Abraham—the repeated promise to their fathers—and the rich map of the 
    luxuriant plains, so often drawn by God's describing hand.</p>
<p align="justify">Such are the workings of <i>vile unbelief</i>. And that 
    dark monster is not dead. Yet—yet it lives. It lurks in corners of each 
    heart. It ever watches to bring its disguise to every eye—its 
    poison-draught to every lip. It is crafty to whisper, that perhaps God's 
    many promises may fail; that faith may be pursuing a vain shadow; and may 
    lie down at last misled—deceived—undone.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, beware—look inward. If you discern the slightest 
    trace of this beguiling serpent, oh! spare it not—seize it and slay it on 
    the altar of revealed truth. Take for the solid pavement of your steps, "It 
    is written." Then manfully advance. Grasp tight the promises; and boldly 
    march toward your pledged inheritance. Let nothing tempt you to test 
    heaven's counsels at the bar of human sense. He is the fool of fools, who 
    tests divine assurances in the scales of mortal vision.</p>
<p align="justify">But this timid policy befools Israel's camp. The spies 
    are named. They are sent forth to ascertain, whether their God be true. They 
    pass from place to place. They view the mountains and the valleys. Then in 
    their progress they reach Eshcol's brook. Here fruit before unknown for 
    size, for beauty, and for luxuriant juice, meets their admiring gaze. They 
    pluck one cluster from the vine. The treasure needs two men to bear it. Upon 
    a staff they prop it up. And thus they seek the camp, laden with a trophy of 
    the country's wealth.</p>
<p align="justify">Here let the spies be left. Here let a curtain fall on 
    their sad errand and their sin. Their sin—for they bring back a false 
    report—and while they show the fruit, they largely dwell upon the walled 
    towns, and monster-forms, and other formidable sights. But from such conduct 
    let us turn. It is more solacing to contemplate that cluster, which they 
    bear—that pledge of rich fields.</p>
<p align="justify">The Spirit teaching, we may draw hence a foretaste of the 
    full riches of our celestial land. These grapes are proof of Canaan's 
    exuberant fertility. The giant-produce testifies abundance. So, too, there 
    is <b>a heavenly Eshcol</b> before faith's eye. It shows delicious clusters. 
    And should we not delight to walk in the enchanting ground, and cheer our 
    spirits with the glowing prospect? Surely Eshcol's luxuriance portrays our 
    glorious Canaan. It pictures heaven—our looked-for rest—the mark, to which 
    we press—the haven of our storm-tossed voyage—the end of weary 
    pilgrimage—the soul's eternal home—the land of every delight. This Eshcol 
    should be ever in our view.</p>
<p align="justify">The joy before Christ cheered His heart. The joy before 
    us should gird up our loins. The racer bounds, when he discerns the goal in 
    sight. The mariner is alert, when land is seen. The soul spreads swifter 
    wings, when heaven seems to open.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, come, then, in Eshcol's grapes, read <i>faith's 
    amazing prize.</i></p>

<p align="justify">But here thought flags—mind fails—all words seem 
    emptiness—all images fall short. No angel's tongue can adequately paint the 
    brightness of those realms. Mortal powers shrink into very nothingness. None 
    can describe heaven, but those who enter it. And those who enter it, find 
    their delight an ever-swelling flood—an ever-brightening day—an 
    ever-opening flower—a volume, which eternity cannot read through!</p>
<p align="justify">Heaven! It is the palace of the great Eternal. Salvation 
    is its walls—its gates are praise. Its pavement is purity's most golden 
    luster. Its atmosphere is perfect love. Heaven! It is the home prepared by 
    God before the worlds were made, for His redeemed children. It is the 
    mansion, which the ascended Jesus still labors to make fit. Heaven! It is so 
    attractive, that all Jehovah's skill cannot increase the beauty—so full, 
    that nothing can be added—so rich, that it can hold no more.</p>
<p align="justify">But Eshcol's luxuriance allures us to more close 
    examination. Let us draw nearer. This cluster was the vine's perfection. So, 
    too, perfection is the essence of our heaven. Nothing can enter there to 
    stain—to soil—to vex—to humble. Oh! what a contrast to our present state! 
    We would be holy—but, alas! a treacherous adversary rolls us in the mire. 
    Our hearts are daily pierced. We loathe and we abhor ourselves. But our high 
    home is barricaded against sin. Never—never—never—can iniquity again 
    intrude. The soul forever joys—righteous, as God is righteous—pure, as God 
    is pure. Reader, seek heaven. But heaven is more than this.</p>
<p align="justify">Here on earth, the <b>foul tempter</b> all day long is 
    spreading nets. There is no saint too saintly for his vile approach. In Eden 
    he approached the innocent. To Jesus he said, 'Worship me'. His whispers, 
    his bold lies, as keenest anguish, haunt the regenerate heart. And while 
    life lasts, there is no respite. He watches every dying bed. But in heaven 
    this misery has ceased. <i>No serpent crawls along that pavement!</i> Satan 
    is outside—far off—the bottomless pit has shut its mouth upon him. Reader, 
    seek heaven. But heaven is more than this.</p>
<p align="justify">Here on earth, <b>fears</b> rush in. The ground is 
    slippery. A precipice is near. We tremble on the brink. Fiery darts fly 
    round. We shudder, lest some poison penetrate our veins. The torturing 
    thought breaks in, 'Will my frail bark hold out! Will even God's own grace 
    endure my daily provocations! May I not, after all, fail of salvation! May 
    not my end be with the lost!' But fear dies at heaven's gate! The happy 
    company realize, that they are lofty above injury. Their throne is safety in 
    the highest. They know it—what then can they fear? Reader, seek heaven. But 
    heaven is more than this.</p>
<p align="justify">Earth is <b>affliction's</b> home. A troop of sorrows 
    compass us about. Tears stream. The bosom sighs. The brow is furrowed by the 
    lines of care and worry. Death tears away the much-loved friend. Sickness 
    invades the frame. The home is desolate. The table is destitute. We look to 
    the right-hand, and there is trouble—on the left, and still fresh troubles 
    frown. But heaven is a wide sea of bliss without a ripple. All tears are 
    wiped away. All faces beam with one enraptured smile. All lips confess, 'The 
    cup of happiness overflows'. We bathe in oceans of delight. Reader, seek 
    heaven. But heaven is more than this.</p>
<p align="justify">Here <b>unbelief</b> often gathers, as a chilly cloud. It 
    mantles the soul in darkness. It suggests apprehension, that His love has 
    ceased, and that desertion is, or may be, our lot. This is a miserable 
    condition. When God is felt to be a God at hand, woe ceases to be woe, and 
    burdens are all light. But in heaven a present God is always everywhere. <i>
    We cannot move beyond the sunshine of His love.</i> His countenance is 
    universal brightness. Reader, seek heaven. But heaven is more than this.</p>
<p align="justify">Here <b>ignorance</b> leads us in a floundering path. We 
    thirst for knowledge, but we reach it not. How much concerning God is 
    utterly beyond our grasp! Blindness curtails our perspective. Clouds narrow 
    our view. But heaven is a realm without horizon. We know God, as we are 
    known. We love intelligently. We understand, whom we adore. Reader, seek 
    heaven. But heaven is more than this.</p>
<p align="justify">Sin is shut out—temptations banished—fears buried in an 
    unfathomable grave—sorrow and unbelief have fled away—knowledge is 
    perfect—our souls are purity—our bodies are imperishable beauty—we 
    completely share the glory of our all-glorious Lord. How much is this! But 
    yet this is not all.</p>
<p align="justify">In the true Eshcol's cluster there is this richer 
    fruit—Jesus is seen. This is the crown of heaven. This is the pinnacle of 
    bliss. The rising of the sun makes day. The presence of the king constitutes 
    the court. The revelation of the Lord, without one intervening cloud, is the 
    grand glory of the endless kingdom. Heaven is full heaven, because Christ 
    shines there exactly as He is—seen and admired of every eye.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith searches for Him now in types, and shadows, and 
    prophetic forms, and sacraments, and holy emblems. This sight is 
    precious—gratefully to be enjoyed—devoutly to be improved. But these are 
    faint outlines of the eternal vision. These often are obscured. But in 
    heaven Jesus ever stands conspicuous in one undiminishable blaze.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, what will it be to gaze on the manifested 
    beauty of Him, who is so altogether lovely! What! to read clearly all the 
    deep mysteries of His redeeming will! What! to dive down to the vast depths 
    of His unfathomable heart! What! to fly upward to the very summit of His 
    boundless love! What! to trace clearly all His dealings in providence and 
    grace! What! to comprehend all that Jesus is! What! never to lose sight of 
    Him—no, not for a moment! What! to be ever drinking fresh raptures from His 
    present smile! What! to feel, that this joy is mine forever! What! to shout, 
    'Come on, you ages of eternity, you never part me from my Lord!' This—this 
    is heaven. This—this is Eshcol's full cluster.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, are you a traveler towards this heaven? When you 
    behold the grapes of Eshcol, do you know, that the vineyard is your sure 
    heritage? The question may be solved. This kingdom is for the subjects of 
    the King—this palace is for His sons. Are you, then, His by faith? They, 
    who are in Him now, will dwell with Him forever. They, who live Christ on 
    earth, go to Him in the upper world. Then ask, "Is your soul knit to Him? 
    Are you a branch engrafted in the heavenly stem? Are you the bride espoused 
    to the Lamb?" Conscience well knows.</p>
<p align="justify">The link, which thus connects, is faith. This is that 
    precious grace, which sees His worth—flees to Him—embraces Him—and holds 
    Him tight. This is that heaven-given power, which, with glad hand, receives 
    the title-deeds of heaven. This is that Spirit-implanted confidence, which 
    looks to Eshcol, and claims all Canaan, as a promised home.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, never rest, then, until, standing on firm 
    Gospel-ground, you can look up and cry, "Lord, I believe." Then daily feed 
    on Eshcol's grapes. Then daily move towards Canaan. You soon will hear, 
    "Come you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from 
    the foundation of the world." Matt. 25:34.</p>
