<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana" size="4"><b>THE     BRAZEN SERPENT</b></font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Henry Law</font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>
    "The Lord said unto Moses, Make a <b>fiery serpent</b>, 
    and set it upon a pole—and it shall come to pass that every one who is 
    bitten, when he looks upon it shall live. So Moses made a <b>serpent</b> out 
    of <b>bronze</b> and attached it to the top of a pole. Whenever those who 
    were bitten looked at the bronze snake, they recovered!"</i> Numbers 21:8-9</font></p>
<p align="justify">Alas! what broods of vileness nestle in man's heart! As 
    wave succeeds to wave, sin presses on the heels of sin. If a brief calm 
    seems to give peace, a fiercer storm soon rises. The seeds of evil, for a 
    while concealed, revive as weeds in spring. All human history proves this. 
    But the recurring murmurs in the wilderness are saddest evidence. Seven 
    times already has rebellion raged. And now again, because the way is long, 
    there is revolt, and blasphemies are muttered, "and they began to murmur 
    against God and Moses. 'Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die here in 
    the wilderness?' they complained. 'There is nothing to eat here and nothing 
    to drink. And we hate this wretched manna!'" Numbers 21:5</p>
<p align="justify">Here is another proof, that <i>there is no blindness like 
    UNBELIEF.</i> Surely the sweetest manna fell with every morning's dawn. 
    Surely the purest stream flowed closely in their rear. But harsh ingratitude 
    sees frowns on mercy's loveliest brow. Reader, are not your features in this 
    picture? By nature this same quarry is your cradle. You spring, a branch of 
    this sin-bearing tree. And if fretful distrust be not your constant fruit, 
    free grace has wrought in you a mighty change.</p>
<p align="justify">Israel's murmurs soon plunge them into deep waters of 
    distress. Hence learn to dread this evil. Flee its touch. Bar fast the door 
    against its entrance. Wrath follows in its rear. The dregs of woe are in its 
    cup. Whoever sinned and suffered not? See what swift vengeance overtakes 
    these rebels! "The Lord sent <i>fiery serpents</i> among the people, and 
    they bit the people—and many people of Israel died." Numb. 21:6.</p>
<p align="justify">The camp is now wide-spread dismay. These <i>messengers 
    of wrath</i> beset each path. No care can flee them. Their dart is sudden. 
    Their sting is death. Thus multitudes sink tortured to the grave.</p>
<p align="justify">But Israel's sin gives opportunity for grace to smile. 
    Mercy often uses punishment, as a cure. A scourge is sent to check the 
    downward course. How many find recovery in <i>suffering's valley! </i>How 
    many rise, because they were cast down! A rod is often evidence of love. It 
    is so here. The stricken crowds now feel their guilt. Self-loathingly they 
    mourn. They beseech Moses, "Pray unto the Lord, that He take away the 
    serpents from us."</p>
<p align="justify">Moses complies. He here appears a type of his 
    forgiving—mediating—Lord. He gives no railing for their cruel taunts. He 
    upbraids them not for unbelief. He reminds them not, that this misery was 
    the due wages of their ways. He quickly flies to God. Can prayer knock 
    earnestly at heaven's gate and be unheeded? Eternal truth proclaims, "Ask, 
    and you shall have." Christian experience responds, "This poor man cried, 
    and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles." Ps. 34:6. 
    Rejoicing multitudes have proved—are proving—that <i>faithful petition 
    prospers.</i> Its gains are ever sure and large. When supplication wrestles, 
    plenteous showers of grace are on the wing.</p>
<p align="justify">But it is mercy's way, to give more than our hearts 
    expect. Behold a proof. The people seek a respite from the plague. This 
    would, indeed, have been a gracious boon. But it would have left <i>the 
    bitten</i> to expire. It would, indeed, have checked the flowing tide of 
    fiery ill. But it would not have eased the pain-racked limb. And what is 
    more, it would have reared no Gospel-beacon for all ages of the Church. But 
    the reply exceeds requests. It thus is worthy of a giving God. It is an 
    ocean of vast love. It is a volume of deep wisdom. It is a flower redolent 
    of saving truth. God takes occasion from this sin to cheer souls to the end 
    of time. "The Lord said unto Moses, Make a fiery serpent, and set it upon a 
    pole—and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he 
    looks upon it shall live." Numb. 21:8.</p>
<p align="justify">Relief for body is conceded. But, so marvelous is the 
    plan, that human skill is silent in amaze. No mind could have conceived such 
    mode. Indeed, proud reason would assuredly despise it. But cure for body is 
    the smallest portion of this mercy. It shows the cross, in form too clear 
    for doubts—in colors, which no age can fade.</p>
<p align="justify">It is instructive to observe, how Moses staggers not here 
    in unbelief. God speaks. That is enough. Therefore the plan is 
    wise—therefore it must succeed. So, instantly he executes. "He made a 
    serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole—and it came to pass, that if a 
    serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived." 
    Numb. 21:9.</p>
<p align="justify">Behold God's method—simple, yet mighty; one only, yet 
    sufficient for each case. The prince, the poor, must seek the selfsame 
    remedy. The mightiest intellect—the most expanded mind—the most inventive 
    thought—could find no other rescue. The most illiterate had instant access 
    to it. The aged raised the eye, and health returned. The youthful gazed, and 
    malady was gone. In some, the pains were great, and death seemed near, but
    <i>one view killed the plague. </i>Others had just felt the sting, and found 
    the pain to fly. Some were far off in distant borders of the camp—some had 
    their dwellings around the uplifted pole—but every look—from far—from 
    near—was full, complete, and instantaneous cure.</p>
<p align="justify">Did any scorn the means? If so, neglect was ruin. No 
    other help could heal the bite. But all, who acted trust in God's appointed 
    mode, found sure deliverance. There was only one remedy—free—open unto 
    all—but only one. Look, and be healed. Look, and let life return.</p>
<p align="justify">The glory of this type now gloriously breaks. Let minor 
    thoughts now vanish, as stars before the sun.<b> The Brazen Serpent on the 
    pole is Christ. </b>The look towards it is faith. This must be granted. The 
    lips, which cannot err—which cannot lead astray—decide. When Jesus opened 
    wisdom's volume to Nicodemus, He brought him to this very scene. The words 
    are as bright as midday. "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, 
    even so must the Son of Man be lifted up—that whoever believes in Him, 
    should not perish, but have eternal life." John 3:14, 15.</p>
<p align="justify">Blessed record! sweet sound! amazing truth! grand tidings 
    worth ten thousand worlds! Here then, in emblem, is <i>the gospel of free 
    grace! </i>Here is the remedy of God. Here is relief commensurate with all 
    the need of all poor sin-sick souls. Reader, give ear. See in this figure 
    your hope—your joy—your peace—your full redemption—your complete 
    salvation—your curse removed—your sins all blotted out! Come, and look <b>
    in</b>ward—realize your neediness—your pain—your rankling sore—your just 
    exposure to eternal death. And then look <b>up</b>ward and behold health in 
    a bleeding Savior's wounds—life in a dying Savior's death.</p>
<p align="justify">Mark, PERISHING is no fable's vain conceit. These words 
    warn of it, "that whoever believes in Him should not perish." The bitten 
    sufferer truly pictures our very case. We too are pilgrims journeying 
    through a wild wilderness. It is infested with the old serpent and his 
    brood. At every step, at every turn, we meet some forked attack. Each day 
    the mischief taints our veins. Satan's least touch is fatal venom. In Eden 
    he began his murderous work. And still his fiery darts fly round. No 
    mother's son escapes. All earth is perishing like Israel's camp. But earth 
    brings no relief. If penitence forever wept—if sighs ceased not—if rolling 
    hours were one continued wail—the streaming eye—the smitten breast—the 
    bending knee—the upraised eye—the wringing hand—the supplicating lip 
    could not extract the sting. Self has no help. The Law is no physician. Its 
    glance detects disease. Its voice proclaims the hopeless state. But it holds 
    no cordial remedy in its stores . It denounces the leprous spots. It sternly 
    sentences, and leaves the wounded to expire. Man cannot help himself—or 
    save his brother. No rites—no forms—no services—suck out the poison. As 
    all the sick in Israel's camp were surely lost, unless God had decreed to 
    heal—so all the serpent-wounded upon earth must surely have sunk down to 
    hell, unless free mercy had most freely pitied. But He who said, Raise up a 
    serpent on the pole, said also, Lift up My Son upon the accursed tree.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus God resolves to help the helpless—to stay the 
    plague—to save the lost. Praise—praise—His name! Our God is love. Gaze on 
    the proof. He calls His Son to bring relief. Bless—bless His grace! He 
    sends His Jesus from His own bosom to give health!</p>
<p align="justify">And can it be, that Jesus refuses to come and deliver us? 
    No, He flies gladly on redeeming wings. He thinks no load too heavy—no 
    agony too great—no ignominy too vile—no shame too shameful, if only He may 
    restore.</p>
<p align="justify">My soul, ponder again this healing work. The serpent's 
    sting had slain man's race. The God-man comes to bruise this serpent's head. 
    He, without sin, assumes the form of sinful flesh—and in that form is 
    lifted high up on the cross. He hangs as the graphic antitype of the 
    brass-serpent. He is thus raised up on the cross, that He may be 
    conspicuously displayed to all earth's sons—and that all faithful ministers 
    may learn to lift aloft this only beacon.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, look then from other things towards this cross. 
    Look with assured faith. He, who there hangs, is verily the mighty God. 
    Therefore divinity belongs to those deep wounds. They have infinity of merit 
    to expiate infinity of guilt. He wears your form—He bears your nature—that 
    His sufferings may be accounted, as your own. In Him all power—all 
    fitness—all sufficiency combine. God sends—accredits—appoints—accepts 
    Him. In Him all attributes are more than satisfied. He is salvation to the 
    uttermost. He is God's glory in the highest.</p>
<p align="justify">Look yet more earnestly. The look of faith is saving. You 
    cannot turn a trustful eye to Him and not receive fullest salvation. Did any 
    wounded Israelite look and not live? So no beholding sinner dies. The remedy 
    is sure—is near. You may be <b>aged</b>, and long years of sin may show a 
    blackened course. Look, and the mighty mass of sin is gone. You may bewail a 
    life of aggravated guilt. Your stains may be the deepest crimson. You may be 
    plunged and replunged in vilest filth. Look, and be whole. If all the sins 
    of all the lost were yours, they would not exceed this expiating power. </p>
<p align="justify">You may be <b>young</b>—and life's first buds be 
    opening. But you are born <i>a withered branch on withered tree. The 
    serpent's poison tainted your infant veins. </i>You never can have health, 
    but from the cross. The rich must look—for riches cannot save. The <i>poor</i> 
    must look—for poverty is no cloak for guilt. The <i>learned</i> must 
    look—for learning can devise no other help. The <i>ignorant</i> must 
    look—for ignorance is not heaven's key. None ever lived without 
    soul-sickness. None regain strength apart from Christ. But His cross stands 
    uplifted high—even as the pole in Israel's camp. And it is not a vain 
    voice, which cries, "Look unto Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth!" 
    Is. 45:22.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, you know, that you have <b>daily</b> need to 
    look. You are raised high by faith, but not above the <i>flying</i> 
    serpent's reach. Alas! how suddenly he wounds God's saints. And all his 
    wounds bring pain. But the reviving cross is ever in sight. There alone, can 
    the venom lose its pain. Then live with your eye riveted on Christ. Thence 
    flow your streams of peace. Turn not away your gaze in life—in death—until 
    you enter the blessed home, where the old serpent cannot come.</p>
