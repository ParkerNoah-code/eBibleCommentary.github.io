<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana" size="4"><b>THE     RISING AND THE RESTING PRAYER</b></font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Henry Law<i><br/> <br/>    "It came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses 
    said, Rise up, Lord, and let Your enemies be scattered; and let those who 
    hate You, flee before You—And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto 
    the many thousands of Israel."</i> Numb. 10:35, 36.</font></p>
<p align="justify">When the ark moves, a praying voice is heard. When the 
    tribes halt, and tents receive them, again it sounds. Prayer consecrates the 
    going forth and coming in. It opens the door for departure. It bolts the 
    resting-place. It is the vanguard to precede. It is the rear-guard to lock 
    in. It sanctifies the extreme links—and so the entire chain.</p>
<p align="justify">My soul, often view this teaching fact. Moses begins and 
    ends with hands—with eyes—with heart—uplifted. The first—the last look, 
    is towards heaven. He seeks a journeying blessing, before he stirs. He asks 
    resting blessing, when he rests.</p>
<p align="justify">This is true wisdom and real grace. Happy the life, which 
    is one flow of prayer! It is the pilgrim's staff—the warrior's sword—the 
    pillow of the weary—the refuge of distress—the cry, which proves the man 
    to be new-born. It is the wing, on which the soul flies upward. It is the 
    tongue, which asks—the hand, which takes—great things. It has free access 
    to a mercy-seat, and there it carries on a gainful trade.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, to you each day is a new journey. Each 
    circumstance is an onward step. Each morning calls you to a march. Each 
    night is as the spreading of a resting tent. Each finished work is as 
    another pause in your advancing pilgrimage. Let then your progress be one 
    stream of supplication. None ever prayed enough. Many in life and death 
    bewail soul-poverty. The cause is poverty of prayer. Much is badly 
    done—much is undone—because prayer is not well-done. What scales can weigh 
    the profit, which might thus be earned! What thought can estimate the loss, 
    which prayerless hours incur!</p>
<p align="justify">"Rise up, Lord." "Return, O Lord." Such is the Rising and 
    the Resting Prayer. There is strong significance in the petitions. They are 
    as arrows wisely pointed to a mark. They breathe a definite design. They are 
    not weak in vagueness of unmeaning generality. Some prayers are forms, in 
    which no feature is exact. The words are many, but clear thought is rare. 
    But true grace always realizes <i>need</i>. And then distinctly seeks <i>
    relief</i>. It asks with known and felt intent.</p>
<p align="justify">Let, now, the substance of these prayers be sifted.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. THE RISING PRAYER.</p></b> "Rise up, Lord, and let Your 
    enemies be scattered—and let those who hate You, flee before You." Here is 
    confession, that Israel's onward path was thronged with foes. It is so 
    still, and so will always be. Opposing armies are in front. Each step must 
    be through hostile ranks. The rest is reached through many a fight. The 
    Canaanite—the Amorite—the myriads of Satan's seed—still live. They leave 
    no stratagem untried—no weapon unemployed. There is no hour, when sword and 
    shield may hang unused.
<p align="justify">Next Moses feels, that his own might is nothing—vain are 
    his counsels—powerless is his arm. When not upheld, he falls. Unaided, he 
    is driven back. His hope—his trust—his strength—his armor—his 
    success—his triumph—are from God. Therefore to God he flees. "Rise up, 
    Lord." So now, if God's right hand be not our help, the tide of foes must 
    bear us down. But God is moved by importunities of faith. "Rise up, Lord," 
    is a cry, which brings all heaven to aid. It puts sure victory on the wing.</p>
<p align="justify">Observe here, how the prayer of faith yearns for God's 
    glory. "Let <i>Your</i> enemies be scattered." These enemies hate God. They 
    would impede the progress of His truth. They would extinguish His word's 
    light. They would cast down His righteous rule. Can faith sit still and see 
    Him thus dethroned? Oh! no. It agonizes with desire, that He would vindicate 
    His holy cause—uphold His honor, and add trophies to His name. "Rise up, 
    Lord, and let those who hate You, flee before You."</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, act out this pattern. Be zealous for God's 
    kingdom. Let every thought center in Him. Strive that He may increase. Let 
    Him be magnified—exalted—glorified—and then care not, that SELF lies low.</p>
<p align="justify">Realize, too, your oneness with the Lord. His life is 
    your life. His death is your death. His resurrection is your revival. In Him 
    you died, and rose, and sit now at God's right hand. So, too, His cause, His 
    foes, are yours; and yours are His. Thus, when temptations fiercely try, you 
    may appeal to Him, These are Your conflicts—"Rise up, Lord." These weapons 
    seek Your injury—"Rise up, Lord, and let Your enemies be scattered—and let 
    those who hate You, flee before You."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. THE RESTING-PRAYER.</p></b> "Return, O Lord, to the many 
    thousands of Israel." The going forth would have been ruin, except the Lord 
    moved in the front. The rest will be no rest, unless the Lord return. Prayer 
    called Him to precede their steps. Prayer calls Him to abide around their 
    resting tents. Vast was the multitude. But what are numbers without God? His 
    presence is their power—their peace—their joy—their glory—their 
    strength—their fortress—their shield, and their repose. They know it, and 
    they cry, "Return, O Lord." 
<p align="justify">Reader, what is your home—what is your heart—if God be 
    absent? That family alone is blessed, in which God has His constant place. 
    The table is a sweet feast, when He presides. The home circle beams with 
    pure delights, when He is seen in every smiling look. The house is 
    sheltered, when His wings spread the canopy around.</p>
<p align="justify">But is God willing to abide with men? His word expels all 
    doubt. The promises hang in clusters. "Draw near to God, and He will draw 
    near to you." Jam. 4:8. Do you ask, 'But how can one so vile, so base—so 
    hateful through iniquity—so stained with sin's polluting filth—draw near 
    to one so holy and so high?' A ready path is open. Christ is the way. Flee 
    to His arms, and you reach God. In Christ distance is swallowed up—and 
    union is cemented.</p>
<p align="justify">Hear next Christ's sweet assurance. "If a man loves me, 
    he will keep my words—and my Father will love him, and we will come unto 
    him, and make our abode with him." John 14:23. Give then your heart to 
    Christ. Make His commands your constant walk. And then you are the temple of 
    His presence. He will come in, and with Him all the glories of indwelling 
    Deity.</p>
<p align="justify">Heed, too, the wondrous word, "Thus says the high and 
    lofty One, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy—I dwell in the high 
    and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit." Is. 
    57:15. Then ask the Spirit to lead you along humility's low valley. God will 
    meet you there, and make your heart His home. Thus you may be filled with 
    all the fullness of your God—your soul may be a present heaven—your eye 
    may ever rest upon His smile—your ear may ever hear the whispers of His 
    love. At the close of every hour—duty—conflict, pray with undoubting 
    faith, "Return, O Lord," and surely God will come.</p>
<p align="justify">We are next taught, that these petitions have enduring 
    life. They are a model to the end of time. Let none suppose, that, when the 
    ark crossed Jordan, they were cast aside. No rather, they flow on as a 
    never-failing stream. They blossom, as an ever-verdant tree. Let David give 
    the proof. When ages had flown by, he brought the ark, with joyful pomp, to 
    Zion's hill. Where shall his heart find fitting praise? These words supply 
    it. "Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered—let them also, who hate 
    Him flee before Him." Ps. 68:1. My soul, may you, too, ever use this 
    Prayer—at all times fit!</p>
<p align="justify">But these high words from David's lips open a more 
    glorious view. When he thus sings beside the ark, he has an onward look to 
    Christ. He sees redemption's Lord riding in redemption's chariot. He lauds 
    Him, as the mighty conqueror traveling in triumph's pomp. Else, why should 
    he add, "You have ascended on high—You have led captivity captive—You have 
    received gifts for men, yes, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God 
    might dwell among them?" Ps. 68:18. You have done gloriously, as salvation's 
    captain. All your foes, where are they? They have fled. They are all 
    scattered, as the dust before the wind. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus the <b>Rising</b> and the Resting Prayer beside the 
    rising and the resting ark lead us directly to our conquering and our coming 
    Jesus. Faith claps the hand, and sings aloud, 'Here is my Lord'.</p>
<p align="justify">Yes. The moving ark is type of Jesus going forth to cast 
    down rebel foes. It is high joy to trace the Antitype's victorious march. 
    How mightily the Lord advanced! The strength of God was in His arm. His 
    sword was Deity. His darts were barbed with all Jehovah's might. "He had on 
    His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of 
    lords." Rev. 19:16. His foes, indeed, strove mightily. It was no easy work, 
    to rescue souls from Satan's grasp—or to lay low the prison-house of 
    darkness. The enemy rushed on, clad in his fiercest armor—wild in his 
    keenest rage—wily in his deadliest crafts. He plied His every temptation, 
    as a terrific battery. But the true Ark never quailed. The adversary licked 
    the dust. Malignant passions maddened in opposing breasts. The kings stood 
    up—rulers took counsel—all plots were laid—the ignominious death was 
    planned and executed. But still the Ark moved on. The cross gave aid—not 
    injury. The grave could not detain. Death could not vanquish. The gates of 
    hell fly open. The mighty conqueror appears. And as in Canaan, the ark 
    ascended Zion's hill amid triumphant shouts, so Jesus mounts on high. The 
    heaven of heavens receives Him. The Father welcomes the all-conquering 
    Savior. Angelic hosts adore the glorious God-man. The Rising Prayer has full 
    accomplishment, "Rise up, Lord, and let Your enemies be scattered, and let 
    those who hate You flee before You."</p>
<p align="justify">And now from glory's throne He cheers His humble 
    followers in their desert-march. Their toils, their conflicts, and their 
    fears are many. They ofttimes seem, as a poor worm beneath the crushing 
    feet. But they survive—they prosper—they lift up the head. As of old the 
    ark was victory—so Jesus is victory now. Yes—every child of faith shall 
    surely set a conquering foot upon the host of foes. Hear this, you mad 
    opposers, and desist. Where are the nations, who resisted Israel? Where are 
    the Pharaohs—the beleaguered kings—the Herods—the chief-priests—the 
    Pilates? Share not their malice, lest you share their end. Read in this word 
    your near destruction, "Rise up, Lord, and let Your enemies be scattered, 
    and let those who hate You flee before You."</p>
<p align="justify">And as the Rising Prayer has never failed, so, too, the
    <b>Resting Prayer</b> now teems with life. "Return, O Lord." Jesus is ready 
    to fly back. Israel's many thousands wait, but wait not in vain. "Yet a 
    little while, and He who shall come will come, and will not tarry." Heb. 
    10:37. Oh! joyful day—triumphant sight! What ecstacy—what shouts—what 
    glory! Salvation's Lord returns. Welcome—welcome to Him!</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, what will be your state on that bright morn? Will 
    your lips shout, "This is the Lord, we have waited for Him?" What is the 
    answer of your heart? Is it now swelling with the cry, "Come, Lord Jesus, 
    come quickly?"—"Return, O Lord, to, the many thousands of Israel."</p>
<p align="justify">This is the grand event, for which the earth now sighs. 
    And will it tarry long? Scripture has long since said, "The coming of the 
    Lord draws near." "The Judge stands before the door." Jam. 5:8. Believer, be 
    wise. Be looking from your watch-tower. Are there no rays streaking the 
    horizon? Extend the listening ear. Is there no sound of chariot-wheels in 
    startling events?</p>
