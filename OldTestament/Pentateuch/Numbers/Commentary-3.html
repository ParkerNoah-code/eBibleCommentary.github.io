<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana" size="4"><b>THE 
    THREEFOLD BLESSING.</b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana"><i>
<p align="justify">"The Lord bless you and keep you--the Lord make His face 
    shine upon you, and be gracious unto you; the Lord lift up His countenance 
    upon you, and give you peace."</p></i> Numb. 6:24-26.
<p align="justify">How gracious is our God in Christ! His mercy overtops the 
    heaven of heavens. Throughout the Bible-page, at every turn, it beams forth 
    in fresh rays. Behold a signal instance. He speaks in these verses, and 
    blessings drop from Him, sparkling as the morning dew--large as Jehovah's 
    heart.</p>
<p align="justify">The tribes are now prepared to move. The guiding pillar 
    will soon conduct them into desert-paths. Doubtless they go encircled with 
    all pledges of support. Their cup of favor mantles to the brim. But God 
    still multiplies new stores of comfort. He adds--He superadds--vast 
    bounties. He tells, that all, which heaven contains, shall fall in showers 
    upon their heads.</p>
<p align="justify">With this loving mind He thus instructs the priests. 
    "This is how you are to bless the Israelites." The act is ordered. "You 
    shall bless." The distinct form of blessing is supplied. "This is how you 
    are to bless." He wills to give. Is not this grace? He wills, that the vast 
    amplitude of His gifts be evidently seen. Is not this grace on grace?</p>
<p align="justify">Mark the broad channel of their course. "The Lord bless 
    you, and keep you; the Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious 
    unto you; the Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace." 
    The bounteous God thus opens wide the treasures of His bounty-house--and 
    tells the people, 'All these riches are for you.'</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, come now and listen to these sounds, as you sit 
    calmly on your Gospel-heights. You see it is the office of the priest to 
    bless. This introduces Jesus to the eye of faith. He is 'the Church's 
    blessing Priest'. The only priesthood is wrapped up in Him. The earthly 
    office, ministered by men, long since expired. When His own hands brought 
    His own life a victim to the altar-cross, all 'typical' functions were 
    fulfilled. But now on heaven's throne He ministers. There He presents the 
    ever-fragrant incense of His blood. There He portions out the covenanted 
    mercies. Thence freely He outpours them. He came--He lived--He worked--He 
    died, that He might bless. He gave Himself--the price of blessings. He 
    rose--He took His seat on high, that He might reign a Priest, forever 
    blessed, and forever blessing.</p>
<p align="justify">Is there a child of Adam's needy race, who covets 
    blessings from the courts of heaven? Let him approach. There is one open 
    way. No fiery sword drives from it. No--a gracious hand is ever 
    beckoning--and gracious invitations call. Hasten to Christ. He is the home 
    of blessings.</p>
<p align="justify">Do any ask, When did Aaron's sons thus bless the people? 
    On what occasion were these sounds proclaimed? The Spirit gives not a 
    distinct reply. It is conjectured, that when the morning lamb was offered, 
    the happy worshipers were thus dismissed. If so, when they drew near to gaze 
    on emblems of the dying Lord, these notes hymned peace round their departing 
    steps. It is ever true, that no poor sinner can look up to Christ, without 
    receiving harvests of delight. Who can approach, and not retire with 
    overflowing cup?</p>
<p align="justify">If the foregoing thought be right, the sons of Israel 
    once only in each day rejoiced in this blessing. It only fell as 
    morning-manna. But now, around the Gospel-camp, the sound unceasingly is 
    heard. There is no moment, when the believer may not be thus cheered. 
    Christ--his Priest--is always near. In every place--in every work--he may 
    realize His voice, and hear the constant music of the mighty blessing, "The 
    Lord bless you, and keep you; the Lord make His face to shine upon you, and 
    be gracious unto you; the Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give 
    you peace." The heavenly voice is never mute. The heavenly sun knows no 
    eclipse.</p>
<p align="justify">Next, the <b>terms</b> are aptly chosen to solace 
    individual hearts. Observe--these blessings are not given, as a general 
    store. They are not cast, as handfuls to a crowd--where some may gather 
    much, and some return with none. Far otherwise. They single out each 
    separate child of faith. They call each one alone, and say, Here is a 
    blessing for your own bosom-need. Each one, apart from all his fellows, 
    takes for himself a full supply.</p>
<p align="justify">These lineaments pervade our Gospel. It proclaims special 
    grace. It brings home direct comfort to each soul. The true believer comes 
    apart from men; he leaves the maze of general mercies; he feels, Christ 
    "loved me, and gave Himself for me," as if redemption centered all in me. He 
    lives in heaven, and prays at God's right hand, and fits a bright throne, <i>
    for me</i>, as if I were His only care. I see my own name foremost on His 
    breast. To me the words come especially, "The Lord bless you and keep you; 
    the Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you; the Lord 
    lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace."</p>
<p align="justify">But if there be this special mercy in the singular 
    address, is there not threefold mercy in the triple voice? With tender love 
    Jehovah is thrice named. Blessings are multiplied--again--again--again. 
    Faith quickly grasps the significance. Three glorious persons form the 
    glorious Godhead. Doubtless they are one in undivided essence--one in 
    coequal majesty--one in the singleness of unchangeable decree--one in the 
    boundlessness of love--one in the exercise of might--one in accomplishment 
    of plan. But there is Trinity in this mystic Unity. One Deity is three in 
    office.</p>
<p align="justify">But the whole heart of the Triune Jehovah yearns over the 
    redeemed. They all concur to save. They all combine to help. They all unite 
    to bless. Surely the Threefold Blessing sounds this truth.</p>
<p align="justify">Heed--heed again the heaven-sent form. "The Lord," 
    Jehovah the Father, "bless you and keep you." Again--"The Lord," Jehovah the 
    Son, "make His face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you." Again--"The 
    Lord," Jehovah the Holy Spirit, "lift up His countenance upon you, and give 
    you peace."</p>
<p align="justify">Our souls are now prepared to press the juice of these 
    rich clusters.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Open the hand wide. The <b>FATHER</b> comes to fill 
    it. "The Lord bless you, and keep you." The first word is large, as God is 
    large. It gives so much, that it leaves nothing ungiven. It floods the cup, 
    so that no other drop can enter. It shows a prospect, in which there is no 
    vacancy. "The Lord bless you." May He, who speaks, and it is done; who 
    wills, and it must be; who holds all power in His hands; who sits on the 
    high throne of universal rule, may He bless you!</p>
<p align="justify">WHEN? Now and ever--throughout the moments, which are and 
    shall be--when you go out--come in--sit down--rise up--through all your 
    living space, and when the last breath flutters on your lips.--"The Lord 
    bless you."</p>
<p align="justify">WHERE? In every place, in which you tarry, or to which 
    you move; in the closet--at home--abroad--in still retreat, and in the 
    busiest haunts--in the publicity of open work--and in the sanctity of 
    holiest spots.--"The Lord bless you."</p>
<p align="justify">HOW? By causing all things to minister to your true 
    good--by crowning your lot with all real happiness.--"The Lord bless you."</p>
<p align="justify">Perhaps the soul, conscious of weakness, finding SELF to 
    be a broken reed, and seeing many perils all around, sighs specially for 
    protection. Be it so. Protection here is stretched out, as a shield--help is 
    extended, as a sustaining arm. It is added, "and keep you." From WHAT? From 
    every foe's injurious assault--from every secret dart--from every direct 
    attack--from self--from men--from evil's legion--from the world's smile and 
    frown. HOW? By the shelter of His shadowing wings. HOW LONG? Until all need 
    is past, and danger's region is quite left behind, and heaven's safe haven 
    is attained. Happy believer--thus blest--thus kept of God!</p>
<p align="justify">2. <b>JESUS</b> comes next. "The Lord make His face shine 
    upon you, and be gracious unto you." The greatest change on nature's brow is 
    when light dawns. Gloom dwells beneath the pall of night. When clouds cast 
    their thick shade, dark chilliness prevails. But with returning beams the 
    landscape sparkles, the groves are melody, the fields are joy. It is so with 
    the soul. <i>Sad are the hours, which are not bright with Jesus. </i>Then 
    sins affright, and wrath dismays, and all the future is despair. There is no 
    misery like the absence of His look. But when His face again is seen, the 
    heart is happiness, the lips are praise. This blessing promises the shining 
    of His face--not a brief ray, but the full blaze of concentrated love. 
    Heaven's fullness is to see Him face to face. Heaven's foretaste, is to 
    catch this pledge of His smile. "The Lord make His face shine upon you."</p>
<p align="justify">Here, too, a precious pearl is added. It is GRACE. The 
    words proceed, "and be gracious unto you." What wonders are wrapped up in 
    grace! Its birth is in the heavens--its fruit upon the earth. It looks on 
    those, in whom no merit dwells. It sees them lost. But still it loves, and 
    pities, and relieves. It drew salvation's scheme. It named salvation's sons. 
    It raised the cross, and led the Savior to it. Apart from Christ--it has no 
    being--and no admission-door to its beloved work. But now, through Christ, 
    its visits come on sanctifying wing. The graceless become gracious, because 
    grace <i>works</i>. The gracious become glorious, because grace <i>triumphs</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The blessing voice still speaks. "The Lord lift up His 
    countenance upon you, and give you peace." Can they, who have received so 
    much, need more? But more is wondrously given. The truly blest have all the 
    blessings of a Triune Jehovah. Hence the <b>SPIRIT'S</b> favor is moreover 
    pledged. Some covet earthly honors and applause. Some seek the bursting 
    coffer and the large estate. But what is earth, and all its contents, 
    compared to this possession? The Spirit's countenance converts the soul from 
    death to life, and raises it from hell to glory. He shows its utter need, 
    and its recovery in Christ. He teaches the vile loathsomeness of sin--and 
    the just punishment of hell. He then reveals the God-man slain--the shelter 
    of His wounds--the mantle of His righteousness. He points to welcoming arms. 
    He testifies, that none can perish at the cross. When He lifts up His 
    countenance, the mists of ignorance, the clouds of unbelief, melt off--and 
    SELF is seen, that it may be abhorred--and Christ is seen, that He may be 
    embraced and loved. Then peace will surely follow. There is no peace in 
    soul-blindness, in distance from Christ, in unsubdued iniquity, in wallowing 
    in nature's mire. But when the Spirit joins the soul to Christ--when He 
    renews the nature, and sows seeds of godliness; then peace--abundant 
    peace--peace always, by all means, establishes glad sway.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, seek Christ--adhere to Him--abide in Him--make 
    Him your all--then will this Threefold Blessing be your crown. Hear it once 
    more. "The Lord bless you, and keep you; the Lord make His face shine upon 
    you, and be gracious unto you; the Lord lift up His countenance upon you, 
    and give you peace."</p>
<p align="justify">It is the gift of gifts--the prize of prizes--the 
    Father's full protection--the Savior's smiling grace--the Spirit's 
    countenance and peace. Reader, do you ask, Can such transcendent property be 
    mine? Pause--think. Why is it thus revealed? God speaks these blessings, not 
    to mock, but to fulfill. Can they be mine? Oh! cast yourself without one 
    fear on Christ, and you will quickly know.</p>
