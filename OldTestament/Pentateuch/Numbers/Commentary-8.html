    BUDDED ROD.</b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana"><i>
<p align="justify">"The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and 
    saw that Aaron's staff, which represented the house of Levi, had not only 
    sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds."</p></i> Numbers 17:8
<p align="justify">A new miracle now meets us. It is God's work. It is the 
    Spirit's record. Therefore it stands here for our souls' profit. A withered 
    rod, long severed from the parent stem, in which all vital juice was dried, 
    sprouts in fresh verdure. Buds show their infant forms, and clustering 
    blossoms open, while fruit in ripe luxuriance hangs.</p>
<p align="justify">This fact claims special thought, from its position in 
    the sacred page. It raises a conspicuous head high in a vast field of 
    miracle. Israel's whole journey is a chain of marvels. The falling 
    manna--the guiding cloud--the flowing stream--prove heavenly care. Each day 
    evidences, that omnipotence is active for them. But here a fresh prodigy 
    starts to life. God superadds another sign to win confiding trust.</p>
<p align="justify">To us this story of the Budded Rod now comes. May He, who 
    wrought the wonder, work wonders through it for our growth in grace!</p>
<p align="justify">But before we view it with a nearer eye, we must not 
    disregard the preceding notes. The faithless spies draw an appalling picture 
    of the searched land. The fortresses defy assault. The men are giants. 
    Israel's hosts are less than insects at their feet. Such is their evil 
    record. And it is received. Hearts quake. Blaspheming tongues reproach their 
    guiding God.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus nature shows its proneness to doubt, to tremble, and 
    to distrust. But such UNBELIEF brings misery in its train. It is a seed, 
    from which ill ever springs. It changes blessings into curse. It arms the 
    hand of love with an avenging scourge.</p>
<p align="justify">So now wrath instantly goes forth. The murmuring hosts 
    are doomed to turn their back upon the home just reached. The wilderness 
    must be re-entered. They now must wander up and down for forty years. Thus 
    their bright prospects end in darkest night. Their hopes of rest--almost 
    attained--are gone. They must wear out in woe their dismal days.</p>
<p align="justify">Distrust! truly you are the parent of all woe! My soul, 
    never distrust--cleave fast to God--cast deep your anchor in His word--bear 
    all things--suffer all pains--but never let one rebel doubt arise.</p>
<p align="justify">Pause now, and pray, "O Spirit of the living God, never 
    withdraw--leave me not to the fears, which sense and folly would excite. 
    Lord, I believe; help my unbelief."</p>
<p align="justify">Surely the downcast host will now tread tremblingly their 
    retrogressing path--their lips will now be sad with penitence and shame. 
    They, who so reason, are yet blind to the deep roots of sin.<i> As there is 
    no mercy, which man's heart will not abuse, so there is no judgment, which 
    it will not proudly scorn. </i>Open rebellion soon follows these murmurs and 
    this punishment. Korah and his company dispute the rule of Moses. They 
    challenge it, as usurpation and self-arrogance. Thus God's authority is 
    dethroned. But these leaders are leading at His call. Therefore, to revile 
    them is to revile His will.</p>
<p align="justify">Instantly terrific vengeance vindicates God's ways. Moses 
    proclaims the near approach of impending wrath; and, "He had hardly finished 
    speaking the words when the ground suddenly split open beneath them. The 
    earth opened up and swallowed the men, along with their households and the 
    followers who were standing with them, and everything they owned. So they 
    went down alive into the grave, along with their belongings. The earth 
    closed over them, and they all vanished." Numbers 16:31-33</p>
<p align="justify">Again we are disposed to cry, 'surely now rebellion must 
    be buried in that grave! Surely obedience now will meekly walk with God!' 
    But we soon find, that <i>sin has seeds so deep</i>, and fibers so 
    far-spreading, that while most withering judgments are descending, it still 
    will germinate and bring forth its weeds.</p>
<p align="justify">The morrow dawns, but not to see contrition in each face. 
    No, rather, it finds one flood of universal rage. The camp is indignant 
    against the servants of the Lord. The whole assembly raises the cry, "You 
    have killed the people of the Lord," But sin cannot thus sin, and wrath not 
    multiply to punish. A slaying plague speeds forth. It rapidly mows down the 
    God-defying host. Moses beseeches Aaron to rush forth. He grasps his 
    censer--fills it with incense--adds the altar-fire--and takes his station 
    between the living and the dead. God sees the mediating high-priest–the type 
    of His dear Son. The sight checks wrath. But still a plague-struck pile 
    stands, as a mighty pyramid--a monument of sin's deserts.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, at this moment, God gives the miracle of the Budded 
    Rod. Another sign now shames unbelieving doubts, and pictures Gospel-truth. 
    The people had scorned Aaron's priestly rights. God's overflowing love 
    selects this very time to add confirmation of His choice. Twelve rods are 
    taken. Each bears the name of the chief ruler of a tribe. They are deposited 
    before the ark. Thus the night passes. When the morrow comes, Moses 
    re-enters. Eleven lie, as they were placed, withered, lifeless, dry. The 
    twelfth, engraved with Aaron's name, is changed--most marvelously changed! 
    Verdure adorns it--but not verdure only. No branch was ever so enriched. 
    Blossoms are joined to buds. And amid blossoms ripe fruits swell. Man's hand 
    has no share here. The proof of God's immediate power appears in every part. 
    The rod, thus vivified, is to be kept a constant sign. God's voice commands, 
    "Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a sign against 
    the rebels." Numb. 17:10.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us now advance from the ancient record, to the 
    still-living Gospel of the fact. The Rod in many graphic tints shows Jesus. 
    The very name is caught by raptured prophets. Hark, how they announce Him. 
    "There shall come forth a <i>Rod</i> out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch 
    shall grow out of his roots." Is. 11:1. "Behold the man, whose name is The
    <i>Branch</i>; and He shall grow up out of His place, and He shall build the 
    temple of the Lord--and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon 
    His throne--and He shall be a Priest upon His throne." Zech. 6:12, 13. Thus 
    faith gleans lessons from the very title--Rod.</p>
<p align="justify">But the grand significance of the type is to REJECT ALL 
    RIVALS. It sets Aaron alone upon the priestly seat. The parallel proclaims, 
    that similarly <i>JESUS is our only Priest</i>. God 
    calls--anoints--appoints--accepts, and ever hears Him--but Him alone. In His 
    hands only do these functions live. He sprinkles the true mercy-seat with 
    ever-pleading blood. He bears His people's name upon His breast. He perfumes 
    all their petitions--praises--service, with meritorious fragrance. He 
    intercedes, and they are pardoned. He blesses, and all blessings crown them. 
    But He shares not the glory with a colleague. They, who seek God with <i>
    censers of their own</i>, like Korah scorn the only avenue--like Korah rush 
    to ruin. My soul, be satisfied with Jesus. Shout–"None but the consecrated 
    God-man--He is my total Priest--I need no more."</p>
<p align="justify">Next, the constant luxuriance has a clear voice. In 
    nature's field, buds--blossoms--fruit, soon wither. The grove--the 
    garden--lovely in spring--laden in autumn--soon droop. Not so this Rod. Its 
    rich abundance was forever rich. Its verdure was forever green. Its fruit 
    was ever ripe. Beside the ark it was reserved in never-fading beauty. Here 
    is the ever-blooming Priesthood of our Lord. "You are a Priest forever, 
    after the order of Melchizedek." Ps. 110:4. "This man--because He continues 
    forever--has an unchangeable Priesthood." Heb. 7:24. What joy--what rapture 
    fills the heart of faith, when with adoring eye it looks aloft and sees its 
    ever-living High-Priest on the throne! At every moment Jesus stands in all 
    the freshness of salvation's vigor. Our prayers are ofttimes cold and 
    languid. Our lips are dull to speak. Our thoughts stray far away. Petitions 
    are as an intermitting stream. The channel sometimes is quite dry. It is not 
    so in heaven. There, always is full tide of priestly mediation. Here is the 
    cause why saints prevail, and grace survives. Hence Satan with all his 
    legioned host is beaten back. Hence faith's tiny bark rides on the crest of 
    mountain-waves, and safely reaches the blest haven. Hence plans for 
    Gospel-progress triumph. Because Christ ever lives, and ever loves, and ever 
    prays, and ever works, therefore His kingdom swells.</p>
<p align="justify">And so it shall be, while the need remains. But when the 
    last of the redeemed is safely gathered in, then heaven shall no more hear 
    the interceding Priest. Then the one sound from the vast throng shall 
    be--Hallelujah. Thus the Rod, ever fresh--shows Jesus ever mighty in His 
    Priestly power.</p>
<p align="justify">Mark, moreover, that types of Jesus often comprehend the 
    CHURCH. It is so with these rods. The twelve rods at first seem all alike. 
    They are all sapless twigs. The same grove saw their birth. Man's eye sees 
    but one likeness in their dry forms. But suddenly one puts forth 
    loveliness--while the others still remain worthless and withered. Here is a 
    picture of God's dealings with a sin-slain race. Since Adam's fall, all are 
    born lifeless branches of a withered stock. Many abide so, and thus pass as 
    fuel to the quenchless fire. But in a chosen remnant, a new birth occurs. 
    The grave sprouts into life. The sapless put forth buds. Blossoms appear. 
    Fruit ripens. Whence is the difference? It is not nature's work. No dry 
    stick can restore itself. No withered helplessness can deck itself with 
    verdure. This cannot be. When any child of man arises from the death of sin, 
    and blooms in grace, God has arisen with divine almightiness. Free, 
    sovereign love decrees renewal. Boundless power achieves it.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, the Budded Rod gives another warning. It is a 
    picture of LUXURIANCE. Turn from it and look inward. Is your soul thus 
    richly fertile? Is life in you abundant life? <i>Where are the almonds?</i> 
    They are rare. Instead of fruit, you often yield the thorn. Should it be so? 
    "Herein is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, so shall you be My 
    disciples." John 15:8. Whence is the fault? Why is the stem thus bare? The 
    fertilizing means abound. Perhaps they are little heeded. "Abide in Me and I 
    in you--as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the 
    vine, no more can you, except you abide in Me." John 15:4. Perhaps your 
    neglectful soul departs from Christ. Thus fructifying sap is checked. Thus 
    bloom is nipped. Thus early buds fall off. You leave the sunny slopes of 
    Zion's hill. You stray into the chilly marshes of the world. Then blight and 
    mildew mar the expected fruit. The Word is not the daily food. Hence the 
    roots drink not renovating moisture--and the withered leaf drops off. 
    Meditate in God's law day and night, and you "shall be like a tree planted 
    by the rivers of waters, that brings forth his <i>fruit</i> in his 
    season--his leaf also shall not wither--and whatever he does shall <i>
    prosper</i>." Ps. 1:3.</p>
<p align="justify">But if the Budded Rod rebukes the scanty fruit in the 
    newborn soul, what is its voice to unregenerate worldlings? Alas! these are 
    a forest of sticks, wholly dry. The curse, which fell on Eden's garden, 
    blasted their nature to the core. Thus withered they were born. Thus 
    withered they continue. What will their end be? That end draws near. What 
    then awaits them? Can they be beams and rafters in the palace of heaven's 
    King! Oh! no. The decree is sure. Faithfulness has warned. Almighty power 
    will execute. "That, which bears thorns and briers, is rejected, and is near 
    unto cursing, whose end is to be burned." Heb. 6:8.</p>
