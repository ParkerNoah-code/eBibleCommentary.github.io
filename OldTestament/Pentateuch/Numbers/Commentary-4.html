<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">Henry Law<i><br/> <br/>    "Make two Trumpets of Silver."</i> Numb. 10:2.</p>
<p align="justify">Sinai's ordinances here end. The hallowed mount must now 
    be left. But before the onward-signal sounds, God speaks again. A final 
    token testifies, that Israel's every matter occupies His heart.</p>
<p align="justify">A mandate issues to form Trumpets. In number they are 
    two. Their metal is pure silver. As in the golden candlestick, each is 
    constructed from one piece. There is no joint--no link--no mixture. The 
    priests alone may use them. Their purpose is fourfold.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Their liquid note convenes assemblies to the 
    tabernacle-door. </p>
<p align="justify">2. They sound, when the moving pillar calls the tribes to 
    march (verse 2). </p>
<p align="justify">3.<i> </i>They warn, when hostile armies threaten battle 
    (verse 9).</p>
<p align="justify">4. On festive days they peal melodiously around the 
    blood-stained altar. Such are these Trumpets--such their use. Each order is 
    divine.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, this is our grace-day. We live, that we may glean 
    soul-profit. The Bible is our harvest field. Here this ordinance now meets 
    us, and offers no small riches to our store.</p>
<p align="justify">An obvious thought stands on the threshold. We see God's 
    all-pervading care. He directs all things for His people's welfare. Their 
    least arrangements are arranged in heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">How happy; then, is the child of faith! The grand 
    concerns of his eternal home are firmly settled. The door is opened--the 
    passport is provided--fit robes are wrought, by the God-man's redeeming 
    work. A new heart, fit for pure joys, is created by the Spirit. But this is 
    not all. Heavenly plans are not restricted to these heavenly things. <i>Each 
    little matter on the earthly stage is offspring of decree.</i> The countless 
    links in each day's chain are framed above. The way, then, must be right, 
    because divinely marked. Chance guides no vessel through life's waves.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, hence learn to scorn no matter, as too small for 
    thought. There are no trifles in a soul's career. <i>Minute things</i> 
    sometimes seems to turn the scale for heaven or hell. Make conscience of 
    each trivial event. It has an influence on eternity. When God appears to 
    order two Silver Trumpets for the camp, surely He stamps all little things 
    with magnitude.</p>
<p align="justify">The MATERIAL must be silver. This is a metal carefully 
    prepared. Repeated fires cleanse it from all dross. Hence it is emblem of 
    rare purity. "The words of the Lord are pure words--as silver tried in a 
    furnace of earth, purified seven times." Ps. 12:6. Each vessel in the camp 
    of God must be thus clean. "Holiness becomes Your house, O Lord, forever." 
    Ps. 93:5. Ministers should precede with silver-brightness. The flock should 
    follow, as silver without alloy.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us now draw nearer to the camp. Two priests are seen. 
    Each blows a Silver Trumpet. Light falls hence on <i>the office of God's 
    ministers.</i> Their voice should sound with trumpet-clearness through the 
    flock. They are entrusted with God's message to a fallen world. Theirs is 
    the privilege to tell the story of redeeming grace. They bear grand tidings, 
    which are life to the dead--health to the sick--liberty to the captive--joy 
    to the mourner--comfort to the broken-hearted--wealth to the poor--sight to 
    the blind--recovery to the lost--strength to the weak. As heralds, they have 
    to announce, that God is reconciled--a ransom found--a remedy provided--a 
    Savior given--a Deliverer sent. It is their work to cry, Behold the 
    cross--look to the dying Lamb--flee to His sheltering arms--hide in His 
    wounded side--nestle beneath the covert of His wings--put on the glories of 
    His righteousness--trust in His finished work--plead His atoning 
    sacrifice--present by faith His wrath-appeasing death--receive Him, as all 
    wisdom, joy, and peace--cling to Him through life, in death, forever--in 
    answer to all Satan's wiles, and conscience-fears, shout, 'Christ is All'. 
    They have to warn of the world's murderous arts--of sin's tremendous 
    doom--of fire, which is never quenched--of anguish, which exceeds all 
    thought--of an eternity in darkness and despair.</p>
<p align="justify">Should they not, then, with clarion-shrillness, rouse the 
    flock? The Silver Trumpets sent a PIERCING note. So should the Gospel-herald 
    utter aloud the Gospel-news. Away with timid whisper--and a stammering 
    tongue. The servant's lips should glory in the Master's name. Let statements 
    be unmistakable, as the sun without one cloudâ€“clear, as the crystal 
    stream--distinct, as the unmuffled trumpet's voice.</p>
<p align="justify">Note, the Trumpets were of ONE PIECE. So is the 
    Gospel-message. It knows no mixture. It is no piece-meal fabric. It is not 
    partly grace and partly works. It calls not men to finish what the Lord 
    commenced. From first to last--in origin--in progress--in 
    conclusion--Gospel-salvation is a free gift. All merit is in Christ. He 
    opens heaven. He closes hell. He washes, decks, and fits. He presents His 
    children pure and faultless. Their pardon and their fitness is His work. 
    They follow Him, because He calls. They love, because He wins their hearts. 
    They conquer, because He is their sword and shield. They persevere, because 
    His hand upholds. Their grace is offspring of His love. Their glory is the 
    payment of His worth. Thus Christ is All. No diverse metal soiled these 
    Trumpets. No intermingling error should soil pulpits.</p>
<p align="justify">The type, moreover, fixes attention on the Christian as a 
    worshiper--a pilgrim--a warrior--a son of joy. For let the OCCASIONS, on 
    which these Trumpets sounded, be now more closely marked.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. They call the people to God's sanctuary. </p></b>Reader, 
    mark this. It is a Gospel-ordinance, that worshipers should throng the holy 
    courts--that public prayer and praise should reverence the glorious name. 
    Who will not hasten to obey? Who will not join the people, who keep 
    holy-day? A saintly congregation is a foretaste of heaven. It is earth's 
    holiest scene. What sanctity pervades the spot! What blessedness inspires 
    the company! The Triune God is mighty in the midst. The SPIRIT intercedes 
    within the soul. He prompts longing desires. He makes sin's burden to be 
    felt. He deepens penitential grief. He fans the flame of wrestling 
    supplication. He brightens the torch of love. The GREAT HIGH-PRIEST draws 
    near. He takes each prayer, and washes it in cleansing blood. He perfumes 
    every note of praise. He then presents the fragrant sacrifice before the 
    throne. The FATHER is well-pleased. The service is accepted. Pardons are 
    sealed. Blessings fly down. The faithful meet to honor God. They honor and 
    are honored. They come in faith, and they depart in peace.
<p align="justify">Reader, do not think, say not, that such assemblage is 
    superfluous. Doubtless God is not linked to means. He can bless in solitude, 
    and hear in the secluded closet. But it has pleased Him to order public 
    worship. His commands are always gain. The pious congregation thrives. Faith 
    hears--obeys--and finds obedience to be wealth.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. The trumpets give command to march.</p></b> Christians are 
    portion of a <i>marching</i> host. The Bible warns, that earth is not our 
    rest. We live a stranger-life. We occupy a moving tent. We hold a 
    pilgrim-staff. What is there stationary here? Our days are a fast-flowing 
    stream. The rapid current rushes onward. Let then no heart cast anchor on 
    these sands. Let not affection entwine its fibers around earthly stems. Our 
    mansions are on high. Our home is far away. Be prepared for the journey. Let 
    all be ready for departure. Death should not find a Christian unequipped for 
    march. It is a friend, for whom expecting eyes should watch. The ears should 
    listen for the chariot-wheels. When it appears, let there be no tremor--no 
    surprise--no work unfinished. The Gospel's Silver Trumpets ever cry, 'Arise, 
    Depart. Come up here'.
<b>
<p align="justify">3. The trumpets sound for war. </p></b>The life of faith is 
    one incessant fight. Beneath the cross, a sword is drawn, of which the 
    scabbard is cast far away. The attitude of bold defiance is assumed. Until 
    the victor's crown is won, unflinching combat must go on. The foes are 
    many--mighty--wily--restless. They meet us, at each step. They lurk in every 
    corner. They infest our public walk. They enter our closed doors. They are 
    without--around--within. Count, if you can, the hateful legions, who compose 
    hell's hosts--they all rush at the soul. Survey the world--its snares--its 
    foul seductions--its enticing arts--its siren calls--its smiles--its 
    venom-sneers--its terrifying threats. Each in its turn assails--and each, 
    when foiled, renews the assault. Behold the heart, and all its brood of 
    lusts and raging passions. How often it betrays! How often it beguiles! The 
    Gospel-trumpet ever cries, 'Battle is near. Stand firm. Resist'.
<p align="justify">But when the Gospel calls, it promises sure triumph. It 
    gives an armor, wrought by God. This, rightly used, cannot be broken. It 
    points to a Captain, by whose side no battle can be lost--beneath whose 
    banner, no warrior was ever slain.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, hear, and go forth in hope. Face all your foes. 
    Grasp manfully your sword. Use skillfully your shield. Lift up the head, 
    safe in salvation's helmet. Shout boldly your great Leader's name. The fight 
    will soon be over. The victor's song will soon be on your lips.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They have a further use. <b>In the grand feasts the 
    trumpets cheer the worshipers around the bleeding victims.</b> While the 
    altar streams, and happy crowds look on, the heavens resound with these 
    exulting melodies. The precept is obeyed, "Sing aloud unto God our 
    strength--make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob." Ps. 81:1.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, thus, too, the Gospel teaches you to 
    rejoice--to rejoice with heart abounding with melodious praise, when you in 
    faith contemplate, and in worship plead, the meritorious death of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">My soul, obey, remember Calvary, and sing--shout--pour 
    forth music of delight. Let all, that is within you, swell the adoring 
    chorus. Gaze on the cross--and let exulting hallelujahs testify, how 
    fervently you love--how rapturously you extol--how undoubtingly you trust, 
    that <i>death</i>, which is your life--that <i>blood</i>, which is your 
    ransom--those <i>wounds</i>, which are your shelter--that <i>Jesus</i>, who 
    is your full salvation--that <i>Christ</i>, who is your All.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, the Gospel-trumpet is now within your hearing. 
    But it is prelude of another melody. Yet a little while, and "the Lord 
    Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout--with the voice of the 
    Archangel and the trumpet of God." 1 Thess. 4:16. That note will open every 
    grave, and wake the sleeping dust, and gather mankind to the great white 
    throne. Quickly you will hear it--for every ear shall hear. It introduces 
    the coronation-day of saints. It is the knell of execution to the lost. Are 
    you prepared? Do you stand ready--one with Christ? If you heed now the 
    Gospel-trumpet calling you to Him, you will hear then the last-day-trumpet 
    calling you to glory.</p>
<p align="justify">It is faith's happiest hour, when it goes forth in spirit 
    to intermingle in the fast-coming scene. "We shall not all sleep, but we 
    shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last 
    Trumpet--for the Trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised 
    incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on 
    incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. Then shall be brought 
    to pass the saying, that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory. O 
    death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?" 1 Cor. 
    15:51-55.</p>
<p align="justify">My soul, hark! hark! This Trumpet soon will sound. Bless 
    Jesus--and fear not.</p>
