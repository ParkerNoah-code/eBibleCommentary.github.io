    CAMP.</b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana"><i>
<p align="justify">"Each tribe will be assigned its own area in <b>the camp</b>, 
    and the various groups will camp beneath their family banners. The 
    Tabernacle will be located at the center of these tribal compounds."</p></i> 
    Numbers 2:2
<p align="justify">When Balaam looks down upon the outstretched Camp of 
    Israel, his very soul expands. It must break forth in praise. The beauty 
    captivates. The order charms. The evidence is clear--no common people there 
    reside. He rapturously exclaims, "How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, 
    your dwelling places, O Israel!" He paints a landscape of delights. "They 
    spread before me like groves of palms, like fruitful gardens by the 
    riverside. They are like aloes planted by the Lord, like cedars beside the 
    waters." Numb. 24:5, 6. Images of choice fruits--elaborate 
    arrangement--luxuriance--verdure--stateliness--fragrance--lend colors to 
    depict the scene.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, let us, too, mount the heights of godly 
    meditation, and in spirit view this favored Camp. And as we gaze, may rays 
    from heaven illumine every part!</p>
<p align="justify">The points rich in instruction are--the tents 
    themselves--their order--position--standard.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. THE TENTS.</p></b> Abodes present themselves. They are not 
    splendid palaces, and golden columns, and sparkling capitals, and giant 
    pyramids. They are not constructed, as lasting monuments to future times.
<p align="justify">The simple contrast meets the eye. They are poor tents. 
    They stand today. Tomorrow sees the cords relaxed--the fastenings removed, 
    and a vacant place. They are the pilgrim-dwellings of a pilgrim-troop--the 
    short-lived homes of short-lived sojourners.</p>
<p align="justify">This first view instantly reminds of mortal state. What 
    is our body? It is nothing but clay. These frames have one origin--the dust. 
    The vilest reptile and the proudest prince are composites of one poor mire. 
    Is it not folly, then, to pamper and admire this flesh? At best these bodies 
    are a tent--than which creation knows no humbler thing.</p>
<p align="justify">How soon they crumble! No care--no thought--no art can 
    lengthen out continuance. The countless families of foregone ages--where are 
    they now? Dust they were. To dust they are gone back. The many families of 
    this our day--where do they speed? Dust they are--to dust they hasten. The 
    tents must fall. But when? Perchance this very hour. Is he not then the fool 
    of fools, who boasts him of to-morrow's dawn!</p>
<p align="justify">My soul, from Israel's tents, you learn, <i>how fleeting 
    is life's day!</i> Press then the question, 'When I go hence, is an abiding 
    mansion mine? There is a kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world. 
    Is it for me? Christ lives to prepare everlasting homes. Are they for me? 
    Oh! turn not from this Camp, until faith clearly reads its title to the 
    heavenly home.</p>
<p align="justify">Flesh is a <i>lowly</i> abode. This thought commends the 
    grace of Jesus. He scorned not to assume it. Amazing fact! He took this 
    clothing, as His own. Beneath these <i>rags</i> He hid the glories of His 
    glorious Deity. No man was ever man more thoroughly than Jesus. He 
    tabernacled in manhood's baseness, as truly as He shone in Godhead's 
    brightness. He thus descended, that He might 
    endure--suffer--bleed--die--might bear the curse--and hang upon the cross.</p>
<p align="justify">This none but man could do, therefore His tent was 
    pitched, as man, among the sons of men. He was made <i>man</i>, that He 
    might be made <i>sin</i>. He was made sin, that He might take it thoroughly 
    away. He sought a lowly tent (body) to do a godlike work.</p>
<p align="justify">But soon the degradation passed. Humiliation's valley was 
    left. The cross was triumph's chariot. And now in heaven--at God's right 
    hand--on glory's throne--the God-man sits. Manhood now shines in Him arrayed 
    in light of Deity. And all, whom faith makes one with Him, will soon behold 
    and share this luster. Their vile bodies shall be changed. Weakness and 
    frailty shall put on unfading freshness. The lowly bud shall bloom into a 
    glorious flower. The glorious Head will leave no member in decay. </p>
<p align="justify">Blessed are they, whose faith discerns Him nailed as 
    their Surety on the tree. He comes--He quickly comes to gild mortality with 
    life. Happy the inhabitants of these crumbling frames, if only they are 
    Christ's! They now are vilest dust. They soon will shine more brightly than 
    ten thousand suns.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. THE ORDER. </p></b>Let Israel's Camp be now more closely 
    scanned. What perfect regularity appears! Rule draws each line. Arrangement 
    is complete. These streets of tents are uniformity's perfection.
<p align="justify">One truth is here distinctly written. Our God delights in 
    order. Where He presides, confusion vanishes.</p>
<p align="justify">Is it not so in every Christian heart? When Jesus takes 
    the throne, wise rule prevails. Disturbing lusts lie down. Perplexing doubts 
    flee far. Gusts of sinful desire are lulled. The soul is like the well-set 
    garden, in which <i>method</i> plants each shrub and flower.</p>
<p align="justify">Is it not so in Christian life? Each duty occupies its 
    stated post. There is no tangled labyrinth of plans--no misspent 
    diligence--no toil without a purpose. God's worship has its sacred 
    place--and no intruder interferes. The Scripture claims appointed study--and 
    then the door is barred against disturbing entrance. The family demands due 
    care--due care is given. The home--the closet--the public--the world, in 
    turn have claims--in turn are served. Each morning dawns--each evening 
    closes, on a well-ordered scheme of work.</p>
<p align="justify">How different is the worldling's day! It seems an upset 
    hive. The notes all jar--movements all jostle. It is a jumbled chaos of 
    desire--attempt--design. Motives conflict with motives--thoughts with 
    thoughts--plans with plans. Why is it so? God rules not. Wisdom holds not 
    the rudder. Therefore the ship is sport to every wind and wave. There is no 
    order, but in the Camp of God.</p>
<p align="justify">But in Israel's Camp each tribe has its place. The family 
    of Aaron guard the tabernacle's door. The sons of Levi encircle the holy 
    tent. The other tribes occupy appointed ground. God fixes all the bounds, 
    and all the bounds are gladly kept.</p>
<p align="justify">The same all-ruling mind disposes now each member of 
    Christ's body. Each enters on the stage of life, as God is pleased to call. 
    Each runs a pre-ordained course. Each disappears, when the allotted task is 
    done. We see this clear arrangement throughout the Church's history. At the 
    set time the sun of <i>Moses</i> sets--the star of <i>Joshua</i> dawns--the 
    several <i>Judges</i> rule--the several <i>kings</i> ascend the throne. In 
    the right season Paul labors--and <i>apostles</i> preach--and <i>martyrs</i> 
    seal the truth with blood--and each devoted <i>teacher</i> toils--and each 
    disciple aids the Gospel-cause. God plans each champion's station in the 
    Gospel-Camp.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, bow humbly before this ordering mind. Then 
    discontent will not arise. No murmurings will mourn an obscure lot--a 
    grievous burden--a lengthened pilgrimage--or an early grave. The time--the 
    task--the place--will be regarded, as most wisely fixed. What if self-will 
    could make a change? Would it not mar the work on earth, and tarnish the 
    eternal crown? The foot should not desire the hand's employ--or the eye's 
    higher seat. Ephraim is pleased, that Judah leads. Judah would not take 
    Ephraim's rear place.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">3. THE POSITION.</p></b> But all these tents share one grand 
    privilege. "Around the <i>Tent of Meeting</i> shall they camp." They all 
    have common focus. As the planets circle the sun, so these surround the 
    sanctuary. <i>God is the center. </i>They form the wide circumference. And 
    from each door one sight--the holy tent--is visible.
<p align="justify">Is there no <i>meaning</i> here? There is!--and it is <i>
    precious</i>. God in Christ Jesus is the center--the heart--the life--the 
    strength--the shield--the joy of His believing flock. In their midst He 
    dwells--their glory and delight. When they go forth, their eyes are fixed on 
    Him. When they return, it is to nestle round His presence.</p>
<p align="justify">Is there no <i>warning</i> here? There is!--and it is <i>
    wise</i>. Let Christians ponder this Camp's plan, when called to fix their 
    dwellings upon earth. When weighing the advantages of the right place to 
    settle, the foremost thought should be, 'Is God known here? Are His pure 
    truths here clearly taught?' There may be rites and forms. But an external 
    rituals are not grace. A heaven-directed church spire leads not infallibly 
    to heaven. 'Ichabod' is the name, if God in Christ be not proclaimed.</p>
<p align="justify">Soul-profit is real profit. And soul-profit cannot be 
    apart from Christ. Soul-loss is saddest loss--and the soul loses, when not 
    led to Christ. Our children, too, and all who form our household, claim, 
    that their first good be first considered. Was Lot a gainer, when his eye 
    only coveted the fertile plains? How David's pious spirit mourns, when 
    exiled from the house of God! Can fairer fields, or sweeter temporal 
    prospects, make amends for a cold blank within? Can healthful air repay for 
    inward sickness and a spiritual decline? What, if any tribe should have 
    receded to spots, from which the cloud could not be seen! The end would have 
    been sure. It was cut off from Israel. So all, who willingly abide far from 
    the Gospel's light, choose present darkness leading to far darker night.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">4. THE BANNER.</p></b> A banner floats above each tribe. 
    Beneath the well-known sign they rest. And by its side they march.
<p align="justify">Believers have a banner too. The banner over them is 
    Jesus's love. Song 2:4. Enlightened eyes can ever catch these waving flag 
    folds, and read therein the great Commander's heart.</p>
<p align="justify">The banner is a pledge of <b>safety</b>. True, mighty 
    foes hate and assail. True, night and day they plot and rage, and draw the 
    bow, and lay the snare. But they must fail. The fight may be both fierce and 
    long, but in Christ's Camp no follower can finally expire.</p>
<p align="justify">Beneath it there is <b>sweet repose</b>. The weary spirit 
    and the worn-out flesh can often watch no more. Unless the vigilance of 
    heavenly love defend, surprise will overpower the fainting bands. But as is 
    the vineyard of the Lord, so is His Camp. "I, the Lord, will watch over it 
    and tend its fruitful vines. Each day I will water them; day and night I 
    will watch to keep enemies away." Isaiah 27:3</p>
<p align="justify">Beside it there is <b>victory</b>. Many have fought 
    beneath the Gospel-banner, and all have triumphed. They, who go boldly 
    forward, looking unto Jesus, assuredly prevail. Paul lifts aloud the happy 
    cry--"Thanks be to God, who always makes us to triumph in Christ." 2 Cor. 
    2:14. What is the one testimony of the saints in light? We strove and 
    conquered "by the blood of the Lamb." We waved His banner and now we wave 
    these palms. We clung to it, and now we wear these crowns. Happy Camp, where 
    Jesus is Salvation's Captain--His cross salvation's banner--His heaven 
    salvation's rest!</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, glory in your banner, and be steadfast. Alas! 
    Sometimes shame, and timidities, and fears, have caused ignoble tremblings, 
    and flights, and falls. Peter denied his noble flag. Deep was his wound, and 
    bitter his repenting sighs. His warning cries, "Be courageous. Be strong." 
    Demas was allured, and left the ranks. Was he recovered from the world's 
    embrace? The all-revealing day alone can tell. But that dread time will show 
    a cowardly troop bewailing the hour, when they deserted Christ. Cling, then, 
    cling boldly, constantly, to Him. Let every company--moment--place--witness 
    your firm resolves. Wave now and ever the glorious banner--"Christ is all."</p>
<p align="justify">Thus dwell within the Camp, and you will reign upon the 
    throne.</p>
