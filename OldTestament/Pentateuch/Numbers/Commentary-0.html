<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana" size="4"><b>THE     NUMBERED PEOPLE</b></font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Henry Law<i><br/> <br/>    "Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their 
    clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one. You and Aaron are 
    to number by their divisions all the men in Israel twenty years old or more 
    who are able to serve in the army." </i>Numbers 1:2-3</font></p>
<p align="justify">These verses bring us to the camp of Israel still 
    circling Sinai's base. Christian thought—waiting for dews of heavenly 
    grace—delights to linger here. Let us observe the people closely. They are 
    snatched by God's hand from tyrannizing foes. A miracle of care supplies 
    their daily needs. A moving pillar guides their way. The law has been 
    repeated to them amid terrific phenomena. Moreover they are fenced around by 
    strict peculiarities of social custom and of typical worship. Their contact 
    with the world is broken. They move amid the nations of the earth, as a 
    stream flowing through the ocean's bed, unmingling with contiguous waves. 
    God near, with sheltering arms, is their defense. Goodness and mercy guard 
    their present steps. The land of promised rest is the horizon of their 
    hopes.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, these annals are a historic mirror. They picture 
    a heavenly Father's special dealings with each child of faith. In every age 
    and place there is an Israel thus mercifully loved, and led, and fed. The 
    antitype will never fail, until the last Christian's course is run.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence precious teaching meets us in the study of this 
    chart. We often err and fail, through dim discernment of our state. Peace 
    would abound, and comforts cheer, and strength put forth more vigor, if 
    right perceptions shed a clearer light. Let us, then, <i>view ourselves</i> 
    in Israel's varied story. Our every step finds counterpart in them.</p>
<p align="justify">The parallel is quickly drawn. They once groaned bitterly 
    in cruel bondage. But mercy set them free. Believer, you too were once a 
    slave at Satan's will. He ruled you with an iron yoke. But now the chain is 
    broken, and you rejoice, the ransomed freed-man of the Lord. Egypt is 
    escaped. The tyrant holds you not.</p>
<p align="justify">Israel's tribes are journeying, as strangers, through a 
    desert-waste. And is not yours a wilderness-wandering? The abiding country 
    is not here. The rest is far away. But they are escorted and protected by a 
    heavenly guide. So, too, a beckoning hand marks out your wanderings by 
    day—by night. Is your soul needy? The bread of life fails not. Are you 
    athirst? The wells of life are ever open.</p>
<p align="justify">They had heard "the voice of words"—the fiery law. This 
    law has also pierced the deep recesses of your inner man. You have thus 
    learned the glorious righteousness of God—the hateful sinfulness of 
    sin—your ruined state in SELF. You hence are taught to prize the grace of 
    your curse-bearing Lord, and the rich worth of His imputed merits.</p>
<p align="justify">Was Israel God's special portion? You, too, are not your 
    own. You are a purchased property—a peculiar race. You shun the world, as a 
    forbidden path—a rebel camp—an uncongenial climate—an alien tribe—a Jael's tent—a land of filth and snares.</p>
<p align="justify">This is a scanty outline. Daily experience fills in the 
    picture. Let each similitude be traced. For each is a fruitful school of 
    wisdom and improvement. There is, indeed, no novel thought in this recital. 
    Each Bible-reader knows these things. But common truths—like common 
    blessings—soon lose their point. Colors soon fade, without renewing touch. 
    The flame expires, without reviving breath. Reader, be wise, and often trace 
    your own case in this predictive story.</p>
<p align="justify">And now, before the people move, God speaks again. He 
    gives command to register the Number of each tribe. Account must be 
    distinctly taken. All names must be recorded. Their multitudes must all be 
    reckoned and exactly known.</p>
<p align="justify">New instruction meets us here. God ever leads us in a 
    brightening path. Fresh dealings are fresh seeds of wisdom. They call us to 
    discern anew His mind. May, then, this Numbering-act enrich faith's stores!</p>
<p align="justify">In common matters, men count possessions, which are <i>
    choice, and dear, and prized</i>. They, whose base joys are fixed on this 
    world's pelf—thus calculate their gold. Their coffers are often opened. 
    Frequent reckonings review the contents. See, too, the watchful shepherd's 
    care. His marking eye perpetually surveys the flock. As they go forth—as 
    they return—the Number is most diligently kept.</p>
<p align="justify">Do we, then, stray beyond sound limits—do we indulge 
    unfounded fancy—when in God's Numbering we read God's love? Do not clear 
    characters here write, that His people are thus Numbered, because 
    loved—counted, because prized? This truth extends to all the children of 
    faith's family. My soul, come bow before it. Its worth exceeds all worlds.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no blessedness like his, whose glowing gratitude 
    often realizes, My God loves me—my name is in His heart. The Lord of all 
    creation esteems me among His choicest jewels.</p>
<p align="justify">The knowledge of this fact is reached by happy steps. 
    They are all scripturally firm. Review them. <b>Why</b> was Jesus sent to 
    bear your sins, and deck you in His robe of righteousness? Why did Jehovah 
    inflict on Him the hell-pains, which were justly yours? Why was Christ 
    slain? Why are you spared? There can be only one reply, 'God loves you'.</p>
<p align="justify">And why did the Spirit speed to arouse your sleeping 
    conscience—to show self's ruin, and the remedy of the Cross? Why did your adamantine     heart dissolve, and unbelief melt into faith, and your whole heart 
    clasp Jesus, as its own? There can be only one reply, 'God loves you'.</p>
<p align="justify">How is it, that your slender bark still rides above the 
    raging billows of an engulfing world? How is it, that your tottering feet 
    are still upheld along the slippery hill, which leads to Zion's heights? The
    <i>strength</i> is not your own. It is most freely given. There can be only 
    one reply, 'God loves you'.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">When</p></b> did this love commence?—Tell me, when God began 
    to be, and I will tell you, when His love began. Will not this love expire? 
    Can God be no more God? While God is God, He must be love.
<p align="justify">God loves you! Would that the eye of faith forever rested 
    on this glorious truth! Heroic might will brace the inner man, just as this 
    thrives and strengthens. God loves you! What an amazing impulse to bear the 
    willing servant over all mountains of doubt, and fear, and hindrance! God 
    loves you! What a strong shield to ward off Satan's darts! God loves you! It 
    is victory, before one blow is struck. It is a pillow of unfailing peace. It 
    is light in the dark day of trial. It is a cordial of invigorating comfort. 
    It is the holy wing to lift above the world. It is a foretaste of a sure 
    heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">Next, <b>who</b> are Numbered? The young—the weak—the 
    female—stand apart. None are enrolled, but those whose age and strength 
    enable them for WAR.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ's service is a mighty work—a valiant struggle—a 
    determined fight. <i>Satan</i> disputes each onward step. We must 
    undauntedly resist. The <i>world</i> presents its countless troops—all 
    quick to wound—and skilled to capture. We must defy them with unwavering 
    front. The <i>flesh</i> is an internal foe—haunting the secret chambers of 
    the heart, and entwined around our very being. It gives no respite. No 
    respite must be given to it.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, yours is this warrior-life. Fight, as one 
    fighting for eternity. Strive, as one striving for a kingdom. March, as one 
    resolute to take heaven by storm. Jesus calls—commands—precedes. Follow 
    Him boldly. The Numbered host is Numbered for the fight. The fighting host 
    will soon shout, Victory. No one will triumph, who has never fought. No one, 
    who truly fights, will fail. Each Numbered soldier paid a <b>ransom price</b>. 
    Ex. 30:12. The rich—the poor—were equally assessed. There was no 
    difference for differing age or state.</p>
<p align="justify">The Gospel of this fact is clear. All in Christ's camp 
    are ransomed by His blood. All join the chosen band, confessing, that they 
    need redemption, and glorying in redemption found. All plead one sacrifice. 
    All bring the same expiation-price.</p>
<p align="justify">Next count the register. It presents a vast array of 
    Numbered warriors. They stretch beyond six hundred thousand men. Numb. 1:46. 
    Whence is this marvelous increase? One family had entered Egypt. Hardship, 
    and cruelty, and toil had done their worst to keep them low. But now, within 
    the lapse of a short period, they stand an army of this vast extent. Whence 
    is this multiplied expanse?</p>
<p align="justify">God's early promise was their portion. "I will make of 
    you a great nation." Gen. 12:2. God's purpose never fails. When He has 
    spoken, seeming impossibilities may rise—but all in vain—fulfillment will 
    not tarry. The Numbered People prove, that our God is Truth as well as Love. 
    His promise is a seed, which surely ripens into fruit.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, behold again this multitude. It is an emblem of a 
    far larger host. The conflict will soon end; and then before the throne a 
    countless company will be spread. Rev. 7:9. They are the saved from every 
    nation—kindred—people—tongue. Their robes are white; for Jesus's blood 
    has washed them. Their hands wave palms; for they have conquered in His 
    name. Say—say—will you rejoice and triumph with them? Say—say—are you 
    now warring, a comrade in these ranks? The <i>fight</i> is prelude to the <i>
    crown</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">About a year has passed since the last Numbering of this 
    family. The Levites then formed part of the collected mass. They are not now 
    included. They stand apart, a separate portion. But mark a wondrous fact. 
    The Number then and now amounts exactly to the same. Israel has surrendered 
    Levi's tribe, but Israel's forces are not thereby less. Here is a profitable 
    lesson. We never lose by giving to the Lord. Selfishness is poverty. 
    Christian benevolence is wealth. We often grudgingly withhold. The result is 
    loss, not gain. The coffers drain not, which supply God's cause. The more 
    thus given is the more possessed. They, who thus lay out, lay up.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, once more survey the Numbered People. You are 
    inclined to say, this band will safely reach the promised land. Surely their 
    willing steps will ever run in the appointed way. Alas! two, and two only, 
    steadfastly adhere. The multitude distrust the Lord. They wilfully provoke 
    Him. Therefore just indignation dooms them to exclusion. Their corpses strew 
    the desert. And one by one they line the road with graves. They fall, a 
    dreadful proof, that <b>outward privileges alone</b> do not save. Unbelief 
    nullified their many means of grace. It poisoned their cup of blessing. 
    "They could not enter in, because of unbelief." Heb. 3:19.</p>
<p align="justify">Ah, unbelief! It is the sin of sins—the misery of 
    miseries—the hopeless malady—the death of souls—the bar, which shuts out 
    Christ.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Reader, is this vile viper lurking in your heart? Oh! 
    drag it to the cross, and slay it there.</p></i> Implore the Spirit, by His 
    mighty sword, to hew it into shreds. If it survives, you die. The case is 
    clear. Can he be healed, who scorns the only cure? Can he reach home, who 
    leaves the only homeward path? Can he be cleansed, who flees the only 
    cleansing stream? Can he go in, who will not pass the door? Can he escape 
    from the fast-sinking wreck, who spurns the life-boat? Who can reach God, 
    who puts aside the Mediator? Who can be saved, who tramples down the only 
    Savior? Unbelief rejects the Gospel, and so perishes. It turns God's truth 
    into a lie, and it goes hence to learn its folly, where faith never comes. 
    Many may be Numbered, as the Church's sons, who are not Numbered, as the 
    heirs of life.
