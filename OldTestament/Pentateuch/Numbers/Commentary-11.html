<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana" size="4"><b>JACOB'S     STAR AND ISRAEL'S SCEPTER</b></font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Henry Law<i><br/> <br/>    "There shall come a <b>Star</b> out of Jacob, and a <b>
    Scepter</b> shall rise out of Israel."</i> Numb. 24:17.</font></p>
<p align="justify">Jesus is here sweetly preached—but from a heart, which 
    never loved Him, and by lips, which never more shall praise Him. It is 
    indeed a solemn personage, who now speaks. A cloak of fearful mystery 
    enwraps him. He journeys far to <i>curse</i> God's people. But when he 
    comes, he cannot choose but to bless them.</p>
<p align="justify">His name is BALAAM. His mind, his motives, and his 
    frightful course, are a deep study. <i>They are a sign-post, showing hell's 
    downward road. </i>Thus they present a vast expanse of profit, of which the 
    barest outline only can be touched.</p>
<p align="justify">His dwelling was amid the mountains of the East. His 
    intellect had there acquired some knowledge of the living God. His name was 
    wide-spread, as a man enriched with heavenly gifts. He was revered, as 
    having mystic influence in the unseen world.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence Balak, Moab's king, dismayed at Israel's conquering 
    course, thinks, that Balaam's aid would avail more than armaments. Therefore 
    he calls him, saying, "I know, that he whom you blessed, is blessed—and he 
    whom you curse, is cursed."</p>
<p align="justify">Common reputation thus made him more than man.<i> But all 
    his outward sanctity concealed a graceless heart.</i> Disguised in holy 
    livery, he was the slave of this world's prince.</p>
<p align="justify">The messengers arrive. Their errand is declared. Balaam's 
    first answer suits his fame. God seems the foremost object of his thoughts. 
    He thus professes, that God's will is his only guide—"Lodge here this 
    night, and I will bring you word again, as the Lord shall speak unto me." 
    And can so fair a morn be soon a rayless night? Alas! a good commencement 
    secures not a good end. The bud may never blossom, and the blossom may not 
    ripen into fruit. <i>Many a lost one once looked heavenward.</i></p>

<p align="justify">He tells the matter to his God. The clearest answer is 
    returned. "You shall NOT go with them—you shall not curse the people—for 
    they are blessed." And can it be, that God thus communes with unrighteous 
    men? Yes! Truth may pass the threshold of the mind, and not subdue the 
    heart. Alpine snows reflect the sun, but are not softened by it.</p>
<p align="justify">Balaam's half-heartedness now creeps from its disguise. 
    His <i>ear</i> received God's plain reply. But his <i>eye</i> looked on 
    Balak's rich rewards. He cannot but dismiss the princes. But his weak words 
    betray his hankering heart. He <i>slightly</i> says, "The Lord refuses to 
    give me leave to go." Here is not truth in its full stature. The prohibition 
    is withheld—"You shall not curse." The grand decree is cloaked—"For they 
    are blessed."</p>
<p align="justify">Unhappy man! one honest speech would have uplifted him 
    above temptation's reach. Alas! for those who halt and linger on the borders 
    of untruth. The timid clippers of God's word, the trembling fritterers, 
    suppress reality, and so deceive.</p>
<p align="justify">Satan has cast a wily net. His arts succeed. Balaam told 
    less than God's reply. The princes hasten back, and they tell even less than 
    Balaam's words. Dilution is diluted more. They only say, "Balaam refuses to 
    come." God is now totally left out—and man's demurring will appears the 
    sole hindrance.</p>
<p align="justify">The temptation is thus courted to return. And it will not 
    be slow to seek the half-inviting door. Balak sends mightier princes, with 
    larger entreaties, and more costly bribes. Balaam's <i>mask</i> now further 
    drops. He frowns them not away. Professing loyalty to God, he urges them to 
    tarry, while he sought further guidance. But he fully knew God's will. 
    Still, regardless of this, a secret longing lurked, that he might get some 
    doubtful word, which seemingly might make compliance guiltless. Alas! for 
    those, who, while they scruple to impinge against a bolted <i>door</i>, seek 
    by some <i>crevice</i> to get out.</p>
<p align="justify">God speaks again; but the restraining rein is slackened. 
    Those who shun light, will soon be left to stumble in the dark. Balaam now 
    only hears, "If the men come to call you, rise up, and go with them." Here 
    is a lowered barrier. And, intent on gain, he quickly overleaps it. 
    Uncalled, he early rises. <i>And so he rushes down the stream to earthly 
    treasure, and soul-death.</i></p>

<p align="justify">But now a prodigy bars up his course. The Angel of the 
    Lord thrice stands an adversary in the way; and then "he was rebuked for his 
    wrongdoing by a donkey—a beast without speech—who spoke with a man's voice 
    and restrained the prophet's madness." 2 Peter 2:16. Heaven and earth 
    miraculously restrain him. Still his desire of lucre will not stop. He is 
    surrendered to his evil will. Restraints diminish. He gains the terrible 
    permission to advance. "Go with the men." He deserts God. God deserts him. 
    Thus Balaam reaches Moab's land. And here he still pretends devotedness to 
    God, while his whole heart worships the idol of cheap reward.</p>
<p align="justify">What scenes ensue! Altars are raised. Victims profusely 
    bleed. The king beseeches, tempts, caresses. The wretched prophet struggles 
    to comply. He seeks all means to curse, that so he may grasp the cursed 
    bribe. He mounts the summit of the lofty rock. He thence surveys the 
    outstretched camp. He opens his mouth—and longs for words to blast God's 
    people, and secure the gold. But all is vain. As a reluctant instrument in 
    mightier hands he cries, "How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed?"</p>
<p align="justify">Surely he will now desist. Ah! No. A hateful passion has 
    become his lord. Another vile attempt is made. He moves to Pisgah's heights. 
    Thence but the outskirts of the camp are seen, and there he tarries, 
    courting a seeming license to oppose God without open rejection of a 
    servant's garb. The Lord again distinctly overrules. The struggling traitor 
    cannot but cry, "Behold, I have received commandment to bless—and He has 
    blessed—and I cannot reverse it." Will he not yield to this clear voice! 
    Will he not turn, and rather heap his curses on God's foes!</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Ah! what can change the heart, which worldly passions 
    hold in bonds? </p></i>Once more he seeks an eminence. He fully looks upon the 
    multitudinous company. Again his bad lips open. Again God conquers, and the 
    truth is heard, "Blessed is he, who blesses you, and cursed is he, who 
    curses you."
<p align="justify">Do any read, who, against conscience and clear light, 
    would touch forbidden ground? Balaam's case cries, Forbear—forbear! Be 
    firm—be resolute—at once, forever turn away. Dally not with an unholy 
    wish. Now to escape, may not be hard. Tomorrow, resistance weakens, while 
    the lure strengthens.</p>
<p align="justify">The prophet vexed—the king enraged, now part. Balak 
    reproaches—Balaam recriminates. They both are foiled. The evil union ends 
    in evil. But Balaam's lips speak once again. Unhappy man! he must proclaim a 
    Savior, in whose salvation he shall have no share.</p>
<p align="justify">"I shall see Him, but not now—I shall behold Him, but 
    not near—there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out 
    of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children 
    of Sheth." Numb. 24:17.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus is the Gospel preached by a dead soul. Let preachers 
    search their inmost hearts. Christ only in the <i>mind</i>—the <i>lips</i>—the
    <i>pulpit</i>, will not save. Many, many show, who never shall behold, Him. 
    They raise the cross, yet turn away themselves. They praise the blood, yet 
    never wash. They tell of wounds, which they touch not. They open out 
    redemption's scheme, but never clasp redemption's Lord. They teach the 
    truth, and live a lie. They point out the source of life, and pass by it to 
    death. The apostle Judas from the side of Jesus went to his own place. The 
    prophet Balaam thus preached to others, and yet he died the vilest of the 
    vile.</p>
<p align="justify">But his clear prophecy now asks attention. Where can more 
    glowing terms of Christ be found? A Star—a Scepter—a two-fold phase of the 
    most glorious sight, which men or angels can behold.</p>
<p align="justify">"There shall come a <b>STAR</b> out of Jacob." A Star, 
    what is it, but a glittering orb set in the canopy of night? It sparkles, as 
    a gem amid surrounding gloom. It darts a cheering ray on the black pall 
    around. It smiles with lovely radiance on a dark ground. </p>
<p align="justify">Such is Christ Jesus. Where He beams not, it is 
    unmitigated night. It is the skies without a star. What is such blackness, 
    but a chilly type of ignorance, and wretchedness, and sin? Take the poor 
    soul, in which Christ never shone. All these vile troops there brood. Is God 
    there known? Far otherwise. There may be vague idea of some supreme 
    director. But the realities of God's grace, and love, and truth, and 
    justice, are utterly unseen. There is no basking in a Father's smile. Each 
    step is through the maze and thickness of impenetrable doubts. There is no 
    joy of a felt pardon. There is no knowledge of sins blotted out. Such is 
    each Christless soul. But let the Star appear—what loveliness pervades the 
    scene! So when Christ rises in the heart, that brightness comes, before 
    which sin and misery flee.</p>
<p align="justify">Balaam proclaimed this Star. But his beclouded eye 
    discerned it not. Reader, say, do you see its beauteous light? All, who 
    behold it, reflect its rays.</p>
<p align="justify">Next Jesus, who thus enlightens, <b>exercises</b> <b>sway</b>. 
    His presence cheers and also subjugates. Another aspect therefore is 
    adjoined. "A <b>SCEPTER</b> shall rise out of Israel." These types of Christ 
    may seem most diverse. But they have mystic union. Is not a Savior seen most 
    surely <i>loved?</i> Is not a Savior loved most warmly <i>served? </i>As 
    surely as we cannot love, until we know; so surely we cannot know and fail 
    to love—so surely we cannot love and not desire to please. Thus the 
    Gospel-beams always give sanctifying warmth. Thus the Star brings a <b>
    Scepter</b> with it. </p>
<p align="justify">Experience proves this truth. The holiest man is always 
    he, whose soul is the widest flood of Gospel-light. <i>The more the Star is 
    seen, the more the Scepter is outstretched. </i>The more Christ shines 
    within, the more ungodly weeds decline. The Gospel-truth makes all its 
    subjects willing in a day of power. And, when made willing, they no longer 
    live to self, but unto Him, who governs by His love. Balaam proclaimed the 
    Scepter with a rebel-heart. Reader, submit to this most righteous rule. </p>
<p align="justify">Mark finally, that Balaam is forced to utter TERROR to a 
    Christ-refusing world. "A <b>scepter</b> will rise out of Israel. He will 
    crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the sons of Sheth." Numbers 
    24:17. As His willing subjects are exalted, so the rebellious world must 
    perish. They, who submit, are saved. They who resist, are dashed to powder.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, now answer, what is your state? Are you among the 
    happy heirs of this Star's kingdom? If not, take warning. His coming is at 
    hand. His glorious chariot draws near. A blessed gathering throngs it. They 
    sing. They triumph. They give praise. The rebel mass lie prostrate at His 
    feet. The crushing wheels destroy them, and from His presence they are 
    driven to that woe, where no Star rises in the endless night—and the one 
    Scepter is hell's iron sway.</p>
<p align="justify">Think, think again of Balaam. He had an inward hell, 
    while yet he lived on earth. Where is there misery like this foresight of 
    woe? "I shall see Him, but not now. I shall behold Him, but not near." His 
    eyes shall see the Lord—too late. Yes. They must open to His glorious view. 
    "But not near!" What! when He calls His ransomed to His side, and bids them 
    occupy His throne, and gaze forever on His beauty, and never leave Him 
    more—what! then to be cast out! Reader, beware! Soon will each doom be 
    fixed!</p>
