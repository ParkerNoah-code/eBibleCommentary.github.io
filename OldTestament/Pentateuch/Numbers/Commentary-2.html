    THE NAZARITE.</font></b></font></p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"This is the law of <b>the Nazarite</b>."</p></i> Numb. 6:21
<p align="justify">Here a new ordinance appears. It seems a special flower 
    set by God's hand within the garden of the Jewish code. Therefore let 
    special fragrance now be sought by faith, for surely special fragrance may 
    be found.</p>
<p align="justify">Israel's whole race was severed from the world. But the 
    wide circumference encompassed a narrower circle. Where all were separate, 
    the Nazarites occupied special separation.</p>
<p align="justify">These stood apart, as a peculiar dedication to the Lord. 
    Amid surrounding columns they rose the highest pyramids. Among God's 
    servants they wore distinctive clothing. Where all were nationally holy, 
    they showed the holiest badge.</p>
<p align="justify">They bound themselves by voluntary vows. Some mighty 
    motive must have urged their hearts. But it is not revealed. Conjecture may 
    suppose, but cannot be assured. The vow might be the act of men weighed down 
    by consciousness of sin--appalled by sight of inborn evil--or penitent for 
    grievous falls. It might be gratitude for signal mercies. It might be zeal 
    to arouse others to think more of God. But the real cause is veiled. This 
    only is declared, that Nazarites, obeying a strong impulse, gave themselves 
    peculiarly to God.</p>
<p align="justify">My soul, the Nazarite here speaks with warning voice to 
    you. Your days, are they devoted service? Your public walk, is it 
    resplendent godliness? Are all observers led to mark, that you are wholly 
    God's? But surely above all you should be pre-eminently His.</p>
<p align="justify">Think of His dealings with you--His tender love--and 
    smiles of never-failing care. Think of your Jesus--His cross--His blood--His 
    wounds--His agonies. Think of the mercy-seat--the interceding prayer--the 
    coming glory--the eternity of bliss. Think of hell merited, and heaven your 
    free-grace home. Surely each morn should see you self-bound by stricter 
    vow--and dedicated to more signal piety.</p>
<p align="justify">The Nazarite's motives are unknown. But Nazarite-rules 
    are rigidly prescribed. They are threefold. Let them now be viewed.</p>
<p align="justify">1. No juice of <b>GRAPE</b>, no produce of the vine, from 
    seed unto skin, may touch the consecrated lips. Not only the intoxicating 
    cup is banished far, but all, which grows on the intoxicating tree. 
    Enticement's total troop, from first to last, must be expelled. Like Achan, 
    and his little ones--all must die. Numb. 6:3, 4.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, this principle is broad and deep. You openly 
    avow, that you are not your own. Your body--spirit--mind and soul--are 
    purchased by redeeming blood. They all are bound a living sacrifice to the 
    one altar--Christ. Hence you must keep them 
    pure--clean--bright--strong--vigorous for His work. They should stand, as 
    servants with loins girt--ready at all times to discharge His will. </p>
<p align="justify">Then sedulously flee whatever, like the juice of grape, 
    may tend to weaken the firm energy, or to stir up the sleeping brood of 
    sensual and ungodly lusts. Alas! what evil lingers still in every saintly 
    heart! A sudden spark may cause a fearful blaze. Keep far from the beguiling 
    cup. </p>
<p align="justify">Touch not the seed or the skin. Flee not strong potions 
    only, but all that may insidiously corrupt the taste. More than gross vice 
    is branded here. Evils may enter in a pigmy form. At first they may seem 
    harmless, as the gentle dove. Avoid them. They are the cancer's touch. They 
    are the weed's first seed. Rapidly they grow. Fatally they spread. Mightily 
    they strengthen. Soon they pervade the weakened soul.</p>
<p align="justify">2. No <b>RAZOR</b> approaches the Nazarite's hair. His 
    flowing locks openly announce his separate state. His head pre-eminently 
    bears the signal of his service. The dedication must not be a secret act, 
    known only to the conscience and the Lord. The front must witness, that the 
    man is God's. Numb. 6:5.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, here is another lesson for your life. Religion 
    is not for the closet or the knees alone. It is not a lily, growing only in 
    the shade. It is to be the one attire, in which you move abroad--the holy 
    crown of hair, which sparkles on your brow. It must be conspicuous, as locks 
    pendant from the head. It is not to be cut short or hidden. It must arrest 
    attention. Like the flag, it must proclaim the country, to which the ship 
    belongs.</p>
<p align="justify">Christian meekness, and the Spirit's wisdom, never 
    conceal our faith. Truth scorns all cowardly modesty. Bold honesty rejects 
    such timid shame. Pure religion shines as the sun without one cloud. Thus 
    others profit by its rays. Thus, like an attractive magnet, it draw souls to 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He must <b>AVOID ALL CONTACT WITH THE DEAD</b>. He 
    must not close the eyes of his expiring friends, or catch their parting 
    breath, or bear their corpses to the grave. Among the living, he must live. 
    Where life is absent, he must be absent too. Numb. 6:6, 7.</p>
<p align="justify">Why is death to be thus shunned? Reasons are obvious. It 
    is the penalty of sin--the sign of God's most righteous wrath. It is a proof 
    of innocence destroyed--of evil touched--of vengeance merited. It is 
    abomination's colleague. Therefore it is emblem of what holy men should 
    abhor. Life, too, is God's inseparable essence. He cannot die. Therefore to 
    intermix with death, denotes a separation from our God.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is again a rule for Christian walk. He, who is 
    Christ's, must flee the touch of everything allied to sin. The holy garments 
    may not be defiled. The blood-washed feet must shun polluted paths. The 
    vessels for the Master's use may have no stain. The spirit's temple must be 
    pure. Corruption in no form may soil it.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, rigidly apply this maxim. It drives you from 
    the contagion of ungodly scenes. How many crowds are nothing but a crowded 
    charnel-house! The bodies breathe, but hold no breathing soul. The 
    words--the works--are odious, as an open grave. Arise--depart. The living 
    dwell not amid tombs. The atmosphere pollutes. Depart, touch not the dead.</p>
<p align="justify">How many books are deathful! They may have fascinating 
    garb. But they are only gay, as corpses decked with flowers. Their taint 
    destroys. Their chilly touch corrupts.</p>
<p align="justify">This rule brands many a pulpit, as a plague-spot. A 
    lifeless teacher often guides in paths of death. No spark from heaven has 
    vivified his soul. What, then, but putrefaction issues from his lips? <i>On 
    earth there is not a more pitiable sight, than death, in a preacher's form, 
    digging the grave of souls.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Here, too, we see the misery of those, who by dead works 
    expect to buy soul-life. All works are dead, which grow not on the stem of 
    faith. Such are but rotten berries. They live not unto God. How can they 
    purchase life?</p>
<p align="justify">But no precautionary care can always keep men from the 
    dying scene. Death has an unrestricted range. It moves among the busy 
    haunts. Its icy hand is everywhere. In every spot it seizes victims. Thus 
    the most watchful Nazarite might most unwillingly stand by the dead.</p>
<p align="justify">If so, corruption has been by his side--pollution has 
    polluted him--his vow is broken. Therefore atonement must be made. The 
    ordinance now commands him, as guilty, to seek God. He is required to place 
    a whole burnt-offering on the blazing altar. He must then add a sacrifice 
    for sin. Moreover, as a debtor, he must buy remission by a 
    trespass-offering. Thus the chief types, which shadowed out Christ's blood, 
    must all be brought.</p>
<p align="justify">This is not all. The former period of his Nazarate is 
    cancelled. The previous days are counted, as lost time. He must cut short 
    the locks, which hitherto had proved his separate state. He must commence 
    afresh his dedicated walk. Numb. 6:9-12.</p>
<p align="justify">Hark! What a voice here cries, Beware of sudden evil! 
    Satan is a lurking foe. He shoots his darts from hidden ambushes. When all 
    seems safe, a wound is given. There is a pitfall in the firmest paths. Where 
    least suspected, nets are spread. David arose, unconscious of the slippery 
    ground. A few brief moments rolled him in the mire. But there is hope for 
    suddenly contracted guilt. This type attests this blessed truth. It bids the 
    failing Nazarite to recover his lost state by offerings of blood. Reader, at 
    all times there is an open access to a remitting God. There is a Savior 
    waiting to obliterate. Come, plead His merits--present His expiating death. 
    There is no stain, which He removes not.</p>
<p align="justify">The type, moreover, shows, that pardon found must be the 
    starting post of new devotedness. The washed feet ascend anew the holy hill. 
    The cleansed hands fight with more vigor. The Nazarite, passing the 
    appointed gate, enters again upon his sacred course.</p>
<p align="justify">These reconciling rites were ordered, if the offence were 
    sudden, unintended, and abhorred. But what, if deliberate transgression be 
    indulged? The ordinance is silent here; and thus warns solemnly. Where shall 
    he turn, who turns presumptuously from God? Where is his hope, who boldly 
    touches sin? Reader, never burst conscience-bounds. Grieve not the Spirit's 
    gentle mind. Drive not the holy inhabitant from your breast. Some, who ran 
    well, have wantonly cast off the gracious yoke. The after-course has been 
    fall upon fall, without a check or turn.</p>
<p align="justify">The Nazarite vow<b> </b>continued only for a fixed time. 
    The days expired. The vow was then discharged. The badge of consecration was 
    laid down.</p>
<p align="justify">But grand solemnities attested the completion of this 
    hallowed state. The Nazarite enters the tabernacle's gate. He stands beside 
    the sacrificing altar. He brings each victim, which symbolizes sin's desert. 
    No rite is absent, which confesses need of remission, and trust in 
    reconciling blood. A lamb, as a burnt-offering, dies. A lamb again, as a 
    sin-offering, is utterly consumed. A perfect ram, as a peace-offering, 
    solicits peace. Meat-offerings in every form are piled. Drink-offerings in 
    abundance flow. Voluntary gifts profusely follow. All hair is next shorn 
    off. The fire receives it. It ascends in the ascending flame of the 
    peace-offering. Numb. 6:13-21.</p>
<p align="justify">But why is there this expenditure of blood? What is the 
    significance of this multitude of rites? They all seek expiation. They all 
    look onward to the cross--and thus they graphically show, that <i>holiest 
    deeds of holiest men can only find acceptance through the dying Jesus.</i> 
    For surely this full train of pardon-petitioning sacrifice distinctly 
    states, that the Nazarite's devoted course still needed to be cleansed.</p>
<p align="justify">Believer, is not this the conscious feeling of your 
    humbled soul? You are the Lord's. You strive to serve 
    Him--wholly--unreservedly--forever. You would bring to Him your every 
    moment--faculty--and power. You would present the offering of your 
    thoughts--your words--your works. But ah! what failures! You would do 
    good--evil is present. In public acts, what inconsistency! In private 
    duties, what outbreakings of corruption! In the closet, evil thoughts 
    assail. On the knees, the tempter haunts. Some base imagination stains 
    ascending praise. Your self-denial is too often self-indulgence.<i> The 
    badge of the 'Nazarite vow'</i><i><font face="Verdana"><b> </b>too 
    often hides a worldling's heart. </font></i><font face="Verdana">What, then, 
    shall be done? Behold the cross. There is your only help. Thence only is 
    your peace. In that most precious blood you only can obliterate your guilt. 
    Come, wash therein your every duty--service--prayer--thanksgiving. Cleanse 
    there the stains of your most holy hours. Live under vows, as a strict 
    Nazarite. But wrestle for forgiveness, as a sad short-comer.</font></p>
