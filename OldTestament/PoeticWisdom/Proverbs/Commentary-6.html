        <p align="justify">
          Solomon was deeply impressed with a sense of
          <i>the evil of immorality</i>. Nor was he less fully convinced of that
          danger to which young men are exposed, from the temptations presented
          by those <i>agents for Hell</i>, who, lost to all sense of shame and
          interest, throw themselves headlong, and as many along with them as
          they can, into an everlasting Hell — and all for the momentary
          gratification of a base and brutal passion!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          On this subject he had already said as much as might have served to
          guard any man against this danger, who was not under the influence of
          a very <i>debased mind</i>, and a very <i>depraved heart</i>. But he
          wishes to penetrate the heart of the most hardened, to rouse the most
          inconsiderate of men to serious thought. He thinks that too much
          cannot be said on a matter of such concernment to us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have in this chapter an affecting illustration of
          <i> the danger of youthful lusts</i>. The mode of instruction to which
          our teacher in the present instance has recourse, is the narration of
          a piece of history or parable, (for it matters not which), of the most
          instructive kind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Will anyone dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity,
          after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively a manner, the
          danger of so much as <i>going near </i>the harlot's house? Then he is
          as inexcusable as the man who dances on the brink of a precipice, when
          he has just seen another, who ventured to display his courage in the
          same manner, fall headlong from his place, and dashed to pieces on the
          rocks below — the sad victim of his own rashness and folly!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The danger of wicked courses should mightily recommend to us the word
          of God, which is able to keep us from falling, and to which
          self-ruined sinners give testimony, when they must acknowledge too
          late, that their misery began with their disregard to that blessed
          book.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What would men not give for an antidote that could preserve them from
          every bodily disease? If any person, possessed of such a medicine,
          were to perish by some fatal distemper, in consequence of neglecting
          to have recourse to it — surely his fate would excite no
          commiseration!
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 1-5.</p></font>"My
          son, keep my words and store up my commands within you. Keep my
          commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your
          eye. Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your
          heart. Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding your
          kinsman; they will keep you from the adulteress, from the wayward wife
          with her seductive words."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          When a man has got possession of some precious jewel, he will deposit
          it in some place secured from the predations of thieves. The words of
          God are infinitely more precious than diamonds, and ought to be laid
          up in our hearts, and kept with constant diligence and caution. They
          are to be kept as our life, for we are but dead men if we lose them,
          and they are the effectual instruments by which God is pleased to
          quicken men to newness of life, and to nourish, and strengthen, and
          preserve their souls. Without them, the life of the body is no better
          than a dream.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is our advantage which God has in view, in furnishing us with a
          rule of conduct. "Be holy," is the sum of the whole law — and the
          law's excellency is, that it is as <i>good </i>as it is
          <i>holy </i>and <i> just</i>. Those, therefore, who neglect it —
          regard lying vanities, and despise their own mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God expresses that regard which he has for his people, and that
          compassionate care which he exercises over them, by affirming that he
          who touches them, touches the apple of his eye. No less regard is
          certainly due on our part to that divine word of his, without which
          our souls must remain in darkness. The eye is a most precious member,
          and the apple of the eye is its most precious part. The Author of the
          body has guarded that part of it with a natural fence, and no less
          vigilance is exercised by us in its protection. We will not, if
          possible, permit the smallest mote to fall into it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          With equal care ought we to observe the law of God, and to avoid every
          temptation which might induce us in the smallest degree to transgress
          its commandments.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The law is to be fixed as a <i>ring </i>upon our fingers, that it may
          constantly present itself to our view, and deeply impress our hearts.
          These are the living tables, on which the statutes of the Lord are to
          be inscribed, that every inward power may be wrought into a
          suitableness unto them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We take great pleasure in the society of amiable friends. Wisdom ought
          to be our most beloved friend, and our constant companion. With this
          best of friends, let us daily converse, and thus shall we be preserved
          from the danger of infectious company, and the allurements of seducers
          to vice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who love understanding, and call wisdom their sister, are
          acknowledged by our Savior himself as his dearest relations. When we
          familiarize ourselves to wisdom, and treat her as a kinswoman — we
          shall find ourselves great gainers by it. She will preserve us from
          the immoral woman, and from her flatteries. The charms of wisdom will
          sink her beauty into deformity. The music of wisdom's voice will
          render us deaf to the most inviting eloquence of her who would tempt
          us to forget the covenant of our God. Her lips drop as a honey-comb —
          but wisdom assures us that her end is bitter as wormwood.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But those who reject wisdom, will find <i>this tempter </i>too cunning
          for them. Of this Solomon gives us a proof from his own observation.
          He was a wise observer of men and their ways, and the result of his
          observation, as well as the wisdom which he learned by experience, he
          has communicated for our caution and instruction.

        <b
          >"At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice. I saw
          among the simple, I noticed among the young men — a youth who lacked
          judgment. He was going down the street near her corner, walking along
          in the direction of her house at twilight, as the day was fading, as
          the dark of night set in. Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed
          like a prostitute and with crafty intent!"</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Though this story were to be considered as a parable, the instruction
          it contains is grounded on the observation of Solomon. He was, no
          doubt, acquainted with many who owed their ruin to the arts which are
          here described. People of every age, and gender, and condition, ought
          to watch against the temptations incident to their particular
          situations, for
          <i
            >the great master of deceit knows how to suit his temptations to the
            different tempers and circumstances of men.
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Young people, whose passions are warm and whose experience is little —
          are easily seduced into those sins which gratify the lusts of the
          flesh. The man whom Solomon observed going towards the house of the
          immoral woman, was a young man. He was void of understanding, for he
          had not supplied the lack of experience on his own part, by the
          instructions of the aged, or of the word of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If young men would be prevailed on to read and study the Book of
          Proverbs, they would not deserve to be classed among the
          <i>simple ones</i> — for it gives wisdom to the simple, and to the
          young man knowledge and discretion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This young man had no intention to pollute his body with acts of
          wickedness, (verse 21.) — but in the evening he wished to have a
          little amusement; and, forgetful of the danger of going
          <i>near </i>the dwellings of the wicked — he went in the way that
          leads to the harlot's house!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We ought daily to pray that we may be preserved from running into
          temptation; for if we invite our enemies to spread their snares for us
          — then how can we expect to escape? The time of work was over; and for
          the purpose of recruiting our strength and minds, a little evening's
          relaxation is allowable. Those amusements, however, that lead us into
          the company of the wicked, are exceedingly dangerous.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In our evening walks, let us avoid the places where we are likely to
          meet with devils, possessed indeed of human <i>shapes</i> — but not of
          human <i>hearts!</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Isaac goes out at the evening-tide, to converse with himself and his
          God, and God sends him a virtuous wife.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This poor simpleton goes out to walk in <i>the purlieus of vice</i>,
          and, behold, he meets with a common harlot, dressed out with that
          gaudiness of attire which befitted her wicked dispositions — for
          sometimes the dress of the female is like the sign-post hung out
          before the house, telling what is within. Her heart was subtle, for
          she possessed the <i>art </i>as well as the <i>venom </i>of the old
          serpent! Her temperament accorded with her dress and her heart.

          street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks." </b
        >Her vociferous tongue is the token of her imperious and stubborn
        spirit. She loves to reign, and cannot brook subjection to the guide of
        her youth; thus exemplifying a spirit completely opposite to those godly
        women who call their husbands <i>lord</i>. But clamorous and stubborn as
        she is at home, (where indeed she is seldom to be found), she has the
        art, when she comes abroad, to fashion her speech to her designs.
        <p align="justify">
          With soothing words and insinuating flattery, she seduces the unhappy
          victim of her wiles. She is fierce, like a tiger — but when a purpose
          is to be gained, can assume all the meekness of a lamb. She hates her
          own house, because she abhors useful labor, and holds her husband in
          detestation; but she is still roaming about those places where she may
          meet unwary travelers. Like a wild beast of the desert, she constantly
          prowls about those places where a prey may be expected.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let women that desire to be thought virtuous, be keepers at home! Let
          them beware of eating <i>the bread of idleness</i>, which, though not
          always, is oftentimes the companion of profligacy, and never the
          attendant of virtue.

          Modesty is the lovely ornament of the female gender — and nothing can
          be more hateful than a woman that has renounced it. When this
          <i> fence of virtue </i>is demolished, profligacy is the natural and
          unavoidable consequence. The <i>words </i>and the <i>behavior </i>of
          this abandoned creature are alike shameless. Yet, with marvelous
          inconsistency, she pretends to be religious. The feast which she
          intends for her lover, is that part of the peace-offerings which,
          according to the law, she had reserved for herself and her friends,
          after paying her vows to the Lord.

        <p align="justify">
          It is strange to tell — and yet certainly true, that there are people
          who endeavor to join together the service of God and Belial. They must
          have their passions gratified, and in all other things they will be
          obedient to the dictates of conscience. But those who think that they
          may sometimes eat a little <i>poison</i>, provided they take wholesome
          food at other times — and yet live and enjoy tolerable health, are not
          more foolish.

        <p align="justify">
          God is glorious in showing mercy to <i>sinners</i> — but he will show
          none to <i>sin</i>. She pretends a special and tender regard for this
          miserable youth, whom she wishes to draw into her <i>snares</i>, and

          This abandoned woman artfully entangles the heart of the simple youth,

          senses. She will entertain him with the delicate provision of which
          feasts were made, after performing the ceremonies of religion. His
          eyes shall be entertained with the sight of furniture, equally
          valuable for its materials and workmanship. The <i>bed </i>is decked
          with the finest linen, and the whole house <i>perfumed </i>with
          fragrances, emitted by the most fragrant flowers. All these
          <i>pleasures</i>, she informs him, may be enjoyed in the most perfect
          security, for her husband is gone far from home; and it is certain
          that he will not return until the time appointed, for he has a great
          deal of business to transact, and has carried a great deal of money
          with him, to bear his expenses, and to employ in trade.

          Beware of those sins that are represented to you as
          <i> pleasant sins</i>. They are more dangerous than others, because
          they most easily gain the heart, and most powerfully guard it against
          repentance. Eve found that <i>the pleasure of forbidden fruit </i>was
          only an introduction to horror and remorse! Our hearts must be guarded
          against the admission of sin, by stronger motives than the fear of
          detection and disgrace; for artful solicitors to evil will easily
          baffle such restraints as these.

        There is a force in words, which it is often almost impossible to
        resist.
        <p align="justify">
          Good words have a wonderful virtue in them to work upon the mind, and
          a great part of the good which we are called to do in the world, is to
          be accomplished by means of that little member — the tongue.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But corrupt minds are often found to have greater influence in
          persuading men to sin, because human nature is depraved, and needs
          only a temptation to draw men to the practice of the worst of evils!
          No words have greater force in them to persuade men to sin, than the
          flatteries of the immoral woman. Therefore the apostle Paul, who
          directs us to strive against sin, calls loudly to us to flee youthful
          lusts. Such lusts can scarcely be conquered but by flight, because the
          temptations to them, when they meet with a simple mind and an impure
          heart — are like sparks of fire lighting upon fully dry stubble!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The force that is in the tongue of the immoral woman, will not excuse
          the deluded youth; for his yielding to her is to be attributed to the
          depravity of his own heart, which inclines him to prefer the advice of
          a wicked woman, to the counsels of the Supreme and Eternal Wisdom.

          willfully sets himself up as a mark for the arrows of divine justice!

          A bird may indeed fly into the snare, for it has not the gift of
          reason — but for men to hasten into a snare, there is no excuse. God
          has made them wiser than the birds of Heaven.

          It was a good maxim, said to be delivered by an eastern sage, "Do
          nothing until you have well considered the <i>end </i>of it." The
          judgment to come will be soon present, and by the exercise of reason
          and faith, we should make it now present to us. The
          <i>pleasures of sin </i>will then be seen in a very different light.
          They will appear to be remorse and anguish, varnished over with a
          little transient pang of delight that never reaches the heart, or at
          least plays only on the surface of it.

          Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and spend all his days in
          the highest delights of sin — one hour of the anguish of Hell which
          must follow, will far outweigh them.

        When but one of the disciples was to betray Christ — all of them were
        anxious lest they should fall into such a horrid sin. When not a small
        number — but multitudes, have fallen by the force of temptation into
        immorality, and when the same depraved disposition continues in men, and
        the same temptations expose them to danger — shall we not fear, and
        depart from the evil?
        <p align="justify">
          Men have been wounded and slain by the arts of the immoral woman, who
          seemed to possess resolution and strength to support themselves
          against the most dangerous assaults. David was sorely wounded — and
          Sampson was slain. When <i>cedars </i>are shaken and fall — it is time
          for the <i>fir trees </i>to be afraid. It is a dangerous piece of
          self-confidence in us to imagine, that we are possessed of more
          strength than Sampson, or endowed with more steady virtue than David.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Immorality is not the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit — but it is
          <i>ordinarily a sin unto death</i>. He who has entered on a course of
          it, is on a staircase that leads down to death and Hell! The descent
          makes the brain so giddy, that power is seldom left to make a timely
          retreat. They are gross self-flatterers, who imagine that they may go
          on for a time in sensuality, and stop short, and repent when they
          please. Who but God can say to the waves of sin, "Hitherto shall you
          come, and no farther, and here shall your proud swellings be stayed!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David repented, and was pardoned, and so we hope was Sampson.

          The three children were cast alive into a burning fiery furnace, and
          came out unsinged — but we will not cast ourselves into the fire, in
          hope that the same <i>miracle </i>will be wrought for our deliverance.
          May the Lord keep us from temptation, and pluck out hardened
          sensualists as brands out of the fire!
