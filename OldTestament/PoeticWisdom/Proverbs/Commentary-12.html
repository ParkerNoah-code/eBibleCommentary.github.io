          >
          The reason why so many will not regard instruction, and listen to
          rebuke with meekness, is, that they think it a disparagement to their
          good sense. But in what does man's wisdom lie? Not in being
          infallible, or in needing no reproof — but in being sensible that he
          is liable to error and sin, and in a humble disposition to reverence
          instruction, even when administered in the form of reproof, and
          enforced by needful correction.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          He is an unkind father who never checks the froward inclinations and
          behavior of his children. And he is a proud and haughty scorner, who
          receives the rebukes of a father, or of any other wise person, with
          contempt and aversion. Eli's sons disregarded the mild admonitions of
          their father. Their father was punished in them for his excessive
          lenity — and they were destroyed for their stubborn contempt of
          advice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If a wise son will regard the instructions and reproofs of a father,
          how much more should we be in subjection to the Father of spirits! How

        Trees are often planted by one man and dressed by another, while the
        fruit of them is eaten by a third. But the tongue of the righteous is a
        tree of life, that yields its most precious fruits to themselves. They
        enjoy the comfort and honor, and gracious acceptance of their own holy
        and useful discourse; and these fruits are produced, not once a year —
        but every day. But the tongue of transgressors is like a poisonous tree,

        We must not only avoid speaking evil — but prudently beware of speaking
        good when it would be unseasonable. A certain philosopher being silent
        in company, and asked the reason of it, answered,
        <i

        <p align="justify">
          Destruction from God, and sometimes from men — is the punishment of an
          ungoverned tongue, which in this respect resembles an untamable
          monster which often destroys its owner. Nabal had almost ruined his
          whole family by his intemperate railing at David. The harm was indeed
          prevented by the prudent tongue of Abigail — and yet the remorse of
          his own mind was one means of bringing him to his latter end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Why does the wise man insist so much on this subject? Because the
          tongue is a most unruly member — and yet it is absolutely necessary to
          bridle it.

        >Laziness has a double tendency to make men miserable — for it affords
        to the <i>mind </i>abundant opportunity to form boundless desires — and
        at the same time it refuses the means of gratifying them. When men
        indulge an idle disposition, the desires of the <i>mind </i>are not idle
        — but enlarge themselves as Hell, and grow into exorbitant wishes, which
        even the most successful industry could not satisfy.

          Spiritual sloth is in like manner attended with spiritual poverty.
          There is no man that would not choose to be eternally happy — but the
          slothful man will not strive to enter in at the strait gate, or to
          walk in the narrow way. He has one mighty objection against Heaven,
          that he cannot make sure of it in a morning dream.

          great — and he has an abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom!

        <b
          >"The righteous hate what is false, but the wicked bring shame and
          disgrace."</b
        >
        It is not said that a righteous man never lies. David lied more than
        once — and yet he could say with truth, that he abhorred lying. Though
        he lied to Abimelech the priest, and to the king of the Philistines —
        yet his fixed hatred of sin was an evidence of piety, to which those can
        lay no claim who never spoke a lie in their lives, if their abstinence
        from this sin was caused by some other motive than hatred.
        <p align="justify">
          A righteous man hates lying in all its forms, because it is contrary
          to the nature of God, and an abomination to him. God hates all liars —
          and therefore a godly man will not befriend such as tell lies. And if
          temptation has hurried him into this sin, he loathes himself,
          endeavors to repair every injury that his lie has occasioned, and
          prays to God to remove the wicked way of lies far from him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who hate lying are valuable members of society, and are blessed
          with that good name which is better than precious ointment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But wicked men are loathsome to God, and come to shame. Whatever
          respectable qualities they may possess — they are destitute of a
          <i> principle </i>of truth and honesty. That falsehood which they
          sometimes use to serve a selfish purpose, is the same thing in their
          characters as a dead fly in a box of precious ointment, which causes
          it to send forth a stench. God and men agree in almost nothing but
          this, that a liar is detestable to both, and therefore he must sooner
          or later come to disgrace.

          the sinner." </b
        >No wonder that this truth is so often repeated. The righteous
        themselves retain not so lively an impression of it as they ought. In
        this case, Abraham should not have dissembled about his wife — nor
        should have Jacob lied in order to obtain the blessing.
        <p align="justify">
          Let us never, to avoid danger, shun the path of duty, or allow
          ourselves to be allured into that of sin, as though it were the way of
          rest and safety. What God has joined together — let no man put
          asunder. what God has put asunder — let no man attempt to join.

          <i>themselves</i>, and the <i>poor</i>, and <i>God </i>also — while

          These opposite faults, which are in this proverb censured by the wise

          All men are sensible of the conveniences that attend riches — and the

        <b>"A man's riches may ransom his life." </b>Our Lord tells us that it
        is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. This saying, if
        we firmly believed it — would have a mighty influence in checking our
        immoderate desires after riches.
        <p align="justify">
          Do we really desire to walk in that way which leads to life? Do we

        <p align="justify">
          But even in regard to the present life, there are great inconveniences
          that frequently attend <i>riches</i>. Rich men are the people whose
          houses are broken into by thieves, who are attacked by highwaymen, and
          whose lives are sometimes brought into danger by false accusations.
          They are often meeting with losses of their property, and sometimes
          they would be glad to lose it, if it might ransom their lives, like
          the ten men who willingly parted with their treasures to Ishmael the
          son of Nethaniah, that he might spare their lives.

        sometimes a defense — but the lack of it is a shadow under which poor
        men live unnoticed by the plunderers. A poor man can travel pleasantly
        in a road beset by robbers — when he who carries a full purse trembles
        in every joint.

        <p align="justify">
          In public calamities, the poor are often allowed to escape without a
          blow or a threatening — when the riches of others cannot ransom them.

        discretion and integrity. For though a man be poor — yet when he
        improves his little stock by honest labor, he shall not lack; nor in the
        greater part of cases shall he need to beg, or to be put into the
        poor-roll. There is plenty of food for himself and his family; and
        having food and clothing, he should be therewith content.
        <p align="justify">
          But some are ruined by lack of <i>integrity</i>. They endeavor to
          increase their wealth by those dishonest and unhallowed means that
          bring the curse of God into their substance, and it melts like the
          Israelitish manna before the rising sun. Others are brought to poverty
          by indiscretion. <i>Frugality </i>and <i>economy </i>must be joined
          with <i> industry</i>. Our Lord could feed men by miracle — and yet he
          would not allow the <i>fragments </i>to be lost. The seven years of
          extraordinary plenty, could not have preserved Egypt from ruin, had
          not Joseph laid up the grain against the years of scarcity.

        Parents feel those lashes with which they are obliged sometimes to
        chastise their children. But parents love their children with no true
        affection, if they are not willing to endure the smart of them for the
        good of their children. There is not a groan of the believer — but is
        felt at the heart of Christ — but Christ does not for that reason spare
        his correcting rod: "Those who I love, (says he) I rebuke and chasten."
        <p align="justify">
          The foolish fondness of too indulgent parents is accounted by them as
          parental love — but the Spirit of God calls it hatred. That affection
          which is harmful to the spiritual interests of its objects, is love in
          the language of men — but hatred in the language of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A parent would be accounted a hater of his young child, were he to
          allow him to play with a knife until he gave himself a mortal stab.
          And that parent deserves the same character, who by fond indulgence
          allows his son to bring himself to a gibbet, or to expose himself to
          the damnation of Hell.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But he who loves his son, chastens him as soon as he begins to reveal
          that folly which is bound up in his heart. He will not, indeed,
          chastise him with blows — when words are sufficient to answer the end.
          But he will administer the rod — when words have small influence. He
          will imitate the skillful physician, who prescribes medicines, neither
          too weak — lest the disease should remain uncured; nor too strong —
          lest the body should prove two weak to bear them.

        <p align="justify">
          A young bullock may be tamed — but if you allow it to grow old in
          idleness, you will sooner break its neck, than break it to the yoke!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Just so, the early days of childhood are a proper season for
          correction, because vice has not then obtained deep and firm root in
          the heart.

        <b
          >"The righteous eat to their hearts' content, but the stomach of the
          wicked goes hungry." </b
        >God's blessing gives to a righteous man food and contentment — but the
        wicked man lacks one or both of them. The family of <i>Jacob </i>were
        well fed, when the Egyptians were almost starved. <i>Elijah </i>had food
        to his satisfaction, when Ahab and his courtiers were obliged, with
        anxious hearts, to traverse the country for a supply of pasture to their
        cattle.
        <p align="justify">
          The righteous man must sometimes live on coarse fare, when the wicked
          riot in plenty. But Daniel was happier with his vegetables, than the
          others in the luxuries of the royal table. The family of Christ, too,
          enjoyed more pleasure in their barley-loaves and fish, than the rulers
          who despised them in their sumptuous entertainments.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If a righteous man has little, that little is better than the riches
          of many wicked. The wicked is often reduced to poverty by his own
          vices, and the judgment of God upon him. But if he has much, he still
          lacks the blessing of God, which alone can sweeten it, and therefore
          in the midst of sufficiency, he is in straits.
