          We must add to our faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
          knowledge <i>self-control</i>. Temperance is to be preserved at all
          times, and to be guarded in a special manner when we are called to eat
          with a ruler. For then is the trial of this virtue, and in a time of
          trial we are in great danger of falling, unless we consider the
          temptation, and watch against it. We ought, therefore, to consider
          diligently the plenty, the variety, the delicacy of the dishes that
          are served at the great man's table, the danger of being drawn to
          intemperance, and the abominableness and danger of that vice.

          >"and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          A man given to gluttony is in great danger of running to excess on
          such an occasion. For his fleshly lust within, and the well-spread
          table before him, combine to betray him. Men's consciences are too
          often so lax, as to think that the laws of temperance are to be
          dispensed with, when there is a fair opportunity, and a strong
          temptation to break them. A man of a sensual and gluttonous
          disposition ought to mortify his appetite. Gluttony is a great sin, as
          well as drunkenness. "Take heed," says our Lord, "lest your hearts be
          overcharged with gluttony and drunkenness, and the cares of this
          life." If the disciples of Christ were under obligation to guard
          against this sin, although they sat almost always at poor men's tables
          — then what need have those to take heed, who are admitted to
          entertainments where everything concurs to solicit their appetite, and
          to throw them off their guard.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "But it will be very painful," says the glutton, "to deny my craving
          appetite, when it is so strongly solicited. It will be as uneasy to
          abstain, as to have a knife stuck in my throat." Be it so, better to
          have a knife in your throat — than to have your soul betrayed by it to
          sensual indulgence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is not affliction rather to be chosen than sin? Is it not better to
          pluck out a right eye, or to cut off a right hand — than to be
          betrayed by them to pleasant sins?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sensual gratifications are harmful to the body, as well as the soul,
          and are the frequent causes of sickness, and weakness, and death. It
          has been often said, that
          <i>the throat has killed more people than the sword. </i>

          >"Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          His dainties have a good appearance to the eye, and they are delicious
          to the taste, and powerfully tempt an ungoverned appetite. But
          remember that <i>the forbidden fruit </i>did the same — and yet the
          eating of it "brought death into the world, and all our woe." When you
          see a number of dishes of very different kinds, think with yourself,
          "Here are fevers, and ailments, and gouts, in disguise.
          <i
            >Here are snares and traps spread along the table to catch my soul,
            and draw me into sin!</i
          >
          Sense gives a good report of this plenty — but <i>reason </i>and
          religion tell me to take heed, for it is deceitful food."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His food is deceitful in another view. The ruler himself has no
          generous or friendly intention in treating you. He makes great
          professions of kindness and regard, and the civilities of a ruler open
          the heart, and put a man off his guard. His real design very probably
          is to pump out some secret from you, or to gain you by his flattering
          caresses to some base or sinful compliance with his pleasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such are the ends designed, and too often effected, by means of those
          feasts that are given at the elections of members of parliament, and
          on some other public occasions of the like nature. It is often
          difficult, if we attend them, to return as temperate Christians as we
          went.

          >"Do not wear yourself out to get rich; have the wisdom to show
          restraint."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          To be rich has been the lot of many saints; and when God bestows
          riches upon us, we are not required to throw them into the sea, as a
          certain foolish philosopher did.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But when God denies us riches, we must not reckon ourselves unhappy on
          that account. Solomon often speaks of riches as a reward that wisdom
          frequently bestows on those who love her — but here he cautions us
          against supposing that wisdom encourages the love of riches — that
          universal passion which has been so mischievous to the human race,
          since the beginning of the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In our fallen condition, we must labor and sweat for our subsistence —
          but that kind of labor is useful both to the body and mind. The labor
          after riches here forbidden, and is exceedingly hurtful to both. It
          arises from an immoderate esteem of present things, and an aspiring
          mind. It is joined with a distrust of God's providence, and a hurry
          and distraction of men's thoughts, which renders them unfit for the
          service of God. It destroys all relish for the comforts of life, which
          might be enjoyed at present — and is a continual incentive to
          unmerciful and unjust behavior. It is a pity that we do not more
          attentively consider the alarming things that are said by our Lord,
          and the apostle Paul, on this subject.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But you will say that money is a necessary and an excellent thing. It
          keeps a man from poverty and dependence; it raises him to dignity and
          consequence; it furnishes everything that is desirable in life. But
          cease from your own wisdom, which is not the wisdom from above — but
          that earthly, sensual, and devilish wisdom so greatly condemned in the
          Scripture. Money, under the direction of wisdom, will indeed serve all
          these purposes, and some others too, of far greater value. But the
          <i>love </i>of money is not merely a bad thing — but the root of all
          evil, and a <i> confidence </i>in money is a very foolish thing.
        </p>

          sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Will you let your eyes fly upon money with eager joy? You shall soon
          see it fly away never to return! To look at other men's money with
          covetous desires, and an admiration of the happiness of the possessor,
          to look upon our own money with rapturous delight, because our hand
          has gotten much — is to make to ourselves <i>gods of gold</i>, as the
          ancient Israelites did, and to give them the worship of the soul.
          Therefore covetousness is called idolatry; and to rejoice in money
          more than in God, is to say to the gold, "You are our hope, and to the
          fine gold, You are our confidence."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is foolish, as well as sinful, to set our eyes and our hearts on
          riches. Will a man set his eyes upon a mere nothing? But what does
          Solomon mean by calling them so? Does not their splendor show that
          they are true substance? It must be confessed that they are
          <i>glittering nothings</i> — but so are bubbles upon the water, when
          they shine with the rays of the sun, which make them to glare for a
          moment — but don't hinder them from vanishing the next.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord tells us that they are not the <i>true </i> riches, and that
          a man's life does not consist in the abundance of them. The wise
          preacher has written a book to prove that they are the very vanity of
          vanities. Philosophers in every age have declaimed in proof of this
          point, and all men are sensible of its truth, at the season when the
          eyes of men are forced open to the sight of truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But in this passage Solomon means the <i>uncertainty </i> of riches.
          They are not, for they fly away out of sight never to return. They
          were another man's yesterday — they are mine today — they will be
          another man's tomorrow — and where they shall have flown in a few
          weeks, we cannot tell.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But <i>how </i>do they get away? They sprout wings! While you sit
          brooding upon them, they are fledging; and although you should try, by
          bills and bonds, and bars, and bolts, to clip their wings — you will
          not be able to hinder their elopement. And when you think to recover
          them, you are often making wings to what is left you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The eagle is the swiftest of birds, and with the swiftness of an eagle
          they mount up towards Heaven, and receive their commission to whom
          they should next go. Does the eagle fly by your command, or can you
          bring him back to your lure? Just so, you cannot recover those riches
          of which Divine Providence has bereaved you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who place their happiness on worldly wealth, build their
          foundation on the sand. Their joy is short, and dashed with a large
          infusion of fear and vexation. Their disappointment is certain; their
          end is dreadful — for those who mind earthly things above heavenly
          things, are enemies of the cross of Christ, and their end is
          destruction. But true Christians seek for the true riches, their
          conversation is in Heaven, and their treasure is in a place where
          there is no moth nor rust, nor any of those feathers which compose the
          <i>eagle wings of riches</i>, with which they flee away.

        >
        <p align="justify">
          The Scripture directs us about the choice of occasional companions, as
          well as friends. There are some people whom we must not receive into
          our houses — and there are some to whose houses we are forbidden to
          visit, or to sit at their tables. We are not, on every occasion,
          forbidden to eat with a ruler, although his dainties are generally
          deceitful food. Nor are we absolutely forbidden to feast with heathen
          and wicked men. But we are forbidden to eat at the table of a stingy
          man, although it should be covered with dainty foods, and his words
          full of kindness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A selfish and churlish disposition reveals itself in the eye, so that
          the miser declares his character against his will. Perhaps, through
          shame, he endeavors to hide his churlish disposition under the mask of
          a plentiful entertainment — but his malignity peeps through his eyes,
          which betray him in spite of all that he can say or do. For nature
          abhors deceit, and often detects it. But why must we not eat his
          bread, nor partake of his dainties? Because it is not the quality of
          the <i>food </i>which you are to consider — but the disposition of the
          <i>company</i>, and especially of the entertainer.

          It is not a man's <i>words </i>and <i>professions </i> that must
          determine his character, and direct our correspondence with him — but
          the disposition of his heart, which is often revealed by the general
          course of a man's behavior, to be very different from what he would
          have men to believe it is.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A man who rolls in his mind impious thoughts of God, is a wicked man —
          however good his words may be; and a man who indulges a selfish
          disposition is unfit to be a companion or a friend, although he
          invites you to his table, and never ceases, when you are there, to
          tell you how welcome you are, and how earnestly he wishes you to eat
          and drink.

        <p align="justify">
          You see how vain it is for men, to pretend that kindness which they do
          not feel. They are revealed more easily than they imagine, and the
          professions they make are means of rendering their dissimulation more
          evident. For true kindness delights not in many words. Let men then
          either be what they profess, loving not in word nor in tongue, but in
          deed and in truth — or else let them lay aside the profession of what
          they are not, for it is idle to add the guilt and shame of
          <i>hypocrisy</i>, to that of a sordid and selfish disposition.

          Men often think it a noble piece of diversion, to sponge off a miser,

          prey upon everything that is in his house. But Solomon teaches us that
          this diversion will end in vexation. You may eat the morsel with
          pleasure — but you shall repent of eating it, as much as if you had
          vomited it up. All your agreeable or useful conversation is lost upon
          him, and he is so far from thinking it a proper recompense for the
          expense he has bestowed upon you, that he will endeavor to extort
          something in return, which it may be very inconvenient to grant. And
          when you refuse, he will brand you with the character of the

          invitation, to make use of Christ, and the blessings of his salvation,
          as our own. To suspect the sincerity of the gospel call, is to suspect

          to whom our Lord tells us, it is needless and unsafe to administer
          personal reproofs. These are the <i>dogs </i>and <i>swine </i>that

          offenders — but at the same time as those who are not incurably

          Wicked men are afraid to do any injury to those who have it in their
          power to retaliate, or powerful friends to espouse their quarrel. Pure
          and defiled religion before God and the Father, is this, to visit the
          fatherless, and the widows in their affliction, and to keep himself
          unspotted from the world. And yet there are none so easy to be
          trampled upon, in this evil world, as the fatherless and widows. But
          let the poor and fatherless commit themselves to God, and the widows
          trust in him — and he will make their adversaries to know that the
          mightiest on earth are not more dangerous to be meddled with, than
          themselves.

          He who meddles with the widow and fatherless, needs better armor than
          he who touches the sons of Belial, who must be fenced with iron and
          brass. God himself has undertaken their defense, and dare we provoke
          the Lord to jealousy — are we stronger than he? He graciously calls
          himself their kinsman or Redeemer. They have lost the best of earthly
          friends. But there is one in Heaven who calls them to trust in him, as
          their husband and father, their Redeemer and advocate. He has promised
          to supply their needs, and protect them from every enemy. Their
          enemies set themselves in opposition to God, and endeavor to make him
          a liar, by frustrating his promises — but they do it at their peril.

        <p align="justify">
          Perhaps those who oppress the widow and fatherless, may allege that
          God is the Redeemer only of his own people, and that the poor and
          fatherless, whom they oppress are none of them. To this it may be
          answered, that God executes righteousness and judgment for all who are
          oppressed. He is the great lover of righteousness and mercy, and the
          avenger of all that are unrighteous and unmerciful.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          One part of the office of the kinsman-redeemer under the law, was to
          avenge the harms done to his poor friend. And this part of it God will
          perform for all who are oppressed, without exception, so that the
          oppressor will feel the terrors of the threatening contained in this
          declaration, although the fatherless and the widows through their
          unbelief, should lose the comforts of that grace, which is revealed in
          it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But how do you know, O you presumptuous opposers of God's mercy to the
          poor, that those whom you wrong are not God's people? Can you know the
          hearts of men? If you can do this, can you also look into the heart of
          God, and into the book of life, to know who are the objects of his
          special favor? How do you know but God may choose those whom you
          afflict, in the furnace of affliction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here the widow and the fatherless, may find comfort under every
          injury, and instruction how to derive the greatest advantages out of
          the greatest wrongs, by making use of the injustice of the enemy, as a
          motive to flee to God as their Redeemer, and a plea in their
          supplications for help.

          This direction is often repeated — but there is need for it — too
          often <i>we hear as if we heard not</i>. An hour or two passes after
          we have been reading a chapter, or hearing a discourse on one of the
          most important subjects — and scarcely a trace of it is left upon our
          minds.

          I have read of a minister, who was preaching a sermon on the day of
          judgment, and the solemn truths which he delivered made such an
          impression on the audience, that they all appeared to be alarmed — but
          the preacher told them that he had something yet to tell them more
          awful than anything he had said — that in two hours they would be as
          little affected with these things, as if they had not heard them;
          which accordingly proved to be the case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us take heed that we be not found among those of whom it is said,
          that the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith
          in those who heard it — for the word will not be a means of salvation
          to us, unless it is received with meekness, and engrafted into our
          souls.

          Parents are here required to give due correction to their children,
          with their own hands, and not to entrust that office entirely to
          others. At the same time they are forbidden to withhold correction
          from them, even when they are under the care of others. If teachers
          are employed to <i>instruct </i>them, they must have the power of
          <i>correcting </i> likewise — and no offence must be taken at them for
          using it. Parents would take it amiss, if anything they thought
          necessary for their children was withheld from them by those under
          whose care they are placed — and what is more necessary than
          correction? The world will think that man cruel, who does not give
          food and clothing to his child — but Solomon looks upon him also to be
          a cruel man, who does not give needful correction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the fond hearts of parents will suggest several objections to this
          duty. They cannot bear the cries and sobs of their children; they are
          afraid they will die under their hands. There is no fear of this,
          answers the wise man, they only wish to frighten you by their
          complaints. They shall not die, but live. Punish them with the rod,
          for it is one of the means that God has appointed for delivering them
          from an untimely death in this world, and destruction in the eternal
          world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What an idea does this give us, of the <i>usefulness </i> of the rod
          of correction! What parent who loves his child, and has any sense of
          the terrors of eternal punishment — will spare his rod, after he has
          heard this saying of God? Would you not force your children to undergo
          an operation by the surgeon, if you saw it necessary for the
          preservation of their lives? Are their souls less precious than their
          bodies?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You think that <i>gentle means </i>are always the best — but does not
          God tell you that this does not hold in every case? No doubt Eli and
          David wished well to their children, and their parental fondness told
          them that gentle admonitions and time, would correct all the disorders
          in their families. But they mourned at last over these children, who
          had been so much hurt by their indulgence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Whether the disorders in David's family were the occasion of Solomon's
          making so many proverbs on this subject, I shall not say — but after
          what he has said, and after what Eli and David suffered — those
          parents who do not perform this duty, are more inexcusable than these
          godly men were. Your children may perhaps complain of your severity,
          when there is no ground for it. But this is easier to be borne, than
          it would be to hear them curse you, at the last day, and from the
          bottomless pit, for allowing them to take their course in sin.

          Solomon was a wise father, and had the same wishes for his son as for
          himself. He did not greatly mind whether his son was to be very
          <i>rich </i>or not — but his main concern was that he might be
          <i>wise</i>. For he knew that if his son was a fool, the riches he was
          to leave him would do him no good.

          Just so, parents may form a judgment of their own dispositions from
          their wishes about their children. Worldly men make it their great
          work to provide those things for their children, which they account
          their own <i>best </i>things. Saints desire above all things, that the
          hearts of their children may be richly furnished with wisdom, and that
          their lips may speak right things. For the heart is the throne of
          wisdom, and by the lips she reveals her possession of that throne.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who are evil cannot ordinarily speak good things. Those lips
          will undoubtedly speak good things — when there is a good treasure in
          the heart. Language cannot express the cordial joys that a wise parent
          feels from the wise and good behavior of a son. When parents enjoy
          this blessing, let them consider, to heighten their joy and
          thankfulness, the smart that others have felt from the undutifulness
          and folly of their children.

          Let parents use every means recommended by God, for making their

          rejoice, in the happy effect of their endeavors, or at least in the
          consciousness of having done their duty.

        <p align="justify">
          When we see the wicked flourishing in prosperity, and the people of
          God languishing under oppression — we are sometimes tempted to doubt
          whether there is a divine providence, and whether the promises and
          threatenings of God are true or not — and to grudge that there is not
          a present distribution of rewards and punishments, according to the
          works of men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Unfit as we are for managing our own affairs, we are too much disposed
          to usurp God's office of governing the world; and if he does not
          shower down blessings into the lap of those whom we esteem, and fire
          and brimstone upon the head of the wicked — then we think that God
          cannot see things through the dark cloud, or is unfit to manage them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But we are here directed to banish envy from our hearts, and as an
          antidote to this mischievous passion, to be in the fear of the Lord
          continually. Envy of the wicked is a great enemy to the fear of the
          Lord. Asaph's feet had almost stumbled when he looked with a grudging
          eye at the prosperous circumstances of the wicked — but by the fear of
          the Lord, he was preserved from falling, and was recovered from his
          dangerous situation. For a deep and heart-affecting impression of the
          infinite excellencies of the divine nature, will silence our
          murmurings and subdue the insurrections of our hearts. If we are
          deeply impressed with a sense of the <i> righteousness </i>and
          <i>holiness </i>of God, and of his <i>wisdom </i>and <i>goodness</i> —
          we will believe that his ways are always right, and that there can be
          no unrighteousness in his administration, even when we cannot discern
          the reasons of it. "Clouds and darkness are round about him — but
          righteousness and judgment are still the habitation of his throne."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are required to live in the fear of the Lord all the day long.
          Whether we are in prosperous or in adverse circumstances, and whether
          the wicked around us rise into affluence and power, or sink into
          insignificance and misery — an impression of God's perfection, and of
          the happiness that attends true religion, and the misery that follows
          sin — must dwell upon our hearts, and govern our conduct.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This fear of God will banish from our minds impious reflections upon
          God, and dispose us to keep his way, even when wicked men are in
          power, and threaten to banish all religion out of the world. For still
          we shall believe that it will be well with the righteous and ill with
          the wicked, <i>perhaps </i>in this world — but most
          <i>certainly </i>in the next.

          If things were to continue in their present state through eternity, or
          if there were no eternity before us — much might be said for the
          wisdom of impiety, and the folly of religion — but reason gives us
          probable arguments for a future state, and the Bible assures us of it.
          Job saw the prosperity of the wicked with astonishment — but he knew
          that their day was coming. And when he saw that some of them died
          amidst friends and prosperity, and were honorably buried — he inferred
          that there was a day of wrath to which they were reserved. He was in
          like manner fully persuaded, that his living Redeemer would raise his
          own dust at the last day, and wipe off all his reproach, and give him
          the transporting sight of the divine glory, to his eternal happiness.
          His hope of this blessedness was so lively, even when there was no
          Scripture, that he expresses an ardent wish that his profession of
          hope might be inscribed forever in the rock, with a pen of iron. And
          it was written, not on a rock, to be read by the dwellers in the land
          of Uz — but in the book of God, to be seen and read of all men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Did Job triumph in this blessed hope amidst afflictions that would
          have swallowed up all the courage of a philosopher and hero? Shall we
          faint, who are instructed by Moses and the prophets, by the Apostles,
          and the Lord himself, concerning the unspeakable felicities of a
          future state, and the right we have to look for the mercy of our Lord
          Jesus Christ unto eternal life? Besides, we have a great cloud of
          witnesses to assure us that it is not a vain thing to wait for the
          salvation of the Lord, and that the expectation of the godly, although
          it may seem to be cut off, shall not perish forever?

          Abraham had a promise of a son, by whom his seed were to be like the
          stars for multitude — and yet he waited until Sarah's womb, which was
          formerly barren, was now dead, before he had the promised son. He
          waited sixty years longer, before he saw any children by Isaac — but
          still he was persuaded that the Word of God was true, and that his
          <i>promise </i> was the same thing as <i>performance</i>. He had the
          promise of Canaan — and yet he traveled through it as a stranger and
          pilgrim — but he trusted God, and what he had promised, he performed
          long after Abraham went to sleep with his fathers. And those who give
          credit to the testimony of God, and wait with patience in the hope of
          the promise, are blessed with faithful Abraham.

          It is not sufficient, although it is necessary, for us to hear the
          instructions of the inspired moralist. We are called to learn wisdom,
          which is to be acquired by hearing under the influence of that blessed
          Spirit by whom these truths were dictated. Hearing without being made
          wise, will aggravate our guilt, and make our condemnation more
          dreadful. But to expect wisdom without hearing, is to expect
          nourishment without food. Let us hear then, with all that meekness and
          affection which is due to a kind father instructing his beloved
          children. With hearing let us join prayer to that God, by whose
          direction and in whose name Solomon speaks to us as children. For our
          heavenly father will give the Spirit of wisdom and revelation to those
          who ask him.

        <p align="justify">
          What is that wisdom that we are called to seek after? Wisdom to guide
          our heart in the way, for Zion's travelers must have the way that
          conducts to blessedness in their hearts. Our <i>feet </i>and our
          <i> hearts </i>must be in the same good paths, for no man is truly
          religious, whatever his outward conduct is, unless his heart is right
          with God. The Word of God is then truly useful to us, when we rejoice
          in the way of God's testimonies, more than in all riches.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If we would have our hearts guided in the way, then we must hear what
          the wise man is going to say to us against intemperance in eating and
          drinking. For as those who run in the Grecian races, and strove for
          masteries in their games, were obliged to be temperate in all things,
          in the view of a corruptible crown — so those who have the eternal
          crown in their eye, must exercise a proper care over themselves, that
          they may not be pressed down with the immoderate use of food and
          drink, and thereby rendered unfit for the Christian course.

          Although we do not dethrone reason by drinking — yet if we impair the
          vigor of it, and render ourselves less fit for the business of life,
          and the service of God, than we are at other times, by the free use of
          the bottle — then we are drunkards. Food is fit provision for our
          bodies, and it is freely allowed us by God for bodily provision, under
          the New Testament dispensation — but it is great ingratitude to God to
          abuse his goodness in order to serve the lusts of the flesh.

          impaired, and the seeds of weakness, and drowsiness, and disease, sown

          We are forbidden, not only to be drunkards or gluttons — but to be

          many who were once sober, have been enticed by them to go to excess,

          Those who have been long inured to a temperate course of life, must
          not think that they are at liberty to infringe this precept, and to
          mingle themselves with gluttons and drunkards, because they are strong
          enough in their own eye to overcome all the temptations of sensuality.
          Christ charges his own disciples, who had been practiced in every
          virtue under his own eye, and who had less temptations to this vice
          than any other men, to take heed to themselves that their hearts might
          not be weighed down with self-indulgence and drunkenness; and we find
          the apostle Paul, who was so often in want, very anxious that he might
          not transgress this precept. But what harm is there in learning the
          ways of the drunkard and glutton? Much harm even in this world, as any
          man may see, who will but open his eyes!

          >"For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and
          drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Poverty may be born with patience and cheerfulness, when it is merely
          a misfortune. But that poverty fills the mind with remorse and
          vexation, which is the fruit of a man's own bad conduct. And no
          self-contracted poverty is so disagreeable as that which a man brings
          upon himself by gluttony and drunkenness, which at the same time that
          they deprive a man of the necessities of life — create in him a
          craving appetite after superfluities and luxuries. As miserable as men
          must be, by being reduced to such unhappy circumstances — they are
          almost unpitied when they fall into them. For who will pity one for
          misfortunes into which he rushes with his eyes open? If a man will not
          pity himself, it is vain for him to expect pity from his neighbors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The drunkard or glutton may flatter himself with vain hopes that he
          shall escape poverty, and that tomorrow shall be as this day, and much
          more abundant — but reason and experience, as well as Scripture,
          confirm the truth in our text. For if the <i>slothful </i>man bring
          himself to poverty, the <i>waster </i>must do it much sooner,
          especially as luxury and reveling bring drowsiness and sloth in their
          train. For by a course of sensual indulgence, a man is indisposed to
          labor and prudent care; so that, while he throws away with one hand —
          he gathers nothing with the other to supply his numerous needs. The
          slothful man is brother to him who is a great waster — but when the
          great waster is likewise a slothful man, as is generally the case,
          poverty is coming to him with hasty steps, and with resistless force.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Hell is at a great distance, the sensualist thinks, and lies quite out
          of the view of mortals, and wine has so besotted him, that he cannot
          think seriously about it — but here he is told of one part of his
          punishment, which he cannot put off to a distant day, and must feel,
          unless he is stupefied to an extraordinary degree. For his wicked
          relishes might themselves excite a proper sense of the harm of poverty
          — and how hardened must they be in sin who cannot be driven from it,
          either by the terrors of the world to come, or the miseries of this
          world?

          Solomon takes it for granted that our fathers and mothers will give us
          good counsel and instruction. For they are monsters, and not parents,
          who are unconcerned about the present and eternal welfare of their
          children, and quite negligent of those means that may contribute to
          such valuable ends. Children should consider what they owe to their
          parents, and what affection they manifest in their good counsels and
          instructions — and what monsters of ingratitude they are, if they do
          not show respect to those who have conferred obligations upon them,
          for which they can never make a sufficient recompense, and to those
          instructions which can have no object but their own benefit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Mothers are to be honored as well as fathers; nor must we despise them
          — but reverence their good advices, and kindly sympathize with their
          infirmities when they are old. They may then prove peevish and
          fretful, and lose much of their understanding, and become
          <i>children a second time</i>. But they took care of us when we were
          helpless children, and our froward passions did not then provoke them
          to cast us away — but engaged their pity and help. It is only when the
          instructions of parents are good and sound, that we must receive and
          comply with them, for we are bound to cleave to the <i>truth </i>at
          all risks.

          understanding."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          The truth revealed in the Word of God is infinitely valuable and
          interesting, and therefore we are commanded to buy, and not to sell
          it. Men are enriched by buying and selling other commodities — but in
          our dealings about truth we are enriched by buying alone, whatever is
          the price — and impoverished by selling, whatever price we might
          receive.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But why are we commanded to buy? Does God receive a price from us for
          his truths? By no means. But we are commanded to buy, because we must
          grudge no expense or toil in seeking the truth. The wise merchant is
          he who is so impressed with its value that he is willing to go and
          sell all he has, that he may obtain possession of this precious
          treasure. Merchants will venture their money and their lives for those
          commodities by which they expect to make profit, although they often
          meet with disappointments and losses. Why then should those who
          profess to value the <i>truth </i>above everything, be so careless
          about obtaining the knowledge and experience of it, when the value of
          it will abundantly recompense all our pains and losses in the search
          of it, although we should lose our life on its account?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          On no account must we sell the truth. Had Paul been offered all the
          kingdoms of the world, and all the glories of them, for one article of
          truth, he would have answered, "I have suffered the loss of all things
          already for Christ, yes, doubtless, I count all things but loss and
          dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must rather part with our lives than with the truth, and here we
          have the example of the noble army of martyrs who loved not their
          lives unto death for its sake. He who loses his life for the sake of
          truth, and a good conscience, is a great gainer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If it is a great sin to sell the truth, even when our life is offered
          for it — then what shall we say of those who part with it in
          profession or practice, without receiving any price at all for it?
          Surely they have a small regard for the truth, or for the great Author
          of it, who wantonly cast away this precious pearl, and take a pebble
          in its place.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must show the same sacred regard to wisdom, and instruction, and
          understanding, which are inseparably connected with the truth. For we
          have no true hold of the truth, however clear our apprehensions of it
          are, or however zealously we profess it — if we are not made wise, and
          led in the way of duty by its influence. That wisdom and understanding
          which is not grounded in truth — is but cunning craftiness and
          splendid ignorance. That instruction which is not according to truth,
          is poison to the soul. Truth is to be received into the mind and
          heart, and rule our conduct. Those only are wise unto salvation, who
          receive the truth in the love of it, and hold it forth in their
          profession, and walk in it until they reach the end of their course.

          This divine teacher, in the name of God, requires our hearts to be
          applied to the word of exhortation. "Set your hearts to all the words
          which I testify among you this day," said the Jewish lawgiver, "which
          you shall observe, to do all the words of this law." The same demand
          is made on us in this and in several other passages of this book. And
          the demand would not be so frequently made, if it were not necessary.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are naturally indisposed to give a due attention to the Word of God
          — for our hearts are vain, and earthly, and carnal. And yet, unless we

          Paul gives thanks to God for the saints at Rome, because, from the

          them — that their whole temper and life might be formed into a
          correspondence with it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord, in his parable of the sower, speaks of four different sorts
          of hearers of the word, and there was only one sort who received real

          Our hearts are naturally intractable and perverse and we cannot work

          Our hearts, vile and worthless as they are — are claimed by him. He is
          our Creator and Redeemer, and he calls us to give up our souls and
          bodies unto him. He will form them anew, and take the stony heart out
          of our flesh, and give us hearts of flesh, and put his Spirit within

          the ways that he instructs us to walk in are those good paths wherein
          rest is to be found. He smarted greatly with the wounds made in his
          conscience by his correspondence with immoral women, and none of the
          Old Testament writers sound so loud alarms of the danger that we are
          in from the arts of such <i> seducers</i>. He fell into the deep and
          narrow ditch — but by the grace of God he escaped with life, and warns
          us all not to risk our souls in the manner he had done.

          And those who cannot do without it — but go in search of it, feeling
          themselves quite unhappy when they are not pouring it down their
          throats, and who are such sensualists that they cannot be satisfied,

          pleasure that brings so much pain and vexation along with it! Wine is
          raging, and pushes on the people that swill it down, like madmen, to
          fightings and contentions. It takes from them, in a great measure, the
          use of their tongues, and makes them to stammer — and yet it fills
          their minds with so much vanity and wickedness that they must speak
          and pour forth floods of profaneness and ribaldry, of nonsense and
          wickedness. By this means drunkenness stirs up squabbles and
          fightings, which end in wounds without cause. For the drunkards

          And what harm is there in looking upon the pleasant liquor sparkling
          in the cup? What harm, you may as well ask, was there in Eve's looking
          at the fruit of the forbidden tree, or in Achan's looking at the
          golden wedge, or Babylonian garment? Or what harm is there in looking
          at a beauteous face, until lust is excited in the heart?

          To look with pleasure at a tempting object, is very unsafe, for the
          <i>imagination </i>catches fire, and the <i>passions </i>are inflamed,
          and <i>reason </i>is gradually deposed from its throne. Such are the
          natural consequences of looking at the delicious liquor. Caesar came,
          and saw, and conquered — but the drunkard comes to the tavern, he sees
          the flowing blood of the grape, and is conquered. He drinks and tastes
          a little pleasure while the liquor is passing down his throat, but,

        <p align="justify">
          If drunkards saw a viper at the bottom of the glass, although it were
          dead, they would rather pour all the liquor into the street than drink
          it. But the wine itself is worse than any viper. It infuses a deadly
          though slow poison into the drunkard, and his body becomes the seat of
          disease.

          Nor are the miserable effects of it confined to himself — but they are
          frequently entailed upon his posterity, who suffer by their father's
          fault, and are often obliged to drag out a wretched life in weakness
          and disease, and suffering.

          But it poisons the soul worst of all, for it breeds that worm of
          conscience in comparison of which the bite of an adder is pleasure and
          health. It exposes the drunkard to the lake of fire and brimstone,
          which is the second death, where the wine of the fierceness of the
          wrath of Almighty God must be drunk, without intermission or end, and
          where the drunkard shall be punished, not only for drunkenness — but
          for a countless multitude of sins, to which this vice led the way!

          Other vices work their own way into the soul — but this mischievous

          sin of immorality and filthy speech.

          Drunkenness produces new vices, and discloses the old. It removes
          every fence of reason and religion, and makes the person overpowered
          by it to resemble a city without walls, into which the besiegers find
          an open passage that they may enter, and commit what ravages they
          please.

          Lot kept himself pure in Sodom — and yet his daughters, by making him
          drunk, knew that they could easily draw him to incest, for they had
          seen the men of Sodom tempted, by their gluttony and intemperate
          drinking, to every excess of wickedness.

          A Roman author tells us, that, in the good days of Rome, drinking of
          wine was absolutely prohibited to women, lest drinking should tempt
          them to unchastity. For, as the same author observes,<i>
            it shuts the door against every virtue — and opens it to every
            vice</i
          >. Drunkenness besots the heart, and makes it to utter perverse and
          abominable things by the tongue. For blasphemy is wit, and ribaldry is
          eloquence to a man who is turned into a brute.

          Can a man who is a slave to strong drink find no possible means of
          escape from his bondage? He will not make his escape, for his heart is
          infatuated, and he cannot prevail upon himself to forego a momentary
          indulgence, although it should cost him the torments of a whole life,
          and of an awful eternity! He feels the inconveniences that result from
          his indulgence to his appetite. But
          <i>his appetite has a sovereign dominion over his reason</i>, and
          forces it to find out some pitiful shifts and pretenses to excuse his
          continuance in his abominable habits.

          "Drink," says one, "steals away a man from himself, and leaves a brute
          in his stead." This is saying much — but not all. A drunkard is a
          self-made brute, and is far more senseless than a natural brute beast.
          It has been found upon trial, that a brute, after being once deceived
          by wine, would not venture upon it a second time. But the self-made
          brute, after he has felt an hundred times the harms of drinking,
          becomes still fonder of his misery, and makes his understanding to
          serve only for palliating his folly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If wicked men can patiently bear such harms for the sake of a beloved
          lust, which will at length bite like a serpent, and sting like an
          adder — then why should we grudge at the little hardships that we
          sometimes undergo for the sake of religion, which will be so richly
          recompensed. If the servants of Satan are willing to bear innumerable
          crosses and curses for the love they have to his service — then why
          should we bear with reluctance, in the service of God, those crosses
          which are blessings in disguise?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let those drunkards who have any remainders of understanding, compare
          the inconveniences that might attend the mortification of their
          appetite — with the miseries that God has inseparably joined to a
          continuance in their criminal indulgences. And if they can say that it
          is not a thousand times better to put a knife to their throat, than to
          be tyrannized over by such a pernicious lust — let them swallow down
          gallons every day of their life.

          The Lacedemonians used to make their slaves drunk in the presence of
          their children, that when they saw what monsters men were turned into
          by sensuality, their children might contract an irreconcilable
          aversion to this vice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon gives us such a lively picture of this vice in the paragraph
          before our eyes, that we need not the sight of a drunken man to excite
          our detestation of drunkenness. Isaiah gives us a description of it
          equally shocking. What excuse is left for a drunkard who has ever read
          the Bible? How will his mouth be stopped at the last day! How will he
          curse himself through eternity, for making himself first a beast, and
          then a devil!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A master in the art of moral painting, gives us a just picture of
          drunkenness in these words, "Drunkenness is a distemper of the head, a
          subversion of the senses, a tempest of the tongue, a storm in the body
          — the shipwreck of virtue, the loss of time, a willful madness, a
          pleasant devil, a sugared poison, a sweet sin. He who commits it, does
          not only commit sin — but is himself altogether sin."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us therefore follow the counsel of the wise man. Be not among
          wine-bibbers. For he who goes to the tavern for the love of company,
          will soon go there for the love of strong drink. Let us follow the
          counsel of another inspired writer, "Be not filled with wine wherein
          is excess — but be you filled with the Spirit. Let us walk in the
          spirit, and we shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If, after all, we rather choose to follow the council of the wicked
          one, there is no help for it — but those who walk according to the
          prince of the power of the air, and fulfill the lusts of the flesh,
          must have their portion and dwelling with him whose galling yoke and
          crushing burden they prefer to the sweet yoke and light burden of the
          Redeemer. Christ would heal you — but if you will not be healed. Howl,
          O you drinkers of wine, for the fruit of the vine shall be cut off
          from your mouths. Joy shall wither away from your eyes, and a cup must
          be put into your hands, of which the wine is red. It is poured out
          full of mixture, and the dregs thereof you must wring out, and drink!
