            anger." </b
          >Anger is a fire that burns unto destruction, and it is our duty to
          bring water to quench this fire. A soft answer to provoking words, is
          like water to a fire. By gentle language, joined to liberal presents —
          Jacob pacified the fierce resentments of his brother Esau. He prayed
          to God, and trusted in him for the preservation of his family — but he
          did not neglect the proper means of calming his brother's angry
          spirit.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          There are some tempers so intractable that they cannot be pacified —
          but these are rare, and seem to be under some powerful influence of
          the devil, like that of Judas Iscariot, who was not reclaimed by the
          kind words of our Lord from executing his bloody purpose; or those
          miscreants that seized on our Savior, although to his ordinary
          gentleness, he added his miraculous power in healing the ear of
          Malchus.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But there are some who cast oil upon the flame of anger, and make it
          to burn more fiercely by their grievous and provoking words. What can
          such people expect — but to be consumed by their own rashness?
          <i> Anger is a temporary madness</i>, and when two mad people are
          engaged, they both are in danger or receiving deadly wounds. Let us,
          therefore, endeavor to bridle our passions, and guard ourselves by the
          meekness of wisdom from the fierce passions of other men — lest, by
          biting and devouring one another, we be consumed one of another.

          The fierce words of the men of Judah and Israel, when they were
          bringing back David to his throne, kindled a new war, which, without
          active and prudent management in David and his generals, might have
          produced fatal consequences.

          fools pours out foolishness." </b
        >The wise man knows when he ought to be silent — and when he should
        speak. He will not cast his pearls before swine, and give his holy
        things to dogs. His words are good, for they are spoken in due season,
        and he knows how to address himself in a proper manner to different
        people, according to their tempers and circumstances.

          But our Lord is the most glorious instance of the right use of
          knowledge. The different answers be made to his friends and enemies,

          wisdom — afford us a pattern of prudence, joined with inflexible
          integrity.

        <p align="justify">
          But fools turn the little wisdom and knowledge they have into folly —
          for their mouths pour out foolishness, as a fountain casts out her
          streams. They are not masters of their tongues — but their tongues are
          masters of them. While wise men have the fear of God set for a
          sentinel upon the door of their lips — the fool's lips have neither a
          door nor a guard — but everything that is within comes out. And as

          good." </b
        >The eyes of <i>men </i>can be but in one place, because themselves are
        limited to one place. But the eyes of that <i>God </i>who fills Heaven
        and earth are everywhere. Angels are full of eyes before and behind —
        but God is all eye — and even the darkness cannot hide from him. He is
        in Heaven by his glorious presence; and that high and holy place is like
        a watch-tower, from whence He espies the evil and the good.
        <p align="justify">
          Evil men flatter themselves that none sees or knows their wickedness,
          as if God could not see through the dark clouds — but He is a witness
          of what they speak and do in their bed-chambers, nor does a single
          thought of their heart escape His notice!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Shall we do that before the eye of God, which we dared not be guilty
          of in the presence of a child?

        <p align="justify">
          Alas! how is the God who sees all things despised and insulted by men!

          every evil-doer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His eyes behold the godly also — and this is their great consolation
          when they are overlooked or poorly treated by men. God knows their
          integrity, and beholds with a pleasant countenance their humble and
          sincere endeavors to please Him, and to do good to men. Every thought
          of His name, and every good word that they speak — is written by Him
          in a book of remembrance. He beholds all their secret sorrows with an
          eye of pity, and puts their tears in his bottle! Not a moment does He
          withdraw His eye from the righteous.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Godly men need not fear that God will forget any of His gracious
          promises. They will be all accomplished in due season; for His eyes
          run to and fro through the whole earth, to show Himself strong in
          their behalf. And His providence is constantly employed to glorify His
          faithfulness, in fulfilling that word which He has magnified above or
          upon all his name.

          >"The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful
          tongue crushes the spirit."
        </b>
        The tongue that administers proper and seasonable counsels, comforts,
        and reproofs — is a healing tongue. Unmerited rebukes, reproaches,
        unkind words, and cruel mockings — are perverseness in that little
        member, which boasts and can really effect great things.
        <p align="justify">
          The advantages derived from a healing tongue are like the fruits of
          the tree of life — the <i>erring </i>are reclaimed, the
          <i> dejected </i>are comforted, the <i>weak </i>are animated and
          invigorated by it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When Job weak in deep distress, he was very sensible how pleasant
          these fruits were, which he had no opportunity to taste, and tells his
          friends, that if they had been in his situation, he would have
          strengthened them by his words, and assuaged their grief by their
          speech.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>words of God </i>have a divine virtue for healing the diseases
          and the wounds of the spirit. This is the dispensary from which we are
          to derive healing words for the broken in spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But perverseness in the tongue crushes the spirit. It wounds and
          pierces, it breaks and bruises, the heart of him who is reproached by
          it.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Job</p></i>would not have exposed himself so much
        to the censures of Elihu, if his more aged friends had behaved more
        kindly to him. His patient spirit felt the piercing edge of their unjust
        reproofs most sensibly. <i> <p align="justify">David</p></i>felt none of
        his afflictions more bitterly, than the keen reproaches and insults of
        his enemies.
        <p align="justify">
          And our Lord Jesus Christ exemplified his unconquerable patience in
          bearing the contradictions of sinners, and enduring with all meekness,
          though not without afflicting sensibility — the indignities that were
          poured upon him. When we are exposed to the scourge of the tongue, let
          us remember that he was tempted like as we are, and imitate his
          patience, and trust in him for the supplies of needful grace.
        </p>
        <b

          fool despises his father's instruction — but he who regards reproof is
          prudent." </b
        >A father's instruction proceeds from love, and it is folly and
        ingratitude to despise it. Yet some children are such enemies to
        themselves, and so unnatural to their best friends, that they break the
        hearts of their affectionate parents, by spurning those admonitions that
        are needful for their own welfare. They are like froward patients, who
        are angry at the physician for giving them medicines which are
        beneficial — but taste bitter.
        <p align="justify">
          In a father's instructions there is <i>authority</i>. The authority of
          parents over their children has been acknowledged by the heathen
          nations — and is ratified in that law which was spoken by the mouth,
          and written by the finger of God. When they reprove their children,
          the authority of God is joined to the authority of parents, to enforce
          their admonitions. For they are expressly required to attempt the
          reformation of their children by rebukes and corrections.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He who despises his father's reproofs; despises not only man — but
          God! This is folly in the extreme, and he who was a
          <i>fool </i> before he received instruction, becomes <i>mad </i>when
          be resists it! If a fool despises his father's instruction, it is not
          to be supposed that he will pay much regard to the admonitions of
          other men — but a prudent man will receive correction, and be thankful
          for it, not only from a father — but from any person, though inferior
          to himself in station or wisdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David allowed himself to be reclaimed by the wife of Nabal, and Sarah
          received with meekness the reproofs of a heathen king.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          People may receive instruction, when it does not touch their pride —
          and yet have no solid wisdom. But he who receives reproof with
          calmness, and makes use of it for the correction of his life — gives a
          sure proof of his prudence. There are many people who come to church,
          and sit as God's people sit, and appear very attentive to the
          preaching of the word — but if there is any occasion to administer the
          censures of the church to them, they are like a horse or mule when
          their sores are touched; and the bit and bridle will scarcely hold
          them in from coming near unto their reprovers.

        >
        <b>"The house of the righteous contains great treasure." </b>That there
        is much treasure in the house of some righteous people, is certain — but
        it is equally certain that some of those who are rich in faith, have no
        silver and gold, and can scarcely find daily bread. Solomon was not
        ignorant of this, and explains this proverb in verses 16, 17.
        <p align="justify">
          There is incomparably more of solid treasure in the little that a
          righteous man has — than in the great wealth of many wicked. The
          blessing of the Lord is in the house of the righteous, and that is a
          more precious treasure than the gold and diamonds in a thousand mines!
          The riches of the wicked, in which they pride themselves, often
          consist of <i> papers</i> — and if bonds and charters make a man rich,
          the righteous cannot be poor, when they have bonds upon God himself
          for everything they need, and the charter which shows their sure title
          to the everlasting inheritance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The devil robbed Job — but he could not make him poor, for his chief
          treasure lay quite out of the reach of that enemy. Had he served God,
          as the devil said, for hire, he would have been poor indeed — but a
          good conscience, and faith in the living Redeemer, could not be torn
          from him as long as he lived.

        larger than their possessions. And whatever they have, they lack
        satisfaction, and are still crying,<i> "Give, give!" </i>They have,
        besides, a bad conscience — and a drop of that bitter ingredient is
        sufficient swallow up an ocean of earthly delights.

        The wise man does not boast of his wisdom, or make a vain parade of his
        knowledge — but he is far from grudging the benefit of it to others. He
        does not behave like that foolish miser who keeps his precious grain
        shut up in his storehouses, until it rots, or is destroyed by vermin. He
        scatters the good seed of knowledge, where there is any probability that
        it will do good. As the gardener, although he will not sow upon the rock
        — will nevertheless commit his seed to that ground where he is not
        certain of a good increase, and is not deterred by every cloud from his
        work. So the wise man will endeavor to do good, even to those who may
        possibly disappoint his kind intentions, and prove ungrateful for his
        offices of love. He who disperses knowledge wisely, shall not be
        disappointed of a harvest of gracious recompenses to himself.

        <p align="justify">
          But the wicked man cannot disperse knowledge, for he has not a right
          heart. There is no good treasure in his soul to furnish useful
          instructions to others — but an evil treasure within, from which he
          brings forth evil things. He sows the seed of tares and hemlock, and
          shall reap destruction to himself!

        Wicked men may abound in the external acts of religion, as if they
        intended to compensate the defects of the inward man, by a double
        measure of external religiosity. By this means they flatter themselves
        into dangerous and presumptuous hopes of the favor of God, and sometimes
        gain a name among the godly, who are neither qualified nor authorized to
        search the secrets of the heart. But God, who cannot be deceived, sees
        the insincerity of their hearts, and loathes their most splendid and
        costly services, as so many presumptuous attempts to bribe the great
        Judge into a connivance at their wickedness!
        <p align="justify">
          No man would chose to put himself to a great deal of trouble to no
          purpose. But hypocrites not only lose the benefit of their services —
          but provoke God's indignation by them! The wicked and their sacrifices
          are detestable to him! He counts them a trouble, and will not long
          bear with them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How miserable are unrenewed sinners! Their righteousnesses are
          abominable and provoking iniquities to God. What need have they to
          disclaim their own goodness, and seek to win Christ and be found in
          him, clothed with his righteousness, and purified by his Spirit!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But let not God's true people be afraid of this text, although they
          are often obliged to confess that they are carnal, and sold under sin.
          They walk in the light, and have fellowship with God; and the blood of
          Jesus Christ, the Son of God, cleanses them from all sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Their prayers are unworthy of divine acceptance — but through the
          Beloved, they are well pleasing to him. While the costly services of
          the wicked are detested by him — he delights in the smallest services
          of the upright. This was a truth to be believed, while the Old
          Testament ordinances were yet in force — how much more are we
          encouraged to believe this truth, who have clear revelations of that
          great High Priest who is passed into the heavens, and appears in the
          presence of God, making intercession for us, and recommending our weak
          and imperfect services to his Father!

        <p align="justify">
          Prayer is God's delight, and should it not be ours also — who stand in
          so much need of the benefit of it? When God requires from us the
          severest instances of self-denial, it is our duty and interest to
          please God rather than ourselves. But when he delights in prayer, and
          takes pleasure to have his richest favors asked by needy creatures —
          shall we not come often to his throne of grace? He who commands us to
          pray, and delights in the voice of prayer, and has appointed his Son
          to be or advocate — will not turn a deaf ear to the petitions of his
          redeemed suppliants.

        The hypocrites will say, "Why do we offer sacrifices — and God does not
        notice them? Why do we perform the most splendid services, and meet with
        contempt, instead of thanks? What does the Lord mean by requiring duties
        — and yet refusing to accept of them when they are performed?"
        <p align="justify">
          The fault is in the sinner himself — for his heart is polluted with
          iniquity, and therefore he cannot reasonably expect acceptance to his
          most costly religious sacrifices.
          <i>The whole course of the wicked man's life is detested by God</i>,
          who is of purer eyes than to behold sin, or to look upon iniquity. The
          sinner's <i>principles </i>are corrupt; his <i> thoughts </i>are evil
          continually; his <i>words </i>are all vain, or vile, or hypocritical;
          his <i>holy things </i>are deeply stained with his pollutions — and he
          is abhorred by God, when he thinks he is praying. Not one of his
          innumerable iniquities are forgiven, for he is without Christ, and has
          no saving interest in the blood of atonement. If the very
          <i>heavens </i>are not clean in God's sight — then how abominable and
          filthy is the man that drinks iniquity like water! And how detestable
          is the course of his life — to him whose glorious holiness makes the
          angels to cover their faces!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yet, as detestable as sinners are to God, their situation is not
          hopeless, unless they make it so by stubbornness in sin and unbelief.
          Though God hates all sin, even in his own people — yet rich is his
          grace, and so prevalent is the intercession of Christ, that he loves
          his people even in this world where their righteousness is imperfect,
          and their course of life stained with many sins. At the best, they are
          but <i>followers </i> of righteousness. Paul himself could not say
          that he had attained, or was already perfect. Their hungering and
          thirstings after righteousness, are sure evidences of the love of God
          to them, and presages of that perfection which they shall attain in
          due time. Like as a father pities his son, and takes pleasure to see
          his feeble efforts to please and serve him — so the Lord delights in
          every breathing of sincere desire, and every sincere aim to obey his
          will which he sees in his people. Their righteousness towards men, and
          faithful discharge of the duty of their stations, is accepted in his
          sight — as well as their praises addressed to himself.

        <p align="justify">
          On the other side, a healthy body is of great advantage to the

          the countenance. It makes the eyes brisk and sparkling, and gives a
          pleasant grace to the face to every beholder. If one could paint his
          face as well as Jezebel, he could not make his face so lovely as it is
          rendered by the cheerfulness of the heart. Everything that tends to
          promote a well-regulated joy in the mind is valuable, for it serves
          both soul and body at once. Meekness and contentment with our lot,
          peace and love, afford a continual feast to the mind, and make us
          agreeable to others. These virtues are not to be acquired in their

          Christians should remember, that to rejoice is their <i> duty</i>,
          their <i>privilege</i>, and an <i>ornament </i>to their profession.
          The world has been too much tempted by Christians themselves, to think
          that there is little pleasure in religion. Why should we not
          constantly verify that saying of the wise preacher, "A man's wisdom

          The <i>effect of sorrow </i>is often dangerous, and sometimes

          utterly destroy reason, and sink a man into despair.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are indeed sorrows required by religion — but these have no
          danger in them, for they are mingled and attended with the sweetest
          pleasures. It is sin and not religion, which makes sorrow needful —
          and religion forbids sorrow, even for sin, to be carried to a
          dangerous height, lest Satan should thereby gain an advantage. For we
          are not ignorant of his devices, and know that some of his most
          dreadful temptations are founded on that constitution of body or mind
          that disposes men to the entertainment of melancholy thoughts. The
          kingdom of God is not a kingdom of darkness — but of righteousness,
          and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.

        >Here on earth, the most intelligent men know but in part. They are the
        wisest men, who are most sensible of the imperfection of their wisdom.
        The wisest of Christians compares his present attainments to those of a
        child. Desires for wisdom, revealed in the ardent pursuit of it — are
        the best evidences we can give of our wisdom.
        <p align="justify">
          There are many that use the ordinary means of knowledge — and yet have
          no true wisdom — but their fault lies more in the heart than in the
          head. They are formal and careless in their endeavors to obtain
          knowledge, because they have not a cordial love to the truth. They
          <i>read </i>and <i>hear</i> — but they do not <i>meditate </i>and
          <i>pray</i>. If knowledge would drop into their minds as the dew upon
          the earth, they would be very glad of it — but they will not incline
          their ear unto wisdom, nor apply their heart to understanding.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The truly wise have a higher esteem of knowledge than of gold and
          rubies, and their hearts are deeply engaged in the search of it. They
          use the means of knowledge — but will not be satisfied with the use of
          them without obtaining the end, and therefore they depend upon Christ
          as the great teacher, and earnestly plead for the illuminations of his
          Spirit, to brighten their understandings with discoveries of the
          truth, and to furnish them with that practical wisdom, without which
          they cannot be happy. Such seekers of wisdom shall not be
          disappointed. They shall know God to their joy in this world, and in
          Heaven they shall know even as they are known.

        pours out foolishness, and they cannot do better, because they neither
        have, nor desire to have, anything better within their hearts. Out of

        spreads over the mind, and what unceasing sorrows it produces — when it
        is not soothed by the consolations of friendship, or alleviated by the
        vigor of the mind. The patientest of men tells us that his thoughts,
        disquieted by pain, and embittered by the unkindness of his friends —
        turned night into day. In distress, the night cannot put an end to the
        fatigue of the day by the refreshments of sleep — and the pleasant light
        of morning can convey no cheering influence to the anxious mind.
        <p align="justify">
          But a good and cheerful heart is a continual feast. The pleasures of a
          peaceful conscience and a healthful soul, are sweeter than those which
          sensualists enjoy when they are reveling in all the pleasures that
          riches can give. The longest feast that we read of, lasted only six
          months — but it was impossible that the nobles of Ahasuerus could be
          merry all that time. Feasting continued too long, becomes an
          insupportable burden — but the feast of a soul that enjoys
          well-grounded mirth never ends, and needs not suffer interruption.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The mirth of fools, Solomon tells us, is like the crackling of thorns
          under a pot, and therefore it cannot be the mirth that is meant by him
          in this place. The <i>joy of the Lord </i>is the strength and life of
          the heart. When affliction makes a man to abhor dainty foods, the joys
          of God's salvation feed the soul as with marrow and with fatness. Paul
          was exposed to constant sufferings, and could safely protest that he
          died daily — yet every day he enjoyed those pleasures that were better
          than wine. The days of affliction could not suspend his happiness, for
          he was exceeding joyful in all his tribulations, and gloried in his
          infirmities, and sang praises in dungeons, and gave thanks to God, who
          always made him to triumph in Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This continual feast, which does not lose its relish in the days of
          evil, was not peculiar to apostles. The first believers in Christ were
          so lively in the exercise of faith and hope, that the days of
          affliction were in general good and happy days to them.

          It is God who gives both food and gladness — and without gladness,
          what good can our food do to us? And this gladness is ordinarily given
          to him who is godly in his sight — but to the sinner he gives travail;
          to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who is godly.

          If a Christian has but little, it is pleasant to him; because he
          considers it as the gift of his heavenly Father, and tastes in it the
          love of his Savior, through whose grace everything is pure and
          sanctified to him. The wicked have their food from the providence of
          God which rules over all — but the righteous have their bread by
          covenant and promise. If they have little in possession, they know
          that they shall have everything necessary and good for them, from the
          possessor of Heaven and earth. And when they are pinched with straits,
          it is not for lack of goodwill in their heavenly Father — but because
          his goodness to them is directed by his infallible wisdom. If they
          have scarcely any food at all, they have <i>promises </i>on which they
          can feed; with a pleasure never tasted by the men of the world when
          their grain and wine do most abound .

          Trouble is the inseparable companion of great treasures, when they are

          are like water to a man in a dropsy, which does not quench — but only
          inflames his thirst. Anxiety and care, an ill conscience, and the
          uncertainty of present things — embitter the portion of the men of the
          world. Nothing can be really pleasant, which lacks the blessing of
          God. The little that a righteous man has, is better than the riches,
          not of one — but of many wicked. The love that religion promotes,
          tends greatly to sweeten their outward enjoyments.

          him a blessing to his neighbors. He who appeases strife, does us as
          much service, as he who quenches the fire that is burning down a
          house. We must learn of Christ, who was meek and lowly of heart. So
          shall we find rest for ourselves, and pacify contentions, and enjoy a
          double blessing from the great Author of blessings. "Blessed are the
          meek, blessed are the peace-makers."

          It is their food and drink to sin, and they roll iniquity under their
          tongue as if it were a sweet morsel. They do not hate those sins that

          directed to keep your statutes!" And instead of being satisfied with
          such a degree of holiness as may amount to the lowest evidence of true

        <p align="justify">
          Solomon often speaks of the destruction of the proud, and the

          pride, and love of humility — but the natural tendencies of virtue and
          vice serve Providence in this, as in other cases. The <i>proud </i>man
          takes the course that leads to disgrace and ruin, while he trusts so
          much to his own wisdom, that he consults with neither God nor man. The
          <i>humble </i>man acknowledges God in all his ways, and employs the
          wisdom of other men with his own, and his way is prosperous, because
          it is wise.

          word!" </b
        >It is not a good objection against endeavoring to do good by our words
        — that we are often unsuccessful in our endeavors to serve our
        fellow-creatures in this way. For although, by the perverseness of men,
        our kindness may be rendered unprofitable to them — yet a man has joy by
        the apt answer of his mouth. It will be a pleasure to us to reflect,
        that we have discharged our duty, and used our tongues for the ends for
        which they were made. It can give us no true satisfaction, that we have
        gained the applause or good-will of men by <i>sinful silence</i>, or by
        flattering men's humours and prejudices. But if we have lost the favor
        of men by <i>faithfulness </i>to their best interests, the testimony of
        an approving conscience will abundantly counterbalance our damage.
        <p align="justify">
          The joy that arises to a man from the apt answer of his tongue, will
          not be confined to this world — but at the day of judgment, those who
          have been converted by our words from the error of their ways, and
          edified in righteousness, will be a crown of rejoicing to us. Christ
          himself will take a gracious notice of every word that has been spoken
          in his cause.

          from death, or save a soul — for death and life are in the power of
          the tongue.

        perverters of Christianity have taught, with the assistance of the
        ancient heathen. There is but one way of life, and Christ tells us that
        <i>HE </i>is that way, and no man comes unto the Father but by him.
        Those only are in the way of life, who receive him by faith, and walk in
        him by a holy and heavenly life, to which true faith in Christ always
        leads him who possesses it.

          This way is <i>upward</i>, and they are great deceivers of themselves,

          blessedness. The Son of God came from Heaven to earth to purchase our
          salvation, and he has gone back to Heaven to plead for it, and the
          hearts of all who have the living hope of Heaven, will follow him
          thither.

          possible that we can flee with too much speed from everlasting
          burnings, when our flight is directed, not, like that of the

          earth, because we forsake the fountain of living waters. If our
          affections are set on things above — then when Christ our life shall
          appear, he will receive us into the celestial mansions, that where he
          is, we may be also. David and Paul explain this character of the wise
          man, from their own example, compared with that of worldly men.

        and families of the proud, as well as their persons. Proud men value
        themselves upon their magnificent palaces, their great riches, and their
        prosperous families, and provoke the Lord to destroy those things which
        are turned by them into idols, and used as the pillars of that
        <i>creature confidence </i>which He abhors.
        <i> <p align="justify">Nebuchadnezzar</p></i>prided himself in the

        of the world, and great Babylon, which he had built for the honor of his

          Let us never be proud and vain of anything — unless we wish to have it
          destroyed! God abhors pride even in those whom he dearly loves — and
          shows his resentment of it by sending humbling providences.

        <i> <p align="justify">David</p></i>was proud of the vast numbers of his

        ambassadors, would be carried with his posterity to their own land.

        <p align="justify">
          Proud men often attempt to aggrandize their houses, by removing the
          landmark of the widow and fatherless — but the Lord keeps the widow's
          boundaries intact. Let dying husbands leave their fatherless children
          and widows in the hand of God — and let widows trust in him. If they
          are desolate and weak, and liable to oppression, that should not be a
          discouragement — but a strong motive to them to commit themselves unto
          the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.

        <p align="justify">
          There is often more <i>meant</i>, than <i>expressed </i> in the words

          desolate circumstances, and exposed to injuries of any kind. Their
          distressed situations make them proper objects of compassion, and
          infinite compassion are with God. He has erected a throne of mercy,
          and the Redeemer sits upon it, and is exalted, that he may have mercy
          upon the poor and destitute. From the acts of terror and of grace here
          represented to us, we may take occasion to join in the song of the
          mother of our Lord: "He has scattered those who are proud in their

        another, and are too ready to imagine that they shall never be called to
        an account of what passes in their minds. But we must remember that the
        difference between God and man is infinite. Man looks only on the
        outward appearance, and his rewards and punishments can reach no farther
        than his knowledge of the facts that deserve them. But it is the
        prerogative of the Omniscient God to search the hearts and to try the
        thoughts of men, and to render unto them according to their ways.
        <p align="justify">
          The thoughts of the wicked are full of selfishness, impiety, pride,
          and impurity, and must be infinitely offensive unto the pure eyes of
          Jehovah. And whenever wicked men are, by the convincing operation of
          the Spirit, made to discern the secrets of their own hearts — they
          become loathsome to themselves. Wicked men must forsake their
          thoughts, as well as their outward practices of wickedness; for what
          is the profit of making clean the outside of the cup — while the inner
          part is full of impurity?

        <p align="justify">
          God requires us to give him our hearts for his residence. A heart

          If the <i>thoughts </i>of the wicked are abominable to God, their

          evil, speak good things? If the words should be good when the thoughts
          are vile, they are like potsherds covered over with silver dross. God
          desires truth in the inward parts, and abhors those who flatter him
          with their tongues, or seek the applause of men by making their
          tongues the instruments of hypocrisy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the <i>thoughts </i>of the pure are well pleasing to the Lord, and
          their <i>words </i>are pleasant in his ears. God is of pure eyes, and
          delights in those who are made pure by the blood of his Son. Their
          heads are cleansed from iniquity, and produce those
          <i>holy thoughts and words </i>which are acceptable in the sight of
          the Lord their God and Redeemer. Their prayers and praises are a sweet
          fragrances in his nostrils. Their confessions are music to his ears.
          Their common discourse, when it is seasoned with salt, and ministers
          grace to the hearers — is heard by him with delight.

          It is a solemn consideration, that God hears everything that we say,

          wicked say, and his judgment of them is that they speak wickedly. When
          those who fear him speak one to another, he hearkens and hears, and a
          book of remembrance is written before him for those who fear the Lord,
          and think upon his name. What have we to do on earth — but to labor
          that in our <i>thoughts</i>, and <i>words</i>, and <i>ways</i> — we

        >The plans of the wicked shall cast him down, for he is cast into a net
        by his own feet, and he walks upon a snare. Instead of gaining what he
        expects by his iniquity — he exposes himself to those miseries which he
        most dreads. That which he thought would be a shield to defend him,
        proves a killing sword.
        <p align="justify">
          The covetous man is an instance of this truth. His heart is set upon
          gain, and he expects that it will render his life comfortable and
          happy. But he finds, by bitter <i>experience</i>, the truth of what he
          would not believe from the mouth of Christ — that a man's life does
          not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He who is greedy for gain shall not live — so the wise man insinuates
          in the last part of the verse. He either shortens his days by his
          anxieties about the world, and those sinful methods which he takes to
          obtain the things on which he has placed his heart — or he embitters
          his life by his distracting cares. He designs to secure his family
          against poverty and contempt, and to raise it to eminence and honor —
          but his covetousness brings evil and shame to his house, while he sins
          against his own soul. He kindles a fire in his dwelling, which shall
          consume the tabernacles of bribery.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            If men could obtain what they seek by sin — it would be a pitiful
            compensation for eternal misery in Hell!
          </p></i
        >"For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses
        his own soul?"
        <p align="justify">
          But the same Almighty God who punishes the wicked in Hell, reigns by
          his providence upon earth! His face is ever against the wicked, and if
          they prosper and flourish for a while, like the grass — it is that
          they shall be destroyed forever; and they are the wretched instruments
          of harm, not only to themselves — but to those whom they most love,
          and whom they mean to serve by their sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Money is a good thing when it is possessed by the wise — but the love
          of money is the root of every evil, and therefore covetousness is not
          to be named among the saints. If we love ourselves and our children,
          if we wish for quietness and peace on earth, if we cannot think
          without horror of dwelling in everlasting fire — we must take heed and
          beware of covetousness!
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">"But he who hates bribes will live"</p></b> — and
        his house shall stand. It is not enough for us to refrain from dishonest
        gains — but we must shake our hands from holding of bribes. This is the
        difference between the disposition of good and wicked men, with relation
        to sin. Wicked men may for many reasons abstain from the outward
        commission of it — but godly men hate sin, and everything that leads to
        it. He who hates bribes is not a loser by his justice, unless a little
        money be more valuable than life, and the blessing of God to sweeten it.
        His family are great gainers, for the just men walks in his integrity,
        and his children are blessed after him. Jeremiah gives us several
        striking illustrations of this proverb.

        <b
          >"The heart of the righteous weighs its answers, but the mouth of the
          wicked gushes evil." </b
        >The righteous man has a good treasure in his heart, out of which he
        brings good things — but he does not depend upon this good treasure, so
        as to speak anything upon a subject that occurs most readily and easily
        to him. He wishes to speak nothing that may do hurt to others, or lead
        them into mistakes — but on every occasion, and especially in affairs of
        importance, to say what is <i>best </i>and most <i>seasonable</i>. He
        therefore <i> considers </i>what is fit to be answered to any man with
        whom he converses, and his words as well as his affairs are ordered with
        discretion.
        <p align="justify">
          Without thought, the righteous would speak like fools, as David did
          when he was provoked by the churlish words of Nabal, and in his fury,
          vowed to destroy the house of Nabal, and cut of the innocent with the
          guilty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In matters of great consequence that require delicate management, it
          is needful, in answering men, to lift up our soul to God in secret
          prayer for the direction of our tongues. Nehemiah prayed to the Lord
          in the presence of the king of Persia, before he answered his
          question; and it is remarkable with what wise eloquence he was taught
          by God to address the king, in such a manner as to obtain great favor
          for himself and for Israel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But a wicked man has little sense of the importance of the government
          of the tongue, and lacks <i>the bridle of the fear of God </i> to
          manage this unruly member, and therefore he pours forth evil things.
          But for all his vain and wicked words, he must one day account. "But I
          tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for
          every careless word they have spoken. For by your words you will be
          acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned!"
        </p>
        <b

          >"The Lord is far from the wicked — but he hears the prayer of the
          righteous." </b
        >The Lord is not far from any man, for in him we all live, and move, and
        have our being. But as wicked men are far from God, through the
        alienation of their hearts, and the wickedness of their works — so the
        Lord is far from them, that is, he will have no fellowship with them.
        The righteous cry, and the Lord hears them — but he does not hear the
        cry of the wicked, and beholds them afar off. Wicked men think they may
        safely go on in sin, and if trouble comes upon them, then they will cry
        to the Lord, and all shall be well. Many have been ruined by such
        presumptuous expectations, and sad experience has at last convinced them
        that the Almighty was under no obligation to attend to their voice in
        adversity, when they would not hear his voice in the day of his
        forbearance.

        <p align="justify">
          The prayers of the righteous are graciously heard. God does not always
          give a present answer to them — but they need not wonder at that, for
          he did not give a present answer to his own Son crying to him is the
          days of his flesh. He will hear at the time, and in the manner, which
          is best to himself. Even wise heathens could see that it is proper to
          leave it to the wisdom of God to determine what is best for us. If we
          do not obtain a speedy answer to our mind, we must wait on God, for he
          is a righteous God; blessed are all those who wait for him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Advocate who presents our petitions is always heard, and the
          worthy name in which we pray is ever prevalent with God.

        <p align="justify">
          The blind man whom Christ healed, made a noble use of the truth
          contained in the beginning of this verse. He drew from it an
          irrefutable proof of the divine mission of Christ. But there are too
          many that draw a very bad conclusion from it. If our prayers cannot be
          heard, say they, we may give over praying. The prophet Isaiah draws a
          very apposite instruction from this truth, teaching sinners to leave
          their sins, and not their prayers. "When you make many prayers," says
          God, "I will not hear; your hands are full of blood."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What then must they do? Are they forever excluded from the favor of
          God? No, the Lord is far from the wicked — and yet brings near his
          salvation to them. He shows them a fountain of blood in which they
          must be washed and purged from their sin and filth — and then their
          prayers will come with acceptance before him.

        <b>"The light of the eyes brings joy to the heart." </b>Truly the light
        is sweet, and we ought to give thanks every day to God, who makes the
        sun to shine, and formed that amazing piece of mechanism, the
        <i>eye </i>of man, and contrived it so as to fetch in a thousand
        pleasures, not only from the objects that surround us — but from those
        glorious luminaries that are millions of leagues distant from the place
        of our abode.
        <p align="justify">
          If Bartimeus was enraptured with gratitude to Christ when he restored
          to him his sight — then why should we be less grateful to our Maker,
          who gave us this noble organ of sense, and has constantly preserved
          it, and made it the instrument of so many pleasures and advantages?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is very ungrateful to make our eyes the instrument of rebelling
          against our Maker, which is every day done by the
          <i>adulterer </i> and the <i>covetous</i>. On the contrary, when our
          eyes give joy to our hearts, it is highly roper to improve this
          pleasure into adoration and praise, by magnifying the work of God
          which we behold.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">"And good news gives health to the bones."</p></b

        The <i>ear </i>as well as the <i>eye </i>ministers delight and advantage
        to us. Pleasant views are cheering to the spirit — but glad tidings are
        no less reviving to the heart, and the pleasures received from them is
        marrow to the bones, and health to the whole man.
        <p align="justify">
          No reports have this effect so much as the glad tidings of salvation
          to lost sinners. We must thank God that we receive so many intricate
          discoveries by means of the sense of hearing — but above all, that the
          gospel of his grace has reached our ears. Gratitude teaches us to turn
          away our ears from the instruction that causes to err from the words
          of knowledge, and from all corrupt and uncharitable conversation, and
          to attend with earnestness unto the voice of the Lord, addressing us
          from day to day in His holy Word. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing
          by the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Have any of us lost the sight of our eyes? That is a sore affliction —
          yet let us be thankful if the use of our <i>ears </i>remains to us, by
          which we enjoy the agreeable converse of our friends, and the
          opportunities of serving God, and waiting on him in his sanctuary.

          wise." </b
        >There are great differences among reprovers. Some reproofs are not the
        reproofs of life, and these deserve little regard from us. There are
        people who will rebuke others for doing their duty, and curse them
        because they will not see with their unjust eyes. But in opposition to
        these gainsayers, and perverters of the right ways of the Lord, we must
        hold on our way, and never be ashamed of the testimony of the Lord.
        <p align="justify">
          But life-giving reproofs are <i>valuable</i>. Our Lord teaches us to
          account them <i>pearls</i>, and Solomon in this expression gives them
          an equal commendation, and frequently lays it down as a mark of
          wisdom, to pay a proper regard to just and needful reproofs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But how shall we know whether we have this character of wisdom? It is
          not by saying to that friend who reproves us, that we are obliged to
          him. Good manners will make almost any man to say that. But here is
          the trial of our submission to rebukes — if we have a just sense of
          the value of reproofs, we will count that faithful friend who
          reproves, rather than flatters — a treasure, and frequent his company
          on that account. We will not angrily leave that Christian society with
          which we are connected, because the word of God is faithfully applied
          in it to the correction of vice, and <i>discipline </i>impartially
          administered, although we ourselves should become the objects of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The servant who loves a faithful reprover, and truly regards his own
          soul, will chose to live in a house where God is feared, and family
          religion enforced. And every man possessed of this humble disposition,
          will
          <i
            >chose that company in which he is most likely to be told of his
            faults</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who reprove others, ought to dispense their beneficial
          admonitions with meekness and prudence, that they may not render this
          ordinance of God offensive by their manner of dispensing it, and
          render themselves accountable for the harm done by this means to
          precious souls.

          correction gains understanding." </b
        >We are born like the wild donkey's colt, and need not only
        <i>instruction</i> — but <i>reproof</i>, to make us wise. But some are
        such enemies to themselves, that they will not allow themselves to be
        taught wisdom. He is the greatest enemy to himself, if he spurns at the
        physician for giving him those prescriptions that are absolutely
        necessary for his health, though disagreeable to his vitiated palate.
        Just so, the scorner hates his reprover. He is more brutish than the
        horse or mule, for these animals, although they lack reason, and are
        stubborn at first — will rather be tamed than destroyed.
        <p align="justify">
          But that man is happy who welcomes the word of exhortation and
          reproof, for though he is at present chargeable with many faults and
          follies — yet he is in the way of reformation, and takes the sure
          method of getting understanding. He is meek and teachable, and God
          will bless to his soul that word which he receives with meekness.

        minds — it will dispose us with due reverence to search the scriptures,
        and to acquiesce in the wise instructions which they contain. It will
        powerfully influence as to make a thankful use of Christ, as he is made
        of God wisdom to us, and to follow the conduct of the Holy Spirit.

        kingdom of Heaven. He to whom all judgment is committed, has declared,
        and will make it good, "He who humbles himself shall be exalted."
        <p align="justify">
          The honors of this world are so short-lived, that they are scarcely
          worth the naming. Sometimes the proud push themselves into high
          stations — and yet they cannot attain the summit of their ambitious
          aims, without the permission of that Providence from which promotion
          comes. It is certain that God hates the proud, and will not allow them
          to rise into eminence for their real advantage — but rather to
          signalize his vengeance, by spurning them, in due time, into eternal
          disgrace and misery.

          quite unworthy to be the king's son-in-law, and compared himself to a
          partridge and a flea — but was exalted by God to the throne of his
          kingdom over Israel, and to the greater honor of being a prophet in
          the church, and the sweet singer of Israel!
