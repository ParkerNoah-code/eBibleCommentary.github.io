          Wisdom is an excellent thing, therefore get wisdom. But how shall we
          get wisdom? or in what shall the attainment of it profit us? You have
          an answer to both of these questions in this chapter. How shall we get
          wisdom? The wise man answers,

          turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding,
          and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, and
          if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden
          treasure, then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the
          knowledge of God. For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth come
          knowledge and understanding. He holds victory in store for the
          upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless. He lays up
          sound wisdom for the righteous."

        <p align="justify">
          It is not enough for us to attend the public ordinances of God, and to
          read a chapter or two of the Bible at home every day — but we are
          required to receive the words of wisdom, to keep them in our hearts,
          and apply our souls to them. We are to receive the words of our
          heavenly Father, with reverence and love, with faith and diligent
          attention.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No gift is so precious as that knowledge which God imparts to us in
          the scriptures, and we ought to receive it with eagerness — like that
          keenness which the covetous man shows for gold and silver. And as he
          who receives money is careful to store it where he may find it when he
          has occasion to use it — so in like manner it befits us to store up in
          the midst of our heart, the instructions of wisdom, collecting and
          hiding the precious treasure, until the word of Christ dwells in us
          richly in all wisdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When we give due attention to the word of truth — it will dwell . .
          .<br />
          in our <i>minds</i> — dispelling ignorance and error, and
          communicating that light which is necessary to direct the whole of our
          conduct;<br />
          in our <i>memories</i> — affording a constant supply for spiritual
          meditation, ready for use on every emergency;<br />
          in our <i>wills</i> — to guide their choice and inclination;<br />
          in our <i>affections</i> — to direct their motions, to curb their
          extravagance, and to inflame their ardor towards spiritual objects;<br />
          in our <i>consciences</i> — to preserve alive the impressions of the
          divine law, and to direct them in judging of the spiritual state of
          the soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>senses </i>of the body minister to the soul. The
          <i>ear </i>must be inclined to wisdom, that we may learn it. The
          <i>eye</i>, surveying the wonders of God's hand, furnishes the soul
          with apprehensions of his power and wisdom. But the ear is that
          learning sense by which the richest treasures of spiritual knowledge
          are admitted into to the soul. As the <i>mouth </i>tastes the food of
          the body — so the <i>ear </i>receives and tries those words which
          nourish the soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We attend to our friends or neighbors when they are informing us of
          some new thing. We count it good manners to listen, when nothing is to
          be heard but dullness and insipidity. Shall we not, then, attend to
          Him who made the ear, when he condescends to speak to us, and to
          disclose truths of eternal moment? While our ears are attentive, our
          hearts must be applied to wisdom. Angels, who are so much our
          superiors, apply themselves to the learning of it. They are already
          replenished with the stores of truth — and yet the desire to pry
          deeper into the mystery of wisdom. Great as was the measure which
          Solomon had received — yet he still continued to apply his heart to
          it. Surely, then, the wisest of us ought to apply our whole hearts —
          for what is so needful to us, and so valuable in itself?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But after all our application, we have understandings so dark, that
          the Bible must remain a sealed book unto us — unless our eyes are
          enlightened to discern the wonders of God's word. With our
          instructions, therefore, <i>earnest prayer </i>must be mingled, that
          the Spirit of wisdom and revelation may illuminate our understandings,
          and fit our souls for receiving and retaining the truths of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David was wiser than his teachers — and yet he still lifts up his
          voice for wisdom to the Father of lights, and pleads, with fervent
          importunity, that God would open his eyes, and not conceal his laws
          from him, nor take the word of truth out of his mouth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us, in imitation of such a holy example, earnestly pray that we
          may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God; and
          particularly, that we may be furnished with all that wisdom and
          knowledge that is requisite for directing us in our respective
          stations and circumstances.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon was already a wise man — yet when commanded to chose what he
          would have, he chose a greater measure of wisdom, of that wisdom
          especially which would be most useful for him in governing the kingdom
          of Israel. With this petition, God was well pleased. He gave him not
          only what he requested — but everything most highly valued by men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But while we cry after wisdom, and depend on God to bestow it on us,
          it would be presumptuous to neglect the <i>means </i>of obtaining it.
          We must seek it as silver, and search for it as for hidden treasure.
          We every day see with what anxious diligence men seek for silver. They
          fatigue their bodies, and waste their spirits; they destroy their
          health, and expose their lives; they even wound their consciences, and
          expose themselves to shameful deaths and everlasting misery — that
          they may load themselves with <i>shining clay</i>. Shall the professed
          disciples of the great Teacher set less value upon knowledge, than
          other men set upon silver?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David well knew the value of this knowledge, and esteemed it above
          thousands of gold and silver. Job prefers it to everything that
          dazzles with its luster the eyes of mortals. It is therefore highly
          reasonable, that we diligently and carefully use all those
          <i>means </i> which God has appointed for this end; that we hear
          sermons with earnest attention; that we read and search the word of
          God, and make it the subject of our frequent meditation; that we make
          use of edifying conversation; that we go to the wise, who have the law
          of God in their hearts, so that their mouth speaks wisdom, and their
          tongue talks of judgment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To the use of such means of improvement as these — we must add
          <i>prayer </i>for the divine blessing, to render them effectual to our
          instruction and salvation. Truth is like a mine, more precious than
          that which is the depository of gold and of diamonds. Had any of us
          such a precious treasure as this in our garden, we would not travel
          over the ground for pleasure — but employ ourselves day and night in
          digging, until our houses would be enriched with the precious store.
          Why, then, are we careless about that which will enrich us to
          eternity, and fill all our treasures?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You see the <i>means </i>to be used by us for attaining wisdom. Our
          ears and hearts must be employed in the search. We must lift up our
          voices to the Author of wisdom and seek for it with all the desire of
          our souls and with such earnest endeavors as men use in digging for
          hidden treasures. Through the blessing of God, the search shall be
          successful; for "then shall you understand the fear of the Lord, and
          find the knowledge of God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is plain that those who employ themselves in the diligent pursuit
          of wisdom, have been already blessed with some degree of true
          knowledge — for how could they value so highly that with which they
          were altogether unacquainted? He is already wise, who prefers heavenly
          wisdom to every earthly object; and he shall be wiser still, for to
          Him who has shall be given, and he shall have more abundantly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The fear of the Lord, and the sound knowledge of God, are inseparably
          connected. The fear of God is not a blind and tormenting passion of
          the soul — but a holy and delightful grace, founded in true
          apprehensions of the solemn and lovely glories of the divine nature —
          and disposing him who possesses it, to walk with God. The knowledge of
          God regulates this fear, and preserves it from sinking into terror, or
          degenerating into superstition — but guides it to express its power in
          checking and subduing every corrupt affection, and animating the soul
          to every instance of obedience.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If men are careless about wisdom, and use no diligence in seeking it —
          they make it evident that they are destitute of the knowledge and fear
          of the Lord. They have not, and from them shall be taken even that
          which they seem to have. The efficacy of every means of knowledge is
          from God, for "the Lord gives wisdom; out of his mouth comes knowledge
          and understanding." Every beam of reason in men, is communicated from
          the wisdom of God. The simplest of the mechanical arts cannot be
          acquired unless men are taught of God. How, then, can we expect to
          understand the mystery of the divine will, without spiritual light
          communicated from that God who is the Father of lights, and the author
          of every good and perfect gift! Knowledge and understanding comes out
          of the mouth of God. By his Spirit, he bestows upon us this blessing
          through his word, for it is the inspiration of the Almighty that gives
          understanding to men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Experience, however long; observation, however close; human teaching,
          however skillful — can do nothing to supply us with true knowledge,
          without the influence of that Spirit which rested upon Christ as a
          Spirit of wisdom and understanding, and which is given by him to all
          his followers in their measure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The wisdom that God in his kindness bestows upon men, is sound and
          substantial. There are many kinds of knowledge of little importance.
          The knowledge which some possess, tends only to vex and disquiet them
          — or to inspire them with vanity and self-conceit. How different the
          knowledge that God imparts to the diligent students of wisdom! Far
          from perplexing or elating — it fills their understanding with the
          most pleasant truths, and directs them in the everlasting way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But <i>who </i>are the blessed people that are favored with this
          divinely excellent wisdom? "The Lord lays it up for the righteous."
          God is said to teach sinners in the way; for man's unworthiness does
          not exclude him from divine mercy. Saul the persecutor had the Son of
          God revealed to him by divine grace, and neither his stubborn
          prejudices, nor his cruelty to the church of Christ, could shut out
          the beams of heavenly light. Sinners are invited to Christ as the
          light of the Gentiles, and the salvation of the lost; but here it is
          said, he lays it up for the righteous. Sinners and fools
          <i>may </i>have it — but the righteous <i>shall </i>have it. They are
          already made sensible of their need of it, and desire it more than
          silver and gold. They ask it from God, who gives liberally to all men,
          and upbraids not, and it shall be given them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Lord lays up this wisdom for the righteous. There are infinite
          stores of it in his possession, and they are all treasured up in
          Christ, and out of his fullness shall the righteous receive supplies
          suited to their exigencies. To encourage God's people to expect all
          needful supplies of wisdom from him — let them consider his peculiar
          regard to them, and the constant protection he has engaged to afford
          them.

        There are many adversaries that would destroy them if they could, and
        these are too strong for them. But there none like unto the God of
        Jeshurun — who rides on the heavens in their help, and in his excellence
        in the skies. While therefore they are walking to their eternal home,
        they may sing in the ways of the Lord. Mighty is their protector. In the
        shadow of his wings, they may trust — and to his faithfulness they may
        look as their shield and buckler.

        <p align="justify">
          The most dreadful enemies of those who walk uprightly, are those who
          endeavor to turn aside the way of their paths — but against these
          enemies, God is a mighty defense, for he keeps the paths of wisdom and
          righteousness. He is a fence about their ways, and a wall of fire
          around those who walk in them. T

          he <i>devil </i>casts his fiery darts — but they are safe from the
          arrow that flies by day, and from the noisome pestilence. No weapon
          formed against them shall prosper. They are commanded still to trust
          in the name of the Lord, and their faith is like a shield that will
          quench every fiery dart.

          The <i>world </i>displays its terrors and its charms — to terrify or
          allure them into the paths of sin. Against this, as well as the
          adversary formerly mentioned, they must exercise vigilance. Still,
          however, in the hottest part of the combat they may be of good cheer —
          for the Captain of their salvation has overcome the world, and shall
          make them to share in his victory through their faith.

          Their own <i>remaining corruptions </i>give them many alarms. Nor is
          it astonishing that they feel alarmed when ready to halt by its
          influence, or powerfully solicited to turn aside unto the flowery but
          destructive paths, where poisons grow and serpents haunt. But their
          fears shall not overpower them, for the Spirit wars against the flesh,
          and shall prevail. What says their Almighty guide? "Sin shall not have
          dominion over you."

          Those who walk in the paths of judgment are God's saints. He has
          beautified them with holiness, and he acknowledges them as his own
          property. They are his portion and the lot of his inheritance, his
          treasure and his glory — and he will allow none of them to be lost.
          Every one of them shall be hidden in the day when he makes up his
          jewels!

        <p align="justify">
          Let us ask for these good old ways, and walk in them, and we shall
          find rest and safety for our souls. They are safe paths when God
          guards them, and preserves the way of those who walk in them. No lion,
          no ravenous beast is found there. The wayfaring man, though a fool,
          shall not err therein.

        <p align="justify">
          But it is our duty, while we trust in God to guide and preserve us, to
          make use of our <i>eyes</i>. None of Zion's travelers shall be found
          lacking in the end — but many who thought themselves in the good way,
          shall fail of the end of their hopes, because they entered not in at
          the gate, neither trod the narrow path. He who is born of God keeps
          himself pure — that the wicked one touches him not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We cannot by our utmost care keep ourselves in safety; but a true
          dependence upon God will dispose us to be as sober and vigilant as if
          we had none else to keep us — while we yet trust entirely in God, and
          not in ourselves — knowing that if left to ourselves one hour, we must
          surely perish.

        <p align="justify">
          The lovers of wisdom are furnished with the best wisdom, and led into
          those paths of holiness where safety is to be found. In order to
          persuade us to hearken to the instructions of wisdom, the wise man

        >There is no end of the commendation of the ways of wisdom. The fear and
        knowledge of God is not only the <i>beginning</i> — but the
        <i>perfection </i>of wisdom. But the lovers of wisdom have those
        instructions also which are necessary for guiding them in their behavior
        toward men. They are taught how to walk justly and wisely, and in what
        manner to behave in every affair.

          When a traveler is going to a distant place, it is pleasant to him to
          be informed that his way is safe, and that it may be found without
          difficulty. Now, as the way of holiness is the way of peace, so the
          scriptures give us sufficient directions for every step of it. Are we
          at a loss about our duty in any case? We may then safely infer, either
          that we have forgotten what our directory says — or that we are not
          skillful in applying it.

        <p align="justify">
          Our carelessness in the study of this rule of life may often put us to
          a standstill — therefore we ought to have it daily in our hands, and
          to meditate on it day and night, so shall we find it a counselor in
          all our straits. The Spirit is promised as our guide through this
          world, and he directs us by his word, opening our minds to understand
          it, and directing our conduct in the way that it prescribes.

          Is the saint at a loss with regard to the way of duty in any
          particular instance? Let him pray, as David did in such cases — and
          like this holy man, he shall be led in the way of truth. Solomon has
          instructed us how to obtain wisdom, and in part shown the advantages
          of it. He insists on this last point through the remaining part of
          this chapter, telling us that it will preserve us from the snares of
          wicked men and women, verse 10-19, and lead us in the way that has
          been followed by the saints in every age, who have found it to be the
          way of happiness and joy, verse 20, 21, 22.

        >That we may enjoy the advantages of wisdom, it must enter into our
        heart, which is naturally disposed to enter sin and folly; for man,
        however fond he may be of the reputation of wisdom — is born like the
        wild donkey's colt. Some receive the words of wisdom into their
        <i>ears</i> — but understand not what they hear. Others hear and form
        clear apprehensions of what they hear — so to be able to talk of them,
        like Balaam or Judas, and instruct others. But the children of wisdom
        not only <i>hear </i>and <i>understand</i> — but <i>love </i>the truth.
        The Spirit of God writes it in the inward part; then it comes to them in
        power and in the Holy Spirit — and the testimonies of God are received
        by their hearts with pleasure and joy. Knowledge becomes sweeter than
        honey dropping from the comb, and is esteemed more than necessary food.
        <i> <p align="justify">Paul</p></i>counted everything but loss for the
        excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. When <i>Jeremiah </i>found
        the word of God, he ate it, and it was to him the joy and rejoicing of
        his heart.
        <p align="justify">
          The pleasure that saints take in knowledge, is very different from the
          <i>transient affection </i>experienced in the word by those hearers
          whom our Lord compares to <i>stony ground</i>. These false believers
          were moved and transported by the novelty of the truth, by the
          prospect of deliverance from Hell and possession of Heaven which it
          presented to them — but they had no spiritual apprehensions alone of
          its divine glory, nor any deep-rooted affection to it. They still
          loved the world more than the testimonies of God, and this reigning
          earthliness of spirit, in time choked the beautiful springing of this
          seed in their souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But those into whose hearts wisdom enters, have their
          <i> eyes </i>opened to see its glory — and the
          <i>affections </i>sanctified to relish its genuine sweetness. They
          rejoice in the truths that oppose their most darling corruptions. They
          take pleasure in the way of God's testimonies, as well as in the
          glorious prospects which they present. They heartily esteem
          <i>all </i>God's precepts concerning all things to be right — and
          delight in the law of God after the inward man, because it is pure and
          spiritual. They delight in it, though it forces them to confess that
          they are carnal, and sold under sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This wisdom entering into their souls, furnishes them with
          understanding to see their way, and discretion to manage their affairs
          with prudence and judgment to the end. This understanding and prudence
          is an antidote against the poisonous infection of evil men and strange
          women. It is, first, a means of preserving us from the snares of
          wicked men.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#008000"> <p align="justify">Verse 12-15.</p></font>
          "Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose
          words are perverse, who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways,
          who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,
          whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Such is the portrait drawn by Solomon of those wicked men by whom his
          pupils are in danger of being seduced, unless furnished with wisdom to
          avoid the snare. They speak perverse things; they pay no regard to
          truth — but their tongues speak lies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Among these pests of men, none are such virulent pests of everything
          that is good, as those who once made a profession of religion — but
          have left the way of uprightness to walk in those miserable and gloomy
          paths — which begin in the darkness of the mind, and end in the
          darkness of Hell! The stings of conscience which such people
          experience, instead of reclaiming them, tend only to irritate their
          spirits, and inflame them into fierce enmity against religion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If, instead of being pierced with such stings, their consciences are
          hardened enough for the blackest sin — they are prepared not only to
          do evil — but to work it with both hands greedily. They rejoice in the
          service of Satan, and no greater pleasure do they know than that which
          arises from seeing that his interests flourish, that his kingdom
          prospers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such people are crooked in their ways. The only straight way is the
          way of uprightness — but that sinners leave, and wander into paths
          where they are bewildered and lost. They know not where they go,
          because darkness path blinded their eyes. One sin leads them on to
          another, and that to a third — until at length they run into
          wickednesses of which they could not have thought without horror when
          first they set foot in these deceitful paths. These miscreants are
          froward and stubborn in their ways — and why? <i> Habit </i>has become
          a second nature to them, their hearts are become impenetrably hard,
          and armored against admonition.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yet look back to their early days and you shall find them to have
          evinced tempers and dispositions very different. They would then have
          abhorred gross impieties, and were not without impressions of the
          necessity of virtue and holiness. But the unwearied adversary of
          mankind spread his toils around them, and employed such men as they
          are now become — to efface every good impression, and to lead them on,
          by slow and imperceptible degrees, to those lengths in wickedness at
          which they have now arrived.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Had they been armed with the instructions of wisdom, and employed
          these in their own defense — what different people might they now have
          been!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          While they would mislead us by their persuasions — let us learn
          instruction from their miserable situation, and thankfully improve
          those means which God has afforded, to keep us out of the paths of
          destruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God is our preserver — but he has been pleased to appoint the
          instructions of wisdom as our great defense against these instruments
          of wickedness. The knowledge of the truth, and the cordial love of it
          — will open our eyes to our danger, and possess our hearts with a
          settled aversion to the practices of the ungodly. As our Lord repelled
          every temptation of the devil by the word of God — so when it abides
          in us, it will enable us to meet every temptation of the old serpent,
          and of his instruments, with safety and steadfast resolution.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Grace in the soul is weak of itself — but the seed of God shall remain
          forever. The powers of Hell shall never be able to extinguish it
          utterly — for it receives new supplies from the fountain of grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Wisdom, by its instructions received into the heart, will
          preserve us also from the malignant influence of wicked women.

          seductive words, who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the
          covenant she made before God. For her house leads down to death and
          her paths to the spirits of the dead. None who go to her return or

          It is a great happiness for young people to escape the snares of the
          harlot, in which so many have been entangled and lost. A true love to
          the word of God is eminently fitted to secure such a happiness. There
          is no viler object in nature, than an adulteress.<i>
            Her beauty is but a jewel of gold in a swine's snout!</i
          >
          Though born and baptized in a Christian land — she is to looked upon
          as a heathen woman and a stranger. And as self-made brutes are greater
          monsters than natural brute beasts — so
          <i> baptized heathen are by far the worst of pagans! </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Her words may be sweet and soft to the inexperienced ear of a
          thoughtless youth — but she is only flattering with her lips. Honey
          and milk seem to be under her tongue — but it is the cruel venom of
          dragons! She is <i>monster of ingratitude </i>to that husband who was
          the guide and protector of her youth. All the fervors of her first
          love are forgotten. She returns the most cruel treatment, for all that
          fond affection by which he bound her to him in the most endearing
          obligations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But her profaneness is still more shocking — for she violates that
          sacred bond which was instituted by him whom she presumes to call her
          God — and regards not the marriage oath which she swore by his great
          and solemn name.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Shall a woman unfaithful to the best and kindest of friends — a wretch
          that commits perjury without remorse — prove faithful to any man? When
          she speaks fair — believe her not, for there are seven abominations in
          her heart! Miserable are those who trust to her alluring professions,
          for there is scarcely a hope that they will recover themselves from
          the snare of the devil! Her house is full of the pestilence of sin,
          and will infect everyone who enters with a mortal and almost incurable
          distemper! The mind is darkened, and the conscience deadened — the
          affections, too, are sunk into sensuality! How then can they again
          take hold of the paths of life?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No doubt there is virtue in the blood and Spirit of Christ for the
          remission of the greatest sins, and the purification of the most
          defiled souls. It is even admitted, that whoremongers have been made
          illustrious <i>monuments of the power of divine grace</i> — but let it
          be remembered that these are <i>miracles of grace</i>. Who would cast
          himself into a deep pit, in the hopes of coming out alive, when almost
          all who fell into it were dashed in pieces or buried alive!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Whoever pleases God, shall escape from this devouring pit! Let us
          therefore cleave to God's judgments, and follow their direction, and
          keep at a distance from the place of temptation.

          How worthy of our imitation is the example of <i>Joseph</i>, who was
          tempted day by day — but hearkened not to his mistress to lie with her
          or to be with her, because he would not sin against God. But wisdom
          will not only keep us from the paths of the wicked — it will also lead
          us in the way of good men.

        It is not enough to refrain from wickedness — we in also work
        righteousness. We profess to be the servants of God — and it will be no
        sufficient excuse for a servant that has slept all day, to say that he
        did no mischief.
        <p align="justify">
          There are two ways, in one or other of which all men walk — the narrow
          way that leads unto life, and the broad way that leads to destruction.
          In the former way few walk — but it has been trodden by the feet of
          all who are worthy of our imitation. In it Abraham, and Job, and David
          walked — while those whose memorials are now perished, or whose names
          are remembered only to be execrated, were traveling in the broad way
          that leads to destruction.

        <p align="justify">
          Which of these classes of people do we chose to follow in our course
          of life? If the former, we must take our directions from the wisdom
          taught by Solomon, and the other inspired writers. Those venerable men
          who have obtained a good report, and who through faith and patience
          inherit the promises — were close students of the word of God, so far
          as they enjoyed the benefit of its instructions. And by faith in its
          doctrines and promises, and a constant regard to its precepts — they
          obtained their good report. Happy shall we be if, like them, we esteem
          the word of God more than our necessary food and keep the judgments of
          God still in our view.

        They shall enjoy a long and a prosperous life, as far as it is for their
        real advantage, in that good land which God bestowed on his people — and
        shall, even when they are dead, possess it in the persons of their
        posterity, who are blessed for their sakes. Sinners enjoy not this
        happiness,

        very different thing to the righteous, and to the wicked. To the wicked,
        this world is all the Heaven they ever have. To the righteous, this
        world is a place of preparation or Heaven. Death is a kind messenger
        sent to the righteous by their heavenly Father — calling them to the
        possession of their eternal inheritance! To the wicked, death is a
        messenger of wrath, summoning them to the abodes of misery! Death is the
        beginning of happiness to God's people — but the final conclusion of all
        that the wicked counted their happiness.
        <p align="justify">
          To the righteous, death is a translation to a glorious eternity. To
          the wicked, it is everlasting destruction and woe.

          And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the
          miseries of their latter end, or with Zion's travelers in those
          everlasting joys that shall crown them when they attain the end of
          their faith?
