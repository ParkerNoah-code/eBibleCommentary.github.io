        <p align="justify">
          Man's wisdom in this world is imperfect, and appears much more in
          desires than attainments. But these desires are not feeble and
          ineffectual wishes, like those of Balaam, when he desired to die the
          death of the righteous — and yet had a prevailing love to the wages of
          unrighteousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Genuine desires for wisdom and holiness will dispose a man to separate
          himself from everything that would obstruct the attainment of it, and
          to use every proper means for obtaining it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are not called to give up every connection with the world — but in
          the calling with which we are called, we are directed to abide with
          God. But we must lay aside every unnecessary encumbrance, and avoid
          that load of worldly cares which would press us down to the earth, and
          keep us from traveling in that way of wisdom and life. Worldly cares,
          and the lusts of other things, are the thorns that choke the good seed
          of the Word, and hinder it from bringing forth good fruit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David was called to the government of a kingdom — but he did not allow
          the weighty cares of government to alienate his soul from the Word of
          God; which was still his meditation day and night. How far it is a
          man's duty to separate himself from worldly things to learn wisdom,
          depends upon his particular circumstances; for the same person, in
          different situations, is required to employ a greater or lesser part
          of his time for this purpose. The laborer, who must attend upon his
          own business with diligence in its proper season, should employ
          himself in beholding God's work, when his hand is sealed up by stormy
          weather. The person who desires wisdom will seek it with earnestness,
          although he depends on God for this precious gift — yet he will not
          make the freeness of divine grace a pretense for laziness — but by
          reading and hearing, meditating and conversing, praying, and
          practicing what he knows already — he will follow on to know the Lord,
          and on such means the blessing of God may be expected.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is not one branch of wisdom only that the lover of wisdom will seek
          after. It is his earnest wish and endeavor, that the word of Christ
          may dwell in him richly in all wisdom. He regards both
          <i> knowledge </i>and <i>practice </i>as necessary parts of wisdom —
          that his eye easy be clear, and his whole body full of light. He
          wishes and endeavors to be sound in the faith, and to attain a large
          measure of acquaintance with the law and the gospel. He is careful to
          understand his own way exactly, and to have every one of his steps
          ordered in the Word of God. Every branch of religion is valuable in
          his eyes, and the Spirit shall lead him into all truth. <br />

        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 18:2.</p></font>
          "A fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his
          own opinions."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          The disposition of fools is entirely opposite to that of the lovers of
          wisdom, for they have no pleasure in understanding. Novelty, or
          curiosity, or a desire to make a figure by their knowledge — may
          sometimes induce them to bestow some pains to procure knowledge; but
          their eyes were never opened to discern the divine beauty of truth and
          holiness. They have no spiritual perception, to relish the sweetness
          of that which every Christian declares from experience to be sweeter
          than honey from the comb.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Herod</p></i>heard John gladly, and did many
        things because of him — but his obstinate continuance in the sin of
        incest was an evidence that he had no true delight in wisdom — for that
        would have disposed him to abhor every false way.
        <p align="justify">
          In the 58th chapter of Isaiah, we read of wicked men that delighted to
          know God's way — but we learn from the following part of that
          discourse, that their delight in wisdom was an empty pretense. Their
          delight was not placed on God or his ways — but on those advantages to
          themselves which they fondly hoped to obtain by their religious
          rituals.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The hearers resembled by the stony ground received the Word with joy,
          and for a time seemed to profit by it — but they had no cordial relish
          of the gospel. Their delight was only a transient flash of affection,
          and it soon appeared that they loved their bodies more than their
          souls, and preferred their ease and safety to the gospel of salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The pleasure of a fool, is that his heart delights in airing his own
          opinions. Some of the wicked are decent in their outward conduct, and
          their pleasure lies in the inward indulgence of their corrupt
          disposition — but others of them are not ashamed of their folly, and
          take delight in making it visible to all men by its fruits. They
          reveal their pride and vanity, their sensual and impious dispositions,
          by their tongues and practices — so that you may easily see that they
          are corrupt trees, because they bear nothing but corrupt fruit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This proverb instructs us to distinguish between fools and wise men. A
          wise man seeks all wisdom, because be delights in it after the inward
          man. If we love not wisdom — but take pleasure in the thoughts of
          foolishness or in the outward expressions of folly, we must be ranked
          in that black catalogue of which so many bad things are said in this
          book, for <i>as a man thinks in his heart, so is he. </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Foolish thoughts too often come into the minds of the wise — but we
          must suppress them as soon as they enter, lest by giving them license
          to pollute our hearts, and stain our lives — we should incur the
          reputation of a fool. <br />

        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 18:3.</p></font>
          "When wickedness comes, so does contempt; and with shame comes
          disgrace."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Pride is one ingredient of the wicked man's character, and this
          disposes him to treat those who are better men than himself with
          contempt. When he makes his appearance, you need not wonder if you
          find contempt, and ignominy, and reproach in his company — for he
          wishes to exalt himself upon the ruins of the honor and good name of
          his neighbors. The proud man has sagacity to find materials in great
          abundance to furnish him with those titles of scorn and reproach which
          he heaps on other men. Poverty and calamity, natural infirmities, or
          ungracefulness in behavior, foibles and failings — are all employed by
          him for exposing his neighbors to contempt and laughter. But godly men
          are the chief objects of his spleen, and if he can find nothing else
          to afford him a handle for holding them up to scorn or reproach, he
          can make a dexterous use of their very virtues to serve his pride and
          malice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To expose our innocent neighbors as the objects of contempt or
          ignominy, is a very wicked thing, especially when they are saints who
          are treated in this disrespectful manner. He who mocks the poor,
          reproaches his Maker. He who casts dirt in those faces which shine
          with the beauties of holiness — is an enemy to Christ, and to his
          beauteous image.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What a pity is it, that even the saints themselves should reproach or
          insult one another! And yet it cannot be denied, that
          <i>church disputes </i>have sometimes afforded instances of this
          melancholy fact.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When we meet with contempt and reproach, let us remember that our Lord
          Jesus Christ met with it in a much larger degree for our sake, and has
          left us an example of bearing it with patience. He hid not his face
          from shame and spitting — but gave his back to the smiters, and his
          cheeks to those who plucked off the hair.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But wicked men shall be paid in their own contempt. Michal despised
          David for his piety, and lived all her days under the reproach of
          barrenness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The text may admit of another meaning besides that we have given, that
          dishonor and disgrace follows wickedness at the heels. The wickedness
          and pride of men shall be recompensed with shame and everlasting
          contempt!<br />

          "The words of a man's mouth are deep waters, but the fountain of
          wisdom is a bubbling brook."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          The words of a crafty man may be compared to deep waters — but this is
          not owing so much to his wit as his lack of conscience, for he does
          not scruple to speak in direct contradiction to his real sentiments —
          but God knows, and will reveal and punish his iniquity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The wise man seems here to speak of the words of a man that is
          furnished with a rich treasure of true wisdom. His words are like deep
          waters, not because he delights to express himself in riddles, and to
          conceal his treasures of wisdom from the eyes of others. He uses great
          plainness of speech — but there is more of
          <i>solid sense and useful instruction </i>in his words, than another
          man can apprehend at hearing them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          While men of shallow understandings pour forth a flood of words, in
          which there is scarcely a drop of matter — the truly wise man spares
          his words, but what he says contains much in its narrow compass.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such were the words of Solomon himself, which filled the queen of
          Sheba with amazement, for the sagacity of that wise princess could not
          penetrate the depths of that wisdom which he conveyed in his
          discourses.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How valuable is the conversation of the wise! Their words are like
          oracles which deserve to be remembered, and to be the subject of our
          thoughts. They supply us with refreshment and pleasure, like a flowing
          brook which never runs dry — but is ever ready to afford drink to the
          thirsty traveler.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the Word of God which furnishes the heart of a wise man with all
          those treasures of knowledge which are so justly compared to a spring
          of living waters. And the faithful sayings of God deserve this high
          character above all the words of the wisest men — that they are like
          deep waters. Our ears can receive but a little of them, and therefore
          they ought to be our study day and night. We cannot expect much
          benefit by a cursory view of the Scriptures — but when we search into
          any part of them, with a dependence on the Father of light, we shall
          find not only <i>treasures</i> — but <i>rich mines </i>of what is more
          valuable than the purest gold. <br />

          "It is not good to be partial to the wicked or to deprive the innocent
          of justice."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          It is a very bad thing to justify the wicked, and a worse thing to
          condemn the righteous — but both these iniquities meet in the sin
          condemned in the text. Peter exhorts oppressed Christians to commit
          their souls in well-doing to God as to a faithful Creator. God hates
          partial dealings so much, that he will certainly reprove it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Job's friends condemned that godly man out of zeal for the glory of
          God, for they could not conceive how God could be righteous, unless
          Job were wicked. And yet God did not approve of their conduct — but
          sharply censured them for endeavoring to vindicate his glory at Job's
          expense.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This sin of partiality in judging is no less detestable in
          ecclesiastical, than in civil administrations. When men of riches and
          power are allowed to trample upon the liberties of the poor and lowly,
          and when those who ought not to have a place and a name in the church,
          are permitted to usurp those powers that evidently belong, by Christ's
          appointment, to the body of the faithful — is it not plain that
          church-rulers have become partial in themselves, and judges of evil
          thoughts?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are other instances of partiality in church managements equally
          condemned in this place. When we take it on us to judge other men,
          without any call, against the command of Christ — we too often run
          into this iniquity of partial judgment, by censuring the same faults
          in different people, with different degrees of severity — as our
          affections lead us. <br />

          "A fool's lips bring him strife, and his mouth invites a beating."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon has already represented very clearly the folly and danger of
          contention, and observation abundantly verifies his words — and yet
          there are many people so foolish that nothing will warn them. Their
          lips enter into strife, and their mouth calls for a beating. While
          they pour forth the venom of ill-nature in a torrent of spiteful
          reflections against their neighbors — they do not consider that they
          are calling for a stroke to themselves, by kindling up those passions
          which may provoke their antagonists to return their rage with good
          measure.

        <p align="justify">
          That profane apostate, the emperor Julian, used to banter the
          Christians with that precept of our Lord, "When your adversary smites
          you on the one cheek — turn to him the other also." But Christians
          consult their ease as well as their consciences when they obey this
          precept in the spirit of it. Whereas proud and passionate fools, when
          they give vent to their rancorous spirits, because they cannot bear
          the shadow of an indignity, not only turn the other cheek to their
          adversary — but smite, and urge, and almost force him to strike and
          destroy them. It may be justly said, that, <br />

        <p align="justify">
          For men to be destroyed on account of the transgression of their lips,
          is a grievous though just punishment — but the text represents the
          calamity which they bring upon themselves, in a still stronger light.
          They are not only the <i>causes</i> — but the <i>agents </i> of their
          own destruction! By their lips they are caught in a snare — and by
          their lips they are destroyed.

          It was a severe, though unjust censure, which Eliphaz passed on Job,

          But here Solomon tells us that fools, who have not the command of
          their tongues, are not only condemned — but punished by their own
          mouths. Their own tongues, as David expresses it, shall fall upon
          them; and when men's tongues fall upon themselves — they are crushed
          under the weight. The tongues of other men may pierce into our vitals
          — but the sharpest and most envenomed words of other men can never
          wound a man so incurably as his own.

          It was a more mortifying punishment for Haman to be hanged on a gibbet

          erects a gallows for himself, and twists those cords by which he is
          strangled. But Haman could not know that he was working for his own
          destruction; whereas the lover of strife has fair warning of his
          danger from the Word of God, and therefore must fall unpitied if he
          will not be reformed. <br />

          It is just that a fool's mouth should become the instrument of his own

          Men may in some cases report the faults of others, without exposing
          themselves to the censure of this text. Joseph reported the faults of
          his brethren to his father, that his father's authority might reclaim
          them. Just so, we are authorized by our Lord to complain to the church
          of an offending brother, when he will not allow himself to be gained
          by a private admonition.

          But when men publish bad things of their neighbors through spite or
          levity, or to have the pleasure of hearing themselves talk — then they
          deserve the name of tale-bearers, and incur the reproofs given to such
          pestilent members of society in this book. The <i>tales </i>which this
          kind of men tell, are sometimes entirely false, and at other times
          have some truth in them — although they seldom lack some dash of
          slander, to heighten their relish to those who love to feed on the
          faults and misfortunes of their fellow-creatures.
        </p>

          The words of tale-bearers are as wounds, and these wounds are of a

          the <i>character</i>, and often destroy the usefulness of those who
          have the misfortune to be the mark of these sharp arrows of the
          tongue. Those who give these deadly wounds do not always mean all the
          harm they bring, being instigated, not by downright spite — but by a
          pleasure they have in speaking, while they are destitute of good

          you did it for lack of better employment? Don't you know that a man's
          <i>name </i>is as dear to him as his life, and his
          <i>usefulness </i>perhaps dearer to him than either of them? By wanton

          "One who is slothful in his work, is brother to one who destroys."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Slothfulness in work is commonly a companion of tale-bearing; and both
          of them are more dangerous iniquities than men generally apprehend,
          and need to be seriously and frequently remonstrated against. A man
          with half an eye may see that the <i>squanderer</i> will soon reduce
          himself to feeding on husks. With a little attention, we may know that
          a <i>slothful </i>man is only a younger brother to him, and will come
          to poverty as certainly, though not with so much speed. The man that
          runs will speedily arrive at the end of his journey — but he who
          follows him with a slower pace, will arrive at it in good time.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He who spends his days in debauchery, takes his estate and casts it
          into a devouring gulf! But he who is slothful in his work, suffers a
          <i>moth </i>to devour his substance. Both these sins are breaches of
          the eighth commandment, though in different degrees.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is the like difference between the careless Christian and the
          profane sinner. Sloth in religion is a consumption which preys upon
          the vitals — but open profaneness is a burning fever, which will more
          rapidly destroy the constitution.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us not be slothful, otherwise we are followers, though, at a
          distance, of those who have already plunged themselves into perdition
          by their wickedness! But let us follow those who by faith and patience
          inherit the promises.

          "The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and

        <p align="justify">
          Nations provide fortifications and arms for their defense, even in
          time of peace. If they are so imprudent as to neglect these
          precautions, they are in imminent danger of destruction when an enemy
          makes an attack.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In like manner, when we know that life is exposed to the incursions of
          calamity, and that we are surrounded with
          <i>legions of invisible enemies</i> — it is our wisdom to be provided
          with a sure defense, that we may be safe in the day of battle and war.
          No creature in Heaven or earth can defend us against the assaults of
          misfortune, or the more dangerous attacks of invisible adversaries.
          Nor have we any power or wisdom of our own to afford us security. Our
          safety is only in the name of the Lord, that God with whom is
          everlasting strength and sufficiency, and who reveals himself through
          his blessed Son our Savior, as the refuge of fallen men. In this great
          name, protection is to be found . . .<br />
          from the distresses of the present life, <br />
          from the tyranny of sin, <br />
          from every evil, <br />
          and from every fear,<br />
          from the temptations of the devil, <br />
          from the terrors of death, <br />
          from everlasting wrath!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David in the day or his distress resorted to the caves of Engedi, and
          the mountains of the wild goats — but we find in his history, and in
          many of his psalms, that these were insufficient for his protection,
          and that his confidence was ever placed on God himself as his tower of
          salvation. In him he trusted, and was helped. Therefore his heart
          greatly rejoiced, and with his tongue he praised God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But God was not only David's confidence — he has ever been the
          dwelling-place of the generation of the righteous. They run by faith
          and prayer, into this high tower in the day of their calamity and
          danger — and they are not at a loss when unexpected dangers are ready
          to overwhelm them, for no enemy can be so near to distress them, as
          God is to preserve them. He is ever a present — a very present help in
          the time of trouble.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But are poor sinners excluded from this refuge? Will they be expelled
          from it, if they come to shelter themselves under the protection of
          the merciful God? Never! The righteous runs into it, and none that run
          into it continue unrighteous. But it is accessible to lost sinners
          also, for the name of the Lord is "the Lord, the Lord God merciful and
          gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness, and truth, keeping
          mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity." And sinners are invited into
          this tower of salvation by God himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Eternal safety is enjoyed by all who run into this tower, for it can
          never be undermined, or scaled, or destroyed, by all the devils in
          Hell! No enemy can break into it by force, or find a way by fraud to
          enter. None can so much as climb up to this refuge, to endanger the
          safety of those happy people who have made it their habitation. Nor is
          there any lack of necessities ever felt in it, for he who is the
          defense of his people is their all-sufficient portion, and heavenly
          Father. The place of their defense is the munition of rocks — bread
          shall be given them, and their water shall be sure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Surely if we have any wisdom, we will endeavor diligently to learn the
          way of running into this tower. We cannot learn it better than by
          taking David for our pattern, whom we see, in many of his psalms,
          fleeing unto God for refuge. Let us read these divine compositions,
          and pray for the same spirit of faith which animated that holy man,
          and endeavor to follow the steps of his faith. <br />

          Men charm themselves upon their penetration and quickness of

          their judgment upon a point, before they are well informed of it. But
          this rash manner of judging, especially in matters of consequence, is
          their folly and shame — they reveal their ignorance and pride, when

          Instead of pronouncing peremptorily upon a <i>half hearing </i>of a
          thing, it is often needful to hear it over and over again, and to hear
          different people concerning it — that we may not be drawn into false
          conclusions by the prejudices and partiality of those whom we first
          heard on the subject. This is a necessary instruction to magistrates,
          who may be guilty of crying injustice, by pronouncing a
          <i>hasty sentence </i>in a cause that comes before them.

          Philip king of Macedonia, having given sentence against a widow in a
          cause she had before him, was so sensible of his injustice upon second
          thoughts, that he sentenced himself to pay her damages. But kings are
          seldom so honest as to acknowledge their mistakes, and therefore they
          ought to be very careful that they do not fall into them. The pride of
          sovereigns established that law in Persia, that the royal decrees
          should not be reversed; and other princes, although they do not make
          sigh pretenses to <i> royal infallibility</i>, have nevertheless too
          high a sense of dignity to be easily brought to an acknowledgment of
          errors.

          Ministers of the Word of God are instructed by this rule, not to be
          rash with their mouths to utter anything as the Word of God in the
          pulpit — but to consider well what they are to say in the name of the
          Lord; and to use due deliberation and inquiry before they give their
          judgment in cases of conscience — lest they should make sins and
          duties, that which God never made, by a wrong application of the Word
          of God to particular cases; or distress the minds of God's people, and
          encourage sinners, by giving a rash opinion on the state of their
          souls.

          This rule is to be observed by all men in <i>giving advice</i>, or in

          to judge on them. The Jews condemned our Lord as a Sabbath-breaker,
          because he made a man whole on it — but he tells them that they sinned
          by judging too rashly: "You judge according to outward appearance —
          but judge righteous judgment."

          We ought to be the more cautious in forming and pronouncing opinions,

          It is commonly supposed that ministers do not repent of their

          it is not restricted to that order of men; for the same pride that
          makes one set of men stubborn in their wrong opinions, is to be found
          in other men, although it is not perhaps so much strengthened by
          particular circumstances, nor so visible in their conduct, because
          they do not meet with the same temptations to reveal it.

          alarmed with the dreadful apprehensions of eternal misery — then the
          affrighted eye seems to behold upon the walls the hand-writing that
          amazed the mighty king of Babylon, and unsinewed all his joints. Every

          much under the influence of money, as the poor. Silver and gold may
          dazzle the eyes — but they cannot fill the heart, even while they
          encumber it.

          Yet it is not in every case unlawful for great men to receive gifts,
          nor for men of inferior station to bestow them. Great men may
          cheerfully receive them as expressions of gratitude, for favors of a
          higher kind conferred, or to be conferred on their inferiors. And poor
          men may lawfully give them to procure favors, though not to obtain
          justice in a court of law.

          In private life, it is proper that we should know what a man can say
          for himself and his behavior, before we punish him in his character.
          If we will judge our neighbors, we should certainly act the part of
          impartial judges, and not believe bad things of men, upon the report

          In religious disputes, it is a great injustice to regard the character
          of a sect, or an impartial representation of their doctrines — upon
          one whom partiality has blinded, and rendered unfit, however honest he
          may be, to do them justice. Party-spirit has as much influence as
          gifts, to blind the eyes of the wise, and to pervert the words of the

          It may, however, be a great satisfaction to us, that we may judge, as
          far as we have any occasion to do so, for ourselves, in the most
          important religious contentions, without hearing either of the
          parties. A man may easily know from the Bible, whether Christ is the
          supreme God, without the help of others. The Bereans could readily
          judge whether Paul's doctrine was true or not, by searching the

          the Jewish doctors could say against it.

          Causes between private people are thus to be decided by an impartial

          be decided, that arise between princes, who are too high to have any

        <p align="justify">
          The contentions of princes are very dangerous, because pride will not
          allow either party to yield, and their power enables them to interest
          millions in their cause. How often have <i>oceans of blood </i>been
          spilt, and nations been loaded with the most oppressive taxes, and
          great kingdoms utterly subverted and laid desolate, in the prosecution
          of the the quarrels of their leaders! The <i>disputes of kings</i>,

          the foot.

        <p align="justify">
          Why may not <i>the lot </i>determine their quarrels? They are too

        <p align="justify">
          It is a mercy to men that God has provided a method so safe and easy

          settled their own way, whatever it may cost — than by means of an
          ordinance of God.

        <p align="justify">
          As the whole disposing of the lot is of the Lord, those who agree to

          That law which binds us to love our relations, obliges us, if we have

          Abraham would not live in a state of contention with Lot, because they

          But such is the perverseness of human nature, that contentions between
          brethren are generally more irremediable than any others. When we meet
          with provocation where we thought we had all the reason in the world
          to expect a contrary behavior — we can scarcely find in our hearts to
          bestow forgiveness. Thus it is easier to win a strong city, or to
          break in pieces the barred gates of a castle — than to heal breeches

          contention with them, the authority of God should constrain us to
          mortify that unforgiving disposition which would prevent a cordial
          reconciliation.

          The love of Christ has broken in pieces for us the gates of brass, and

          Jacob used all possible means obtain the good graces of his brother

          This example teaches us what means we should use for healing such

          evil-speakers are cast into a fiery furnace — the fruits of the

          everlasting life. It is not the use of the tongue on some particular
          occasion that will determine a man's happiness or misery — but the
          love of a good or bad tongue. Saints may, through the influence of
          provocation and passion, speak unadvisedly with their lips — and the
          wicked may speak many good words, when their hearts are not right with
          God. But he who loves to speak as befits a saint, shall eat good by
          the fruit of his mouth. And he who that takes pleasure in vain or

          one of which is that it teaches us one of the best lessons — that of
          <i>humility</i>. The poor have a daily experience of their dependent
          condition, which instructs them in the language of submission and
          lowliness; and when the Spirit of God sanctifies this condition of
          life to a man, it leads him to great improvements in that grace on

          rich are alike poor before God, and without his rich bounty they both
          must be eternally wretched. If poor men supplicate the rich for their
          favors, with what words shall we express our baseness and absolute
          dependence, before him who regards not the rich more than the poor!
          But he never gives a rough answer to his suppliants. Let us therefore

          Religion requires us to perform all those kind services to one

          unreasonable offenses to alienate our affections from our friends —
          but cleave to them while we live. We must often gladden their hearts
          by our company, and share in all their joys and sorrows. We must not
          renounce their friendship for their imperfections, nor even for those
          temporary coldnesses which they may reveal in the day of our distress
          — unless their behavior is such as to show that their professions of
          regard were not sincere. Above all, we must show our tender sympathy
          in the time of their calamity, otherwise our alienation will greatly

          resentment of her father — but Jonathan bravely incurred the

          If this is a reason for our friendly behavior to our friends, what
          regard ought we to show to our Lord Jesus Christ, who sticks to us
          infinitely closer than any friend! Having loved his own who were in
          the world — he loved them unto the end. Neither death, nor sin itself,
          can separate us from his love. What shall we render to him for his
          marvelous loving-kindness? Love and obedience — for we are his
          friends, if we do whatever he commands us.
