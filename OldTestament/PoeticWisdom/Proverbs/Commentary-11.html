            >"Whoever loves instruction, loves knowledge; but he who hates
            reproof is brutish." </b
          >Pythagoras took to himself the name of <i>Philosopher</i>, or
          <i>lover of wisdom</i>, rather than the name of <i>wise man</i>, which
          had been assumed by the sages before him — because he thought that the
          greatest men might, with more propriety, be called <i>seekers</i>,
          than <i>finders </i>of wisdom.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          If a man is a lover of knowledge, though much ignorance still remains
          with him, he is in the sure way of finding it. But is there any man so
          foolish, and so like a beast, as not to love knowledge? Solomon tells
          us, that those who love instruction, love knowledge; but those who
          hate reproof are brutish. Let us, therefore, examine ourselves by this
          mark.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The lover of knowledge will take pleasure in the Bible, and in
          sermons, and in conversation with the wise. He will be glad of
          reproofs, which serve to convey the most seasonable and necessary
          instructions, though in a manner so mortifying to human pride, that
          they are not relished but by those who prefer their real good to the
          applause of men. The lover of knowledge will count that man his real
          friend, who honestly tells him his faults, and would would to be a
          member of that family and church which is governed by the rules of
          Christ. For though he values liberty, he does not place it in being
          allowed to do evil when he pleases, without check.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But he who hates instruction, and cannot endure the reproof of love —
          is brutish. He is like the horse or the mule, which bites and kicks at
          the man who performs a painful operation upon it, though absolutely
          necessary for removing a dangerous distemper. Or he is like a dog, or
          sow, which will show as much rage at the man that casts a pearl before
          it, as if he were killing it with a stone. He is surely a brute, and
          not a rational creature, who has swallowed poison, and will rather
          allow it to take its course, than admit the necessary relief of
          medicine, lest he should be obliged to confess his folly, in exposing
          himself to the need of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is an indisposedness among professors of religion, to receive
          Christian reproof. Drunkards and swearers often reveal less
          displeasure against a reprover, than some that consider themselves
          first-rate Christians. The man, therefore, that ventures on the
          friendly office of admonition, must exercise much prudence, and show,
          by his manner of dispensing it, that he is constrained by love, lest
          he irritate instead of reforming. Asa was a godly man — and yet he was
          angry at a prophet of God for reproving him. He certainly ought to
          have made Asaph's confession, "Thus foolish was I, and ignorant — I
          was as a beast before you!"
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></font> "A good
          man obtains favor from the Lord, but the Lord condemns those who
          devise evil." </b
        >We are to show forth the virtues of Him who called us out of darkness
        into his marvelous light, by endeavoring to shine in the exercise of
        such Christian graces, as correspond to those attributes of God that
        shine with resplendent luster in the work of our salvation. The
        exercise, therefore, of charity and goodness, is highly befitting those
        on whose account such miracles of goodness and love have been displayed.
        A godly man forms no devices for serving himself, to the harm of his
        fellow-creatures. Could a window be opened in his breast, you would see
        love ruling in his heart, and disposing him earnestly to wish for the
        spiritual and temporal advantages of his neighbors, and to imitate our
        gracious Savior, who went about doing good; for the Spirit of Christ is
        in him, and the fruit of this Spirit is in all goodness.
        <p align="justify">
          He does not value himself on this account, as if there were any merit
          in paying a debt which he owes to men on God's account. All his hopes
          are founded upon that infinite goodness, which provided salvation for
          self-ruined sinners — yet his goodness is well-pleasing unto the Lord,
          who blesses him with the smiles of his countenance, and will remember
          him concerning all his works, and all his thoughts and designs of
          love, according to the multitude of his mercies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must not do as others do to us, nor be discouraged in the practice
          of goodness, by the unthankful returns which we meet with from
          ungrateful men — but perform our duties to our fellow creatures, from
          a regard to God, and with a view to his acceptance through Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is the praise or gratitude of men worthy to be the subject of a
          thought, when we read that a godly man shall obtain favor from the
          Lord? If our goodness is produced by a regard to men, it is not
          goodness — but selfishness in disguise, and truly its whole reward is
          from men.

            "But the Lord condemns those who devise evil."
          </p></b
        >Such a man may be artful enough to disguise his selfish plans, under
        the mask of religion and benevolence, like the old Pharisees. But the
        eyes of the Judge of the world are like a flame of fire, they pierce
        into the secrets of every soul, and there is no dark design harbored,
        which shall not be completely disclosed in the day of Christ.
        <p align="justify">
          When our Lord was upon earth, he revealed and condemned the corrupt
          hearts of many hypocritical rogues — and at the day of the revelation
          of the righteous judgment of God, no vain pretender to goodness shall
          stand in the congregation of the righteous. Even those who refused to
          minister to the necessities of others, shall be commanded to Hell. How
          shall they escape, whose hearts were pre-occupied with wicked devices,
          to the ruin or damage of those who were made of the same blood with
          themselves!

          shall not be established by wickedness." </b
        >A man sometimes appears to be established, and often hopes to be so by
        wickedness — but it is all a delusion. Had Zimri peace, who founded his
        throne on treason? A man may with more reason hopes to build himself a
        secure house upon pillars of ice, than to establish his fortunes upon an
        accursed ground.

        The leaves of the trees of righteousness may wither, their branches may
        be tossed hither and thither by the tempests of tribulation and
        affliction — but they are rooted in Christ, and kept night and day by
        the Almighty, and therefore their root is safe from the rage of earth
        and Hell.

        >A virtuous woman . . .<br />
        fears the Lord,<br />
        reverences her husband,<br />
        manages her house with prudence and care,<br />
        behaves charitably to the poor, and kindly to all.
        <p align="justify">
          To what should we compare such a woman? Should we compare her to a
          bracelet, or say that she is a necklace of gold to her husband? Such
          comparisons would be quite below her worth. She makes him as happy as
          a king, and procures him such respect and honor, that she deserves to
          be compared to that royal ornament that encircles the head of Majesty.
          She is to her husband, a crown enriched with those lovely virtues,
          which shine with more radiant luster than diamonds! She is health to
          her husband's bones, for the sight of her amiable behavior, and the
          pleasure of her society, inspires him with that habitual cheerfulness
          which does good like a medicine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the woman who lacks virtue disgraces her husband, and is as
          rottenness in his bones.<br />
          Her peevish temper or passionate behavior,<br />
          her extravagant expenses or her sordid avarice,<br />
          the levity of her speech or the scandal of her vices — <br />
          make him the object of pity or scorn when he is abroad, and fill him
          with anguish at home. She is not a help — but a torment to him. A man
          may get out of a fever in a few weeks — but the misery of this living
          disease is, that unless the almighty grace of God works an uncommon
          cure, it will prey upon a man's bones and spirits, until the death of
          one of the married parties brings relief.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let such, then, as have wives to chose, consider that the man should
          be the glory of Christ, as the woman of the man; that a good wife is
          from the Lord — and that it is therefore their interest to live to the
          praise of Christ, to resolve to marry only in the Lord, and to seek
          this precious gift from Him, by humble prayer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let wives consider seriously, whether they wish for happiness and
          honor to their husbands — or disgrace and misery; and whether it be
          better for themselves to prove helpers to the joy, and crowns to the
          head of their husbands — or living plagues to them, and fires to
          consume their vitals!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let husbands give honor to their wives, and encourage them in virtue,
          by their kindness and approbation. What tender love does Christ show
          to those whom he is pleased to betroth to himself in loving-kindness!
          So ought husbands to love their wives.

        As far as we are warranted or concerned to judge of the character of our
        <i> neighbors</i>, we must draw our opinion of them from their words and
        behavior. But we are to form our judgment of <i>ourselves</i>, chiefly
        by our thoughts, which are the immediate product of our hearts — for as
        a man thinks in his heart, so is he.
        <b> <p align="justify">"The thoughts of the righteous are just."</p></b>
        Evil and foolish thoughts often rise up in their minds — but they hate

        <p align="justify">
          Their love to <i>God </i>produces many delightful meditations

        <p align="justify">
          Their love to <i>men </i>excludes ungrounded suspicion and evil

          them to consider not only how they may serve their own interests — but
          how they may contribute to the happiness of their neighbors. Should
          any plan be suggested to them that appears greatly conducive to their
          own advantage, it will be rejected with abhorrence, unless it consists
          with the happiness of those whom they are constrained, by the command
          of God and the love of Christ, to love as themselves.

        he forms in his mind are crooked and artful. He must if possible, be
        gratified in his pursuits, though others should be rendered unhappy. And
        because the people at whose expense he means to serve himself, will
        naturally stand in his way — he contrives to cover his real designs with

        communication between the heart and the tongue; when men's hearts are
        evil, it may therefore be expected that their words will lie in wait for
        blood. There are passions in the hearts of wicked men, that are murder
        in the sight of God, and have a natural tendency to harm and kill — but
        through the good providence of the universal Ruler — they are checked by
        the <i>terrors of conscience</i>, or the <i>fear of punishment </i>from

          Heathen themselves were sensible of the mercy due to the animal
          creation. The Athenians excluded a man from a place in their
          government, if he killed a bird that fled to him for shelter. They
          justly reasoned that a man who could exercise cruelty to brutes, could
          not be safely trusted with the life or comfort of his fellow-men.

          That God, whose goodness the righteous imitate, is good to all. In

          be all drowned in Noah's flood, all he considered them in sparing
          Nineveh. There are many laws in the books of Moses guarding us against
          wanton oppression; and these laws, inconsiderable as they may appear

        Wicked men are so for from exercising their compassion to brutes — that

          When people give to the poor, and join their gifts with insult and
          abuse — this is <i>cruel mercy</i>. When Pilate ordered Christ to be
          scourged, with a design to procure his release — was this mercy? and
          not rather injustice and oppression. Such was the mercy of the Jewish
          council to the apostles, and of the Philippian magistrates to Paul.

          Ahab's mercy to Benhadad was cruelty in another sense. He was cruel to

        <b>"He who works his land will be satisfied with bread." </b>The
        business of the farmer is so honorable, that it is here used by Solomon
        to signify every useful profession. Kings themselves are served by the
        field, and the only two universal monarchs practiced farming.
        <p align="justify">
          The Spirit of God here teaches us, that we ought to have a useful
          profession, and to follow it with diligence, minding our own business,
          and not meddling with affairs in which we have no concern.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That we shall be satisfied with bread, is the encouragement held out
          to pursue such a course as this. Some people think that they cannot
          have enough, unless they have more than the necessities and decent
          comforts of life; but we are here instructed that bread should satisfy
          our desires, unless God is pleased to bestow more upon us. Having food
          and clothing, let us be content. There are few who lack these — and
          yet few are content. There are others who think that they will not be
          able to live by their business, without over-reaching their neighbors,
          by means of those underhand practices which <i>custom </i>has
          interwoven with many professions. But says the wise man, "He who works
          his land shall have enough;" and Paul tells us, that he may have
          something more to give to him who is needy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To be satisfied with bread, is a happy temper of mind, and is commonly
          the portion of the man of industry, which not only procures bread —
          but gives it a relish unknown to men that are above labor. A dinner of
          green herbs is commonly a sweeter meal to the laborer, and followed by
          more refreshing sleep — than all the luxuries of high life to a man of
          fortune.

        exposes himself as a prey to disgrace, and his soul to the temptations
        of the devil. He wastes his precious time, and lays himself open to all
        the miseries of a self-procured poverty. In short, all the creatures in

        Multitudes walk under the influence of delusion and error, who, instead

        yet exclaim against such as would give them, from scripture, the
        clearest proofs of the danger of the mistakes under which they labor,
        and the insufficiency of the evidences which they think they can,
        produce, of their being in the right way. We are not, however, to
        hearken to counsel without examination, because other men are liable to
        error as well as ourselves. Absalom was ruined by giving ear to
        treacherous counsel; and Rehoboam lost the greater part of his kingdom,
        by preferring the counsel of fools to that of wise men. In our spiritual

        wisdom, to whose word we are carefully to attend, and on whose Spirit
        and grace we must exercise a daily and humble dependence. It is our

        does not cover his wrath, that it may have time to work, and draw the
        powers of reason into its service, that it may break forth with more

          God has given us the endowments of our minds, as talents with which we

        The wise man does not say that the righteous is more excellent than the
        wicked — but gives the unrighteous man the best designation of which
        truth will admit, for after all possible allowances are made on the side
        of the unrighteous, the superior excellency of the righteous man is
        still unquestionable.
        <p align="justify">
          The righteous man is possessed with the faith of Christ, and this
          faith works by love to God and man. He is not selfish in his
          disposition — but makes it his settled principle of conduct, to
          glorify God and to do good to man. He is under the government of
          inward principles, that render him steady in his good purposes, and
          dispose him, not only to seek for glory, honor, and immortality — but
          to perform conscientiously the duties of his station, and of every
          relation in which Providence shall be pleased to place him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His neighbor may exceed him in many of those possessions and
          qualifications which are valued in the world — but the righteous man

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His neighbor may be able to perform more splendid acts of generosity —
          but he lacks that charity without which it profits a man nothing to

          world — but that is foolishness with God, and can bear no comparison
          with that wisdom which is unto salvation. He may be very rich — but he
          has no interest in the unsearchable riches of Christ. He may be a
          duke, or a prince — but he is not a child of God, nor an heir of
          Heaven. He may be clothed with purple, and fare sumptuously every day

          feed on the hidden manna. He may live in a magnificent palace — but he
          has no title to the house not made with hands, and to the mansions
          which Christ has gone to prepare for his followers. He may be admired
          by men — but the righteous man is an eternal excellency in the eyes of
          God, and the Lord Almighty is to him a crown of glory, and a diadem of
          beauty.
