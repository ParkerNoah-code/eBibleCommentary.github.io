            "These are more proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, King
            of Judah, copied out."
          </b>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          A book written by Solomon, and published by the order of Hezekiah,
          would deserve very high regard. But the proverbs of Solomon need no
          human recommendation. Their intrinsic worth, and their divine
          original, place them far above the compositions of the greatest
          philosophers and kings who were not favored with divine inspiration.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those servants of Hezekiah who copied out the following part of
          Solomon's proverbs, and joined them to the rest, are here mentioned to
          their honor. They were the <i>publishers</i>, and not the composers of
          the following chapters — but they performed a piece of service to the
          church for which their names shall live.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Just so, if we cannot do so much for God and his people as some others
          have done, let us do what we can, and we shall never lose our reward.
          The contributors of goat's hair to the tabernacle are mentioned to
          their honor, as well as those who gave silver, and gold, and precious
          stones. For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according
          to what a man has, and not according to what he has not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many of the following precepts respect the duties of kings. Hezekiah
          walked in the good ways of David and Solomon, and he desired
          instruction in his duty as a king. Every one of us ought to study the
          duties that belong to our respective stations, that we may be
          thoroughly furnished for every good work.

          is the glory of kings."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          How arrogant are those men who must know the reasons of all God's
          works. Or, if that exceeds their capacity, to call them into question,
          or find fault with them — as if they knew better what God ought to do
          than God Himself! There are unsearchable mysteries in the excellencies
          and ways of God. His way is in the sea, and His path in the mighty
          waters, and His footsteps are not known — and it is His glory that
          they are not known. He would not be God — if we could understand Him
          to perfection. Nor would His sovereignty absolute — if He were obliged
          to do nothing but what His creatures would approve.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The lowest of the creatures of God have qualities that we cannot fully
          understand; how strange then is it, that we will not allow His
          providence to transcend our comprehension, or that a doubt should be
          entertained about the mysteries of His grace — because they are
          incomprehensible to our feeble understandings? It was a good saying of
          a pious divine, "Lord, preserve us from a comprehensible God!" It is
          our duty to venerate and wonder — and not to pry with curious eyes
          into the secrets of God. The history of the fall is an everlasting
          warning to the sons of Adam to prefer the <i>tree of life </i>to the
          <i>tree of knowledge</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the kings of this earth are infinitely inferior to the God of
          Heaven, and their honors are of a humbler kind. It is their honor to
          search out a matter. When God is said to search the hearts of men, he
          is spoken of in the language of men, for he beholds all things past,
          present, and to come, by one glance of his infinite mind. But kings,
          who need a great deal of knowledge and wisdom, must obtain it, like
          other men — by labor and diligence. It is their honor to be diligent
          in searching out everything that princes ought to know.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They must employ much care, and make use of the wisdom of other men to
          inform themselves about all the interests of their kingdoms, and their
          various connections with foreign states. They must endeavor to
          acquaint themselves with the dispositions of their subjects, with the
          best means of suppressing vice, and encouraging goodness, and making
          their people happy, and the proper methods of preserving peace, or of
          defending their crowns and kingdoms from foreign enemies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When kings act the part of judges in their own people, as they did in
          ancient times, their sphere of labor is greatly increased. For every
          cause they must search out. They must neither refuse to judge in it
          because it is difficult, nor must they pass sentence without good
          ground, to save their own labor. But they must search things to the
          bottom, and judge wisely and righteously, as Solomon did in the case
          of the two harlots. On these accounts kings cannot conceal their
          important affairs within their own minds. They must have assistants to
          bear the burden of government, and make use of the counsels and
          abilities of other men, to whom they must communicate their secrets.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the glory of God to need no counselor. It is the honor of kings
          to choose right counselors and to follow their beneficial advises. Yet
          it is not to be expected that their subjects in general should be
          their privy counselors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 25:3.</p></font
          >"As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of
          kings are unsearchable."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          No man can measure the height of the heavens, or the depth of the
          earth — and as little can the hearts of kings be searched out. But is
          every king a Solomon, with a heart as comprehensive as the sand on the
          sea shore? Every king needs a very enlarged heart. The
          <i>throne </i>is not a bed of repose — but the seat of care and labor.
          What knowledge and prudence is requisite to understand the intricate
          science of government, and to manage the complicated affairs of
          kingdoms? And as kings are not born wiser than other men, they
          certainly ought to improve the many advantages they have, for
          acquiring that knowledge which is suited to their station, and to pray
          earnestly for wisdom to him by whom kings reign, and whose servants
          they ought to be.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Without a large measure of wisdom they are fit only to be the tools of
          their own ministers, who are often lovers of themselves, and of their
          own families — more than of their king and country.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the heart of kings is often unsearchable another sense. Their
          designs cannot be known by their subjects, or by foreign princes —
          because they industriously conceal them from the knowledge of all but
          their privy counselors; and this is often necessary, because a
          discovery of their counsels would obstruct the execution of them.
          Besides, the affairs of government are so various and complicated,
          they have so many designs to carry on, so many harms to obviate, so
          many opposite tempers of men to consider, and so many unknown
          difficulties to encounter — that people in a lower station cannot
          possibly understand the reasons of a great part of their conduct, or
          the ends which they have in view. It is therefore presumptuous in
          subjects to pry too narrowly into their behavior, or to be rash with
          their censures on the public management. Those who take a liberty to
          despise authorities, and speak evil of dignities, should be sure that
          they do not speak evil of those things which they do not understand.
          If the heart of kings, who are infinitely inferior to God's, is so
          unsearchable — then how foolish is it to think that we can search out
          God unto perfection!

        <p align="justify">
          The interests of prince and people are so evidently the same. A bad
          king is so evidently his own enemy, that it may well be wondered at
          that so many kings have proved <i>tyrants</i>, and exposed themselves
          to the danger and infamy which are the inseparable attendants of
          oppression and injustice in men of high place. To account for this
          fact, we must consider that kings cannot govern their people without
          the assistance of ministers and counselors, and these servants of
          government have private interests of their own, different from those
          of the prince and people, which they too often prosecute with a
          selfish and wicked spirit. To serve their own covetous and ambitious
          views, they too often corrupt the mind of their prince with the
          <i>sweet poison of flattery</i>, and lead him, by their
          misrepresentations, into false notions of the state of things in his
          kingdom, and of the character and behavior of many of his subjects,
          and draw him on to compliance with their own interested or malicious
          views, to the harm of his kingdom, and the ruin of many of his
          faithful subjects.

        <p align="justify">
          If we read the histories of nations with attention, we shall find that
          unjust wars, oppressive taxes, iniquitous laws, unjust executions,
          seditious and civil commotions, the overturning of thrones, and the
          confusions of kingdoms — have originated in the wicked counsels of bad
          ministers. The histories of Rehoboam, and Joash, and Ahasuerus, are
          scriptural instances of this truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wicked men are often compared in Scripture to <i>dross</i>; and as the
          dross must be separated from the silver before a beautiful vase can be
          framed, so the wicked must be removed from before the throne, that it
          may be established in righteousness. Kings need our prayers, that they
          may be furnished with wisdom to choose their counselors and ministers
          from their best deserving subjects, and to turn all flatterers and
          self-seekers out of public employment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If Rehoboam had possessed so much wisdom, the kingdom might have
          remained entire in his hand — but Solomon his father could not infuse
          this wisdom into his mind by all his instructions, and God left him to
          his folly, that his solemn purpose of dividing his people, and
          diminishing the kingdom of the house of David, might be fulfilled.

          seen with your eyes."</b
        >
        <i> <p align="justify">Impudence</p></i>is a very disagreeable vice to
        any man, and it is especially odious to kings, who are jealous of their
        honor and dignity, and cannot bear those who would intrude into their
        presence, or push themselves into places of trust or power under them.
        <p align="justify">
          It is selfish ambition that prompts people to seek high station and
          royal favor — but ambition often disappoints its own designs, by an
          eager pursuit of them, and by those methods which it uses to
          accomplish them — and where it expected honor, it meets with shame and
          disgrace.

          How mortifying must it be to a man who places his chief happiness in
          the smiles of a king, and those honors which are derived from earthly
          majesty — to find himself disgraced in the eyes, and by the order of
          that prince whom his eyes have beheld, and of whose favor he supposed
          himself secure!

          Kings, if they are wise, will look with a suspicious eye on those who

          Our Lord spoke a parable like this proverb of Solomon, and gives a
          wider extent to the instruction contained in it (the Pharisee and the
          Tax-collector). It is our duty to entertain such a low opinion of
          ourselves, as willingly to take a place even below our inferiors, as
          far as the duties and decencies of our station will permit. None are
          so likely to meet with disgrace, as those who are too fond of honor,
          like the Pharisees, whom our Lord severely censures for loving the
          best seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts. None have
          so much honor from God or man, as the meek and humble, whose temper it
          is, in honor to prefer their neighbors, and to serve them in love, and
          condescend to men of low degree.

          should act with reason, and not incur lasting misery, to gratify a fit

          If men considered the <i>consequences </i>of every important action
          before they entered upon it, it would cut off ninety-nine out of a
          hundred of the law-suits with which the world is pestered. If it is
          the desire of saving or gaining money that pushes men to go forth to
          strive with their neighbors at the bar, they should consider that
          going to law is little better than fishing with a golden hook. A few
          fish may possibly be caught — but something may be lost of more value
          than many fish.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If men are instigated by their <i>pride </i>to go to law, (and pride
          is the real cause of many more pleas than covetousness,) they should
          well consider whether they are most likely to gain or lose the cause;
          or, if they gain it, whether the gain will compensate the loss of
          time, and money, and temper, which are inseparable from law-suits.

          That sense of <i>honor </i>which leads so many into contention, would
          keep them out of it, if it were under the regulation of prudence. That
          pride which plunges men into the gulf of the law, must end in the most
          galling remorse, when the cause is lost, and shame, instead of honor,
          is gained by it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Contention of every kind ought to be avoided by us. Before we venture
          to gratify our rage by strife and debate, it is necessary for our
          peace and comfort, to consider with coolness, whether we have
          <i> reason </i>on our side. Self-love will tell us that he have met
          with wrong, although no real injury was done, or intended to us. We
          cannot expect that the other party, or the judge, (if the matter is
          referred to a judge,) should have the same bias in our favor, as
          ourselves.

          If we are forced into debate, the more <i>privately </i> it is managed

          course is to reason the matter with the offender in the spirit of
          meekness, to convince him of the wrong he has done to us; and to show
          him a forgiving spirit, which will be the most effectual means of
          bringing him to repentance, and to put an end to the difference — if
          possible, without exposing ourselves or our neighbors to the censure
          of the world, which will conclude that there are faults on both sides.

          If we cannot bring our neighbor to a sense of his fault by this
          method, our great teacher allows and prescribes other methods of

          sure that we have met with an offence which will justify our conduct.

          In other cases, we must keep the matter to ourselves, as the wise man
          here directs us. When we make complaints of the injustice done us in
          another manner than our Lord directs us, we will not be believed, and
          ought not to be believed, until the other party has given in his
          defense. For he is an unjust judge who passes sentence until both
          parties are heard. Those who are ever complaining of the injustice of
          others, may or may not be believed, to the harm of those concerning
          whom they may complain — but strong suspicions will most certainly be
          entertained to their own harm, and by their own tongues they bring an
          indelible reproach upon themselves, as men of a quarrelsome and
          unforgiving temper.

          It is not uncommon for people, when they are at variance with those
          who had once been their friends, to take every opportunity, and to use
          every means, however unfair, to <i>blacken their characters</i>. If
          they have been entrusted by them, in the days of intimacy, with any
          secret, they will divulge it, to gratify their present irascibility.
          This is base conduct, and must fix an everlasting stain on those who
          make use of such abominable methods to support their own credit and
          interests.

          A man who has the least degree of generosity in his nature, would
          rather suffer blame, or lose a cause, than defend himself by such
          dirty and dishonorable means. But when a man is reduced to such
          pitiful shifts, it is a strong presumption that cause is not good. On
          the whole, if we would preserve ourselves from lasting disgrace, we
          must either leave off contention before it starts — or, if that cannot
          be done, manage it with the weapons proper for a man and a Christian.

          of murder before he killed the priests of the Lord, by telling the
          enraged tyrant that David had received bread and a sword from
          Ahimelech. Jonathan was a man of a very opposite spirit, and revealed
          it by the seasonable mention he made to his father of David's exploit
          in slaying Goliath. By putting Saul in mind this noble action, he
          disarmed for a time his angry resentments.

          No words have greater need to be fitly spoken, than words of reproof.
          Few are capable of <i>reproving </i>wisely, and fewer still are able
          to <i>receive </i>a reproof in a right manner. Wisdom is necessary in
          a reprover, to direct him about the <i>time </i>and <i>manner </i>of
          giving the reproof.

          Elihu showed great wisdom and great faithfulness, in performing this
          difficult office; and when Job had been irritated by the unjust
          reproofs of his other three friends, he was silent under the smart
          reproofs of Elihu. For he charged nothing upon Job — but what had some
          truth in it, and revealed his friendship for Job, and his good opinion
          of him, with regard to the general course of his behavior, at the time
          that he rebuked him with great severity, for the unjustifiable
          expressions which came from when his mind was fretted with the weight
          of his troubles, and the injurious reflections of the former speakers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          An <i>obedient ear </i>to reproof, is a very rare thing. It is
          observed by an eminent divine of the last age, that the professors of
          religion are generally more stubborn against reproof than fornicators,
          or common swearers, and that they are ready to fly at the faces of men
          who reprove them, for those very faults which they daily confess to
          God!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If there was more of the <i>meekness of wisdom </i> revealed in giving
          reproof, it is probable that greater meekness and submission might be
          showed in receiving it. Yet a due sense of the evil of our faults, and
          of the necessity of amendment, would make us to value just rebukes
          even from the mouth of an enemy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a false sense of honor that makes us to fret at reproof — but if
          we had the same sense of honor with the wise man, we would not judge
          ourselves on a supposition that we are unblamable and irreprovable —
          but reckon it our honor to
          <i
            >receive reproof with gratitude, and improve it for the correction
            of our vices.

          Gold earrings were worn in ancient days by people of distinction — but
          nothing adorns the ear so much, in the judgment of the inspired
          philosopher, as the <i>obedient hearing of wise reproof</i>. It would
          be a great honor to us to need no reproof — but this is not to be
          expected in our degenerate race. We ought, therefore, if we have
          forfeited our credit by falling into sin, to recover it by welcoming
          needful rebukes — and if others have been overtaken in a fault, to
          hold them in the same esteem as formerly, when they have given proper
          evidence of their repentance, by submitting to reproof. By their sin,
          they have showed themselves to be men of like frailty with ourselves —
          by their obedient hearing of reproof, they have revealed a degree of
          meekness too rarely to be met with among Christians.

          Equally refreshing to the soul, is the faithful execution of an

          of all servants that they be found faithful, and it is required in a
          special manner of messengers who are employed in distant and important
          commissions. Fidelity is the more praiseworthy in them, because they

          Such a messenger was Eliezer to Abraham and Isaac, for he valued the

          master, and his son Isaac.

          If we are employed in any business for another person, we should make

          satisfaction to our employer, and receive his thanks, if he is not
          wholly destitute of the feelings of gratitude.

        <p align="justify">
          If we are obliged to perform any affairs of consequence by the hands

          fidelity with our affairs. For he who is faithful in one thing, is
          likely to be faithful in another thing also, though of much greater
          consequence. Ministers of the gospel are messengers of Christ, for the
          benefit of the churches. If they are faithful, they are accepted of
          Christ and useful to men.

          Covetousness is so much detested in the world, that the people who are

          liberal; and therefore, if they have ever been able to master their
          disposition so far as to perform one generous action in the course of
          their life, they will boast of it as long as they live, and think
          themselves ill-used if they are not honored by other men with the
          character of being generous people. But it is moreover very usual for
          them, to talk of charities which they <i>never </i>bestowed, and thus
          they add vice to vice. Their arrogance and deceit, added to their
          stinginess, makes them doubly detestable. They are like clouds carried
          about with the wind, which seem to be full of rain — when there is not
          a drop for the refreshment of the weary earth. Those who boast and are

          likewise like clouds without water. When you ask any favor from them,
          they give you great reason, by their frankness and professions, to
          believe that they will serve you — but when they are called on for
          performance, some unlucky accident has come in their way, and they can
          do nothing for you at present. They will only give you new promises,

          The apostles Peter and Jude speak of a set of men that may be compared

          of rebellion against him, by making a god of our bellies. Nothing
          earthly must be allowed to engross our affections, so as to sensualize
          our souls, and alienate our minds from spiritual objects. The time of

          We must not indulge ourselves <i>without restraint </i>in any of the

          another, are to the heart. But as we must eat only so much honey as is
          sufficient for us, so we must use a prudent caution in our
          familiarities with our most affectionate friends. Although their
          houses are a home to us — yet we must not be frequenting them at every
          hour, nor continue in them until our company becomes wearisome. It is
          highly proper for us to visit our friends, and preserve by that means
          our mutual friendship, and enjoy the sweets of it — but it is very
          improper to weary a friend by too frequent visits, which may have the
          unhappy effect of dissolving the closest intimacy, by creating disgust
          where love in former times took place.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our friends have their business to mind, and their time is valuable to
          them. Friendship is bought too dear, by him who ceases to be master of
          his own time, and is called off the most necessary employment to
          receive a visitant.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Besides, we ought to consider the circumstances of our friends, and

          they may be unable or unwilling to bear.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The freedom of friendship does not consist in a liberty to weary one

          How different are the pleasures of earthly friendships, from those

          This proverb is sufficient to strike an alarm into all evil speakers
          who spread scandal against their neighbors, merely because they have
          nothing else to do, or because they have some little quarrel with
          them. Consider, you who deal in such evil conversation, whether you
          could think of treating the objects of your defamatory discourse as
          <i>Jael </i> did Sisera, or as <i>Joab </i>treated Abner. Would you
          shrink with horror at the thought of beating out your neighbor's
          brains with a hammer, or of piercing him with a sword, or a sharp
          arrow? Why then do you indulge yourselves in a piece of the like
          barbarity, destroying, as far as you can, that <i>reputation </i>which
          is dear to men as their life, and wounding all their best interests by
          mangling their character?

          The supposed insincerity of Job's friends produced great bitterness of
          spirit in that venerable sufferer, and added greatly to that load of
          distress which lay upon his body and spirit; and he compares them to
          the brooks of Tema, which abounded with snow in the winter — but had
          no water in them for the thirsty traveler in the sultry heat of
          summer.

          Let us be faithful in our friendships, as well as in the duties of
          every other relation. Insincerity and inconstancy in friendship, is
          immoral and impious. As the before mentioned sufferer observes, "To
          him who is afflicted, pity should be showed by his friend." In the
          times of our distress, we have reason to expect sympathy from our
          friends — but we must not be too optimistic in our hopes; they may
          prove <i>unable </i>to help us, or <i>unfaithful</i>, or some
          temporary alienation may estrange them from us. Or God for our
          chastisement or trial, may bereave us of the comforts of their
          friendship, or trouble may fret our spirits, and make us to think that
          they are become cold to us, when they show us all that friendship
          which ought to be expected from frail creatures like ourselves.

          When we lament the treachery or insincerity of our friends, we should
          remember that David, and Christ himself, felt all the bitterness of
          this calamity. One of our Lord's disciples betrayed him, and his most
          affectionate, and highly favored friends forsook him. In many cases of
          this kind we have greater reason to complain of ourselves, than of our
          false friends. For had we chosen our friends more wisely, and fixed
          our regard to then upon the ground of <i>piety</i> — we would not have
          found so much reason to complain of violated professions.

          He who takes away a garment in cold weather, leaves the person whom he

          It is to be confessed that sorrows of a slight kind may be diverted

          with grief, it is <i>exasperated </i>and not revived by unseasonable
          and ill-directed endeavors to dispel the sorrow which feeds upon it.
          Mirth and gaiety, and the sprightly airs of vocal and instrumental
          music, deaden the spirit, as vinegar does nitre, and are just as
          ineffectual to restore gladness, as the taking away of clothes in cold

          But we who are Christians have not so learned Christ. Enmity against
          God is infinitely worse than enmity against us — and yet God spares
          his enemies, and does them good, giving them sunshine and rain and
          fruitful seasons. We ourselves were once alienated from God, and
          enemies in our mind by wicked works. If we had been recompensed
          according to our works, we would now have been in the lake of fire and
          brimstone! But God who is rich in mercy, sent his Son to accomplish
          our redemption from ruin. By Christ, we who were guilty of horrid
          enmity against God, have received his sin-atoning sacrifice. We are
          reconciled to God, and blessed with every spiritual blessing in
          Christ. Shall we now think that God lays an unreasonable command upon
          us, when he requires us to be charitable and kind to our enemies, and

          injuries, and to bury them in silence — but
          <i>a sullen disdain of injuries </i>is no Christian grace. Our duty is
          to wish real happiness to our enemies in this world and the next, and
          to show the truth of our love in praying for them, and in doing them

          It was so habitual to Bishop Cranmer to show kindness to those who had

          It is said to be a custom to this day among the Arabians, to cure some

          those <i>coals of love </i>that Solomon here directs us to heap upon
          the heads of our enemies. As the hard metals are softened and melted
          by the fire — so the hard and stubborn spirit is softened and melted
          by the solid expressions of charity and meekness. He is a wild beast
          of the most untameable kind, who feels no shame for his own conduct,
          nor any warm emotions of gratitude to him whom he has offended — when
          he sees him returning good for evil.

          No enmity is stronger than the enmity of man's heart to God — and God
          makes use of his own kindness to subdue it! We are to be followers of
          God as dear children, and try the like experiment upon our own
          enemies, as far as the infinite difference of people and circumstances
          will admit the resemblance. If our enemies are warmed into friends,
          have we not gained a nobler victory, by gaining our brother, than if

          thrown away upon them? Let them be what they will — our gifts are not
          thrown away. If they persist to return evil for good, the Lord shall
          graciously reward you. The Lord loves mercy and goodness, and there
          are no instances of it that he loves better, and rewards more
          bountifully, than those by which we most resemble himself, and cross
          our selfish and haughty spirits.

          It is a great encouragement to tale-bearers, to observe that their

          a cheerful countenance, and listens to their tales, and makes them
          welcome to his table — they naturally conclude that the person to whom
          they speak has as bad a heart as themselves, and they will not fail to
          bring him new stories of the like kind, as soon as they have got an
          opportunity to <i> learn </i>or to <i>fabricate </i>them.

          tempted to take revenge by speaking evil of him in his absence, for
          nothing is commonly more irritating, or sticks more deeply in the

          administration, instead of being public blessing, is a general curse.
          Those who should be the fathers and guardians of the poor, are worse

          God, by giving encouragement to wickedness, and suppressing goodness,
          and perverting an ordinance of God into an engine for serving the

          >"It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to seek
          one's own honor."</b

        <p align="justify">
          Men may eat <i>some </i>honey, so likewise men are warranted to pay
          due regard to their own honor. If there is anything worthy of praise,
          Paul recommends it to us to think on it; and our Lord enjoins us to
          make our light to shine before men, that they may glorify our Father
          who is in Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But it is a loathsome thing to the stomach to eat too much honey — and
          it is a loathsome thing for a man to be anxious about his honor, and
          to fish for praise, as too many do, who use a variety of methods to
          obtain the applause of men; sometimes putting on all the external
          appearances of humility with that view, and saying things of
          themselves which would inspire them with fury if they were said by
          another person, or believed by that very person to whom they are
          spoken.

          We must value our own reputation because it enables us to be useful to
          men, and to glorify God. But when we indulge an unbridled desire after
          honor from men — we forget our chief end, we disqualify ourselves for
          the most important duties, and we expose ourselves to the worst
          temptations. If our fortune were equal to that of Caesar, our
          <i> ambition </i>might draw us to equal in crimes of that cut-throat
          of mankind.

        <p align="justify">
          The humble are sensible that they deserve shame rather than honor, and
          would be content that all their honor were taken from them, that it
          might be ascribed unto God to whom it truly belongs.

        <p align="justify">
          The vain and proud would rob God Almighty of his crown — that they
          might set it upon their own heads. But God will not allow them to
          escape without a punishment suited to their crime.

          >"He who has no rule over his own spirit — is like a city that is
          broken down, and without walls."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          It is necessary for our happiness and peace, that we should have the
          government of our own spirits. He who possesses not himself, possesses
          nothing — although he should possess all other things. As a city that
          is broken down, and without walls, is exposed to the invasion of every
          enemy — so the man who has not a mastery over his own desires and
          affections, is a ready prey to every devil. His imagination is
          tainted, his corrupt desires are inflamed, and his active powers
          hurried into the most criminal excesses by every slight temptation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A city in flames, or a ship seized by a drunken and mutinous crew, are
          not so terrible spectacles — as a soul where the judgment and reason
          are laid desolate by intemperate passions and appetites. What harms
          have been wrought, and what oceans of blood have been poured out by
          the passion of anger alone, when it was unrestrained by the principle
          of conscience?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When Simeon and Levi heard the dying blessings of their father upon
          the rest of his sons, and the severe censures that he passed upon
          themselves — what remorse must have torn their hearts at the thought
          of that fatal day when in their cruel fury they slew so many men, and
          destroyed the city of Shechem.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us hold in with a strong and steady hand our disorderly passions,
          otherwise they will make us <i>wild beasts</i>, of a more furious kind
          than wolves and leopards; because our rational powers will be forced
          into their service, and tend to no other purpose — but to make us more
          evil and destructive enemies of mankind. No leopards or lions ever
          destroyed men or beasts in such multitudes, as those tyrants have
          done, who were slaves to their own love of glory and vindictive
          spirits.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a happy thing when the body is subject to the mind, and the mind
          deeply penetrated with a habitual sense of the authority of God. That
          we may be placed in this delightful state, we must give up ourselves
          to the Lord, and pray for the accomplishment of these promises, "I
          will put my Spirit within you, and I will cause you to walk in my
          statutes." "The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
          lie down with the kid."
