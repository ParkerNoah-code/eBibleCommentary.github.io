          This chapter contains a variety of useful precepts enforced by the
          strongest motives. First, To remember and keep in our hearts the
          things written in this book, verse 1, 2.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#008000"> <p align="justify">Verse 1.</p></font> "My
          son, do not forget my law — but let your heart keep my
          commandments."</b
        >
        This inspired teacher is to be reverenced as a spiritual father. His
        word is to be regarded as a law publish by Solomon — but binding on us
        by the authority of God. We must never forget this law — but make it
        familiar to our memories, that we may have a guide ready to direct us in
        every situation in which we may be placed; and when we treasure it up in
        our memory, we are to keep it in our heart. Richly does it deserve to
        form the object of our constant love, and the subject of our meditation
        all the day. Our obedience to it must proceed from the heart.
        <p align="justify">
          What is the difference between godly men, and false pretenders to
          religion? To the latter, the religion which they have is a burden — to
          the former religion is a pleasure. To the one the law is a
          disagreeable restraint — to the other God's commandments are not
          grievous, for they rejoice in the way of his testimonies, more than in
          all riches. Self interest dictates to us the propriety of keeping
          God's commandments:
        </p>
        <font color="#008000"
          ><b> <p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></b></font
        >
        <b
          >"For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to
          you."</b
        >
        A long and happy life is the desire of all men, and riches and good
        physicians appear to them the most likely means of obtaining it. But
        religion is better than all the gold and physicians in the world, for it
        has the promise of this life, as well as of that to come. Solomon knew
        well that godly men sometimes die young, while the wicked live, become
        old, yes, mighty in power; but still he asserts and often repeats the
        promise of long life which belongs to godliness. Surely, then it is not
        without meaning and truth.
        <p align="justify">
          The godly shall enjoy life as far as it is really a blessing in their
          particular circumstances — the meaning carried beyond this, would
          convert the blessing into a threatening. Peace is enjoyed by the
          godly, even that of God which passes all understanding, and it keeps
          their hearts and minds through Jesus Christ. Outward prosperity is
          enjoyed by them, as far as it is consistent with their spiritual
          interests. Tribulations and enemies they may meet with — but they live
          in peace. Though slaughtered by the hand of violence, or the sword of
          war, they die in peace. And when they die, they enter into everlasting
          peace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The second precept in this chapter, is one requiring us to live in the
          exercise of mercy and truth:
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#008000"> <p align="justify">Verse 3.</p></font>"Let not
          mercy and truth forsake you. Bind them about your neck, write them
          upon the table of your heart."</b
        >
        Mercy and truth are to be exercised by us in every part of our
        fellowship with our fellow-creatures — however defective they may be in
        the practice of these virtues to us. They are to be tied about our necks
        as a precious ornament, to be worn through life, and made visible to all
        men. Our light should shine before men, not for our own praise — but for
        the glory of our heavenly Father. But it is not enough to practice mercy
        and truth, so as to obtain a character for fidelity among men.
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            Our outward acts must proceed from the heart.
          </p></i
        >
        As the law of commandments was written upon tables of stone — so is the
        law of Christ written on the fleshly tables of the Christian's heart, by
        the Spirit of the living God. As workers under the Spirit, we are
        required to write the law of kindness and of truth upon the tables of
        our heart, by maintaining deep impressions of it, by meditating upon the
        peaceful motives that should excite us to that virtue, and by
        endeavoring, through the grace of Christ, to have our hearts habitually
        disposed to all those duties which are the natural fruits of love and
        integrity.
        <b
          ><font color="#008000"> <p align="justify">Verse 4.</p></font> "So
          shall you find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and
          man."</b
        >
        God is well pleased, not only with the reverence and love which his
        people show to himself — but with that generosity and mercy, that
        sincerity and faithfulness, which they evince to their fellow-men.
        <p align="justify">
          Mercy and truth are glorious perfections in the Deity, perfections
          which shall be forever praised as the springs of our felicity. Of
          these, the mercy and truth found in wisdom's disciples, are to be
          regarded as a faint imitation. God is greatly delighted to find in his
          children this his true, though imperfect image. To the merciful, he
          will show himself merciful — and those who deal truly, are his
          delight. He not only smiles upon them with the light of his
          countenance — but gives them favor in the sight of men also.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Kindness and truth are qualities so amiable as to engage the esteem
          even of those who are too selfish to practice them. They attract the
          good-will of men. They procure that good name which is better than
          precious ointment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That <i>understanding </i>which is good in the sight of God and man,
          is another fruit of the constant practice of mercy and truth. A good
          understanding appears already in his behavior — but it is also
          promoted by it; for the practice of what we know, tends greatly to
          render our knowledge more clear, and certain, and extensive.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The next precept is, to depend on God, and not on our own
          understanding.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#008000"> <p align="justify">Verse 5.</p></font>"Trust
          in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not to your own
          understanding." </b
        >To trust in God, is to depend on him for bestowing on us every needful
        blessing, and preserving us from all evil.
        <p align="justify">
          Faith in Christ for eternal life is included in this dependence on
          God, for by him we believe in God. But we are commanded to trust in
          God for everything necessary for us in this life also; for the Lord
          God is a sun and shield, he will give grace and glory, and every good
          thing. O Lord God Almighty, blessed is the man that trusts in you!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This dependence on God is to be exercised with all our hearts, our
          <i>judgments </i>being persuaded that God is the only and the
          all-sufficient object of confidence, and our <i>souls </i>resting with
          full satisfaction in his power and faithfulness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This holy exercise is fully and clearly exemplified to us in many of
          the psalms of David. While we trust in the Lord, our hearts must
          cleave to him, and renounce every sublunary dependence. To divide our
          confidence between God and the creature, is to lean with one hand upon
          a rock, and with the other hand upon a broken reed!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David charges his soul to wait upon God only, for his expectation was
          from him, and from none else. We must not make
          <i>our own understanding </i>a staff to our hearts. Dependence on our
          own wisdom, will lead us from trusting in God, to make lies our
          refuge, and to adopt unhallowed means for the attainment of our
          wishes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When men reject the testimony of God concerning Christ, when they
          depend on their own righteousness and strength instead of Christ, or
          on creatures rather than on God for help in difficulty, or when they
          expect to obtain pleasure or profit by sinful means — it is evident
          that they are departing from God, through an evil heart of unbelief,
          and trusting for the direction of their behavior to their own
          corrupted minds.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Do we trust in God, and not in ourselves? It will then give us much
          pleasure to know that we are directed and encouraged to make known all
          our affairs to God, according to the following words of the wise king:
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#008000"> <p align="justify">Verse 6.</p></font>"In all
          your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths." </b
        >God is well acquainted with all our affairs — and yet he graciously
        requires us to present them to him in prayer, and to ask from him
        direction in the management of them, that we may be guided by his
        providence and Spirit, according to his word. The saints have found much
        relief in their perplexities, by spreading their case before him, and
        petitioning this verse for their help.
        <p align="justify">
          But times of distress are not the only seasons in which we ought to
          apply to him, "Be anxious for nothing, (says Paul,) but in everything,
          by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make known your requests
          unto him." We are every day to pray that our steps may be so ordered,
          as that we may not be led into temptation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Joshua in the midst of his prosperity erred, by neglecting to ask
          counsel at the mouth of the Lord, because he thought the matter so
          clear, as that he might safely trust to his own understanding.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our encouragement to this duty is a promise that our path shall be
          directed. Having showed to God our way, we must wait on God for
          direction — not by a voice from Heaven, or by a new inspiration — but
          by his Spirit enabling us to understand his word, and apply it to
          particular affairs, and by his providence making the way where we
          should walk clear before us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus will our path be so directed, as that we shall be preserved from
          falling into sin, from meeting with temptations that might prove too
          hard for us, and from being subjected to more than needful calamity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What a pleasure is it to have a wise and kind friend to consult with
          in all our affairs! but how much sweeter the pleasure, that we know
          where to find God, that we are invited to go even to his throne of
          grace, and to utter all our words before him! When we interest God in
          our affairs by prayer, we may cast away every care, and walk on
          cheerfully, believing that he will guide every step of our journey.
          For his eyes are not only upon the <i>way </i>of his people — but upon
          <i>every step </i>of it. But when we acknowledge the Lord in all our
          ways, let us be sure to do it with self-diffidence, and with sincere
          resolutions to adhere to that way which will be pleasing to God.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#008000"> <p align="justify">Verse 7.</p></font> "Do not
          be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord, and depart from evil."</b
        >
        Vain man would be wise, although man is born like the wild donkey's
        colt. The world is full of wise men, or of men that would be thought
        wise. But we cannot be truly wise unless we become fools, renouncing all
        dependence on our own wisdom, and depending with humility upon the Lord,
        for those supplies of wisdom that are necessary for enlightening our
        minds and directing our paths.
        <p align="justify">
          When we pretend to ask counsel from God, while we have a secret
          dependence upon ourselves, and a reserved determination to pay no
          regard to his word or providence if it should cross our own desires —
          we play the hypocrite with God, and cover over that self-confidence
          which he abhors, with false professions of faith and resignation to
          the will of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A high opinion of men's own wisdom is so dangerous, that Isaiah
          pronounces a heavy woe upon it. We are not indeed to pull out our own
          eyes, to renounce our own understandings, or to believe
          contradictions. But we ought certainly to keep our rational powers in
          subjection to the word of God, to be sensible of our great liableness
          to err, and of our absolute need of divine direction, especially in
          those matters that concern religion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That we may have our paths made straight, we must also fear the Lord
          and depart from evil. To those who fear the Lord, is addressed a
          promise of divine teaching. The fear of the Lord has a native tendency
          to prevent men from turning out of the way of truth. By the fear of
          the Lord, men depart from evil. It acts as a sentinel to the soul,
          which keeps temptation from entering. God makes use of the grace of
          fear, as well as that of faith, in repelling temptation, and in
          subduing corruption. "I will put my fear," says he, "into their
          hearts, and they shall not depart from me." Abraham displayed his fear
          of God, as well as his unconquerable faith, when nothing could for one
          moment withhold him from obeying the strangest command which mortal
          ever received. "Now I know that you feared God," said the angel,
          "seeing you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The fear of God preserves men from bodily disease, as well as from
          sin.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#008000"> <p align="justify">Verse 8.</p></font>"It
          shall be health to your body, and marrow to your bones." </b
        >The <i>bones </i>are the strength and fence of the body. The fear of
        God is health to the outward, as well as to the inward man.
        <p align="justify">
          Health is an object of desire to all, and the wise man will not only
          use medicines when sick, for the restoration of it — but will
          attentively consider what food and what exercise are the most proper
          for preserving health in the body, and marrow in the bones.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The spiritually wise will remember, that in God's hands is our life,
          and breath, and all our ways — that diseases are his servants, which
          come and go at his pleasure — and that the surest way to health is to
          walk before him unto all pleasing. Does he then enjoy health? He has a
          blessing along with it. Is he the victim of disease? It will be more
          beneficial to him, than is to the wicked his unsanctified health.
          Religion has a natural tendency to impart health and vigor to the
          body, because it preserves a man from those distempers which proceed
          from unsubdued lusts, and diffuses over the mind that calm serenity
          and heartfelt joy, which even upon the body exercise a medicinal
          influence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are next required to be liberal in the service of God.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#008000"> <p align="justify">Verse 9, 10.</p></font
          >"Honor the Lord with your substance, and with the first fruits of all
          your increase. So shall your barns be filled with plenty, and your
          vats will brim over with new wine." </b
        >Earthly substance is necessary for the use of our bodies — but we are
        called to make a nobler use of it than the mere service of the outward
        man. We are to honor the Lord with it, making no use of any part of our
        increase, until we have set apart a reasonable proportion of it for the
        service of God.
        <p align="justify">
          God needs nothing at our hands; but for our own benefit, he will have
          us to render back a part of all he gives to us, for the decent support
          of his worship, and for the maintenance of the poor. Is it any
          hardship to give a part to him, from whom we have received all? Can we
          make a better use of our wealth, which is often a snare and a trap to
          men — by serving God, and thus making to ourselves friends of the
          mammon of unrighteousness? By this means we honor the Lord. He is the
          Creator and Redeemer of our souls and bodies, and therefore we are to
          glorify him with our bodies and our souls, which are his.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our substance is his also, and we must honor him with it by a
          liberality in his service, proportioned to the extent of his bounty.
          By the practice of this duty, we show our faith in his providence and
          promises, our love to God, our gratitude for his goodness, and our
          preference for his service, to that of mammon. In this manner we
          justify our profession of the gospel of Christ, and others are made to
          glorify God, while they enjoy the benefit of our ministrations to this
          purpose.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By the neglect of this duty, we are guilty of robbing God himself of
          that <i>rent </i>which he requires from us as his tenants. We dishonor
          him by showing that we love the world better than his service, and
          that we trust more to our money chests, than to his promises. Has he
          not assured us, that instead of being losers, we shall be great
          gainers by what we bestow upon him? Liberality on God's account brings
          down the blessing of providence to such a degree, that our barns shall
          be filled, and our vats need enlargement.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God has the sun, and winds, and rain, and creatures of every
          description, in his hand; and these he manages in such a manner, as
          that none shall be a loser by him, nor a gainer by withholding from
          him.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Robbers of God</p></i>are visited with a curse,
        which like a moth wastes, or like a fire destroys, their substance.
        Liberality opens the windows of Heaven, destroys the devouring locust,
        and turns the barren field in a delightful land. Health and riches are
        the advantages that attend the fear of the Lord, and liberality in his
        service.
        <p align="justify">
          But we must not imagine that these blessings are promised without a
          reservation of the <i>cross</i>, when God sees it needful for us — nor
          suppose that God is unfaithful when he administers correction to his
          children. This truth is inculcated in the next instruction of the wise
          king, which teaches us
          <i>how to behave under afflictive providences. </i>
        </p>

        This exhortation, like many of the others, speaks to us as unto
        children; and it is a piece of ingratitude in the children of wisdom, to
        forget it, by allowing it to be obliterated from their memories, or to
        produce no practical influence.

          We are here warned against <i>despising </i>divine rebukes, or
          <i>fainting </i>under them. The rebukes of providence are despised,
          when people do not regard the supreme hand that afflicts them; when
          they do not consider the design of God in afflicting; or when, through
          stupidity of mind or hardness of heart, they neglect to comply with
          it. This is a great affront to God. It is as if a child would say his
          father when he strikes him, "I do not care, do with me what you will,
          I shall behave no better than I have done."

          Ahaz was a very wicked man — but nothing showed the stubbornness of
          his heart so much, as his walking contrary to God, when he sent sore
          distress upon him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God's people may fall into this sin, sleeping like Jonah amidst the
          storm that God sends to testify his displeasure with them. But those
          whom he loves — he will awaken out of their sleep; and this he
          sometimes does by terrible tempests of outward calamity or of inward
          terror, sufficient to arouse them from the deepest slumber.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As the lively Christian is thankful for the least mercy — so the

          Afflictions may be despised in another sense, which seem to agree
          better with the argument used in the following verse. Men despise
          them, when they do not value them as necessary and useful. We need
          afflictions — and yet we are ready to think that they might be very
          well spared, and the work designed by them effected by gentler means.
          This notion is to be rejected by us with abhorrence, because it
          implies a bad reflection upon the wisdom and love of our heavenly
          Father, who does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of
          men; though now for a season, if need be, he afflicts them, because
          the beneficial consequences are far more than sufficient to
          counterbalance the pain of it.

          Weariness under the divine correction is another fault, which we must
          avoid with care. Our hearts must not fret against the Lord, nor allow
          questioning thoughts to spring up, for God never exceeds the due
          measure in distressing us. No ingredient is poured to the cup of
          affliction — but by infinite wisdom and grace! Nor shall the rod of
          Jehovah rest upon the lot of the righteous, longer than need requires.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Weariness will make the heart to sink like a stone, and produce harsh
          suspicions of the divine goodness. It will disqualify the mind for
          relishing the consolations of God, and answering the designs of the
          Almighty.

          To keep our minds from fainting, let us consider <i>who </i>it is that
          corrects us. It is the Lord, and all flesh must be silent before him,
          and receive what disciplines he is pleased to appoint, with reverence
          and resignation. It is the Lord, let him do unto us what seems good in
          his sight. He is excellent in judgment, and great in justice, and
          cannot do wrong to any of his creatures. But it is a sweeter
          consideration, that he is a <i>Father</i>, and chastens us in love.

          whom the Lord loves he corrects, even as a father corrects the son in
          whom he delights."</b
        >
        God intends, not to destroy us — but to reform us. Correction is one of
        those <i>privileges </i>that belong to the family of God. Christ
        himself, though a Son in an infinitely higher sense than we, though
        altogether free from the <i>need </i>
        of correction — yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.
        Christ was the first-born among many brethren, and we are predestined to
        be conformed to him in sufferings and in holiness. The sorrows which we
        endure are means appointed for making us partakers of God's holiness.
        Earthly fathers correct their children, in order to drive away folly
        from them; and that misguided lenity which withholds the rod, is but
        cruelty in disguise.

        <p align="justify">
          Now, we yield reverence and submission to earthly parents; how much
          more do we owe it to that heavenly Father, who exercises love
          infinitely wiser and greater than theirs! He knows that the greatest
          afflictions have not so much bitterness as the least sin, and he loves
          his children too well to spare correction when it is requisite to
          purge away their sin.

          The best commentary we can have on this text, is that given by Paul in
          his epistle to the Hebrews. Did we understand it aright, we would
          bless God for <i>correction</i>, as well as for <i>smiles</i> — and
          the wormwood and the gall of our miseries would be turned into honey
          and the honey-comb. Whatever corrections the children of God suffer,
          they are still happy, and it is our duty to believe them so. Behold,
          happy is the man whom God corrects! Nothing can make that person
          unhappy who is possessed of wisdom, as the inspired philosopher tells
          us in the next part of this chapter. In it he again recommends wisdom
          to our esteem and pursuit, verses 13-26.

        >
        Where shall wisdom be found, and who is the man that gets understanding?
        Wisdom is to be found in the Bible, and in Christ, who is revealed in
        it. The Scriptures are able to make us wise unto salvation, through
        faith in Christ Jesus. All the treasures of wisdom are hidden in him,
        and he communicates this precious gift by his Word and Spirit, to those
        who apply to him for this purpose. And while they diligently make use of
        the prescribed means, they increase in wisdom, and with it their
        happiness increases too.
        <p align="justify">
          None can tell how happy is the man who finds wisdom. They are
          accounted happy who possess large quantities of gold, or silver, or
          precious stones; but these lose all their value when brought into
          comparison with this heavenly treasure!

          than gold. She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can
          compare with her!"</b
        >
        <i>Silver </i>is much esteemed by men, and <i>gold </i>is almost adored
        by them. <i>Rubies </i>are still more precious, and perhaps there are
        some things still preferred to these <i>shining stones</i>. But all of
        them together, are not to be named in comparison with wisdom. He has no
        true judgment of the real value of things, who would give a grain of
        true wisdom for a mountain of diamonds!
        <p align="justify">
          Earthly riches are for the body — wisdom is for the soul. Earthly
          wealth may enrich a man for the space of threescore and ten years —
          but wisdom will enrich a man for numberless millions of ages.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Gold and rubies are the true riches in the eyes of erring mortals — 
          wisdom and grace are the true riches in the eyes of Christ. If we
          follow his judgment, the diseased beggar Lazarus was incomparably
          happier than the rich man who was clothed with purple, and who fared
          sumptuously every day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A venerable father, when he saw Rome in its splendor, took occasion to
          contemplate the ineffable glories of the Celestial City, compared with
          which Rome itself was but a pitiful village. The Scripture teaches us,
          when we are charmed with the luster of earthly riches — to consider
          how incomparably these are surpassed by the excellency of wisdom. He
          is not a true Christian who would not wish to be rich in faith, rather
          than in silver and gold; for every one that partakes of heavenly
          wisdom is enlightened by the Spirit of God, and disposed, in his
          judgment of the value of things, to listen to the instructions of God
          in his word.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The excellency of wisdom further appears in the gifts she bestows. She
          is a munificent princess, holding in both hands the richest presents,

        A happy life extended to old age is given to the lovers of wisdom; or if
        cut off in the midst of their days, they are no losers. They cannot even
        in this case complain that God is unfaithful to his promise, for in the
        eternal world they enter on a state of life which excels the present as
        much in <i>value </i>as in <i>duration</i>.

          If a man promises to give us fifty acres of ground in a barren country
          — and instead of them gives us ten thousand acres in a fruitful soil,
          watered by the river of God, and blessed by the smiles of Heaven, he
          is not worse — but a great deal better than his word.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Riches and honor are given in the same sense as length of days. When
          Solomon testified his high regard for wisdom, God bestowed upon him
          the riches and glory of this world. But experience taught Solomon that
          these things did not make him wiser, or better, or happier.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us, from the history of the wise man, learn to implore the
          accomplishment of this promise in a <i>spiritual sense</i>. There are
          eternal treasures and unfading diadems reserved for the wise in the
          eternal world. There they will be so rich, that the streets of the
          city are paved with pure gold. There they will be so honorable, that

          But as great as are the advantages, as splendid as are the honors
          which wisdom confers — the world is generally prejudiced against it,
          and with the idea of its being burdensome and unpleasant.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Worldly pleasure appears so desirable, so essential indeed to human
          happiness, that for this sole reason multitudes abhor the thoughts of
          becoming religious. In order to remove this mischievous prejudice,
          Solomon assures us, that religion is not less conducive to pleasure,
          than it is to honor and wealth.

        Do not call religion <i>Marah</i> — but call her <i>Naomi</i>, for she
        is in every respect <i>desirable</i>. True, indeed, it is no rare
        occurrence to find a religious man leading an unpleasant life — but this
        is to be ascribed to his own mistakes and selfish dispositions — and not
        to religion, than which nothing tends so much to render the present life
        a scene of happiness.
        <p align="justify">
          It is pleasant to <i>enter </i>into wisdom's ways by believing in
          Christ. It is pleasant to <i>go on </i>in these paths, by walking in
          him who is the new and living way. In God's presence is that fullness
          of joy into which those travelers shall enter at the termination of
          their journey. Even now some drops of those rivers of pleasure enter
          into their souls, and give them more delight than the highest earthly
          enjoyments can impart to those whose portion is in this life!

        <p align="justify">
          It will readily be admitted, that some of wisdom's ways are pleasant —

          There is peace and pleasure in <i>repentance</i>, which is sweetened

          of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree
          are for the healing of the nations!" The branches of this
          wide-spreading tree bend down to this lower world, and those who are

          heart, when the devil and the world would persuade us to forego some
          part of truth or duty, or to make some small compliance with sin — in
          order to serve some worldly end. "To Him who overcomes, he will he

        Knowledge and wisdom belong to God in their highest perfection, and

        universe, which incessantly proclaims the greatness of its Creator's
        wisdom.
        <p align="justify">
          The language of every creature when considered by itself, and

          It is divine wisdom which draws up the moisture from the earth in

          enjoined to manage our own concerns with wisdom. The God whose
          understanding is infinite, has dignified us with rational powers, and
          directed us to that wisdom which is proper for us. When he displayed
          the wonders of his infinite understanding at the creation of all
          things, he said unto man, "The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom — and
          to depart from evil is understanding." He is the giver of wisdom, and
          he gives it from his own exhaustless stores. Every <i>beam </i>of
          wisdom in man is a <i>ray </i>from that eternal Sun. And the divine
          image, which we lost by our folly in departing from God, begins to be
          renewed in us when we attain that knowledge and wisdom so earnestly
          recommended by the royal teacher.

        of these are so far from being useful, that they are brutish folly. No
        wisdom is sound, but that which is taught by the word of God, and
        approved by him who is the Author of wisdom, and who has given us plain
        marks for distinguishing it from that wisdom of the world which is
        earthly, sensual, and devilish.
        <p align="justify">
          This sound wisdom makes us discreet and prudent, and guards us against
          that <i>selfish deceit </i>which has so often assumed its name. This
          sound wisdom and discretion must be like <i>frontlets </i>before our
          eyes, that we may keep them always in our view. Then will our steps be
          ordered in God's word. For by what means shall we purify our way? By
          taking heed thereto, according to God's word.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are many adversaries who would rob us of this treasure, and we
          are but too ready to let wisdom slip out of our hearts. For this
          reason, we need to be frequently reminded of our duty to keep it. If
          we retain sound wisdom and discretion in our minds and hearts, if we
          uniformly exhibit them in our practice — we shall certainly find that
          our labor is not in vain in the Lord.

        Fools can scarcely be said to live; they neither glorify God nor enjoy
        him, so that they are dead while they live. But the excellency of
        knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to those who have it. It imparts to
        life that happiness, which alone renders it worthy of the name. True
        wisdom is real life, communicated from him who is the quickening Spirit,
        to those who were dead in trespasses and sins. It is an
        <i>ornament </i>of grace to the neck, which renders the lowliest beggar
        who possesses it, more noble than the mightiest monarch, who is
        acquainted with no brighter ornament than his regal crown.
        <i> <p align="justify">Safety</p></i>is another of the great advantages

        >
        While we keep sound wisdom and discretion, we are safe by the protection
        of the Almighty. We are safe whether we walk in the way, or sit in the
        house, or repose on the couch. No <i>evil </i>shall happen to the just;
        even those events which are evil to others — are sanctified and blessed

          But Jesus knew well the regard due to every jot and tittle of the word
          of God. We are required still to keep the way of the Lord, and in the
          affairs of life to attend to our own concerns — shunning the character

          Sudden fears are attended with a stupefying influence upon those who

          the three children in Babylon, that the God whom he serves is able to
          deliver him — or to render him happy, though the desolation of others

        >
        To do justly, is one great point of religion. We ought not unnecessarily
        to delay giving every man his due, for
        <i>the delay of justice is temporary injustice. </i>
        When we owe money to our neighbors, which they require from us at
        present, and we, though able, defer payment until afterwards, we are
        plainly guilty of injustice; for a man has the same right to his
        property now, that he will have a year hence.
        <p align="justify">
          We find men keeping in their own hands, the hire of the laborer — and
          we reprove them for it. The same censure may be applied to those who
          refuse to pay just debts, or to restore to its rightful owner any
          piece of lost property which they have found. We are not to do what we
          will with that which is not ours, nor are we to owe to another
          anything but love. We owe love and the proper fruits of it to our
          fellow-creatures, according to their necessities and characters, and
          our connection with them. And we transgress the rule of righteousness,
          if we withhold even from our enemies that which is due to them by the
          law of Christ; for many things are to be reckoned just debts from us
          on Christ's account, which they have no title to claim for their own
          sakes.

        <p align="justify">
          It may be difficult for us to render to others what is due to them by
          the laws of justice or charity; but the question is not, whether it is
          easy — but whether it is in the power of our hands, to render unto
          others that good which is due to them. The fruits of love are often
          labors — but they are such labors of love as those which our Redeemer
          cheerfully performed for us — nor is any man a loser by them. What is
          in the power of our hands today — may not be in our power tomorrow —
          therefore we ought not to delay the performance of any good work.

        not perform it cheerfully. We are commanded, not only to do good works —

        mercy — but to show it with cheerfulness. He who gives speedily, gives
        twice — but he who gives with slow reluctance, gives in part a denial.
        <p align="justify">
          Much of the benefit is often lost to the receiver, and much of the
          gratitude to the giver — by telling our neighbor to come back later.
          There is a manner of giving which ill accords with that kindness and
          mercy which should dispose us to give. Airs of superiority assumed
          even to the lowliest of our fellow-creatures, are unfitting to the
          Christian. For however inferior to us in point of station in life,
          they are still our neighbors, and God commands us to love them as
          ourselves.

        <p align="justify">
          God often delays answering our prayers — but he is infinitely and

          — he gives before they ask — or while they are yet speaking, he hears.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In one case, the wise man allows us to defer giving. When we have it
          not by us, and when we cannot give at all consistent with more urgent
          duties — we may refuse to give. But still we must have hearts to give,
          were it in our power. And if there is first a willing mind, it is
          accepted according to what a man has, and not according to what he has
          not.

        wholly destitute of love, who can willfully hurt those whom he is
        required to love as himself. Such a man cannot surely pretend to
        religion; or if he does, he is at best like a tinkling brass, or a

          the greater malignity in it. It is criminal to devise evil against any
          person — but it is double iniquity to hurt those who dwell securely by
          us. For this in effect is a breach of trust, and an indication of a

          in reserve, compared with which the crowns and scepters of the world
          deserve not a name. The prudent are even at present crowned with
          knowledge — but the happy day is coming when those who are wise shall
          shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who have turned
          others to the wisdom of the just, as the stars forever and ever.

          Fools are fond of honors — but all the honors they can enjoy are like
          <i>bubbles </i>when they glitter in the sun. They shall be promoted,
          indeed — but their exaltation shall be like that of Haman, who was
          exalted when he was hung upon a gallows fifty cubits high. Their shame
          shall be conspicuous to the world, when they shall be covered with
          everlasting disgrace, and become an abhorrence to all.
