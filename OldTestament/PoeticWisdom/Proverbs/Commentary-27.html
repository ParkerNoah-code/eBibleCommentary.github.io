        <p align="justify">
          The wicked are so desperately hardened that they have no fear of the
          most horrible dangers — at least they have not such an apprehension of
          them, as to flee to that sure and only refuge which Divine grace has
          presided. At the same time they are so wretched that that they are
          never in security, and are liable to the most distressing terrors,
          when there is no reason for them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Syrians that besieged Samaria heard the noise of chariots and
          horsemen, which threw them into such a panic that they fled away, and
          left their bread and clothes behind them. In like manner, the wicked
          are liable to terrors which sometimes encompass them like waters, when
          no reason can be given for them. For the objects which <i>ought </i>to
          alarm transgressors, and have a tremendous reality in them, are not
          the things that take hold of their minds. They are like madmen who
          fear not a drawn sword — but tremble at the shaking of a leaf, as if
          it were a devil ready to hurry them away to the bottomless pit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No passion is more tormenting than fear, and a sense of guilt
          producing it. It was a punishment threatened against the people of
          Israel, if they revolted from God, that they should flee before their
          pursuing enemies — but it is a sign of the utmost wretchedness, when
          men flee away through terror when there are no enemies — but such as
          are conjured up by a timorous imagination.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sinners have great reason after all to fear, even when the objects of
          their fear are mere fantasies. God is angry with them every day, and
          their anxious alarms are a part of the punishment of their sins. They
          cannot expect tranquility and happiness of mind, but in Christ, by
          whom we are delivered from the guilt of sin, and enjoy that peace
          which passes all understanding.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who are justified by his righteousness, and led in the paths of
          righteousness by his Spirit, are as bold as a lion, the most
          courageous of creatures upon earth. For they are delivered from all
          danger of condemnation, and they are at peace with God. They may have
          many enemies — but God is their friend, and no weapon formed against
          them shall prosper. They may meet with adversities and deaths — but
          they shall meet with nothing to separate them from the love of God,
          with nothing that was not designed for them by an all wise and
          gracious providence, with nothing but what shall contribute to their
          good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The righteous are sometimes timorous like doves — but they have reason
          to be bold as lions. They are partakers of those graces which have a
          native tendency to expel tormenting fears, and to produce quietness
          and assurance forever. Their natural constitution, their remaining
          corruptions, their unhappy falls, their numerous enemies — may
          counteract their principles of holy courage — but they are commanded
          to be always strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. The day is
          coming when every fear shall vanish away, and be followed by eternal
          triumphs. What effect righteousness has to produce boldness, and to
          banish fear — appears from the history of the elders who obtained a
          good report through faith, and of the apostles and first Christians,
          who triumphed in the midst of daily deaths, and in the face of bloody
          tyrants. Nor have later ages been destitute of testimonies to the
          truth of this proverb. Martyrs have rejoiced in flames, as if they had
          been beds of roses; and Christians on a deathbed have often said, "O
          death, where is your victory! Thanks be unto God who gives us the
          victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."

          >"When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers, but a man of
          understanding and knowledge maintains order."</b
        >

        <p align="justify">
          The providence of God allows not a sparrow to fall unnoticed to the
          ground — how much less is it to be supposed that the affairs of men,
          and of societies consisting of millions of men, are unobserved by the
          great God, whose kingdom rules over all. We often rejoice, and often
          mourn, when we observe the occurrences of public governments — but we
          attend too little to the justice of God concerned in them. When
          frequent changes happen in the administration by the deaths of
          princes, or by those revolutions which seat a new family on the throne
          — God is carrying on his purposes of mercy or judgment. And although
          the same princes continue sitting on the throne, when public measures
          are continually changing, we may see the justice of Providence, and
          the provocations of the land calling down that vengeance which is
          executed in the miseries brought upon a land by these means.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          For the transgressions of Israel and Judah we find many princes,
          sometimes cut off in a very short space of time; and even the good
          Josiah was removed from an earthly to a heavenly kingdom, to make way
          for that punishment which was due to the guilt of the land.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But a man of wisdom and piety is a great national blessing. A private
          man of such a character may sometimes be a happy instrument of
          rescuing a nation from destruction, or establishing its peace and
          happiness. But a prince furnished with skill to govern a nation, and
          with piety to govern himself, is an inestimable gift of God. His wise
          choice of counselors and magistrates, his good example, his just and
          vigorous administration, the countenance he gives to virtue, and the
          checks he gives to wickedness — concur to establish the land in peace
          and prosperity, and the blessing of God attends his government. The
          history of the good kings of Judah, and of almost all the good kings
          with which any nation has been blessed, are confirmations of this
          truth.

        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 28:3.</p></font>"A
          poor man who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no
          crops."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          One would naturally think that poor men, though exalted to high
          stations, would, through their knowledge of the heart, and experience
          of the hardships of a poor man — look down with tenderness upon the
          poor, and use their newly acquired authority for the protection of
          those who are left in that state out of which they were raised. But
          experience tells us that the worst of all oppressors have ordinarily
          been the poor, when they were advanced to rule.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The poor who oppress the poor, are like a sweeping inundation that
          carries everything along with it, and scarcely leaves anything in the
          ground to be the seed of a future crop. When poor men are exalted to
          power, their new dignity too often turns their brain. They know not
          themselves, and they cannot be expected to know their former brethren.
          Their experience of the hardships of poverty meeting with a selfish
          heart, disposes them to guard against its return, by oppressing those
          below them, and dragging everything into their own possession, that
          they may set their nest on high, and be delivered from the power of
          evil.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is therefore very improper to place the poor in stations where they
          may have an opportunity to enrich themselves at the expense of others
          — unless they are well known to be men like Joseph, of inflexible
          integrity. Those who might behave well in private stations, are often
          <i>tyrants </i>when temptation and opportunity concur to make them so.
          History is full of the harms which arise from the unwise neglect of
          the instruction given to nations and kings in this text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How lovely is the character of our Redeemer! He made himself poor for
          our sakes, and he is now exalted to an heavenly throne. But his heart
          is not exalted above those poor men on earth, whom he deigns to call
          his brethren. He knows the heart of a poor man, and he will deliver
          the needy when he cries, the poor also, and him who has no helper.

          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 28:4.</p></font
          >"Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the
          law resist them."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          The wicked not only destroy their own souls — but contribute to the
          ruin of other men, by praising their sinful courses, and encouraging
          them in evil. No wicked man wishes to be called wicked, and therefore
          he puts false colors upon his own and other men's sins, baptizing them
          with the names of those virtues to which they seem to have most
          resemblance. <i>Drunkenness </i>is called good fellowship<i
            >. Covetousness </i
          >is called prudence and frugality. Courage in <i>sin </i>is called
          bravery. <i>Peevishness </i>has the name of honesty and plain dealing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If no good quality can be found to put a gloss upon their sins, then
          the wicked will flatter one another by praising them for good
          qualities to which they have no shadow of a title — and at the same
          time excusing their faults, as if they had no proportion to their good
          qualities.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To forsake the law of God is a very bad thing — but to take pleasure
          in those who do the same, and to strengthen their hands in wickedness,
          is to walk in the ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel
          to sin. The practice of sin, is praise to evil-doers. Our example is
          of itself an encouragement to those who are like us in their behavior;
          and when those who have fallen into sin through temptation, and
          resolve to reform, see others continuing in the practice of iniquity —
          they will be emboldened to go on in the same path — they see that they
          are no worse than other men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Of all the wicked, those who have left off to be wise and to do good,
          are the most pernicious enemies to holiness, and give the most
          effectual encouragement to sin. The language of their practice is, "We
          have tasted of the new wine of religion, and we find that the old wine
          of the pleasures of sin is better."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Why should I leave my present practices, says the wicked man, to take
          the yoke of religion on my neck; others have tried it, and they find
          they are not able to bear it, and have been obliged to shake it off.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who forsake the law, are <i>living infections </i> to all around
          them, and little consider what loads of guilt, their own and other
          men's, lie upon them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But those who keep the law resist the wicked. For they love God, and
          hate everything that provokes and dishonors him. God promised Abraham
          to be a friend to his friends, and an enemy to his enemies. All the
          children of Abraham are heirs of this promise — and can they forbear
          to hate those who hate God, and to be grieved with those who rise up
          against him? But their hatred to those who hate God has no ill-will to
          their persons in it. They wish well to their best interests, and are
          zealous against their sins for the harm which they do to their souls,
          as well as the provocation they give to God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who keep the law are in very different stations, and have very
          different degrees of influence. Magistrates and ministers, parents and
          masters, if they have a zeal for God — contend each in their places
          against sin. Even those pious people that are in the lowest rank of
          life have an opportunity of striving against sin, by their
          <i>practice </i> and <i>prayers</i>, and in many cases by their
          <i>admonitions</i>. God is well pleased with those who rise up for him
          against the workers of iniquity. Great were the honors bestowed on the
          tribe of Levi for their impartial zeal against sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yet we must remember that we ought to strive against sin with God's
          weapons, and in our proper ranks, under the banner of him who was
          manifested to destroy the works of the devil, and in the imitation of
          that example which he left us, that we might follow his steps.

          understand it fully."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Evil men may have great talents, and much learning — but they do not
          understand justice, and therefore they cannot be said to understand
          anything that is worth the knowing. Their corrupt affections spread a
          dark cloud over their judgments, that they cannot understand the way
          of wisdom and holiness.
          <i
            >Their eyes are disordered and darkened by the malignant influence
            of sin, and therefore their whole course of life is full of

          >It is true, they know their duty in many cases better than they
          practice it — but the knowledge which they have is at best a
          <i>learned ignorance</i>, for they are unacquainted with the necessity
          and excellency of doing their duty, and with those means that would be
          of for enabling and disposing them to do it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>understandings </i>of the wicked are perverse as well as their
          <i>will</i>. Some error is mingled with the knowledge they have,
          which, unknown to others, and undiscerned by themselves — misleads
          them continually. They cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God
          — but their minds and hearts are both sensual, and therefore there is
          no judgment in their goings. Those who know not justice, know nothing
          at all — they are more brutish in their knowledge than the stork, and
          the crane, and the swallow.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But those who seek the Lord know justice, and therefore they know
          everything that is needful to be known by them. They are acquainted
          with the method of salvation, and with the way of being holy and
          happy. And what knowledge can be compared with this? All the things
          that we can desire, all the things that are accounted precious on
          earth, are but dross and dung, compared with the excellency of the
          knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord, and of the way of salvation
          through his blood, and of being conformed to him in his death and
          life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The people blessed with this excellent knowledge, are those who seek
          the Lord. They are set in opposition to evil men. For they are all
          wicked, who call not upon the name of the Lord, and who do not seek
          his favor as their chief happiness — but those who seek the Lord with
          the desire of their souls, are haters of evil, and lovers of goodness,
          and have their portion with the saints.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Perhaps they dare not say that they have found him whom their souls
          love — but their desires shall not be always disappointed. For those
          relishes which the Spirit of God has excited in their souls, shall be
          gratified in due time.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who seek the Lord search the <i>Scriptures</i>, and make them
          the subject of their meditation — and God blesses their diligence by
          giving them wisdom through his statutes. They <i>pray </i>with great
          fervency for the promised Spirit, and God gives the Holy Spirit to
          those who ask him. This spirit is a spirit of wisdom and revelation to
          them, leading them into all necessary truth; and therefore the
          spiritual man is said to judge all things. If he is sometimes at a
          loss to know his duty in particular cases — yet he has sure promises
          to plead with God, and to encourage his own soul in the hope that God
          will be pleased to reveal those things that he knows not, unto him.

        <p align="justify">
          We had the sense of this proverb in the beginning of the 19th chapter
          — but it is here repeated because of the important instruction
          contained in it. Gold and silver glitter in our eyes, and dazzle our
          sight to such a degree, that a rich sinner appears more respectable
          than a saint in rags. The fatal consequence is, that men labor rather
          to be <i>rich </i> than <i>holy</i>. To direct our practice aright, it
          is necessary to have our unreasonable judgements of things corrected,
          and to esteem the poorest saint above the most prosperous
          transgressor.

          Uprightness is so valuable in itself, that it gives a luster to the

          can do — but double-mindedness and insincerity are so vile, that they
          stain the glory of the highest man on earth. Let us therefore choose
          the portion of God's people, however lowly they are, and pray that we
          may <i>not </i>have our portion with the men of the world, although
          their bellies should be filled with God's bounty.

          adorned with every liberal science, and is placed in a way of life
          wherein he has the prospect of making a large fortune; but, after all,
          lacks the grace of God, and has no deep impressions of religion.

          Which of the two parents has most comfort and honor in his son?
          Solomon would answer — the second, because he is a wise son. This
          wisdom will make a young man to choose good company, and to avoid the
          society of riotous people, and everything that might reflect disgrace
          upon himself or his father. But he who is unrestrained by a principle
          of religion, is in great danger of associating himself with riotous
          and dissolute companions. And he who is a companion of riotous people,
          shames his father, for he will soon imitate those whose company he
          loves. Or, if he preserves himself from their vices, (which can
          scarcely be expected,) he at least exposes himself to
          <i>suspicions</i>, and loses his character.

          The reason why men grind the faces of their poor neighbors, by usury
          and unjust gain, is that they expect to make themselves rich by such
          means. The reason why men are averse from pitying the poor, is that
          they fear poverty will be the consequence to themselves. These
          <i>hopes </i>and <i>fears </i>are equally groundless.

        <p align="justify">
          Solomon, in many places of this book, teaches us, that oppression and
          unmercifulness is the surest road to poverty — and that liberality to
          the poor is the surest and shortest road to riches; because God makes
          men rich or poor at his pleasure, and by his secret methods of
          providence makes the money of the wicked to find its way into the
          purses of the righteous and merciful.

        <p align="justify">
          This is a truth which experience often verifies. If it is not
          constantly, it is generally the case, and when things appear to be
          otherwise ordered, we ought to acquiesce in the sovereignty of God,
          and to believe that his Word has, or will have, its accomplishment,
          though in a manner as yet unknown to us. Job was reduced to extreme
          poverty, after all his wonderful acts of generosity to the poor, and
          never expected to enjoy any more happiness in this world — yet he
          never doubted of this truth. "Though he heaps up silver as the dust,
          and prepares clothing as the clay" — he may prepare it — but the just
          shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.

          which are presented in the name of Christ. When we live in a willful
          disobedience to any of God's commandments — we declare all our
          professions to be insincere, and our faith to be a dead faith, and
          therefore we cannot impose on the hearer of prayer, if we hope that

          <i>detestable to God</i>, who sees how corrupt his principles and

          fellowship with God. His heart is under the reigning power of sin, and

          because they are a means of making them more proud and self-conceited
          than they would otherwise be. They think themselves men of greater
          abilities than poor men, because they attribute their wealth to their
          own skill in business. Or, if they possess wealth by inheritance, they
          take to themselves airs of importance, as if they were men of a
          superior species to the rest of the human race. The respect which is
          showed them by discretion, and the honor paid them by flattery, they
          consider as a tribute of praise to their great merit. The importance
          which they assume, and the respect which they exact, render them the
          objects of scorn or pity to many of their poor neighbors.

          God has imparted his gifts variously. To some he has given much wealth
          and little understanding. To others, he has not given riches — but
          what is of incomparably greater value, a sagacious and comprehensive
          mind; and, therefore, no man ought to be proud on the one hand, or
          dejected on the other hand. Let each of us be thankful for the
          bounties of God to ourselves and others. It would be a great
          presumption to grudge other men what God has thought fit to bestow on
          them — or to be displeased because he has not given us everything.

        <p align="justify">
          The poor man who has understanding sees through the weakness and folly
          of his rich neighbor who boasts of his wisdom, and despises him, not
          so much for his lack of sense, as for his groundless pretensions to
          it. No man would make himself the object of laughter, if he would be
          content with his due — but when one exacts more respect than he is
          entitled to, he loses that respect which he would otherwise have.

          Let them take care lest they expose themselves to the censure and
          scorn of their inferiors, by exacting respect, and, what is worst of

          destruction, by turning them into <i>nourishment to their vanity</i>,
          and obstacles in their way to the kingdom of Heaven. Paul enjoins
          Timothy to charge the rich not to trust in riches; pointing out to us
          that rich men are too much disposed to trust in riches, and that trust
          in riches is a very dangerous vice.

          Such people think it would be a dishonor to them to confess their
          faults — but the dishonor lay in committing them — and confession,
          with other proofs of repentance, is the only possible means of wiping
          it away. They stand upon a false point of honor, and expose themselves

          confess our sin, with a dependence on that blessed sacrifice which

          holy name of God — which makes him to dread the thoughts of sinning
          against him more than death, and to tremble at the Word of God, lest
          he should break any of its precepts, or deserve the execution of any

          Paul was a triumphant believer, who feared neither men nor devils, and
          reckoned himself perfectly secure against every charge that might be

          holy fear, which disposed him to keep his body in subjection, lest
          when he had preached the gospel to others, he himself should be a
          castaway. He is not an unhappy man, but a blessed man, whose heart is
          continually governed by this fear. It has a happy influence upon his
          soul, to guard it from the temptations of Satan and the world, and to
          keep it close to the Redeemer. It tends to promote the exercise of
          faith, and hope, and joy in the Lord. Thus fear is a fruit of the Holy
          Spirit, and a blessed means of establishing the heart in the love of
          God. It is a happy sign of a saving interest in the everlasting
          covenant of mercy, and in that special favor of God which is the
          source of all our joys.

          Josiah's heart was made tender by this fear; and judgment could not
          light upon that land where he reigned, until he was removed out of it
          to a better kingdom. But wretched is the man who is not afraid to sin
          against his maker and judge. His heart is hard as the nether
          millstone. He thinks himself a man of courage — but his courage is the
          bravery of an infernal fiend. He is not impressed with the solemn
          authority of God, nor melted with the astonishing declarations of his
          mercy, nor terrified at the tremendous thunders of the threatening
          law. Shall such a man escape the divine vengeance which he defies? Is
          he stronger than the Lord? Let Pharaoh's ruin in the Red Sea, and the
          destruction of Israel in the desert, and the misery of that nation
          which rejected our Savior, be considered by headless sinners, that
          they may judge whether a man can harden himself against God and
          prosper. Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "today, if you will hear
          the voice of Christ, harden not your hearts." Do you find your hearts
          stubborn and insensible, after all God's dealings with you by his Word
          and providence? Put them into the hand of God, that he may take away
          from you the hearts of stone, and give you hearts of flesh.

          The lion and the bear are two of the fiercest kinds of animals — but

          No less dreadful is a tyrant who spreads desolation and terror through

          Oppressors are called benefactors by their slavish flatterers — but
          they are called wild beasts in Scripture. The fiercest of animals, at

          Solomon as emblems of their savage nature. But these emblems were
          insufficient to represent the monstrous barbarities that have been
          often exercised by those who were at the head of the Roman empire in
          its pagan or anti-Christian state. Therefore, Daniel and John
          represent them under the figure of <i>monsters </i>more dreadful than
          any that were ever beheld by the eyes of men. The language of

          a crime of the same nature with condemning the righteous. Saving the
          life of a murderer, has the same relation to the guilt of slaying the
          innocent. Is God so severe in his laws and providence against
          murderers? Then let us give no indulgence to any of those passions or
          dispositions, that lead to such a black and atrocious crime. Hatred
          and malice do not always end in blood — but blood commonly begins with
          hatred and malice. These malignant passions are viewed as murder by
          the holy eyes of God; and the man who indulges them has committed
          murder already in his heart.

          When judges are first perverted from integrity, it is owing to some
          powerful temptation addressed to them, which they think irresistible;
          at the same time, they think that they will never transgress the rules
          of justice for any paltry consideration. "If justice is to be
          violated," said Julius Caesar, "it is to be violated for the sake of
          empire." Few of the covetous or ambitious keep their integrity at such
          a high price — but they must have some valuable consideration in
          exchange for their conscience and honesty. Some will sell justice for
          an estate or a title, who would scorn to barter it away for a trifle
          of money, or to sell their souls at such a pitiful price as that which
          Judas Iscariot had for his master.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But there is great danger in yielding to any temptation, however
          great. For besides that it is the sign of a corrupt heart — the
          conscience that is once violated, will, in time, be prostituted and
          debauched, and the most trifling temptation will become a sufficient
          motive for the greatest iniquities. The
          <i>second step in wickedness </i>will not raise such a conflict in the
          soul as the first, and the <i>third </i>will be easier than the
          second. Just so, the most detestable villainies will appear less
          horrible to a man accustomed in iniquity, than the slightest
          deviations from justice once did to the same person. He who would not
          transgress without the offer of thousands, will at length transgress
          for a piece of bread; and he who once refused a whole estate, if he
          allows himself at last to be perverted, will become so degenerate,
          that he will sell the righteous for a few pieces of silver, and the
          needy for a pair of shoes!

          curse of God; and since it is the blessing of God that makes rich,
          poverty must be the fruit of his curse. He makes both God and men his
          enemies; and if either the justice of God, or the vengeance of men can
          rifle his stores — he must be reduced to poverty. The covetous man
          will not believe that poverty is coming upon him, for he imagines that
          he is taking the most effectual way to become rich — but it will bring
          upon him so much the greater distress and pain which he was not

          distress to the people of God! If the covetous man does not feel the
          assaults of poverty while he lives, death will turn him out naked and
          stripped of everything, to the eternal world! His <i>sins </i>alone
          shall cleave to him, and the <i>curses </i>which he was collecting to

          is the neglect of faithful reproof, or a flattering tongue, the true
          way of gaining the favor of our friends? By no means! God has declared
          otherwise, and God turns the hearts of men at his pleasure. If our
          ways please the Lord, we have reason to hope that he will turn the
          hearts of our enemies to love us. But if our ways displease him, he
          will make those to become our enemies whose favor we courted by

        <i> <p align="justify">Flattery</p></i>may gain us a transient flow of
        kindness, and faithful reproof may excite a temporary disgust. For the

        own praise, without examining whether it is just or not. But the force

          To say that we did not look upon a thing to be a transgression, will
          be no just excuse for any piece of conduct that we might have known to
          be criminal. It will only show us to be so depraved, that even our
          minds and our consciences are defiled.

          Only by pride comes contention — and pride never comes without
          contention. The proud man has a high opinion of his own merit, and
          cannot bear with those who have not the same respect for him, that he
          has for himself. When he finds a man who does not cringe to him, or
          submit implicitly to his opinions — he is instantly alarmed as if an
          attack were made on his honor, and by his angry words and overbearing
          behavior kindles up the fire of contention. The proud man trusts in
          himself, and not in the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He who trusts in the Lord is not high-minded and insolent. He has a
          low opinion of himself, and although he is not careless about his own
          reputation — yet he trusts God with his honor, as well as all his
          other concerns; believing that if his righteousness should be
          eclipsed, God will in due time bring it forth to the light. The
          weapons he uses for the support of his character, are the meekness and
          gentleness of Christ; and the consequence is, that he lives at peace,
          and rather pacifies, than stirs up strife.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The proud are much to be pitied, for they have a poor wretched life.
          They can scarcely enjoy one day's tranquility, because there are never
          lacking some to mortify their pride, and cross their ambition.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But those who trust in the Lord enjoy an inward tranquility and
          outward peace. The God whom they trust takes care of all their
          concerns, so that everything which they do shall prosper. If anything
          happens to cross their wishes, they know that it is agreeable to the
          appointment of God, whose will they prefer to their own. Their souls
          are like a watered garden, and like a well of water, whose waters fail
          not, for they are refreshed with the manifestations of the love of
          God, and the communications of his grace, and their hopes are full of
          immortality. O Lord God Almighty, blessed is the man who trusts in
          you! But miserable are the proud, and those who trust in their own
          hearts!

          We must not trust our own prudence, even about our worldly business,
          without acknowledging God in it — for it is a piece of folly to
          neglect him in whom we live and move, and whose blessing is absolutely
          necessary for our daily labors, and our daily bread. It is still more
          foolish to trust our own hearts in our spiritual concerns — and yet we
          are guilty of this folly in a thousand instances. When we consult with
          our own judgment what worship we ought to give to God, instead of
          consulting with implicit submission of heart the oracles of God, who
          best knows what service will please himself — when we form our
          apprehensions about the doctrines of religion, without searching the
          Scriptures, and supplicating God to send forth his light and truth to
          direct and fix our judgments — when we try some other way of salvation
          than the way revealed in the gospel — when we form resolutions in our
          own strength, or persuade ourselves that we are able to keep them in
          opposition to temptation — when we endeavor to purify our own hearts,
          by closely applying to them moral persuasions, or even divine truths,
          without a sense of our absolute need of Christ as our sanctification —
          in all these cases, and in many others, we are chargeable with this
          folly. How gross the folly is, may appear upon a slight examination of
          it. If any cheat had deceived us a hundred times, we would certainly
          deserve the character of fools if we trusted him any more. Just so, we
          are great strangers at home, if we are not sensible that it has been
          the common practice of our hearts to impose falsehoods on us from our
          youth up. The idolatrous heathens and Roman Catholics, the falls of
          saints, and the general wickedness of mankind, might be adduced as
          proofs of the danger and folly of this carnal confidence.

          The only way of walking wisely, is to have no confidence in ourselves
          — but to trust in the Lord with all our hearts, and to follow his
          counsels wherever they lead us. Those who trust in their own hearts
          lean upon a broken reed, which will soon fail under them, and they
          will fall into harm. Those that trust in the Lord and walk wisely, may
          fall into calamities and temptations; but, for their comfort, they
          have a sure promise of deliverance. Their distresses are the trial of
          their faith, and they shall end in joy and happiness.

          Look upon the distresses of the poor, and your hearts will be melted
          into tenderness. If the sight does not affect your hearts, listen to
          their complaints and petitions. If you disregard the voice of the
          poor, hear the voice of God commanding you to give to the poor.
          <i

          recompense you — but God will do it liberally.

          Are you afraid of bringing poverty upon yourself by your bounty? Many
          have been ruined by withholding — but never any by giving according to
          the will of God. Giving to the poor is the best preventive of poverty,
          for it is putting your money into the bank of Heaven, which can never
          be lost. The best securities on earth will not hinder your money from
          making wings and fleeing away. But he who gives to the poor lends to
          the Lord, and shall surely receive it again when he needs it, with
          abundant increase.

          The uncharitable man closes his eyes to the poor, lest his eyes should
          melt his hard heart, and tempt him to sin against <i>his god</i>, the
          unrighteous mammon. He is as much afraid of anything that might excite
          him to goodness — as a saint is of temptations to sin. But shall he
          save his money by his unrighteous withholding? Will this procure him
          the blessing of God, which makes rich? He can expect nothing but
          curses as his reward. The curse of him who is ready to perish shall
          come upon him. The curse of God is upon his hardened soul, and upon
          his basket and his store. He is miserable upon earth, in the hatred of
          God and men, and he takes the way to be cursed at the last day, and to
          secure himself an abode in that place where
          <i> judgment without mercy </i>shall be executed upon those who show
          no mercy!

          The reign of wicked princes is a general calamity, more dreadful than
          war and pestilence. Those that are not cut off, or stripped of their
          property, live in continual terror, because they know not how soon the
          overflowing scourge may reach themselves. These enemies of mankind are
          like raging bears, or roaring lions while they live — and when they
          die their end is no more regretted than the death of a mad dog. For it
          is a deliverance to the nation, and a blessing to the church. The
          righteous are then freed from their restraints, and take courage to
          themselves, to support and spread the interests of religion and
          virtue.

          It is well known what happiness was caused by the death of Ahaz in the
          kingdom of Judah, and how Christianity was advanced in the Roman
          empire by the death of Julian; and how the death of Queen Mary of
          England, and the abdication of James II, tended to the restoration of
          happiness and religion in our own island.
        </p>

          How wretched are wicked rulers! They are hated while they live above
          the ground — and the curses of a nation pursue them to their long
          homes. They are accountable for the wickedness of thousands whom they
          draw or drive into sin; and they lie down in the dust loaded with
          innumerable iniquities of other men. The mercy, as well as the justice
          of God, is engaged to chase them out of the world. Those who are
          perverted by their influence upon earth will load them with
          execrations through eternity!
