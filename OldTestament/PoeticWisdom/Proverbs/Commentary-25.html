            >"Like snow in summer or rain in harvest — so honor is not fitting
            for a fool."</b
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Snow in summer and rain in harvest are unseasonable, disagreeable, and
          sometimes very hurtful. In like manner, honors bestowed on foolish and
          wicked people sit very ungracefully on them, and enable them often to
          prove hurtful to their inferiors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When Haman was raised to high station, he soon became hurtful to all
          men by his pride; and if providence had not baffled his designs, he
          would have ruined a whole nation of innocent people, and banished true
          religion out of the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This proverb contains a very important instruction to those who have
          the disposal of offices and honors in their hand. By advancing
          unworthy people to stations of influence in church or state, they may
          render themselves deeply accountable for the follies and crimes of
          other men. One of the Caliphs of Babylon, was so sensible of this,
          that he voluntarily resigned his authority, and refused to choose his
          successor, that he might not be accountable for his conduct.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Most men are fond of honor and preferment, as if happiness were
          inseparably connected with it — but few are sensible how difficult it
          is to wear honors with a befitting dignity, and how much better the
          providence of God has chosen their situation than they could have
          chosen it for themselves. Great numbers of those princes who make a
          despicable or hateful figure in history, might have befit a private
          station very well, and left the world lamented by all their
          acquaintances.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It belongs to God to determine our station in life, and to us to
          believe that he has determined it in his wisdom and goodness, and to
          fulfill the duties of it without aspiring to those honors that God has
          not been pleased to bestow upon us. Those that are in stations of
          honor ought not to trust for honor to their stations — but to seek it
          by wisdom, without which, their exalted situation will only render
          their disgrace more visible. The infamous names of Pilate and
          Tiberius, and Caiaphas, might have been buried with those of the
          meanest instruments of their iniquities, if they had not, to their
          great unhappiness, filled high stations while they lived.

          >"Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow — an undeserved curse
          does not come to rest."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse
          causeless shall not come.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When you see a bird wandering about, or a swallow flying hither and
          thither, you are not afraid of any hurt from them. They will not touch
          you — but fly back to their nests.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You have no more reason to be afraid of hurt from unmerited curses,
          whoever the people are that pronounce them. They will fly back to the
          place from which they came, and light with dreadful vengeance on the
          heads of those who profaned their Maker's name, and gave scope to
          their own malice in uttering them. For as they delight in cursing —
          they shall have cursing for their portion; and unless the pardoning
          mercy of God prevents, their curses will enter into their bones.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Groundless fears are real torments, for no passion is more distressing
          than fear. Whether it has a just cause or not, its present effect is
          the same, and therefore God in mercy has given us antidotes against
          every needless and unprofitable kind of fear.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The curses which wicked men sometimes pour forth from their vindictive
          spirits, have such a dreadful sound, that they strike an impression of
          horror into the tender spirits of the innocent and conscientious,
          although they know they have not deserved them. But if our consciences
          do not condemn us, we need not be afraid of the blasphemous
          imprecations of the wicked, although they were expressed in the
          coarsest language of Hell. The curses of a conclave of cardinals, or
          the excommunications of an assembly of divines — could do no harm to
          one whom his own heart does not reproach. They may open their mouths
          wide, and speak great swelling words of terror — but their arm is
          short, and God has not entrusted them with his thunderbolts. Their
          curses, instead of being harmful, will be very useful to us, if we are
          wise enough to imitate the conduct of David, whose meekness was
          approved, his prayers kindled into a flame of desires, and his hopes
          invigorated by them. But we have just reason to fear the undeserved
          curse.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Although people when they meet with ill usage, are not warranted to
          wish a curse upon those who wrong them — yet the curses that are
          extorted by anguish from their hearts, will not fall to the ground.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The most just curse in the world is the curse of God, which lies upon
          all the children of disobedience. We cannot escape the execution of it
          — but through Christ, who was made a curse in our stead.

          whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs
          of fools!"</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          A fool is more brutish than the horse or the donkey. For the horse, as
          well as the ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib — but
          foolish sinners are insensible of the obligations they are under, both
          to God and man. The <i>horse </i>needs the lash to chastise it when it
          is unruly, and to urge its speed when it is dull. The <i>donkey</i>,
          when it was used for riding, needed the bridle to govern its course —
          or the spur to push it on its way. The rod is equally needful for the
          fool's back.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Are you the unhappy fathers of foolish children? You must make use of
          the rod and reproof to give them wisdom. Are you authorized to bear
          rule in the church? The rod of church discipline must be applied to
          offenders, that they may be reclaimed, and others warned. Are you
          magistrates? The rod which God has put into your hands may be a means
          of preserving young malefactors from the gibbet at a more advanced
          period of life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Are you wise? Beware of turning aside unto folly, that you may never
          need the rod. Are you fools? Learn wisdom, or do not blame those whom
          duty and charity will oblige to use the rod for your correction. Is it
          not better that you should be treated by your superiors with love, and
          in the spirit of meekness, than to be beaten with the rod?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Are you obliged, for your faults, to undergo the pains of church
          censure, or criminal law? Kiss the rod, and sin no more, lest a worse
          thing come unto you. Have you formerly endured the rod? Let the
          impressions and effects of it abide with you for life, lest the sword
          of divine vengeance be unsheathed against you, because you refused to
          hear the voice of the rod and him who has appointed it.

          yourself."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          There are many cases in which a fool is to be heard, and not answered
          at all. When a scorner reviles us, it is needless to reprove him for
          it. For he is a dog, and the best way you can deal with him, is to let
          him bark until he ceases of his own accord — if you cast a stone at
          him, he will only follow you the longer and bark the more furiously.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When Rabshakeh railed at Hezekiah, and blasphemed the God of Israel,
          the servants of Hezekiah were expressly forbidden by their master to
          answer him a word, for he knew that an answer would only produce some
          blasphemous reply. Our Lord himself often kept silence when
          impertinent questions were asked of him. He was well acquainted with
          all the secrets of wisdom, and, if he had spoken, his words would have
          been the fittest that could be spoken in these cases — but silence
          was, in his infallible judgment, fitter than any answer that his
          perfect wisdom could make.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But must this be a rule for us in every case? Should not the multitude
          of words be answered; and when the fool mocks, shall no man make him
          ashamed? In many cases it is very fit that a fool's words should be
          answered — only you must take care in answering not to imitate him. If
          he speaks unreasonable, profane, peevish, or passionate words — then
          you must not answer him in his own style. You are angry at him for his
          folly, and reprove him for the extravagance of his behavior — and
          therefore you cannot but confess that yourselves are worthy of a very
          sharp reproof, if you behave like him at the very time that you are
          testifying your displeasure at his conduct. You cannot allege that his
          passionate manner of speaking and acting will justify you in behaving
          passionately. For if one fire kindled from Hell burns so fiercely, and
          threatens to devour everything that comes in its way, why should
          another fire be lighted from it to do still greater harm?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It does not befit the followers of Jesus to return railing for
          railing, or one angry word for another — but in whatever manner others
          talk, our tongues ought still to be governed by the law of meekness
          and charity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are no cases in which this rule is more frequently transgressed
          than in religious disputes. Passion and railing, when they are
          employed in the support of truth, appear to many to be just
          expressions of Christian zeal; and that noble and necessary grace of
          humility has been brought into suspicion, and regarded with a very
          jealous eye, by reason of those who have substituted passion in its
          place, and called it by a name to which it is as well entitled as the
          prince of darkness is to be called an angel of light.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Scripture enjoins Christians to instruct opposers in meekness. It
          declares expressly that the wrath of man works not the righteousness
          of God; and it informs us that Michael, that great prince among the
          heavenly hosts, dared not bring a railing accusation against Satan.

        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          When we answer a fool, we must give him the answer which his folly
          deserves and requires. If you do not answer him at all, other men may
          believe that he is in the right, and where there is any danger of
          that, the edification of your neighbors calls upon you to show the
          folly of what he has said. Besides, if he is not answered, he will
          conclude that you cannot answer him, and his vanity and self-conceit
          will be increased by your silence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The fool when he is not answered, will conclude that his cause is
          good. For although prudence binds up your tongue from speaking in the
          ears of a fool — yet there is no man who reckons himself less a fool
          than he, when he is not baffled in argument. It will be doing a good
          piece of service to the world, and to the fool himself, if you can
          answer him according to his folly, so as to humble his vanity, and
          make him ashamed of himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord triumphed by his wisdom over his insolent enemies. When they
          blamed him for curing distressed people on the Sabbath day, he exposed
          their self-inconsistency and inhumanity, to the conviction of the
          people, and their own shame. When Pilate insolently pretended to a
          sovereign power of life and death, and thereby entrenched on the
          prerogatives of the God of Heaven, our Lord (who did not open his
          mouth, because he knew it was to no purpose, to vindicate his own
          injured character,) gave his assuming judge an answer which reminded
          him who he was but a man.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us seek wisdom from God, that we may know when we should speak,
          and when we should be silent; and that we may be preserved from
          speaking such things as are improper for the mouths of saints, and
          taught to give an answer with meekness and prudence to the words of
          wise men or fools, as occasion requires.

          It would be very ridiculous in a man when he sends a servant on an
          errand, to cut off his feet, and disable him from doing that business
          in which he was employing him. It is equally foolish to employ an
          unwise or unfaithful man in a business of importance. For he is like a
          man whose feet are cut off, for any good he can be expected to do, and
          his employer not only meets with damage in his affairs — but he drinks
          damage in great abundance, losing his reputation for sense, and

          This proverb, like many others of those who were copied out by

          A lame man is very awkward in his manner of walking. But a fool
          appears with a still worse grace, when he presumes to talk of subjects
          beyond his reach, or to speak in praise of those virtues to which he
          is a total stranger in his practice. A clown would be laughed at, if
          he were to talk about wisdom and knowledge. It would fill a person
          with indignation, to hear a thief speak in praise of justice, a
          drunkard commend temperance, or a hypocrite talk in praise of
          holiness. Our tongues and our lives must be of a piece, otherwise all
          our professions will serve no other purpose but to condemn ourselves,
          and to procure us a portion in the eternal world with hypocrites. A
          grave and wise sentence befits the mouth of a wise and holy man. It is
          very unfitting in a Christian to be silent on occasions when he is
          called to glorify God or edify men. It is still more unfitting in a
          saint, to allow himself on any occasion in foolish and vain talking.
          When open sinners profane the Scripture and religion, by their

          perfect in wisdom and goodness — but a uniformity of conduct in the
          general course of life is attainable. Although we cannot all run in
          the way of God's commandments, or mount up with wings as eagles — yet
          we may walk on with an even course in the way of holiness, showing an
          equal respect to those precepts which regard our speech, and to those

          expecting their favor, or hoping that our praise will induce them to
          respect their own honor in their manner of conduct — we only make them
          more arrogant and domineering, and swell that pride in their hearts
          which makes them insufferable to all about them.

          If those who have the disposal of high offices, bestow them upon
          undeserving men, they are only preparing disgrace and repentance for
          themselves — as king Ahasuerus found to his great vexation, when he
          was deceived so far by that wicked minister whom he had foolishly
          advanced, that he ignorantly signed a death-warrant for his much
          beloved queen and her whole nation.

          Men cannot search the hearts of their fellow creatures, and if they
          are the means of advancing some to public offices who disappoint the
          hopes that were entertained of them, they cannot help it. But we can
          form some <i>probable opinions </i>of the dispositions of men from
          their behavior, and ought to do so, before we take any share in
          placing them in those stations where they are likely to do much good
          or much hurt.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Besides, we should pray to the Searcher of hearts to direct our
          judgments on all such occasions, as we find the disciples did in the
          choice of an apostle. Without consideration and prayer, we run a great
          risk of sharing in other men's sins, when we contribute to the
          elevation of men to places, where, if they are fools, they will find
          great scope for their folly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But does not God himself often give honor to fools? Yes. But who are
          you, O man, who questions God? God is the absolute sovereign of the
          world, and is not bound to give an account of any of his matters. He
          is the judge of nations, who has a right to punish men by subjecting
          them to the power of fools. He is the infinitely wise God, who brings
          good out of evil.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must be holy, as God is holy — but we must not pretend to claim the
          prerogatives of <i>sovereignty</i>, because God alone is the sovereign
          of the world. Our business is to acquiesce in the disposals of God, to
          adore where we cannot comprehend him, and to regulate our conduct not
          by his secret will — but his revealed will. We are thereby taught that
          wicked men ought to be despised in our eyes, and that we must honor
          those who fear the Lord.

        <p align="justify">
          Wise and holy sayings, especially on deep and mysterious subjects, are
          not only improper for the mouth of fools — but often hurtful to
          themselves and others. They are like thorns, or sharp-pointed weapons
          in the hands of drunkards — which wound the hands that hold them, and
          may be used to wound others who happen to be in company with them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Proverbs have sometimes been hurtful even in the mouths of wise men,
          through the imperfection of their wisdom. Job's friends dealt much in
          proverbs, which they had learned by tradition from their wise
          ancestors — but they <i>misapplied </i>them to the case of Job.
          Although they meant to plead the cause of God — yet they displeased
          him so much by their uncharitable speeches against Job, which they
          drew by unjust inference, from undoubted truths, that he told them
          they had not spoken the thing that was right concerning him, as his
          servant Job had done. If Job had not been a strong believer, their
          management of truth must have sunk him into despondency.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If wise and holy men have done hurt to themselves and others, by
          meddling with proverbs beyond their capacity, or by unjust comments
          upon them — then what harm may a fool do by dealing in them! When he
          speaks of the wonderful mercy of God, he will praise it at the expense
          of divine justice, and maim the attributes of God by dashing them one
          against another. When he speaks of the necessity and beauty of
          holiness, he will bestow on it a part of that glory which is due to
          Christ. When be speaks of the efficacy of the atonement, he will
          insinuate encouragements to sin into the minds of his hearers. Every
          doctrine will be perverted by his management.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Or, if he speaks correctly and properly on any religious subject — yet
          the <i>inconsistency of his life with his words</i>, will bring
          suspicions to the harm of truth into the minds of those who converse
          with him. And if he shows the true way to heaven — and yet takes the
          road to Hell — those who pay any regard to him, will be disposed to
          think that the way in which he chooses to <i>walk </i>is preferable in
          his eyes, to that of which he only <i>talks</i>.

          From this proverb we learn, that all ministers of the gospel must be
          men of knowledge, soundness in the faith, and a pious conduct. Without
          the former qualities, they cannot handle the Word of God in an
          edifying manner, and may harm precious souls.
          <i

          </i>
          Christians ought to have their speech seasoned with salt. Knowledge of
          sound doctrine is necessary to furnish their lips with this kind of
          discourse. And their practice must correspond with their words,
          otherwise they make themselves, and, perhaps, their profession
          likewise, to be abhorred.

          the parable concerning the talents, where he tells us, that the man
          who had received but one talent was punished, not for spending it in
          riot and dissipation — but for hiding it in a napkin. Those that have
          been eminent transgressors, that have rebelled against the light, and
          stifled the loud clamors of their consciences, and led others in the
          way of sin — shall be repaid in proportion to the greatness and

          impenitent, shall receive from God that recompense of his error which

          It is a terrible thing to provoke the wrath of a prince — but who
          knows the power of God's anger? According to his fear — so is his
          wrath. God is the Creator of all things, and he made all things for
          himself — and will not allow his creatures to frustrate his purpose of
          glory to his own name. Rational creatures may abuse the gifts of
          reason to the dishonor of the Almighty — but if he is not glorified in
          the obedience of his laws — then he will be glorified in the execution
          of the penalties denounced in them against transgressors, who shall be
          punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,
          and from the glory of his power.

        <p align="justify">
          Revenging justice belongs to the great Creator. He punished sin even
          in his own beloved Son, who never knew sin. For the Lord made the
          iniquities of all his people to meet in Christ — and he was oppressed
          and afflicted, and bruised, and put to unspeakable grief. He pardons
          no sin to any man, that was not first punished in Christ. If the great
          God dealt in this solemn manner with his own Son, and with his chosen
          people in the person of their surety — then how can impenitent and
          hardened sinners escape the damnation of Hell? They sometimes indulge
          hopes that the God who made them will not finally destroy them — but
          their obligations to God as their <i>Creator </i>and <i>Preserver</i>,
          make their sins inexcusable — and therefore he who made them will not
          have mercy upon them.

          oath are a plain evidence that the glorious mercy of the Lord will not
          exempt the obstinate sinner from punishment, who goes on still in his
          trespasses. To those who are found unbelieving and impenitent, the
          precious displays of grace will at last be like rivers of oil to

          When the wicked hear of the vengeance of the great Creator against
          themselves, they are sometimes startled, and in some degree convinced
          of the necessity of reformation. Therefore they will stop short in
          their wicked course, and forbear those gross sins which press hard
          upon their consciences, and, like Herod, do many things which they are
          commanded to do, that they may obtain some ease to their minds, and
          reputation among saints. But unless their nature is renewed by the
          grace of the Spirit, which turns dogs into sheep — their hearts are
          still much the same as formerly. Their awakened consciences resist sin
          — but their <i>love </i>to it is not diminished. For the most part,

          The sight of a dog returning to his vomit is very loathsome — but it
          is much more detestable for the wicked to return to their former
          wickedness. Nothing is more dishonoring to God, or insulting to his
          majesty; nothing is more hurtful to the souls of men, and especially
          of the sinner himself. For if any man draws back, it is to perdition
          of the most terrible kind. Impenitent sinners, who never showed any
          disposition to repent, shall be severely punished — but not as
          severely as those who, after they have known and tried the way of
          righteousness, have turned aside from the holy commandment delivered
          unto them. The reproach which they cast upon God, as if iniquity were
          to be found in him, is intolerably provoking. God, in righteous
          judgment, allows the devil, when he returns into these wretches, to
          take with him seven devils, and the last, state of that man becomes
          worse than the first.

          Solomon published many proverbs against slothfulness in his own
          edition of this book. The men of Hezekiah repeat some of them, and
          join some others to them on the same subject. The slothful man is
          reduced to such pitiful shifts for <i>excusing </i>his conduct, that
          he says, contrary to all reason and experience, that there is a lion
          roaming the streets, and that he may be killed in the very streets of

          This sign of sloth is in nothing more observable than in the

          of Christ, who regarded neither the bulls of Bashan, nor the lions of
          the pit, in working out their salvation. But when we make religion our
          smallest concern — then a frown, or a jeer, or a few drops of rain,
          will be a sufficient reason to us for declining the most important
          services. We should remember that

          clothes is a dreadful and intolerable toil. But when every part of his
          body is wearied with the fatigue of lying and turning, he slowly goes
          to his clothes, and with great difficulty gets them thrown about him,
          and perhaps necessity or weariness drives him to some kind of work.
          But still he is like a door moving upon its hinges, for he only
          trifles about the most serious affairs, and the night finds his work
          in much the same state as the morning.

          In this manner do sluggards trifle and sleep, not only in the things
          that concern their present happiness — but in things of solemn and
          eternal consequence. As if they could work out their salvation with
          faint wishes, and spiritless endeavors — their hearts sleep when they
          are calling on God for the pardon of their sins. When they come to
          church, the words of the preacher are forgotten almost as soon as they
          are heard. It is ten to one, that their pew serves for a bed to them.
          And, as if the devil had given them some opium on the Sabbath morning,
          they can scarcely be awakened out of their sleep by the united voices
          of the congregation in the praises of God.

          As drunkards and gluttons enjoy less pleasure it eating and drinking
          than the sober and temperate — so the sluggard never enjoys that sweet
          and delightful sleep by which the laborer is refreshed. For his excess
          in this bodily indulgence, makes his slumbers broken and interrupted;
          nor can he taste that pleasure in eating which other men enjoy, for
          although he could procure meat without work, eating is a toil to him.

          Greece put together. The wisdom of Chalcol and Darda, and Ethan and
          Heman, and Solomon, in one man, could not convince him of his folly.
          "What," says he, "if I should go forth to work in such a sultry day, I
          might catch a headache; and an headache cost the Shunamite's son his
          life. If I should expose myself to the terrible cold of winter, I
          might catch a cold which would bring on a fever or a consumption. For
          cold is the beginning of almost all diseases; and what is a little
          worldly gain compared to one's health or life? Is not a life of ease
          and tranquility incomparably better, though attended with poverty —
          than a life of toil and anxiety with riches?"

        <p align="justify">
          These and the like reasons for his behavior, appear to him
          demonstrations, and his disease is incurable, because he cannot be
          made to believe that he is sick. Self conceit never fails to attend
          spiritual sloth. For it prevents the receiving of those instructions

          Kings were commanded by Moses to read the Bible with care, that their

          in the Scripture, of the great need to mortify pride — but the
          sluggard never learned them, or will not take the trouble of thinking
          upon them. He has perhaps heard or read, that wisdom's ways are
          pleasantness, and from thence concludes that they are fools who are at
          the pains to enter into the strait gate, or walk in the narrow way. He
          expects, by the gift of grace, to obtain Heaven, as well as the most
          laborious Christian. He thinks himself a far happier and wiser man,
          than those who work out their salvation with fear and trembling. None
          are more foolish than those who have the highest opinion of their own
          wisdom. Those only are truly wise, whose understandings and wills are
          regulated by the wisdom and will of God, revealed in his word.

          A gossip is one who tells stories which ought not to be told, whether

          and the extent of that harm which may be justly charged upon them, or
          the <i>misery </i>they are heaping up for themselves — for they shall

          been attended with anguish and self-reflections a thousand times more
          grievous than anything that Mordecai could have felt if Haman's malice
          had been accomplished on him. Here is encouragement for the faith and
          patience of the saints, Here is ground for the highest praise to the
          righteousness of God.

          It might be expected that when a man has wronged his neighbor, by his
          lies or flatteries — he would be filled with remorse, and try to make
          some reparation. But the loss is, that he judges of other men from
          himself; he does not believe that there is enough of generosity in any
          man to forgive him, and therefore persists in his hatred. It is not
          easy for us to forgive the injuries we <i>receive</i> — but it is far
          more difficult to forgive the injuries we <i>do. </i>

          Flatterers are the worst kind of liars, and the most likely to be
          believed, because self-love favors their deceits. Flatterers are
          commonly men who intend to <i>betray with a kiss</i>. But, although
          they should only design to gain our favor by their fair speeches — yet
          they are very corrupting, because they are the friends of our pride,
          which is the worst of our bosom enemies.
