            "Better is a dry morsel, with peace and quiet, than an house full of
            sacrifices with strife."</b
          >
          Solomon expresses the most delicious entertainments by the word
          <i>sacrifices</i>, intimating his hope, that none would presume to
          offer unto God a sacrifice, but of the best of their cattle — for the
          best of beings is to be honored with the best that we can give him.
          The meat of the peace-offerings was a feast for the family and friends
          of the offerer — and there could not be a more delightful feast, when
          piety and friendship gave a relish to the entertainment.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          But the sumptuous provisions are turned into gall and wormwood by
          strife — while the bitterest things are made sweet by love and
          friendship. Solomon has already given us the instruction contained in
          this verse. But it is useful to have it still before our eyes, for
          peace and friendship are not only <i>the balm of life</i> — but of
          great importance in our pious course. Strife is productive of
          innumerable sins, and renders us unfit for the duties we owe to God,
          as well as those of our various relationships. Love and peace make
          every service to our families and friends pleasant, and prepare us to
          lift up holy hands to God, without malice or anger.

        A poor situation does not disqualify men from obtaining and using
        wisdom, nor from enjoying the honors and benefits of it. Nor will an
        elevated rank support men in folly, or hinder them from feeling its
        mischievous effects.

        <p align="justify">
          A poor wise man is too often despised — but it is only by the unwise;
          for those who have wisdom set a high value upon it, <i>wherever </i>it
          is found, and honor the poorest person who possesses it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is perhaps owing to the partiality, and not the wisdom of parents,
          that this proverb has not been more frequently verified in the letter.
          Children that are a shame to their parents, have sometimes brought
          disgrace upon themselves, from those who once loved them with a tender
          affection, and still love them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Reuben was the beginning of Jacob's strength — and yet he lost his
          dignity to his younger brother Joseph, who, according to the customs
          of those times, was to be in some degree under his government. But
          even when partiality prevails over reason in the behavior of parents —
          folly, by its native consequences, and the just providence of God,
          does often reduce men from honor and wealth — to poverty and disgrace,
          and place them below those over whom they once tyrannized.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wisdom exalts servants from poverty to wealth, or even to power.
          Joseph was a slave in Potiphar's house, and then a prisoner — but he
          was made lord over Potiphar himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Servants have often for their wisdom, shared in the inheritance.
          Solomon himself married his daughters to two of his own subjects.
          Jarha, an Egyptian servant, was taken into the family of his master,
          and became the head of a family in Israel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This verse gives parents a proper hint about the distribution of their
          estates, and directs those who have the disposal of places of trust,
          to pay a greater regard to <i>wisdom </i>and <i>integrity</i> — than
          to high birth, or great estates, or the connections of friendship and
          kindred.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How <i>excellent is wisdom</i>, which raises the slave from grinding
          at the mill, and the beggar from the dunghill — to places of
          distinction, and to the truest honors, because they are the pure
          fruits of goodness! How <i>miserable a thing is folly</i>, which
          degrades the high, and brings misery upon the latter days of those who
          flourished like green bay-trees in the prime of their life!

          >"The refining-pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold — but the
          Lord tries the hearts!"</b
        >
        As the fire tries metals, and separates the dross from them — so the
        Lord tries the hearts of men. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and he
        perfectly discerns all the secrets of the heart.
        <p align="justify">
          Men are too often <i>strangers to themselves</i>, and mistake the
          principles by which they are governed — but God is greater than our
          hearts, and every thought is naked and open to his eyes. He
          <i>knows </i> our words before they are pronounced by the mouth, and
          our <i>imaginations </i>before they are framed in our minds. This is
          God's prerogative.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is not a greater folly among those corrupters of Christianity,
          the Roman Catholics, than their practice of praying to saints and
          angels. You, Lord, even you alone, know the hearts of all men, and
          therefore ought to be feared, and to receive all religious homage.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is vain for men to worship God with the lips, while the heart is
          removed from him; nor will our good deeds to our fellow-men be
          accepted by God, when they do not proceed from a principle of love.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This proverb may likewise be understood of those solemn providences by
          which his people are tried, as gold and silver are tried by the fire.
          Afflictions and calamities are like a furnace which God has in
          Jerusalem, by which dross is revealed, and purged away. But herein God
          reveals his kindness — that he does not keep his gold in the fire
          until it is entirely free from the dross, for if such a furious heat
          were applied to it as is requisite to make metals entirely pure, it
          would be altogether destroyed. "I have refined you," says he, "but not
          with silver; I have chosen you (or made you a choice vessel) in the
          furnace of affliction."

          wicked man listens to evil lips; a liar pays attention to a malicious
          tongue." </b
        >Solomon has often warned us against compliance with temptation; and
        every godly man will surely follow his advice. He is a wicked man who
        gives heed to evil lips. Wicked men have a great treasury of evil in
        their hearts — and yet have not enough to satisfy their own corrupt
        dispositions. They are like covetous men, in whom their large
        possessions only increase their lust of having, and therefore they carry
        on a trade with other wicked men, who are able to add to their store of
        iniquity, by flattering and counseling them in sin. Their heart gathers
        iniquity to itself, not merely by its own corrupt imaginations and
        contrivances — but by hearing the devilish lessons of those who have
        made a greater proficiency in that wisdom which comes from below. They
        are blessed who hunger and thirst after righteousness — but cursed are
        those who add drunkenness to thirst in the service of sin, for they
        shall be filled with their own devices.
        <p align="justify">
          By hearkening to the wicked instructions of Jezebel, Ahab destroyed
          himself and his house; and the political advices of Jonadab proved no
          less fatal to the apparent heir of David. A liar is a wicked man, and
          gives ear to an evil tongue, for by the lies of other men he increases
          his own stock, and is enabled to retail his abominable stories better.
          He can say that he gives the story as he heard it, (although he has no
          scruple to make some additions), and thinks this a sufficient
          justification of himself; if the falsehood of what he has told is
          detected. A man shows himself to be a liar and slanderer, when he
          gives too easy belief to bad stories, that he may have the barbarous
          satisfaction of spreading them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          An honest man will not wound his neighbor's character, by trusting the
          words of a talebearer, and divulging what may very possibly be false.
          And even when there is too much ground for believing the report, he
          will be backward to spread it any farther, without some good reason.

          over disaster will not go unpunished." </b
        >It is our indispensable duty to compassionate the poor, and if
        Providence puts it in our power, to relieve them. Yet some are so
        destitute of affection, that they will trample them lower in the dust,
        by insult and oppression. The reason why poor men are more exposed than
        the rich to reproach, is, because they are supposed incapable of taking
        revenge. But it ought to be remembered, that they are showing contempt
        for their Maker. If God should appear in human shape, would we dare to
        insult him? Would not the fear of a just and dreadful vengeance deter
        us? And to mock the poor, amounts to the very same thing.
        <p align="justify">
          God did actually appear in our nature, and he was then poor for our
          sakes; and those who despise the poor, despise them for a reason that
          reflects upon our Savior himself when he dwelt among us. Poor
          Christians are members of his body, and every injury done to them, he
          considers as done to himself. The <i>principle </i>of this proverb
          extends to all people that are despised, or held up to ridicule, on
          account of any defect of body or mind, or misfortune in circumstances.
          When we are what God made us, and meet with calamities from the
          appointment of providence, every indignity or affront offered us
          reflects upon our Maker.

          Christ wept for the miseries that were to befall his implacable
          enemies for their cruelty to himself. We find the people of God
          rejoicing and praising God at the destruction of their enemies — but
          their satisfaction was caused, not by any pleasure in the miseries of
          their enemies — but by the discoveries of God's mercy to themselves,
          and the vindication of his righteousness, by the infliction of
          deserved punishment on the irreconcilable enemies of God. A savage
          delight in the misery of enemies, is often represented in Scripture as
          the temper of the worst of men, who thereby expose themselves to
          signal divine vengeance!

          >"Children's children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the
          pride of their children."</b
        >
        Children are the means of preserving the name of their parents when they
        are dead. And while they are alive, it is their delight and honor to be
        surrounded with descendants, except when they are so unnatural to the
        instruments of their being, as to disgrace them by their evil ways. When
        people are now on the verge of the grave, and everything else becomes
        insipid to them, their children's children are a great comfort, and
        procure them much respect, when they are trained up in the way wherein
        they should go.
        <p align="justify">
          Old men are therefore bound to give thanks to God for giving and
          sparing to them a posterity on the earth. "I had not thought," said
          Jacob to his beloved son, "to see your face again — and lo, God has
          showed me your children also."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Children are a heritage from the Lord, and ought to be instructed in
          his ways, that parents may have pleasure in them, and in their young
          families, when the days come wherein they would otherwise be obliged
          to say, "We have no pleasure in them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It was a custom among the Romans, for men that wanted sons, to adopt
          young men, and give them the title and privileges of sons, that their
          name might not die with themselves. Christians to whom God has denied,
          or from whom he has taken away the blessing of children, may find a
          better method of having some to be their crown and glory. If, by their
          holy example and pious converse, they win souls to Christ, these shall
          be their crown of rejoicing in the day of Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some children are so destitute of natural affection, that they care
          not how soon their parents die — that they may enjoy their estates,
          and become masters of their own actions. These are profane people like
          Esau, who thought he would have it in his power to kill Jacob, when
          Isaac, who was now an old man, was dead.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Dutiful children will think it an ornament to them to have their aged
          parents still alive, even when their poverty and weakness make it the
          duty of their children to labor for their support.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But are parents of every kind a glory to their children? The hoary
          head is <i>not always </i>a crown of glory to the man that wears it,
          or to his family — but only when it is found in the way of
          righteousness. The seed of the righteous are respected for the sake of
          their parents by godly men, and even God himself has a regard to them.

          Truly there is a reward to the righteous, which extends to their
          families and posterity. Righteousness children are a crown to their
          parents, and parents are a glory to their children; and therefore we
          ought not only to practice — but to promote and maintain it among our
          families.

        Fools make themselves ridiculous, by affecting to speak of things beyond
        their reach, or to use language too high for their abilities. For a
        wicked man to talk like a Christian, is equally unseemly. When a
        <i>covetous </i>man talks in praise of liberality, or a
        <i>hypocrite </i>commends the integrity of David — they condemn
        themselves. For a beggar who wears rags to put upon his head the crown
        of a Duke, is ridiculous, because the agreement of things to one another
        is requisite to the beauty and propriety of anything. Professions of
        religion joined to wicked practices, are equally absurd.
        <p align="justify">
          In nothing is consistency to be more studied than in ordering our
          <i>words </i>and <i>conduct</i>. When a wicked man has the tongue of a
          saint, he discredits religion, and brings suspicion upon truly pious
          men. The profane world will say, "Do you hear how finely that man
          talks? And yet he can take the advantage of his neighbor in a bargain!
          They are all alike, and their profession's are but nets to catch the
          unthinking."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Good words will do no good to a bad man — but aggravate his
          condemnation; out of his own mouth shall he be judged. They are not
          acceptable to God. As Christ would not allow devils to make
          confessions of faith, even when their doctrine was sound — so God will
          not allow the hypocrite to take his covenant into his lips, because
          such a holy thing is polluted when it comes into the mouth of filthy
          dogs!

        <p align="justify">
          Lying lips are no less fitting in the mouth of a prince, who ought to
          honor the dignity of his station by the dignity of truth. A prince of
          our own is said to have frequently used this proverbial saying, "He
          who knows not how to dissemble, knows not how to reign." You may judge
          from the text before us, whether he deserved to be called the Solomon
          of his age.

        <p align="justify">
          It was certainly a nobler saying of one of the kings of France — that
          if truth were banished from all the rest of the world, it ought to be
          found in the hearts of princes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When a young prince asked a certain philosopher to give him a
          <i>directory for his conduct</i>, all his instructions were comprised
          in one sentence, <i>"Remember that you are a king's son!" </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          All Christians are advanced to spiritual honors of the most exalted
          kind. They are the children of God, and heirs of the eternal kingdom —
          and ought to resemble their heavenly Father, who is the God of
          holiness. Their dignity obliges them to a behavior worthy of it, and
          of Him whose grace has conferred it.
        </p>

        <i>Gifts </i>have a very strong influence in gaining love. They are like
        precious stones in the eyes of those who receive them, charming their
        eyes, and powerfully turning their affections to the giver. The

        the wise and the benevolent, as well as of the foolish and selfish.

          It was a sign of Abigail's prudence to meet David with generous
          presents, as well as a persuasive speech, when he was coming in fierce
          resentment to extirpate her husband's family. And when Jacob met his
          incensed brother, he not only endeavored to pacify him by submissive
          words — but also loaded him with noble gifts, which were perhaps the
          most effectual means, (next to Jacob's prayers), to regain his lost
          friendship.

          Such is the efficacy of gifts, that God expressly forbids them to be

          the words of the righteous.

          pearls and diamonds! Surely they must have a constraining influence
          upon every heart that is not harder than the nether millstone. "Thanks

          >"He who covers over an offense promotes love, but whoever repeats the
          matter separates close friends."</b
        >
        As we are required to love our neighbors as ourselves, so we ought to
        promote love in the world, and to seek the love of other men to
        ourselves. It is a duty that befits the followers of Christ, to be
        concerned whether we are loved by our neighbors or not. We should not be
        careless whether they obeyed God and performed their duty, or lived in
        the neglect of it. Whatever things are lovely, are to be minded and
        practiced by us; and nothing is more lovely than to cover transgressions
        — as nothing is more hateful than the repeating of them.
        <p align="justify">
          To cover our own transgressions, like Adam, would be very dangerous —
          but we have the noblest examples to recommend to us the
          <i> covering of other men's faults</i>. How lovely was the behavior of
          our Redeemer, when he excused the lazy behavior of his three disciples
          in the garden of Gethsemane, and when he bestowed such high
          commendations on their fidelity in his discourse with them, and his
          prayers to his Father, although he knew that they would soon forsake
          him in his sufferings, and make the best shift they could for
          themselves! Nor was his goodness confined to his Apostles; he excused
          even his murderers, when he prayed to his Father for their
          forgiveness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Who is like unto the Lord our God, who covers our iniquities by his
          pardoning mercy, and removes them as far from us as the east is from
          the west! Surely <i>his pardoning mercy to us — </i>must mightily
          persuade us to cover the offences of our fellow sinners by the mantle
          of charity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Love covers all sins. Paul teaches us how this is done, and our
          self-love may give us much light and direction on this point. Had we a
          love to our neighbors like that which we bear to ourselves — we would
          not be ready to observe their faults, unless they were very glaring.
          We would make much allowance for the temptations that seduced them,
          and consider how liable we ourselves are to fall before temptation. We
          would not keep our eyes fixed upon their faults — but consider
          likewise what there is in them to provoke us to love. We would not be
          harsh in reproving, nor backward in forgiving them. Nor would any
          consideration provoke us to cast in their teeth those old faults that
          seemed to be forgotten.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By such a behavior as this, love is sought and gained. Was it possible
          that Joseph's brethren, as cruel as they had been, could refuse their
          love to him, after the apologies that he so kindly made for their
          faults?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But he who follows the contrary method of behavior seeks hatred, and
          alienates the affections of the most cordial friends from one another.
          The censorious man, the tale-bearer, the person that revives old
          quarrels — is a mortal enemy to love; a faithful servant of the
          accuser of the brethren; an enemy to him who is our peace with God and
          with one another. If such dreadful punishments are threatened to those
          who are destitute of love — then what shall be the portion of those
          who scatter the seed of enmity and discord through a whole town, by
          the stories they tell, and by the lies and misrepresentations which
          they mingle with their idle tales!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The meaning of this proverb must not be stretched into a prohibition
          of punishments or censures necessary to be inflicted on offenders, or
          of friendly reproofs — all which are recommended in other places of
          this book.

          >"A rebuke impresses a man of discernment more than a hundred </b
        >lashes <b>a fool."</b> The wise man gives us many marks by which fools
        may be distinguished from wise men; and does not insist more on any of
        them, than the different uses they make of rebukes and correction. He
        not only tells us that the wise man hears rebuke, and the fool scorns it
        — but that one rebuke will have a better effect on a wise man, than an
        hundred lashes on a fool.
        <p align="justify">
          Fools have sometimes received correction, and made a good use of it —
          but they were fools no longer, for the rod and reproof gave them
          wisdom. But it is a sign that folly is deeply ingrained, when a
          hundred rods leave men as great fools as they found them. Wicked men
          have uncircumcised ears, and they cannot hear the word of the Lord.
          They also have hard hearts, and the works of God, in which he speaks
          louder than in words, leave no impression on them. On the contrary, we
          often find them walking contrary unto God, and making their faces
          harder by those means that should have wrought the very opposite
          effect.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Ahaz</p></i>, in the time of his distress,
        trespassed yet more and more against the Lord.
        <i> <p align="justify">David</p></i>was of a very opposite spirit; and
        when Nathan said unto him, "You are the man!" he replied, "I have sinned
        against the Lord!" and immediately composed the fifty-first psalm, to
        testify his deep repentance to the church, and to every generation of
        mankind.
        <p align="justify">
          We must not be so strict in trying other men by this mark of wisdom,
          as ourselves, for
          <i>wise men are not wise in every piece of their behavior</i>. Asa's
          heart was perfect with the Lord his God all his days — and yet he was
          very angry with a prophet for giving him a just reproof in the name of
          the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But such is not the ordinary temper of God's people, for God takes the
          heart of stone away from them, and gives them hearts of flesh, and
          they have the Spirit of God dwelling within them, who opens their ears
          to discipline, and seals their instruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is good to have tender hearts susceptible of impressions from
          reproof, and from the providence of God. As a lively faith will enable
          the Christian to bear the greatest trials, so a tender conscience will
          enable him to derive spiritual improvement from the gentlest
          afflictions — which are not to be despised, because they come to us
          with a message from God.

          This text likewise teaches us to make a difference, according to the
          dispositions of men, in the reproofs or chastisements that we are
          called to dispense unto men. <i>Eli </i>reproved his children with
          words, when they deserved an hundred stripes, if the law had allowed
          it. On the other hand, some parents provoke their children to wrath,
          instead of reforming them, by their severities.

        Some of the wicked are very pestilent members of society, who, casting
        off all fear of God and the king, employ themselves in those wicked
        courses which expose them to the vengeance of the laws, so that the
        messengers of justice must be employed in their disagreeable task of
        punishment for the benefit and peace of society.
        <p align="justify">
          But others of the wicked have some fear of the king, although they
          have no fear of God before their eyes. Their corrupt dispositions take
          another course, which exposes them to equal danger, though from a
          different quarter. Their employment is to carry weapons against
          <i> the omnipotent King of the world</i>, and they pursue their
          rebellious courses without intermission! There is much iniquity in
          their <i>actions</i>, there is a world of iniquity in their
          <i>tongues</i>, and the imaginations of the thoughts of their hearts
          are only evil continually. They are blind, and know not what they are
          doing! While they think they are only gratifying their own
          dispositions, and making use of their liberty — they are provoking
          God, by a continued course of disobedience to his will. A merciless
          official shall be sent against these rebels; for rebellion is as the
          sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.

        <p align="justify">
          God has innumerable messengers of justice, for every instrument of
          vengeance is at his command, and employed at his pleasure, to avenge
          his quarrel upon the breakers of his law. Beasts and men, diseases and
          death, angels and devils — are in arms at his call, to seize upon the
          criminals whom he means to punish. The weakest creature, considered as
          a messenger of the Almighty, is irresistible by transgressors!

          fought for Hezekiah against the Assyrians.

        <p align="justify">
          God sometimes employs merciless messengers to chastise his own people.
          When David numbered his subjects, 70,000 of them were destroyed in

        <p align="justify">
          If God takes such vengeance of the rebellions of some whom he pardons
          — then what will the end be of those who seek only rebellion! Let the
          wicked cast down their weapons of iniquity, and acquaint themselves
          with God, and be at peace with him through Jesus Christ. Otherwise
          they may expect that dreadful messenger of God, the
          <i>king of terrors</i>, to be sent against them, to plunge them into

        What a mercy is it that a fool is not always in his folly, under the
        irresistible impulse of domineering passions, driving on in his career
        of harm, without fearing God or regarding men! If a gracious providence
        did not rein the wicked of the world by a strong bridle, the world would
        become more uninhabitable than those jungles, where lions and bears are
        constantly prowling and destroying. No creature is fiercer than a bear

          Hushai thought he could not use a better argument to affright Absalom

        <p align="justify">
          And yet this animal in its greatest fury, is not so dangerous as a
          fool in the heat of passion. A bear in its rage makes no distinction
          between those who have robbed her and others — but falls upon anyone
          she sees, and tears him in pieces. Yet you may by escape from her, or
          secure yourself from her violence. But a fool in his folly will
          neither be reduced to reason by just reproofs, nor soothed by the
          mildest language — but behaves like the venomous adder, which will not
          be charmed by the wisest charmer.

        <i>Ingratitude </i>is one of the vilest sins, and gives a clear
        discovery of a disposition evil beyond expression; and the punishment of
        it shall be proportioned to the degree of its guilt. The ungrateful man
        brings evil, not only on himself — but likewise on his house. And this
        misery, which so great a sin procures, does not come like a stranger to
        the house, to tarry for a night — but takes up its residence, and abides
        in it forever.

          forever in fiercer flames than those to whom the grace of God has

        Nothing is more dangerous than <i>fire </i>or <i>water</i>, when they

        <p align="justify">
          When a breach is made in the bank that confines a huge body of water,
          the water seizes the opportunity, widens the breach more and more,
          pours itself forth in mighty currents, and gathering new force
          continually, it soon becomes altogether irresistible, breaks through
          every obstacle in its way, and sweeps along everything that meets it,
          with a violence which cannot be controlled.

        <p align="justify">
          Such are the dismal effects of contention, which might have been
          checked at the beginning — but gathers fury in its progress, and will
          soon lay desolate a man's peace, and credit, and comfort, and
          conscience, and hurry him on to speak and to act in such a manner as
          if he were altogether bereaved of his reason, and transformed into a
          raging bear!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The effects of quarrels do not always stop at the people with whom it
          begun. This <i>deluge </i>often sweeps away houses, and countries, and

          We must therefore endeavor to get out of contention, whenever we find

          But it is still better to leave off contention before it is started.
          The banks of rivers are more easily preserved, than repaired after a
          breach is made. To keep ourselves out of this
          <i>snare of the devil</i>, it is our duty to mortify every selfish
          disposition, to keep every passion under the government of sanctified
          reason, to avoid everything that may give offence, to be hesitant in
          conceiving offences against others; and in our dispositions, words,
          and actions, to observe that great rule of doing to others as we wish
          that others should do to us.

        <p align="justify">
          There are some cases in which <i>contending </i>is a duty. The
          apostles write unto us, and exhort us to contend earnestly for the
          faith which was once delivered to the saints. A
          <i>zeal for truth and holiness </i>is a necessary branch of Christian
          character. But in striving for the faith of the gospel, we must avoid
          the wrath of man, which works not the righteousness of God, and
          carefully preserve the holy fire of religious zeal, from mixture with
          that unhallowed fire of selfish passions which has so often usurped
          its name, and brought it into discredit with superficial observers.

        That condemning the just is a grievous crime, there is no doubt. But

          pleading the cause of the wicked in opposition to truth, or to that

          doctrines unscripturally rigid, making those things to be sinful,
          which are not condemned in the Word of God; or carrying the marks
          necessary to saving faith to a pitch too high to suit the generality
          of true Christians, or applying to particular people those terrors
          that do not justly belong to them. Such was the fault of Job's
          friends.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a mere dangerous error in preachers, to accommodate the
          characters of real Christians to many hypocrites by unsound
          representations of them, or to flatter the sinner into a false belief
          that he is a righteous man. By all these methods, righteousness is
          discouraged, and wickedness favored, in contradiction to the mind of
          God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God never condemns the righteous — but it is his peculiar glory to
          justify the ungodly, through the execution of the curse upon his
          righteous Son. In each of these divine transactions, the injustice
          condemned in our text is revealed to be detestable to God, for
          righteousness shines with more solemn splendor in the infliction of
          punishment upon our Surety, and in our absolution from guilt — than in
          the flames of the lake of fire and brimstone! God would not justify
          his own elect to the disparagement of his inflexible justice — but
          condemned all their sins, and punished them in Christ — and so he is
          just, and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus.

          >"Why is there in the hand of a fool the purchase price of wisdom,
          since he has no heart for it?"</b
        >
        If fools had no means of obtaining wisdom put into their hand, their
        folly would be excusable — but when they have a price allowed them for
        procuring wisdom — and yet have no heart to it, what apology can be made
        for them? Everything that gives us an opportunity of becoming wise, is a
        talent for which we must give account to our great Lord. Bibles, and
        divine ordinances, and time, and leisure, and wealth, which enables us
        to furnish in greater abundance the means of knowledge — are a price put
        into our hands to get wisdom, and if we use them not to this valuable
        end, we despise the riches of God's goodness, and act like unreasonable
        creatures. Nay, the basest animals reprove us, for the stork and the
        crane observe their seasons for flying to warmer climates; and the ants,
        though a feeble people, never neglect the gainful business of the summer
        and harvest.
        <p align="justify">
          How is the fool so stupid as to neglect such important business as the
          gaining of wisdom, and trifle away his time and talents in vanity?
          Surely if he were informed of a rich inheritance to be gotten on easy
          terms, he would show a proper regard to his own interest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Does he not know that wisdom is infinitely more precious than land or
          gold? No, this is the reason of his carelessness. He has no heart or
          desire for wisdom — he knows not its value, and has no relish of its
          pleasures. That which is more precious than rubies — is to him more
          worthless than a pebble. That which is more sweet than honey — is as
          tasteless as the white of an egg to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is this price, then, put into his hand in vain? To himself it is worse
          than in vain. Every means of wisdom shall prove galling to his
          remembrance, when his eyes are opened — for opened they shall be at
          last, to discern the glory of that which he despised. The worm that is
          to prey upon him forever, will be continually fed by the recollection
          of sermons despised, and days wasted in idleness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But this price will not be lost to those who put it into the hands of
          the fool; for their generous endeavors to turn the foolish to the
          wisdom of the just, will be as graciously rewarded as the more
          successful attempts of others to serve their generation. Nor will God
          be a loser of glory by the self-ruining folly of sinners — but his
          <i>justice </i> will forever triumph in the revenges executed upon the
          despisers of his patience and grace.

          >"A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity." </b
        >There are many false friends who <i> profess love </i>for their own
        advantage — and reveal their insincerity when they have no more ground
        to hope that their selfish interests will be served by it. There are
        <i>fickle friends </i>who love for a time, and grow indifferent to our
        interests, without any reason but their own inconstancy.

        <p align="justify">
          But a true friend is steady in his love, and times of prosperity and
          adversity, honor and dishonor, evil report and good report — make no
          more difference to him, than the changes of the air to a man of a
          healthy constitution.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some false friends become cool in the day of prosperity, for they
          grudge to see their equals exalted above them. But a true friend
          rejoices in the prosperity of those whom he loves. Jonathan was one of
          the noblest instances of this truth, who loved David, and rejoiced in
          his prospects of advancement at his own expense.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Adversity</p></i>is commonly reputed
        <i>the touchstone of friendship</i>. That is the season when our hollow
        friends forsake us — but a real friend then acts the part of a brother,
        and reveals his friendship more than ever.
        <p align="justify">
          Jonathan encountered the fury of a tyrant in a father, and risked his
          life for David, for whom he had formerly given up with cheerfulness
          his prospects of a crown.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must not, however, be too rigorous in trying our friends by this
          mark, for perfection is not to be found anywhere among men — and the
          strength of harm or fear, may sometimes make real and worthy friends
          to act in a manner unworthy of themselves. The love of the disciples
          to Christ was approved by himself, "You are those who stood by me in
          my trials;" and yet through fear they forsook him, and fled in the day
          of his strongest trials.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Job's friends, through an unhappy mistake, added greatly to his
          afflictions, and behaved like enemies. Yet that patient sufferer still
          calls them his friends, and solicits their sympathy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We ought to show proper attention to our friends in their distresses,
          that we may approve the sincerity of our former professions. And in
          the day of our own distress, to make due allowances in others for the
          weakness of human nature.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But no friend but Christ deserves our unlimited confidence. In him the
          text received, and still receives, its most glorious accomplishment.
          He remembered us in our low estate, and forgets us not in his own
          exaltation. <i>Afflictions </i>are the seasons when his kindness is
          most richly experienced — and our provocations do not alienate his
          affection from us. This is our beloved, and this is our friend. In him
          we will trust, and to him we will devote our hearts!

        Solomon warns us often against <i>rash suretyship</i> — and yet many
        professors of religion have opened the mouths of enemies by the
        temptations into which they have run themselves by forgetting this
        exhortation. Why should religion bear the blame of what it testifies so
        often against, that every man who reads this book must observe it, and
        have it in his mind — unless he willfully despises the instructions of
        the wise man? If we would hearken to Solomon, he would teach us to be
        richer and happier, as well as better Christians.

          >"He who loves a quarrel loves sin; he who builds a high gate invites
          destruction."</b
        >
        Pride is a destructive sin, in whatever form it reveals itself; and the
        Spirit of God, by Solomon, gives us many warnings of the danger of it,
        and of those sins that are produced by it. Pride breeds contentions —
        and from the love of contention spring an innumerable multitude of
        iniquities! For as love is productive of every virtue — so that he who
        loves another has fulfilled the law, and will do no hurt to his
        neighbor. Just so, he who takes pleasure in strife has broken the whole
        law, and is ready to do every bad thing, for where there is envying and
        strife, there is confusion and every evil work.
        <p align="justify">
          But who is the man that loves contention? Those who are engaged in it,
          allege that they love peace as much as any man — that they are forced
          into it by the perverseness of other men. However, when men are almost
          always engaged in strife, they afford too strong an evidence that they
          love it. If a man is always engaged in law-suits, or in angry
          contentions with his neighbors, or those things that concern his
          private interest — he is surely <i>a lover of strife</i>. It is an
          evidence no less clear of love to contention, when people seize every
          opportunity for beginning a quarrel, and cannot make the least
          sacrifice of self-will, or self interest, for the sake of peace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, if strife is productive of so many sins, it must be attended with
          a proportionate train of miseries, and therefore our interest as well
          as duty requires us to avoid everything that may lead us into angry
          disputes. If we love God, we will love our brother also; and if we are
          reconciled to God, we will follow peace with all men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us hate pride, for it makes a man miserable in this world as well
          as the next. It makes men unsatisfied with the condition allotted to
          them by God, and tempts them to waste their substance, and to cheat
          and oppress their neighbors, in order to gratify their own ambitious
          disposition, and leads on the person in whom it reigns, to the
          practice of many sins which bring down destruction from the Almighty.

          deceitful falls into trouble."</b
        >
        A man of a froward and perverse spirit, makes use of trickery and deceit
        to gain his ends. He thinks himself so wise, that he has no reason to
        fear a disappointment — but he indulges himself in an error which the
        whole Scripture condemns, and which no man of real honesty can fall
        into, that <i> some profit may be gained by sin</i>.
        <p align="justify">
          The perverse in heart is an abomination to the Lord. And as the Lord
          is the universal Ruler — he will never allow a man to enjoy any solid
          satisfaction in that which he detests. He will most certainly
          frustrate those expectations which are founded upon a contempt of his
          majesty, and a presumptuous notion that the power and wisdom of a
          creature can successfully oppose the Creator.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The perverse in heart and in tongue will not only meet with a total
          disappointment of his hopes — but fall into extreme misery. And this
          is the most deplorable condition that we can imagine — when one is not
          only divested of everything comfortable and good, and loaded with the
          opposite miseries. This severe punishment is begun in this world, as
          experience teaches every day, and it is consummated in that punishment
          of loss and of sense, which the wicked suffer in the everlasting
          world.

          grind them to powder. Honesty and integrity is our best wisdom.
          Upright men walk on firm ground — when the men who boast of their

        How little are earthly objects to be trusted! Men's children are the
        sources of their expected joys, and the birth of children is generally
        accounted a joyful occasion — but many children are the causes of grief,
        and not of joy, to their parents. By their folly they are a disgrace to
        those who might have expected better returns of their fondness — and
        fill their days of old age with additional pains, when it was expected
        that the sight of them would have relieved every pang.
        <p align="justify">
          He who has the unhappiness to be father to a fool, has no joy, either,
          in his son or in anything else, for every pleasure is deadened, and
          every distress embittered and poisoned — by the sight of a child
          despising the very instrument of his existence, and treasuring up
          endless miseries for himself. Unnatural are those children who make
          their parents miserable.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Unwise are those parents who look for comfort to their children, and

          anything a blessing to us.

          It must, greatly increase the affliction of those who meet with this

          But the mirth principally recommended by the inspired, writer, is that
          cheerfulness which piety bestows; for he tells us, that the ways of
          wisdom are all pleasantness and peace, and that sorrow and
          wretchedness are inseparable attendants of sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The things of this world are so incapable of affording permanent
          satisfaction, that Solomon wrote almost a whole book to show that they
          are vanity and vexation of spirit — but wisdom, he tells us, makes the
          face to shine, and inspires the heart with pleasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A cheerful heart diffuses its influence through the body, and
          preserves its vigor and health, or tends to restore it where it is
          lost. But a broken spirit crushes the frame of the body, enfeebles its
          powers, makes the flesh to wither and decay, and burns the bones, like
          a hearth. Christ himself, in his agony, felt the effect of strong
          sorrows in his flesh.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Everything that tends to spread a gloom over the mind, is to be
          avoided. There are cases, indeed where we are called to mourn and weep
          — but that grief which religion requires and infuses, is not dangerous
          to the physical frame, because it brings the sweetest joys in its
          train.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is sin which brings the most dangerous sorrows along with it, and
          not repentance, which is a medicine to remove the cause of the worst
          distempers. When David was stubborn, and did not confess his sins, his
          bones waxed old, because of his roaring all the day long. But when he
          confessed his sin, the joys of pardon healed his bones, and renewed
          his vigor, so that he praised God, not only for pardoning all his
          iniquities — but likewise for renewing his age like the eagle's.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The joys of God's salvation will be a mighty antidote against every
          grief, and strengthen the body and soul against those bad impressions
          which the multiplied calamities of life too often make.

        Knowledge is often useless to the possessor of it, either because he is
        ignorant of those things which he ought to know, or because he lacks
        wisdom to make the proper use of his knowledge. But true wisdom is of
        constant use to him who possesses it, for he does not allow it to be
        buried in his mind — but
        <i> applies it to the direction of his life. </i>It guides him in the
        choice of his great end, and makes him steady in the pursuit of it. He
        keeps it still before his eyes to guide all his steps, and walks in his
        way safely, for wisdom preserves him, and discretion keeps him.
        <p align="justify">
          Thus we find David regulating his life. He hid the Word of God in his

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must not only learn wisdom — but keep it in view, that it may be a

          But a fool lacks wisdom in his heart, and there is no wisdom before
          his eyes; for instead of employing his understanding to fix upon the
          great end of life, as the mark at which he aims, his eyes are at the
          ends of the earth, roving up and down to look at everything that comes
          in his way, except that on which his view should be constantly and
          steadily fixed. He has a <i>roving imagination </i>that is perpetually

          he should do — but lives at random, and tosses to and fro like a ship
          in the sea, without a pilot and a helm. Such a man is perpetually in
          chase of <i>shadows</i>, and when he has overtaken one of them, and
          finds no substance in it as he expected — he begins to pursue another.
          And so his days are spent in vanity, and he enters into the eternal

          Our duty is, to fix our eyes upon the things that are not seen, and to

          to tread that path which leads to eternal life, without turning out of

        This instruction would not be repeated so often, if it were not useful
        for many excellent purposes. It teaches <i>parents </i>to avoid that
        common fault of too fond indulgence to the faults of their children, for
        a child left to himself is for the most part a grief to his father, and
        bitterness (which is the greatest degree of grief,) to his mother —
        whose maternal tenderness was more likely to spoil him by its excess,
        than the fondness of a father.

          It instructs those who have not yet entered into family connections,

        It is a bad thing when children, who ought to be a joy to the hearts of
        their parents under every misfortune — prove their heaviest cross. But
        here is a worse evil censured; when magistrates, that are the ministers
        of God for good, prove the ministers of Satan in the administration of
        it, by punishing the just, and perverting an institution of our gracious
        Creator, into an instrument of unrighteousness! To punish the lowest of
        men without ground, is a very evil thing, for it is a discouragement to
        virtue, and a strong incentive to wickedness. But it is doubly wicked to
        strike princes for their integrity, by punishing inferior rulers for
        acting according to the eternal rules of righteousness, and refusing to
        truckle to the humor and caprice of their sovereigns. It was the fear of
        this that determined Pilate to condemn the holy and the just One.
        <p align="justify">
          Subjects may be guilty of striking princes for their integrity, by
          smiting them with their tongues, or seditious practices against their
          authority — while they endeavor, in the administration of their
          office, to serve the true interests, rather than gratify the
          unreasonable wishes of those whom they govern.

          Moses had a large experience of this rebellious disposition, in the

          Parents and masters of families may be charged with the crime of
          punishing the just — by groundless severities to those who are under
          their charge. Rulers in the church are in like manner worthy of
          censure, when they administer the ordinance of discipline to the
          injury of those whom they rule, by rebuking them for things that are
          not criminal; or for real crimes which cannot be proved.

        As we must not be hasty with our mouths to utter anything before
        <i>God</i> — so it is foolish to be swift to speak even before
        <i>men. </i>The empty vessel makes the greatest sound, and the man who
        has nothing to say which deserves hearing — is commonly most prodigal of
        his words.

          Xenocrates the philosopher was upbraided because of his silence in a
          meeting of friends. He answered that, "He had often repented of
          speaking — but never of silence."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          People should not be fond of hearing themselves speak at any time —
          but double caution is unsavory when we meet with provocations that put
          our minds into a ferment. The wise man's knowledge teaches his mouth
          to speak the words of truth and soberness — but angry passions are the
          worst instructors to the tongue in the world. Floods of venom are
          poured from them when they have mastered reason, and obtained the
          command of the lips.

          A man of understanding having the government of his tongue, shows the
          excellency and coolness of his spirit, either by silence, or by the
          meekness of his words, as the occasion directs him.

          David had such a command of his passions through the power of faith,
          that he said nothing amiss when he was tried with the most provoking
          usage in the time of distress, a season when the spirits of other men
          are discomposed by mere trifles. He was like a man that hears not, and
          in whose mouth are no reproofs, "For in you, O Lord," says he, "do I
          hope. You will hear, O Lord my God." But if a man spares his words,
          may he not lay himself open to the suspicion of being an ignorant man
          or a fool? No.

          >"Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he
          holds his tongue."</b
        >
        The silence of a fool is almost always a covering to folly, and a sign
        of some degree of wisdom — yet it is not always a sign that his folly is
        in any degree cured. Absalom held his peace when his sister was ravished
        by Amnon — but his silence proceeded from sullenness and cunning, and
        prepared the way for the execution of his furious revenge.
        <p align="justify">
          It is a good sign that a fool is not incurable, when he has learned to
          keep silent from a sense of his own ignorance, and a desire to learn
          from others. It is as difficult a thing to learn to be silent — as to
          learn to speak! And although unseasonable silence is not a good thing
          — yet unseasonable speaking is far worse! It is often a point of real
          wisdom to be silent, for there is a time to be silent, and a time to
          speak — and the wise man's heart knows both the time and the manner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When men have no call to speak on a subject, or when they have not
          duly considered it; when they are discomposed by passion, or in the
          company of those whose passions render them incapable of hearing
          reason; and finally, when they are more likely to expose themselves to
          damage, than to do good to others by speaking — then to keep silent
          altogether will be their best method of behavior.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is sometimes our duty to keep silent — but we must not run into one
          extreme to avoid another. Silence which is occasioned by cowardice,
          when we are manifestly called to bear testimony for truth, is a
          dangerous sin. Nor must we desert the defense of
          <i>oppressed innocence</i>, to prevent inconvenience to ourselves.
