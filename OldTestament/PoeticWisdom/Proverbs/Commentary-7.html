        <p align="justify">
          The grand question in this chapter is: What are we to understand by
          that <i>wisdom </i>which is here introduced, recommending her
          instructions to us? The <i>fear of the Lord </i>is said to be the
          beginning of wisdom. But the wisdom that speaks in this passage
          appears to be a <i> person</i> — and it is disputed whether we are to
          understand it of <i>Christ</i>, the great Fountain of wisdom, or of
          <i>the noble quality </i>of wisdom, represented by a strong eastern
          figure under a personal character.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This wisdom has been generally understood in the Christian church to
          mean the Lord Jesus Christ — the Word (Logos) spoken of by John, who
          ascribes to him under that name several of those glories which are
          here ascribed to wisdom. There are some things spoken of men in the
          prophetic passages of Scripture, too great to be understood in their
          full meaning of any of the sons of men — except the man Christ. These
          we are taught by the Scriptures of the New Testament, to understand of
          him who is the glory of our race, to whom all the prophets bore
          witness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, if Solomon says concerning wisdom, things that are true to their
          full extent of signification in Christ alone — may we not with good
          reason conclude, that the Spirit who directed his pen, meant to lead
          our thoughts to the personal Word of God, in whom are all the
          treasures of wisdom, and to whom the church of Israelites and
          Christians is indebted for all the discoveries that were ever made?
          The voice of Christ is the voice of wisdom itself. The wise will hear,
          and will increase their learning — and fools only will despise this
          wisdom and instruction. Surely they cannot be reasonable creatures,
          who resist the fervent eloquence and the persuasive arguments
          addressed to us in this chapter.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 1.</p></font>"Does
          not wisdom cry out? Does not understanding raise her voice?" </b
        >Our consciences bear testimony to this truth, that wisdom not only
        <i>speaks</i> — but <i>cries </i>to us with a voice like the sound of a
        trumpet! If we do not hear, it is because our ears are shut, or because
        we turn them away from the truth, to hear the alluring and enchanting
        voice of sin and its servants. How shall they excuse themselves, who
        give ear to the voice of the cunning serpent — rather than to the voice
        of the Eternal Wisdom? But <i>where </i>does wisdom put forth her voice?
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 2, 3.</p></font>"On
          the heights along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
          beside the gates leading into the city, at the entrances, she cries
          aloud!"</b
        >
        If we do not hear the voice of wisdom, we have only ourselves to blame.
        Her pulpit is erected in the high places, and her voice is heard from
        afar. She preaches at the places of concourse, the gates of the city,
        and in the places where roads meet. At our very doors we may hear her
        publishing her precious doctrines!
        <p align="justify">
          Ignorance, when chosen and willful, will by no means excuse us. If we
          are in darkness, it is not for lack of light — but because we hate the
          light, and by winking hard, exclude its beams.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Why should we not use all due pains to find wisdom, when wisdom uses
          such pains to find us out, and to proclaim her necessary instructions
          in our ears? Surely our Lord Jesus was willing to communicate his
          saving instructions, when he preached in mountains and in fields, in
          public roads and in deserts, in synagogues and in ships — inviting men
          to receive his salvation, and pressing them to repent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Nor is the voice of wisdom in our days become more feeble, or heard in
          fewer places. Unless we are stupidly inattentive, we may still hear it
          sounding in our ears, whether we are at home or abroad, walking in the
          fields or sitting in the church. The voice of the <i>gospel</i>, the
          voice of <i>providence</i>, the voice of <i>conscience</i>, the voice
          of <i>honest friends</i> — is a cry of wisdom, to which we do well to
          take heed, for to all of us she speaks.
        </p>
        <font color="#0000ff"
          ><b> <p align="justify">Verse 4.</p></b></font
        >
        <b>"To you, O men, I call out! I raise my voice to all mankind!" </b>The
        mercy of God is <i>sovereign</i> — and therefore the sons of Adam are
        called to repentance. But to the angels that fell, no voice of mercy was
        ever heard. They were nobler in their origin, and more excellent in
        their natures. But the Son of God loved us, just because he would love
        us, and was made wisdom and righteousness unto us — and not to angels.
        <p align="justify">
          There are many of the sons of Adam, that never heard the calls of
          wisdom; but all within hearing are called, and earnestly importuned to
          comply with the call. Let us not then give reason for that complaint,
          "When I called — why was there none to answer." The disobedient and
          unbelieving shall be tormented in Hell with a soul-rending remorse,
          which devils and heathens cannot feel. Say not that the calls of
          wisdom are not to you, because you are fools — for to such she speaks!
        </p>
        <font color="#0000ff"
          ><b> <p align="justify">Verse 5.</p></b></font
        >
        <b
          >"You who are <i>simple</i>, gain prudence; you who are
          <i>foolish</i>, gain understanding." </b
        >Those who are easily seduced, those who live under the power of error
        and sin — are called to hear the wisdom which is from above. Your case,
        O you simple ones, is not hopeless! Eternal Wisdom is your teacher, and
        calls you to learn; and to none does wisdom say, "Seek Me in vain!"
        <p align="justify">
          The teacher is the Lord our God; and he teaches to profit, because
          there is power and light in his words, and in the Spirit who
          accompanies them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Have you been foolish and disobedient? You are called to turn to the
          wisdom of the just. There is pardoning mercy revealed to encourage you
          to turn to the Lord — there is converting power in the words of
          wisdom. Your situation is bad — but not desperate. Hear the words that
          are spoken to you, and let them sink into your souls!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Consider the excellencies of the words, and of the speaker of them.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 6.</p></font>"Listen,
          for I have worthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is
          right." </b
        >Where the words of a king are, there is power. The words of wisdom are
        the princely words of the eternal King. As the sun and moon, these works
        of God's hands, are more excellent than a machine or clock made by some
        human workman — so is the word of God more excellent than the sayings of
        the wisest and greatest of men. The same divine excellency which appears
        to reason's eye in the <i>works </i>of God — appears to the eye of faith
        in the <i>word </i>of God. In the words of the wisest philosophers and
        most eloquent orators, there are some good and some bad things. There is
        <i>dross </i>mingled with their silver — but all the words of wisdom are
        right words, they are like silver seven times purified. They are spoken
        in perfect righteousness and faithfulness.
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 7.</p></font>"My
          mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness." </b
        >Why do we not all believe the words of Christ? Heaven and earth shall
        pass away — but not one jot or tittle shall pass from his word. Let us
        never again be so impious as to suspect the faithfulness of his
        <i>promises</i>, or the sincerity of his <i>invitations</i>, or the
        truth of his precious <i>doctrines</i>. We believe the word of an honest
        man — and Christ is the Amen, the faithful and true Witness. All lying
        is wickedness in his esteem, and is abhorred by his heart.
        <p align="justify">
          If we believe the word of a man who may lie — shall we disbelieve the
          word of Him who cannot lie, nor allow liars to stand in his presence?
          We attend with diligence to the words of a man famous for wisdom and
          integrity — but all the words of Christ are the words of wisdom
          itself, and the things spoken are upright words of truth.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 8.</p></font>"All the
          words of my mouth are righteous — none of them is crooked or
          perverse!" </b
        >One of the characters which our Lord takes is, "I who speak in
        righteousness." Eternal righteousness is in our Lord Jesus Christ, and
        shines in all his administrations and in all his words. God has given us
        in his word, a representation of the righteousness of his own nature and
        will, and framed it as <i>a rule of righteousness to us. </i>Those are
        crooked and perverse, walk in ways not authorized by this rule.
        <p align="justify">
          By the degree of our conformity to it, are our improvements in
          righteousness and true holiness to be estimated. There is
          righteousness in the <i>promises </i>and <i>doctrines</i>, as well as
          in the <i>commands </i>of it. God's words of grace are spoken by him
          in his holiness, and are therefore to be received with an unshaken
          confidence. Has God promised us eternal life, and called us by his
          word to depend on his Son for salvation? We may safely venture our
          souls upon the faithful word of Jehovah. To doubt whether these
          addresses to us are sincere or not, is to suspect that there is
          something crooked or perverse in the faithful sayings of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But is it possible for us to understand the words of wisdom? Yes.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 9.</p></font>"To the
          discerning all of them are right; they are faultless to those who have
          knowledge." </b
        >The words of wisdom are a great depth. In them are
        <i>mysteries </i>which cannot be fully comprehended; for we find that
        the all-wise God has laid up in every part of Scripture, stores of
        wisdom too deep for mortal minds to fathom. There are some passages of
        Scripture, especially in that part of it which was written after the
        time of Solomon, in which are things hard to be understood — and yet all
        the words of wisdom are here said to be plain to the discerning.
        <p align="justify">
          The meaning is, that everything necessary for faith and practice is
          clearly revealed in the Bible by the great Author of it, who meant not
          to insult our ignorance — but to instruct our minds, by that sacred
          book. When we are walled with difficulties, we ought not to quarrel
          with the Bible — but to ascribe it to our own stupidity or sloth. If,
          after the due use of means, some parts of Scripture still continue
          dark to us — let us bless God that the needful doctrines contained in
          them are in other passages taught with sufficient plainness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But if these words are plain only to the discerning — then of what
          service can it prove for simple and foolish people to attend to them?
          Fools are called not only to hear — but to receive wisdom from our
          great Teacher, for none teaches like him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the entrance of God's word gives understanding to the simple, and
          the Spirit of Christ makes them wise unto salvation, who were born
          like the wild donkey's colt. The words of God meet with reproach and
          banter from some, who would found a reputation for wit upon
          wickedness; but wisdom will be justified by her children, and her
          words will be esteemed to be right concerning all things by those who
          find knowledge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What improvement should we make of these commendations given to the
          words of wisdom? We ought to receive them with superlative esteem.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 10, 11.</p></font>
          "Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice
          gold — for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire
          can compare with her!" </b
        >We profess to prefer wisdom in our judgment to the most valued things
        upon earth — but we are hypocrites, if there is not a consistency
        between our <i>profession </i> and our <i>practice</i>. If wisdom is
        better than silver — we must receive it rather than silver. And if it
        were put to our choice whether to be rich or holy — we ought not for a
        moment to hesitate in deciding. It is actually put to our choice,
        whether we will seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness — or
        the delights of sense, and the riches that shine to the eye of flesh.
        <p align="justify">
          If we are resolved at any rate to be rich; if we value the means of
          enriching ourselves with gold above the means of grace; if we grudge
          the necessary expense that may attend the means of religious
          instruction — then we choose gold, and not wisdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The truly wise have some degree of Paul's spirit in them, and are
          taught by God to count everything loss and dung for the excellency of
          the knowledge of Christ Jesus their Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Silver and gold are good things, under the direction of wisdom. But
          they must not be the <i>chief </i>object of our esteem; for if any man
          loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Luther, having received large presents from some princes of Saxony,
          protested that he would not have them for his portion. If gold or
          rubies are equal to wisdom in our judgment — then we have not the mind
          of Christ. That we may be disposed heartily to prefer wisdom to
          everything that our eyes have seen, or our minds have imagined — let
          us hear and believe what more can be said on wisdom's behalf.

        >
        For the Son of God to reveal his own glory to us — is one of the
        innumerable instances of his condescending grace. Had he not manifested
        his own glory to us, we would, to our loss, have remained forever
        ignorant of it.
        <p align="justify">
          Prudence is the companion of wisdom — and infinite prudence was from
          eternity familiar to the personal Wisdom of God, who abounded toward
          us in all prudence, in the contrivance of that glorious plan by which
          the wisdom of God is raised to the highest pitch in the salvation of
          men. For the Word was with God, and was a sharer in the glory of his
          eternal purpose of grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Consummate prudence and divine invention shine with illustrious
          splendor in the whole administration of our Lord Jesus Christ, and out
          of his treasures we receive all that prudence and skill that is
          necessary for us, while sojourning in a world full of enemies and
          snares.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Who would not rather go for water to a fountain that ever flows — than
          to an intermittent brook that often disappoints the thirsty traveler?
          The Son of God has the fountain of life with him, and in his light
          shall we see light.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Perfect purity</p></i>is another excellency of
        our divine Teacher, and his instructions have a sanctifying effect upon

          behavior and perverse speech!"</b
        >
        Some men refrain from evil actions, through fear of shame or punishment.
        But true wisdom teaches men not only to refrain from evil — but to
        <i>hate </i>it, through the fear of God. Then we are possessed of this
        gracious principle, when we abhor not only evil <i>actions</i>,<i
        > </i>but evil <i>words </i>and <i>dispositions</i>. Pride and
        arrogance, wickedness in the course of the conversation, and
        perverseness in spirit — are equally abhorred by our Lord. Such as have
        received his instructions into their hearts, cannot love that which is
        declared in every part of his word to be utterly offensive to him.

        <p align="justify">
          Were anything deserving the name of wisdom to be found anywhere else,
          we might with less damage despise the word of exhortation — but Christ
          claims it as his peculiar excellency:

        "Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have understanding and power!"
        Bildad had referred Job to the wise men that lived in the days of old,
        as the oracles of wisdom, for determining the disputes between Job and
        his friends. Job acknowledged that the ancients had some degree of
        wisdom — but would not implicitly submit his understanding to their
        maxims, because there was no comparison in this respect between the
        wisest sages, and the Ancient of days.
        <p align="justify">
          What is the wisdom of philosophers, who frequently became vain in
          their reasonings, and ruined men by their philosophy and vain deceit —
          to the wisdom of the Eternal Word? But why should we speak of
          <i>wise men</i>, when the <i>holy angels </i>are charged with folly?
          There is no sound wisdom but in Christ, or from him, who is the
          Fountain of human reason — and the Author of all that true wisdom
          which is in man. Whether these great men made their celebrated
          discoveries by the mere force of their own genius, or by the help of
          tradition — it is plain that their light was but a <i>ray </i> from
          that true light that enlightens every man who comes into the world.

        <p align="justify">
          Counsel is his, for he is the wonderful Counselor, between whom and
          his eternal Father, the council of peace was formed, and who by his
          counsel, conducts us in the right way to happiness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The very quintessence of wisdom is his. He is understanding itself,
          and his eyes penetrate to the bottom of the deepest mysteries!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Blessed be God that such a person is made to us wisdom! Wisdom is
          better than strength — and yet wisdom needs strength to execute its
          plans. The eternal <i>wisdom </i>of God is joined with
          <i>omnipotence</i>. The eternal Word is the Almighty, by whom all
          things were made, and all the purposes of grace effected. He gives
          courage and power to all that learn wisdom from him, so that a man of
          understanding increases strength.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Where counsel to contrive and wisdom to propose the noblest end,

        What God was doing before he made the world? But we have here a serious

        foundation of the world to be the Author of wisdom and salvation to us,
        and he accounted it his glory to be the foundation of the counsel of God
        in the administration of grace. The eternal power and Godhead of Christ

          and love, with unwearied diligence, earnest desire, and lively hope.

          The man that waited thirty-eight years at the pool of Siloam, was well
          rewarded at last, when he received vigor to his body. But they enjoy
          greater happiness, who wait for God in his appointed way. Christ is
          found by those who seek him.

        He who has the Son has life, and he who has not the Son of God has not
        life. The first man, Adam, was made a living soul — but by sin he died,
        and we all sinned and died in him, and must have continued forever in a
        state of death — had not another Adam appeared who was made a quickening
        Spirit. Whoever believes in him shall not die — but have everlasting
        life.
        <p align="justify">
          Even in this land of darkness and death, believers enjoy a true and
          happy life — for they are delivered from condemnation, and entitled to
          the heavenly life. They are made free from that principle of
          corruption, which is called <i>the law of sin and death</i>, and made
          alive unto God and holiness. They enjoy that which is better than life
          — the loving-kindness of the Lord; for through Jesus, the Father looks
          upon them with a pleasant countenance. The smiles of God make Heaven,
          and those who obtain favor of the Lord have a
          <i>Heaven upon earth</i>.

        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 36.</p></font>"But he
          who sins against me wrongs his own soul; all who hate me love death." </b
        >Those who despise Christ's gospel, or reject his salvation — are sinful
        rebels against him who is the Supreme Wisdom, and the fountain of
        happiness to men. They are haters of Him who is love itself. Such
        ungrateful rebels are as great enemies to themselves, as to Christ. They
        murder their immortal souls — they love those sins which are death and
        damnation in disguise. Sinners against Christ shall receive a reward of
        vengeance suited to the blackness of their guilt, and shall, through
        eternity, have no room to complain of their Judge. Death and life were
        set before them — and they chose death, and shall forever eat of the
        fruit of their own choice. Consider these things, O unbelievers! If you
        will not now consider them — in the latter days you shall fully consider
        them!
