              </p></font
            >"Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may
            bring forth."

        <p align="justify">
          In God we live, and move, and have our being. But we too often forget
          this important truth, and speak, and act, and think — as if we lived,
          and moved, and had our being in ourselves. We boast of what we will
          do, or of what we shall enjoy at the distance of days, and months, and
          years. This presumption is forbidden in this and in many places of
          Scripture; and a reason is given for the prohibition that every person
          must acknowledge to be a true and good one — that we do not know what
          a day may bring forth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Every new day brings forth the accomplishment of some decree of the
          Most High — but these decrees are written in a sealed book, and no man
          can unloose the seals, nor open the book, nor read what is written
          therein. We know that the sun will rise tomorrow — but we cannot tell
          whether it will rise on us, or on our survivors. We can guess what the
          weather will be — but we cannot say whether we shall be rich or poor,
          sick or in health, left in the possession of our friends, or bereaved
          of those who are dearest to our hearts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the morning Haman went forth from his magnificent palace, expecting
          to be gratified before the evening came with the blood of his hated
          enemy, which would have been sweeter to him than wine. But, before the
          evening came, he was hanged like a dog on the gallows, and went to the
          place appointed for him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We ought to boast of nothing. For our life is but a vapor! What are
          our bags of gold, but a glittering nothings? What are our honors, but
          a puff of wind? Or what are our earthly hopes, when their basis is a
          shadow which flees away, and never returns?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the hopes that are founded upon the rock of ages can never fail
          us, and the believer in Christ can, upon solid ground, triumph in the
          expectation of eternal joys, and unfading crowns! He boasts not of
          himself — but glories in the Lord, whose promises are more stable than
          the everlasting hills, or the pillars of Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The same reason that should check our boasting of tomorrow, may
          preserve us from desponding fears. It may be stormy weather today —
          but storms do not last all the year. We are filled and tormented with
          fears of some impending evil — but we often give ourselves real pain
          by the prospect of calamities that never were appointed to us by the
          providence of God. This is now the spring of the year, and within the
          last twelve months, the country has been three times alarmed with
          anxious fears, all of which have been most agreeably disappointed.

          not your own lips."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          For a man to trumpet his own glory, is no glory. When a man publishes
          his own praises, it is a sign that he has none else to do it for him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Suppose a man has really done some good things — yet when he boasts of
          them, he destroys all their honor. For no man will think himself
          obliged to praise the man who is arrogant enough to publish his own
          praises; and every one will believe that he did those actions which
          are the subject of his talk, not from any principle of love to God or
          man — but merely with a view to his own honor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Pharisees had but a poor reward for their alms and prayers, in the
          praise of men — but the vain boaster has a poorer reward, for he is
          his own paymaster, and must be content to lack the praise of other
          men, as well as of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But we ought to do those things which deserve praise. Our
          <i>hands</i>, and not our <i>tongues</i>, must be employed to publish
          our worth, and thus we shall comply with the precept, and follow the
          example of our Lord. He had a good title to praise himself, and could
          appeal to his works, which bore witness continually on his behalf, and
          published his praise through the world, in spite of all the rage and
          cunning of his adversaries.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In some cases a man is at liberty, and has a call to speak to his own
          praise — but these cases are few. When Paul was laid under a necessity
          of this kind, he often reminds us that he speaks like a fool; and
          blames the Corinthians that they had reduced him to this necessity, by
          neglecting to interpose in the behalf of his injured character.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Although we must be very cautious how we praise <i> ourselves</i> —
          yet when we are called to speak in the praise of another man, we are
          not only at greater liberty — but may expose ourselves to just blame
          by unseasonable silence.

          >"Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but a fool's anger is heavier than
          both. Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but who can stand before
          envy?"</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          A wise man endeavors to live under the influence of that meekness so
          strongly recommended, and so wonderfully exemplified by our Lord. But
          a fool has no government over his passions, and it is better to meet a
          bear bereaved of her cubs, than a fool in his folly. For his wrath is
          heavier than the sand of the sea, it is fiercer than the rage of
          tigers — it is more <i>stubborn </i>and inflexible than the rocks. May
          we never come within the reach of a fool when his passions are roused.
          For they must be gratified and satiated, even if they should bring him
          to a gibbet.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          May we ever possess our souls in patience and calmness. Boisterous
          passions are a whirlwind in the soul, which threaten to rend it in a
          thousand pieces. But as terrible as wrath is, <i>envy </i>is a great
          deal worse. Envy is the grief that a man feels for the prosperity of
          another person; it is a compound of <i>pride </i>and <i>malice; </i>it
          derives misery to a man from his neighbor's happiness. The blessings
          and mercies of God, are turned by it into curses; and the life of
          another man is the envious man's death.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As the devil fell by pride, so he wrought the fall of man by his envy.
          And when envy takes possession of a man, it makes him a devil to his
          neighbors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>envious </i>man is far blacker than the <i>angry </i>man. For
          the outrageous behavior of an angry person sounds an alarm to his
          neighbor to be on his guard — but the envious man conceals his
          malignity, until he has a fit opportunity to strike a mortal blow
          without danger of missing his aim. The one is a <i>dog</i>, which
          barks before he bites; the other is an <i>adder </i>in the grass, that
          stings the traveler when he is dreading no hurt. For the
          <i>malice of the envious man </i>is generally unsuspected, because no
          occasion was given for it. It is the good and happiness of the envied
          object that excites his malignity, and he does not so much as pretend
          (unless he adds lying to envy,) that he has received any provocation.
          <i>Anger </i>may generally be appeased — but <i>envy </i>is the vice
          of a dark and hellish spirit, that has not the least spark of
          generosity to give any hope of pacifying it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The only way you can take to soothe envy is to be miserable. For it
          makes a man such a utter devil, that evil is his only good. The fall
          of man, the murder of <i>Abel</i>, the slavery of <i>Joseph</i>, the
          persecutions of <i>David</i>, the crucifixion of our <i>Lord</i> — are
          monuments of the rage of envy, and the danger incurred by being
          objects of it. But the curse of the serpent, the miserable end of
          Saul, the horrors that pursued Cain, the desolations of Jerusalem, and
          the torments prepared for devils — are terrible proofs that envy is
          infinitely worse for the person who harbors it, than for the innocent
          object of it.

          >"Better is open rebuke than hidden love."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          There are two qualities very requisite in a friend — love and
          faithfulness. The last is as necessary as the first, to make our
          friendships really beneficial to us. There are some who love us with
          sincerity and warmth — and yet lack the courage that is necessary to
          make them faithful in reproving us when we deserve to be reproved. But
          reproof, although it should be severe and cutting, is better than love
          which does not reveal itself in needful rebukes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A true friend will not disclose our faults to the world — but he will
          be sure to reprove us for them. For virtue is the soul of true
          friendship, and must not be entrenched upon, out of regard to our
          dearest friends. Therefore that friend is to be valued, who does not
          spare to tell us roundly to our faces, wherein we have erred. For he
          gives good evidence that he esteems our real welfare, above his own
          interest in our regard. A friend who is afraid to reprove us when we
          deserve if, does not reveal a very high measure of love for us. For he
          seems to think us incapable of bearing reproof, and rather chooses to
          enjoy our smiles than to do us an essential service.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord loved his Apostles with a tender regard; and with admirable
          prudence and kindness he rebuked them when they spoke or behaved
          amiss. He would never allow sin upon them — and yet he reproved them
          in such a manner as to increase and not diminish their love to
          himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us learn, from this proverb, to exercise the fidelity of
          friendship to those whom we love, and to thank our friends when they
          reveal the sincerity of their regard in their concern for our souls.
          We ought to value honesty above politeness, and to excuse a little
          defect in the last quality, for the sake of the first.

          deceitful."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Friends are not to be loved chiefly on account of the pleasure they
          give us, although nothing earthly is more pleasant than a true friend.
          Their <i>integrity </i>and <i>faithfulness </i>are their most valuable
          qualities; and they will sometimes have occasion for them, by speaking
          to us things that are a great deal more <i>useful </i>than pleasant.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David esteemed a friend who would wound and smite him to his profit,
          as much as a wise man values a surgeon who makes needful but painful
          incisions in his flesh, for the restoration of his lost health.
          Abishai, who revealed such zeal for his honor, was not dearer to him
          than Nathan the prophet, who reproved him, in the plainest manner, for
          the murder of Uriah.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All men allow that the kisses of an enemy are deceitful and
          detestable. An enemy speaks sweetly with his lips — but in his heart
          he imagines how to throw you into a pit! He will weep with his eyes —
          but if he finds opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The caresses of an enemy are very base and dangerous — but it deserves
          to be considered whether we have not a greater quantity of revenge
          than generosity in our temper — when we hate the kisses of an enemy
          more than we value the wounds of a friend. If we value the image of
          Christ, it is certain that <i>faithful reprovers </i>express a
          friendship that resembles his love to his people to a greater degree
          than those who withhold from us this plainest token of real regard.

          The poor generally reckon the rich a great deal happier than
          themselves, because they are clothed in fine apparel, and dwell in
          elegant houses, and feed upon the richest dainties. Yet the envy and
          discontent of poor men is very ill founded, for the rich, being
          accustomed to these things, receive no more gratification from them
          than the poor derive from their homely fare, and shabby clothing, and
          poor accommodations.

        <p align="justify">
          If the sight of a well furnished room, and of fine paintings, could
          give any considerable pleasure to those who are accustomed to see
          them, the poor might enjoy as much pleasure by looking at the verdant
          clothing of the earth, and the glorious canopy of Heaven.

          The man who fares sumptuously every day, has no more relish for honey
          and wine than the poor man has for bread and water — for he seldom
          experiences hunger, and so he lacks the best sauce that any food can
          have.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When a man's appetite is excited by hunger and labor, every kind of
          food is welcome and pleasant to him. While the rich are exposed to
          weariness and listlessness in their abundance — the poor have strong
          excitements to be cheerful and thankful although scanty meals are all
          they can afford.

          The children of Israel loathed the manna, although it was bread given
          them immediately from God, and was called the <i>food of angels</i>.
          They wished to be in Canaan, and eat common bread in the sweat of
          their brows. For the <i>abundance </i>of manna made them to despise
          it. If we have fullness of bread, we ought to be cautious lest we
          despise the mercies of God, the giver of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We ought especially to be on our guard against despising our spiritual
          privileges, which we enjoy in so great abundance without molestation.
          Estates have been given in former days for a few leaves of the Bible,
          and gospel ordinances were attended at the hazard of life. For those
          who know what spiritual hunger means, will break through stone walls
          for the bread of life — but those who are full in their own
          apprehension, will despise the riches of divine goodness, and God will
          send them away empty.

          When a bird wanders from her nest, and flies about at random, she is
          in danger of becoming the prey of the fowler or the hawk. Just so,
          when a man abides not at home, when he ought to be employed in his
          business, or when he leaves his calling without a sufficient reason —
          he exposes himself to great inconveniences, and sometimes to dangers.
          He loses his good name, and his estate is likely to go to ruin; he
          learns habits of idleness and dissipation, and gets into company that
          may very probably corrupt his morals.

          Let every man abide with God in that calling in which he is called,
          endeavoring to perform the duties of it conscientiously, that the
          teaching of God our Savior may be adorned. God assigns to every one of
          us our station in life, and we ought to keep it until the call of
          Providence warrants us to make a change in it. When our health, or the
          necessities of our families, or a well-grounded respect of doing
          greater service to God, or some other important consideration, will
          justify our change of place — then we do not come under the censure of
          the wise man, nor do we run the risk that others do, who wantonly and
          causelessly change their place. We are safe in
          <i>following Providence</i>, although it is dangerous to run before
          it, or to attempt to set ourselves free from it — as Jonah did, who
          sought to flee from the presence of the Lord by wandering from his
          place — but soon found that the way of duty is the only way of safety
          and comfort. Paul joins with Solomon in testifying against those who
          abide not in their place, to fulfill the duties of it.

          Perfume and incense diffuse their fragrances around, by which men's

          a well chosen friend cheers the soul better than the sweetest flowers,
          or the most precious fragrances. His amiable virtues, and his
          affectionate fondness beaming from his eyes, and breathing in his
          words and actions, make him the joy of our hearts, and diffuse the
          sweetest sensations of delight into our bosom. Friends are useful at
          all times. They give a relish to the pleasures of life, and their
          society makes the labors of it delightful — but at the times when we
          need advice, or meet with perplexities, the advantage of their
          friendship is best understood.

        <p align="justify">
          Other men often give us such advice as suits their own interest or
          humor; they cannot, at least, enter into our interests, and judge what
          advice is most proper to be given to us, so well as the friends of our
          bosom, who are acquainted with our business and our dispositions, and
          whose fidelity will dispose them to give us advice, according to the
          best of their understanding.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In many cases advice is necessary for us, as Solomon frequently tells
          us. For a man perplexed with difficulties, or surprised by some
          unexpected accident, is not so well qualified to judge what is fit to
          be done, as another person would be who has no superior degree of
          wisdom — but has the advantage of more composure and sedateness. To
          have a bosom friend at such a time to take a share of our sorrows, to
          direct our behavior, to assist us in our time of need — is a great
          relief to the mind, and a restorative to the disquieted heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We ought to value a wise and faithful friend more than gold and
          silver. For how great a part do they contribute of our comfort in
          life, who turn even our days of sorrow into joy, and lighten our
          heaviest burdens. If we expect the pleasures of friendship in their
          full extent, let us remember that our friends have the same claims
          upon us, and the same grounds for them — that we have on the other
          side; and we ought to take the same pleasure in giving, as in
          receiving happiness. For this end we must be furnished, not only with
          an honest and a feeling heart — but with such a measure of wisdom as
          will qualify us for conversing with our friends to our mutual
          improvement, and for giving them counsel in the time of their
          perplexity. He who has friends, must show himself friendly, and must
          continue to do so until the end of his life.

        <p align="justify">
          Clothes and houses are valued for being new — but old friends, like
          old wine, are entitled to the greatest share of our esteem, and we
          must not forsake them when they give us no good reason for it. To
          exchange an old friend for a new one, is to manifest a fickle
          disposition, unfit and unworthy to enjoy the blessings of friendship.
          Some people cool in their friendships through an instability of mind,
          and can give no reason for it but their own humor. Others are no less
          unfit to taste the pleasures of a cordial and lasting friendship,
          because they are so <i>peevish </i>that they can bear with no one, or
          so unforgiving that they cannot love those by whom they think they
          have been offended.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The faults that we ourselves have been guilty of towards our friends
          are more likely than anything to cool our affections to them, through
          an apprehension that they must stick in their hearts. But if we can
          forgive the trivial offences of our friends, why may we not believe
          that they can forgive ours also? Do we imagine that all generosity is
          confined to ourselves?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who are capable of such unpardonable faults were never fit for
          being friends to any man. If the faults of our friends, or the
          differences that may take place between them and us, will not justify
          us in giving up with them; it is a scandalous thing to desert them in
          the time of their distress, when they have most need of our
          friendship. A brother is born for adversity, and a friend loves at all
          times. He is no genuine friend who proves to us in our time of
          calamity, like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "A friend cannot be known in prosperity, and an enemy cannot be hidden
          in adversity." We must not forsake our own friend, for that would be
          to forsake our second self; and we must not forsake our father's
          friend, for that would make us guilty of a double ingratitude of the
          basest sort that we can practice towards men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our father's friends, if they are honest, are the best possessions
          that they can leave us. If Naboth would not sell, for any price, the
          inheritance left him by his fathers — but kept it in spite of an Ahab
          and a Jezebel, until he was stoned — then shall we show such
          irreverence to the memory of our fathers, as to give up, without any
          price, the most precious possessions which they have bequeathed to us.
          <i>Solomon </i> carried on his father's friendly fellowship with
          Hiram, because he had shared with his father in all his afflictions.
          <i>Rehoboam </i>would have been a wiser and happier man, if he had
          followed the example and precept of his father.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Trust in our friends is a duty which we owe them, as well as fidelity,
          and our confidence will be made to appear in the use we make of their
          kindness in the time of our distress. The house of a trustworthy and
          warm friend is then preferable to that of a cold and unreliable
          brother. Brethren by birth, have, for the most part, less attachment
          to one another than those friends who single out one another, not from
          accident, or relation of kindred — but from the harmony of their
          minds, and their mutual kind affections. Greater acts of heroism have
          been performed by those who have been knit by such voluntary and
          endearing ties, than by any kind of relations for one another.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is a friend that sticks closer than a brother, and we do him
          honor by placing an entire confidence in him when we need his
          assistance. At his house we shall meet with a more cordial reception,
          than we can expect from a brother, and shall hear none of those
          upbraidings which the unfortunate too often hear in the houses of
          their near relations.

          not forsake our own and our father's friend, shall we ever forsake our
          own God, and the God of our pious father, who is infinitely the best
          of friends, and disdains not to call us by the endearing name of
          friends to himself.

        <i> <p align="justify">'As is the mother, so is her daughter,'</p></i

        which disgrace his son. Even if his character is so clear that there is
        no room for this — yet it will be judged that the father is in part
        accessory to his son's faults, by neglecting his education, by imprudent
        rigor, or foolish indulgence, or by carelessness in the example which he
        set before him. Although men are frequently guilty of great injustice,
        by making a whole family accountable for the behavior of those who are
        the blemishes of it — yet there is often too much reason for concluding
        that some neglect or mismanagement of the father has afforded scope for
        the irregularities of his family.
        <p align="justify">
          David was justly chargeable on this account, in his behavior towards
          the three eldest of his sons, of whom we have any particular account.
          God himself ordered that under the New Testament, none are to be

          We cannot tell whether morning greetings were in use among the

          The blessing or praising of one's friends is not here absolutely
          condemned. When praises and blessings are a proper expression of
          gratitude, when they are a probable means of exciting to virtuous
          conduct, when they are needful to vindicate a character unjustly
          attacked, and when they are needful to revive a spirit overwhelmed
          with a false humility and groundless terrors, they deserve no blame.

          But he that blesses and praises his friend in high swelling words, and
          seeks opportunities for that purpose, letting no time pass, however
          unseasonable, for loading with commendations the person whose
          friendship he affects — is to be suspected of <i>flattery </i>and base
          designs, and therefore his blessings shall be counted for a curse
          either to his friend, or to himself, or to both. If his friend is
          wise, he will be as much displeased with these blessings as if they
          were curses. For they are an evidence that the
          <i>fawning flatterer </i>has a very poor opinion of the person whom he
          hopes to gratify by such methods, and that he looks upon him to be a

          If those whose favor is thus solicited have their judgments so much
          biased by self-conceit as to relish it — then every one of their vices
          is strengthened, their pride in particular is swelled, and their
          character is ruined by it — for all men will look upon them to be
          fools overrun with vanity and self-esteem. Such flatteries will be a
          curse to those who utter them. For they are guilty of spreading a net
          for their neighbor's feet, and whether they are entangled or not, the

          "The contentions of a wife," says Solomon, in one of his former

          and tells us that they are like a continual dripping on a very rainy
          day. When a man is exposed to the weather in a very rainy day, he
          finds his situation very unpleasant, only he has this great comfort
          that his house is not far distant, and therefore he will soon find a
          shelter — but

          anything he knows, embittered by clamor and noise beating constantly

          from his house — but a man cannot be always away from home without
          leaving behind him the means of his subsistence, and his beloved
          children, and everything dear to him. And when he is in the field, or
          in the house of some friend — yet the noise that he has heard, and is
          still doomed to hear within his own walls, rings constantly in his
          ears.

          nothing of less power, can do this great work. May he not then conceal
          his dishonor from the world? He may as soon shackle the wind, and
          command it to blow where he pleases, or hinder the ointment which is
          poured on his right hand (which is almost constantly in motion) from
          spreading its fragrance through the whole room where he sits. The
          clamors of an imperious wife will be heard, not only in the house —
          but in the street, and through every corner of the town. It is
          impossible to force into her so much sense, as to make her regard
          either her own honor, or the credit of her husband. For if she had the
          least degree of common understanding, or if she were capable of
          receiving any advice — she could never bear the thought of being the
          scourge and torment of that man to whom she is bound by every motive

          The uninspired sages of ancient days concur with Solomon in condemning

          useful employment of the mind. If we are dejected with grief, their
          kind attentions, and seasonable discourse, have a happy effect in
          alleviating our distress, and softening our sorrows. They keep the

          souls with holy zeal. "Those who fear the Lord shall find him. Whoever

          masters. Masters are bound by the law of God, to behave not only
          justly — but kindly, towards honest servants. But even if they should
          prove ungrateful, there is a master and Lord in Heaven, who shall
          recompense with divine liberality those servants who performed their

          The water is <i>nature's looking glass</i>, in which we discern our
          faces; and the face which is seen in the water has a resemblance,
          though not an exact and perfect image of that face which looks into
          it. So likewise there is a resemblance in one man's heart to another.
          As God has fashioned the bodies of men like one another, so the heart
          of every man has the like faculties and passions, and none of the
          human race is born either a brute or an angel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is, indeed, a difference of faces, although in water that
          difference is not well discerned. There is likewise a natural
          difference in the tempers and understandings of men. And yet none of
          us have reason to be proud or insolent, for we are but men, and our
          neighbors are men also. Some of them have miserably disgraced the
          human nature — but others have improved upon that corruption of human
          nature which is common to all. Instead of triumphing over the the
          wicked, we ought to mourn over the ruins of our condition, and to
          adore that mercy which has kept us from sinking down, by our natural
          weight of corruption, to the same deplorable depth of wickedness.

          When the holy martyr Bradford heard of any person that had been guilty
          of an atrocious act of guilt, he used to strike his hand upon his
          heart, and say, "<i>Here </i>is the seed of all that wickedness!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is a mighty change made upon the heart by the grace of God,
          creating it anew in Christ Jesus. But the saints will not boast on
          this account, for they well know what they once were, and who made
          them to differ from others, and from their former selves. They still
          feel the body of death within themselves, and heartily sympathize with
          them who are yet nothing but flesh.

          As the corrupt heart in one man is like the heart in another man — so
          there is a resemblance in one Christian to another. There is a
          difference between Christians, as there is a difference of stature and
          feature and understanding among men. But there are the same outlines
          of character among all real Christians, so that the representations
          made of the hearts of David, and Paul, and other godly men, in
          Scripture, are of great use to us, not only to direct our course of
          life — but to assist us in searching our own hearts. We have not the
          same degrees of faith in Christ, and love to God, and delight in his
          word, as these holy men — but if we are true saints — then the same
          dispositions, though with less vigor, will rule in our lives, for
          every Christian has the same sanctifying Spirit, though his operations
          in all are not equally signal.

          >"Death and destruction are never satisfied — so the eyes of man are
          never satisfied."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Although heart answers to heart — yet there are such varieties in the
          hearts of men, that we cannot search out the secret workings of the
          hearts of our fellow men — and it is a happy thing that we cannot do
          it. But because it is of importance to us to know in some degree the
          thoughts, and wishes, and designs of others, we have some means of
          revealing them. They can inform us by their tongues what is in their
          hearts. And when they think proper, for reasons of their own, to lie
          with their tongues — their eyes often betray them, for in the eyes
          love, and anger, and envy, and desire, often paint themselves so
          visibly, that they cannot but be perceived in spite of every endeavor
          to conceal them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          One of the many things in which men agree with one another, is the
          insatiableness of the desires of the heart, (which are revealed in the
          eyes.) The invisible world is never full of souls, and the grave is
          never satiated with the carcasses of men. After the innumerable
          millions that have been buried in death — they are still crying,
          <i>"Give! Give!" </i>and will continue their importunate demands until
          that day when death and Hell are to be cast into the lake of fire and
          brimstone.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The heart of men is equally clamorous for something to satisfy it.
          They enlarge their desires as Hell, and cannot be satisfied. If you
          should give them a world, they will weep for another world. They think
          if they had this and the other object of their wishes, that they would
          be happy — but they find that the gratification of their desires, is
          but like drink to one in a dropsy, which does not allay — but increase
          his thirst.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The improvement of this truth is taught by Solomon himself, at great
          length, in the book of <i>Ecclesiastes</i>. The insatiableness of
          men's desires is one of the arguments by which he proves the vanity of
          the world, and the unsatisfactory nature of its richest enjoyments.
          Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever — and he
          will never be happy until his heart is suited to his end. To seek
          happiness in this world, is to seek the living among the dead. It is
          to seek to be happy in opposition to the irreversible determination of
          the author of happiness, who framed our souls with such large and
          boundless desires that they never can he filled — but by him who fills
          all in all. The only way of being happy is to comply with the gracious
          invitation of our Redeemer, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto me
          and drink."

          >"The refining pot for silver and the furnace for gold — but man is
          tested by the praise he receives."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          The refining pot tries silver, and the furnace reveals whether gold be
          genuine and pure, so praise bestowed upon a man, reveals the reigning
          temper of his mind. If a wise and humble man is praised, he will not
          be thereby elevated in his own mind. If the criticism conferred upon
          him is not just, he will not think himself warranted to lay any stress
          upon it, for it is an evidence of pride when a man despises undeserved
          reproaches — and yet prides himself on commendations which are equally
          groundless, and therefore equally vain. If it is a piece of baseness
          to be dejected by undeserved reproaches — then it is a piece of vanity
          to be puffed up by praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But if a wise man is commended upon good grounds, he does not consider
          himself as entitled to the chief praise of those good qualities which
          he possesses, or those good actions which he has performed — because
          it is God alone who makes him to differ from other men; and everything
          that is of him, and through him — ought to be ascribed to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When a bad man is praised for those qualities that he has, or those
          actions that he has done — he spoils all their value and credit by the
          greediness with which he swallows the commendations. He does not
          ascribe the praise of them to God — but like Herod wishes to
          appropriate all the glory to himself. Or if he gives the praise to
          God, he does it only in words and professions, like the self-conceited
          Pharisee.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But when a fool receives praise that is founded only on falsehood, or
          on flattering misconstructions of his actions, he is so fond of
          everything that tends to his own advancement, whether right or wrong —
          that he swells with pride. And as if other people knew him better than
          himself, he can prevail on himself to believe everything they are
          pleased to say in his favor. Darkness will be light, and vice will be
          virtue in his eyes, when it serves to nourish his pride and
          self-esteem.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is one good effect which may arise out of undeserved
          commendations to a wise man. They will be a motive to him to deserve
          them, that men may not run into mistakes by their good opinion of him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Praise ought to be administered with great caution to the best of men,
          for as it reveals some men to be nothing but dross, so it shows godly
          men to have too much dross in their composition. The compliments of
          the ambassadors of Babylon were harmful to no less a man than
          Hezekiah. And to Herod, the praise of men proved deadly.

          How deplorably perverse are the hearts of fallen men! Let
          <i>favor </i>be showed to the wicked — yet will they not learn
          righteousness; they will deal unjustly, and will not behold the
          majesty of the Lord. Let them be afflicted, and bruised, and crushed
          under the judgments of God, or punishments inflicted by the hand of
          men, as wheat is crushed in a mortar, or between the upper and nether
          millstones — yet they will refuse to part with their folly.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Pharaoh</p></i>was broken by the terrible plagues
        which God inflicted upon him, and sometimes he confessed his folly, and
        promised amendment — and yet he returned to his folly, like the dog to
        his vomit, until he was utterly destroyed. For when God fights against a
        man, he will be sure to overcome. <i> <p align="justify">Ahaz</p></i>had
        the sermons of the prince of the later prophets to enforce the language
        of the rod. Isaiah preached with celestial eloquence. God smote him with
        a succession of the most alarming judgments — yet in the time of his
        distress, Ahaz sinned more and more against the Lord. Multitudes walk in
        his paths, refusing to receive correction, and thereby exposing
        themselves to tenfold condemnation.
        <p align="justify">
          To what purpose then, does the rod serve for the fool's back? Does not
          the rod of correction drive foolishness away from the heart? It does
          when the blessing of God accompanies it, and it must be used with a
          dependence upon him who has appointed it. Without the concurrence of
          divine grace, the rod will not drive away folly from the hearts of
          young people, and far less from the hearts of those in whom corruption
          receives double strength, from the superadded force of custom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The judgments of God against the wicked tend greatly to aggravate sin,
          when they have not a reforming effect; and therefore when they are in
          the earth, we ought to pour out fervent supplications to God that he
          may subdue, by his almighty grace, the stubbornness of the hearts of
          men, and make them to learn righteousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If we are under the rod, let us consider the design of it, and the
          intolerable load of guilt which we must contract by continuing
          unhumbled; and under a sense of the hardness and instability of our
          hearts, let us turn unto the Lord with those supplications which God
          himself puts into our mouths.

          To the precepts so often given us about <i>diligence </i> in the
          business of our calling, some will object that they have plenty of
          servants to manage their affairs, and they have no occasion to toil
          their own bodies, or fatigue their minds with them. But Solomon tells
          them that they may soon come to poverty, if they will not take the
          trouble of minding their own affairs, and inspecting their servants.
          Every man ought to be acquainted with the state of his own business,
          and look to it with his own eyes. "I am in affluent circumstances,"
          you will perhaps say. But if you will not mind your business, you may
          soon be as poor as Lazarus.

          You have not the riches of a crowned head — but if you had, they might
          be wasted and scattered by carelessness, which has often turned
          princes into beggars or bankrupts. Although there was never a richer
          king than Solomon — yet he was sensible of the necessity of attending
          to his affairs, and acquired a part of his reputation for wisdom from
          the management of his domestic concerns.

        <p align="justify">
          Solomon tells us in another place, that the instability and
          uncertainty of earthly things, after all our care, is a motive to draw
          off our hearts from them, and to fix our eyes upon nobler objects. But
          he tells us, in this place, that the perishing nature of earthly
          things is likewise a reason for bestowing a moderate and lawful share
          of our attention upon our temporal interests. Let us do what we can,
          the world cannot be secured to us, and therefore we must choose a more
          durable portion. But by the blessing of God upon our honest labors, we
          may in most cases expect to enjoy a competency of earthly blessings.
          Whereas negligence in our earthly business will in all probability
          reduce us to those straits which would embitter our days, and those
          shifts which would harm our credit and our consciences. God's bounty
          is a great encouragement to our industry.

          may be gathered for the use of those beasts which serve for the use of
          man. Does God stretch out his hand with blessings — and shall man,
          ungratefully and foolishly despise the bounty, and lose the benefit of
          it by his own neglect and sloth? If God puts a price into our hands,

          sought after. You shall have a comfortable maintenance for yourselves
          and your families; your maid servants shall have plenty of that food
          that is proper and convenient for them.

          On the other side, if you neglect your business, you bring poverty not

          worse than an infidel," or even a robber in the Arabian desert.

        <p align="justify">
          But how does our Lord say, "Do not labor for the food that perishes —
          but for that which endures unto everlasting life?" His meaning is,
          that we are to labor in the first and chief place, for that
          <i> enduring bread</i>. If we must not be careless about our bodies,
          and the interests of this life, which passes away like a cloud — then
          what care can be too great about our everlasting interests? If men
          must look well to the state of their flocks and herds, they are guilty
          of insufferable negligence who have some of Christ's flock committed
          to their care, as parents, or teachers, or pastors — and yet
          thoughtlessly allow them to perish.
