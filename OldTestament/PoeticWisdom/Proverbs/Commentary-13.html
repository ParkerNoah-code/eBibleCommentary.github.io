          <b>"The wise woman builds her house."</b> Diligence in business is
          often recommended by Solomon, as a means of obtaining riches, or at
          least a competency. He here informs us, that the care of the wife is
          necessary, as well as the industry of the husband.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          A wise woman is frugal, and saves. She is industrious, and gains. She
          is pious and charitable, and brings down a blessing from Heaven upon
          her family. If the houses of Laban and Potiphar were blessed for the
          sake of pious servants, a house must be still more favored by
          Providence, for the sake of a pious wife.
        </p>

            "But with her own hands, the foolish one tears hers down!"
          </p></b
        >As if it were a small thing in her eye to allow it to go to ruin, she
        uses her own hands to demolish it! The <i>idle </i>and
        <i>careless </i> woman uses one of her hands — but the
        <i>extravagant </i>woman makes use of both hands, in this ruinous work!
        How soon, in such a case, must a house become a heap of rubbish.
        <p align="justify">
          This verse directs men in the choice of wives. A woman may be rich and
          beautiful — and yet prove a <i>plague </i>to her husband and his
          family, for nothing is more necessary to ruin a house than a bad wife.
          But a wise and virtuous woman is a rich portion to her husband, though
          she brings nothing with her. Her father would give her a portion if he
          were able — but let it be remembered, that she is a daughter of the
          Lord Almighty, who gives a better portion of graces and blessings with
          her, than the wealthiest of earthly parents can bestow!

          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 14:2.</p></font
          >"He who walks in his uprightness fears the Lord — but he who is
          perverse in his ways despises him."</b
        >
        Most men <i>pretend </i>to the fear of God — but pretensions go for
        nothing when they are confuted by <i>facts</i>. The scripture lays down
        plain marks, by which we may know whether we are really possessed of
        that truth of religion, which lies in an affectionate reverence to the
        Most High God.

        <p align="justify">
          The truly godly man, is he who walks in his uprightness. That faith
          which is not attended with godly sincerity in the heart, nor endeavors
          after universal obedience in the life — is a <i>dead faith</i>, which
          gives no evidence of spiritual life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The godly man not only <i>receives </i>Christ — but <i> walks </i>in
          him. He not only enters in at the strait gate — but continues
          traveling in the narrow way, until he comes to the end of his faith
          and holiness in the heavenly world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He walks in his uprightness, showing a constant regard, not only to
          the common duties of a man and a Christian — but to those also that
          are incumbent on him on account of the particular relations and
          circumstances in which he is placed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Upright walking is a sure and true evidence of the fear of the Lord;
          for that fear consists in a deep impression of the divine excellency
          and authority, by which men are disposed to abstain from whatever God
          forbids, however pleasing to the flesh it may be — and to walk before
          him unto all well pleasing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Men of corrupt minds and a perverse behavior, may speak much to the
          praise of God, and profess a high veneration for him — but they are so
          far from fearing the Lord, that they despise him. Every willful sin is
          a plain proof that they . . .<br />
          disregard his authority, <br />
          defy his vengeance, <br />
          insult his patience, and <br />
          turn the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ into a license for sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let stubborn sinners learn from this observation, the exceeding
          sinfulness of their perverse conduct. It contains in it a downright
          <i>contempt </i>for God, which is a crime that can scarcely be charged
          upon devils! What punishment is sufficient for such as despise the
          authority of their Maker, and pour contempt on the grace of a Savior?
          To them it shall be said, "Behold, you despisers — and wonder, and
          perish!"

          >"A fool's talk brings a rod to his back, but the lips of the wise
          protect them." </b
        >Pride is a root of bitterness, producing a rod of insolence and
        rudeness in the mouth of the foolish. By this rod they strike and wound
        their neighbors, who are better than they — but it proves also a rod to
        the backs of themselves. The wise man does not call the instrument of
        their punishment a <i>sword</i> — but a <i>rod</i>; meaning probably in
        this manner to intimate, that their pride shall be abased by punishment
        of an ignominious kind. They shall not die like heroes — but their
        punishment shall be that of slaves and fools, and shall yet prove
        destructive to them, for God can arm with vengeance the meanest
        instruments. <i>Pharaoh </i>was tormented by flies and frogs, and
        <i> Herod </i>was eaten up with despicable worms.
        <p align="justify">
          But the lips of the wise will preserve them from the rod which is in
          the mouth of fools, and from that vengeance which overtakes the
          proud.<i>
            The humility of their hearts instructs their mouths in the language
            of meekness and kindness — and their piety and prudence preserve
            their lips from speaking evil.

          "Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty, but from the strength
          of an ox comes an abundant harvest."</b
        >
        As the wise man teaches us to be diligent in business, so the providence
        of God encourages us to practice this virtue. As he has done so in
        giving us other animals to assist us in our labors, so we ought
        thankfully to employ them. Where no oxen or other beasts of husbandry
        are, there is no food for man or beast — but there is much increase by
        their labor.
        <p align="justify">
          Oxen and donkeys testify, as Isaiah speaks, against the ingratitude of
          God's people; and here Solomon insinuates that they bear witness
          against the laziness of the sluggard also. If oxen do not employ their
          strength for our benefit, the fault is not theirs — but ours. If oxen
          serve us so well — then we should not grudge those who food which they
          earn by their labor, and which is necessary for the preservation of
          their strength.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God would not have the mouth of the ox to be muzzled when he was
          treading out the corn. That law was in part, though not chiefly
          designed for the benefit of oxen; for the God who made all things,
          shows his regard and bounty to them in his laws, as well as in his
          providence. We should praise God for his bounty to the irrational
          creatures, since they not only reveal the riches of the Lord — but
          perform useful services to us. What is man, that God should give us
          the dominion over so many useful animals, and keep them in subjection
          to us, even in our fallen state?

          lies."</b
        >
        In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established —
        but the witnesses ought to be men of veracity, otherwise twenty
        witnesses are no better than so many ciphers.
        <p align="justify">
          A faithful witness is one who will not lie or deceive — but a man who
          has no <i>principle of honesty</i>, will, on the smallest temptation,
          utter lies without scruple.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Judges, and juries, and elders of the church, must be cautious what
          testimonies they receive. Justice requires that no man should suffer
          in his person or character, upon exceptionable grounds. What man can
          enjoy security — if liars are to receive credit?
          <i>How wicked a character is that of a liar! </i>His testimony cannot
          serve his neighbor, and ought not to hurt him. In his mouth, even
          truth is suspected for a lie.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is unjust and uncharitable to indulge suspicions against our
          neighbors, on the report of a liar, or even of common fame, which is
          generally a common lie.

        >A scorner may seek wisdom — but he never seeks it with right views, nor
        does he seek after that wisdom which best deserves the name. The wisdom
        of the prudent is to understand his way — but the scorner seeks wisdom
        to gratify a intricate imagination, to feed his pride; and to enable
        him, by the display of his wit, to make a show of wisdom.
        <p align="justify">
          But he cannot find it, and the reason is plain — he has not a due
          value for the wisdom that comes from God, and he seeks it not with
          that earnestness and humility without which it cannot be found. He
          does not resign his understanding to the instructions of God, nor can
          his pride allow him to receive with meekness the instructions and
          reproofs which give wisdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Greeks sought after wisdom — but Christ crucified was foolishness
          to them. They were already too wise to admit of the preaching of the
          cross, and scorned a tent-maker who would inform them of new
          doctrines, which had never entered into their own minds, and who would
          prove them by other methods than their own favorite devices —
          eloquence and reasoning.

        For he knows the inestimable worth of knowledge, and seeks for it as for

        <p align="justify">
          Lukewarm professors, who are perhaps the least dangerous of bad
          companions, will, if we take pleasure in their company, transfuse
          their lukewarmness into us. Ephraim mixed with the people, and he soon
          became a cake not turned.

        <p align="justify">
          But when are we to leave the company of a foolish man? As soon as we
          perceive that he has not the lips of knowledge. As trees are known by
          their fruit, so men are known by their words and works. But they are
          soonest known by their words, which are the most plentiful and the
          easiest products of the heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are not to suppose men to be fools without evidence — but profane
          or foolish words come from folly in the heart; for a godly man out of
          the good treasure of his heart, brings forth good things — and an evil
          man out of the evil treasure of his heart, brings forth evil things.

          those who think they stand. Let Peter be a witness, who on this ground
          ventured into temptation, and fell before it. But though we were
          secure against all danger to ourselves, our rashness might embolden
          weaker Christians to mingle with dangerous society, and so our
          practice may prove a temptation to those for whom Christ died.

          This commandment should strike terror into the wicked. Since God will
          not allow His redeemed children to keep company with them on earth —

        Foolish men make a sport of their own sins, when they ought to be

        punished — they think that punishment shall never come. Or, like brute
        beasts, they do not consider what shall be hereafter. But if eternal
        burnings are a serious matter — then the sin that kindles them can be no
        just matter of indifference or sport.

          Fools sport at the sins of others, which is far less human than to

        The righteous have a principle of charity, that disposes them to rejoice

          frequently too strong for them to subdue, and when they would comfort
          themselves against sorrow, their hearts are faint within them. Job's
          friends would not have vexed him so much with their severe censures on
          his complaints, had they thoroughly weighed his griefs and calamities.

          It is a great comfort to Christians, that our Redeemer bore our
          griefs, and knows our sorrows, and is touched with the feeling of
          them. For this reason, the broken in spirit should pour forth all
          their sorrows at the throne of grace, and firmly expect from it all
          needful supports.

          There are joys that equally exceed the knowledge of a stranger,
          especially the joys of religion, which an unrenewed man cannot relish
          or understand. These are sometimes unspeakable, and full of glory.
          Christians do not now enter into the joy of their Lord — but streams
          of joy enter into their souls from the overflowing fountain of
          pleasures, and refresh their hearts amidst the sorrows of this
          wilderness to such a degree, that they can rejoice greatly in the God
          of their salvation, at the very seasons when they are pitied by the
          world, as of all men the most miserable.

          The unsaved cannot understand how all the ways of wisdom should be
          pleasantness and peace — but they should consider that they lack those
          purified understandings and affections, without which spiritual joys
          cannot be relished. Let them believe the Scripture, and the experience
          of all godly men. Let them taste and see that the Lord is good, and
          that there is no lack to those who fear him. Christians do indeed feel
          sorrows peculiar to themselves — but these are the <i>seeds </i>of
          inexpressible gladness.

        <b>"Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief."</b>
        The joys of this world cannot make a man happy. They are often merely
        external and false, and they commonly end in heaviness. It is very
        common for men to put on a <i>face </i>of joy, while the
        <i>heart </i>pines away with grief.

          Some put on the appearance of joy to prevent or remove suspicions
          about their behavior, and endeavor to cover a guilty conscience with

          There are others still, who laugh when their hearts are sorrowful,

          misfortunes. They are like the Stoic philosopher, who, under a severe

        departs, in the course of his life from God and his laws with full
        purpose of heart. Such a man is never so filled with sin as he desires
        to be — and takes much pleasure in it. He shall, however, be filled with
        sin, either in this world or the next, when, he feels its painful
        consequences, and finds that God has marked all his steps, and will not
        acquit him from <i>any </i>of his iniquities. This will be the end of
        all impenitent sinners — but chiefly of such as have not only forsaken

        His good works are not the <i>grounds </i>of his confidence — but
        through Christ they are accepted of God, and graciously rewarded. "Say

        Readiness to believe what people say, being supposed to proceed from a
        good temper, is commonly regarded a small fault. But none has ever
        proved more mischievous to the world. Daily experience shows that many
        have their fortunes ruined by giving too easy credit to those knaves who
        will say or swear anything that serves their own interests. History is
        full of examples of men who have lost their lives by means of their
        credulity, among whom were those great men Abner and Amass. Others have
        by this means been robbed of their comfort, as was Jacob for the space
        of twenty years, though he may well be excused for believing the
        mournful tidings of his son's death, especially when confirmed by so
        many plausible circumstances.

          Some have been betrayed into the worst of sins, by believing
          groundless reports of others, as Saul in the case of David, and we
          might almost add, David himself in the case of Mephibosheth. The
          nation of the Jews was threatened with desolation by Ahasuerus, who

          examination.

          A prudent man will therefore look well to his goings. He will not risk
          his fortune and happiness, his life and soul, by believing groundless
          reports, or receiving doctrines that are destitute of sufficient
          proof. He will not withdraw his love from men; or do them hurt,
          because they have the misfortune to become the butt of slander.

          There is nothing in which we are so ready to be deceived as in points
          of religion, and no errors are so dangerous as these. A prudent man
          will therefore call no man on earth <i>master</i> — but will look upon
          Christ as his only Master. The Scriptures he considers as his only
          rule, and the Spirit who dictated them as their great interpreter. He
          searches the Scripture, and seeks wisdom from God by daily prayer. As
          Christ is the only way to the Father, the man that is spiritually wise
          enters into his religious course, and walks in it, depending on this
          Savior alone for acceptance.

        <p align="justify">
          As there is great danger in stepping aside from the path of God's
          commandments, he pays a strict regard to the least of them. Many
          deceivers are gone out into the world, and the old deceiver is still
          walking about, seeking whom he may mislead and destroy. The prudent
          man is therefore sober and vigilant. He informs himself of the devices
          of these enemies of his salvation, and while he guards against them by
          taking heed to God's word, he commits himself to the guidance of him
          who led Joseph like a flock through the desert, and arrives safely at
          that paradise where there is no subtle serpent to betray.

          from the devil and Hell. Noah is an instance of this fear. Paul
          himself, that noble believer, who was always triumphing in Christ,
          lived under the influence of this holy temper, and kept his body in

          precepts, considering its threatenings with awe, and fearing lest he
          should seem to come short of the promised blessings. This fear is a

          God's people are under a cloud of disgrace, they have full assurance
          that it will be soon blown away. Christ himself was once a servant of
          rulers — but all things are now put under his feet; and it is a
          faithful saying: If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.

          >"The poor is hated even of his own neighbor — but the rich has many
          friends."</b
        >
        The poor man's neighbor, in this place, must signify one that lives in
        his neighborhood, or one that is obliged by the ties of relation to love
        him. All our neighbors of the human race have a title to our love — but
        those whom Providence has connected with us by the bonds of vicinity or
        relation, have a double title to our regard; and to despise or hate
        them, or to be indifferent to their happiness, is a very great sin.
        <p align="justify">
          Our love to our neighbor deserves not the name, if it is founded only
          upon his riches. Poverty, or distress, instead of diminishing our love
          to them, ought to draw it forth into action. It is base to profess
          love to people in the time of their prosperity, and to be cold to them
          in the day of their distress. All men censure Job's friends for
          behaving harshly to him at a time when they could not show too much
          tenderness and compassion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The rich has many friends — but little reason to place much confidence
          in many of them. They are generally not friends to himself — but to
          his money and his table. Let him wear rags, and live on bread and
          water — and he will find who are his real friends.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us test our love to our neighbors, for there is much hypocrisy in
          men's regard to their fellow-creatures, as well as in that respect
          which they show to their Maker. Sincere love to Christ cleaves to him,
          whether religion is well or ill spoken of; and true love to our
          neighbors is the same, whether they are in adverse or prosperous
          circumstances — and love appears most when there is most need to
          reveal it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The poor need not be discouraged because their friends have forsaken
          them. It is not true that their friends have forsaken them, if they
          have given them no other reason for it than becoming poor. They were
          not real friends, but dissemblers — and it is no loss to know their
          insincerity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They have reason to rejoice that
          <i>Christ is the poor man's friend</i>, and that he shows his
          friendship most in the season of greatest need.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The rich man needs not boast of the multitude of his friends, for many
          of them are very probably dissemblers, who want to serve themselves at
          his expense. A man need not call himself rich, although he has many
          guineas in his pocket, if he has reason to think that most of them are
          counterfeits.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The friendship of Christ is necessary for him, as well as the poor
          man, and in that he may rejoice and triumph at all times. David was
          driven from his throne, and multitudes of his friends became his
          enemies — but his rejoicing was this, that he had
          <i>one sure and all-sufficient Friend! </i>

        <b>"He who despises his neighbor sins." </b>However common it is for men
        to hate or despise the poor — it is a great sin, and exposes men to
        misery. A man's poverty divests him not of that relation to ourselves,
        and to our Maker and our Savior, which gives him a title to our love.
        Nor does his poverty weaken the obligation of that great commandment,
        which requires us to love our neighbors as ourselves.
        <p align="justify">
          We show our contempt of the poor, not only by <i> trampling </i>upon
          them — but by overlooking them, or by withholding that help for which
          their distress loudly calls. The Levite and the Priest that declined
          the giving of assistance to the wounded traveler on the way to
          Jericho, were notorious breakers of the law of love, in the judgment
          of our Lord. The good Samaritan was the only man that performed the
          duty of a neighbor. He is an unhappy man, who is chargeable with this

        they be punished. The plotters of evil promise to themselves success in
        their plans, and expect great advantage from them. But are they not
        grossly mistaken? Undoubtedly they are. They shall be baffled by the
        wisdom and power of the God whose kingdom rules over all. They may bring

        of them, to gain their ends. Instead of doing hurt to the people of God,
        and disappointing the purposes of the Most High God, concerning his own
        glory, and the happiness of his chosen people — the wrath of man shall
        praise God, and promote the salvation of his people. And what remains of
        the wrath of God's enemies, beyond what would serve these glorious
        purposes, shall be restrained.

          Whatever profit wicked men propose to themselves, they shall find to
          be loss; and if they should triumph in the accomplishment of their
          devices — a moment will put an end to their boasting. The builders of
          <i>Babel </i>expected to make themselves a glorious name — but they
          made themselves a by-word to every generation. The proud king of
          <i>Babylon </i> expected to set his throne above the stars, and to be
          like the Most High God, and with that view he ravaged the nations, and
          turned their countries into deserts. But how is he fallen from Heaven!
          And <i>great Babylon </i> which he built for the honor of his majesty
          — has become the dwelling place of every loathsome creature. Wicked
          men employ their thoughts to contrive harm, and show so much diligence
          in the service of sin, although they have such a miserable reward.

        little good to others by their labors, which are frequently attended
        with much toil, and many disquieting and anxious thoughts to themselves.
        But to Him who sows righteousness, shall be a sure reward at last, for
        his reward is not in the hands of men — but with the Lord, and his work
        is with his God. He cannot, indeed, pretend to merit anything from the

        Him; for he is savingly interested in the <i>promises </i>that are
        derived from the grace of God, and secured by the faithfulness of God.
        If God so exactly fulfills his threatenings against the devisers of evil

          have nothing to do, they bring themselves to poverty by neglecting
          their own. Like the sons of Jacob, when their father refused to send

        Abraham and Lot could not have afforded us so illustrious proofs of

          of everything, did as much honor to him, as his extraordinary
          beneficence while he was the richest man in the East. We honor his
          memory still more, when he wore sackcloth upon his skin, and sat in
          the dust, than at the time when wealth was his robe and his diadem.

          But the foolishness of fools is still folly — when they are in their
          best and highest condition. Riches give a man fair opportunities to
          serve God and man by his wisdom — but instead of making a fool wise,
          they make him seven times more a fool, and render his folly visible to
          the world! If Rehoboam had been in a lower situation, his folly would
          have done less harm in his own time, and might have been forgotten
          when his eyes were closed in death.

          Men are generally eager in the pursuit of riches for themselves and

        disposition, that it is ordinarily used to denote <i>piety </i>in all
        its branches. In piety there is a secure fortress, for godly men are
        safe from every danger, and know, or may know, that they are safe.
        Neither earth nor Hell shall be able to destroy them, for the place of
        their defense is the munition of rocks. They are the children of

          body in its present state. A heart purified by the grace of God, and
          set at liberty from corroding and turbulent passions, enjoys the
          pleasures of a peaceful conscience, and a sweet joy, which gives a
          grace to the countenance, and communicates health and vigor to the
          bones. That cheerful heart which does good like a medicine, is chiefly
          the gift of sacred wisdom; and that benevolence which inclines us to

        worm that shall never die, and fuel to the fire that shall never be

        his misery — but only suspends it a few moments. If he should feed his

          Some allege that God dispenses no rewards and punishments to the
          <i>nations</i> — but such as are the native consequences of their
          behavior, without any particular direction of providence, from a
          regard to their good or bad conduct. But Providence has affixed
          prosperity or misery to virtue or vice, as their natural consequences
          — and we find God punishing many nations on account of their sins, by
          calamities that were not the native results of their sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The histories of Genesis, and Exodus, and Joshua, and the predictions
          of all the prophets concerning the heathen nations, might be quoted in
          proof of this point; and even under the New Testament, we find
          prophecies of the miseries that would cane upon public bodies for
          their sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Great is the regard which a righteous God has for righteousness. The
          virtue even of heathen nations has been rewarded with prosperity, and
          their vices have brought reproach and ruin on them. Righteousness,
          such as heathens could practice, made Greece and Rome to flourish, and
          exalted them to glory. But the last of these nations, after it was
          advanced to the highest pitch of worldly grandeur, was soon brought to
          extreme misery, and debased to the most wretched servitude — when
          corruption and wickedness, in opposition to the dictates of natural
          light, was become common in it.

        <p align="justify">
          Let us all, therefore, if we love our country, oppose wickedness to
          the utmost of our power, for a remnant of righteous people may
          sometimes prove for a time the pillars of a land. It is in the
          interest of kings to promote righteousness, and to discourage iniquity
          among their subjects; and this they will do, if they deserve that
          noble title.

        been made to see their error. Like Ahasuerus, who nourished in his bosom
        that <i>serpent Haman</i>, and overlooked the faithful services of

          Solomon had told us that riches are a crown to the wise — but here he
          tells us that poverty and lowly circumstances will not hinder men from
          being crowned by wisdom. A servant who fears the Lord, and manages the
          affairs entrusted to him with prudence and faithfulness — obtains the

          A foolish servant is a shame to himself and to his master. Although
          for a while his folly and vices may be concealed — yet in the end they
          bring down that displeasure upon him which is often attended with
          vengeance. Some masters may be so ungrateful, as to despise the best
          servants, or through prejudice they may be led to treat them with
          great injustice — but time will convince them of their mistake, and
          cause them to alter their conduct, as we find in the case of David and
          Mephibosheth. But even if they prove so inhuman and wicked as to
          continue to be enemies to their best friends, let such servants
          remember how David was used by Saul, and consider whether he was a
          gainer or a loser by the persecutions he underwent.

          The great King who reigns over Heaven and earth, will reward faithful
          servants, who do honor to his gospel by the proper discharge of the
          duties of their stations; for he does not despise the lowest services
          of the lowest men — but he is a severe Avenger of the wrongs done by
          men, to those with whom his providence has connected them.
