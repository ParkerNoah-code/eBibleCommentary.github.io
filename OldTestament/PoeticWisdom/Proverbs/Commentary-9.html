          Salvation is by grace through faith. This faith works by love,
          producing universal obedience to the law of our Creator and Redeemer.
          This law is summarily comprehended in the ten commandments, and
          published with more particularity in this divinely inspired body of
          Christian morality. Let us study it with attention, and pray that the
          Spirit of Jesus may enable us to understand and practice it.

          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 1.</p></font> "The
          proverbs of Solomon. A wise son brings joy to his father — but a
          foolish son brings grief to his mother."</b
        >
        The first nine chapters are a prefatory address. Now begin the proverbs,
        (or masterly sayings,) properly so called.
        <p align="justify">
          Weighty sayings deserve and gain regard. But how shall we sufficiently
          esteem the proverbs left us by Solomon, which is almost another name
          for wisdom itself! By this inspired philosopher, Divine Wisdom speaks
          to every generation. Were the first of these proverbs to have its due
          influence on mankind, the world would be greatly reformed and blessed
          by its efficacy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A great part of our race are parents — all mankind are, or have been
          children; and by Scripture both parents and children are directed.
          Parents are instructed to use all possible means to make their
          children wise. But how shall they effect this? Is it not the
          prerogative of God to give wisdom? No doubt. But he makes use of
          proper and appointed means for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Would you then derive comfort from your children? Instruct, reprove,
          exhort them, pray for them, recommend true religion to them by your
          example. For thus says the Author of wisdom, "Train up a child in the
          way wherein he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from
          it." But if in some rare instance he should depart from wisdom — then
          your souls will not on that account be stung with self-accusations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Remember, you that are children, how greatly you are indebted to your
          parents, and how much their comfort is bound up in you. Be wise, seek
          useful knowledge, and search for it as for hidden treasure! Walk in
          the fear of the Lord. Let prudence and discretion, (such as Solomon
          teaches,) appear in every part of your conduct. So shall your father
          and mother greatly rejoice, and bless the Lord on your account.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But if you are foolish and unruly — you grieve their spirits, and
          wound the souls that love you with the dearest affection. Consider
          that your <i>mothers </i>bore you with sorrow. Why should your lives
          also be a continual source of pain to their tender hearts! Or why
          should the anxieties of your fathers on your behalf, be rewarded with
          the cutting view of your ungodly lives!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "A wise son brings joy to his father — but a foolish son brings grief
          to his mother." Though he should in no other way express his contempt
          for her — his foolish behavior is a plain proof that he does not value
          his mother's happiness.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></font
          >"Ill-gotten treasures are of no value." </b
        >Ill-gotten riches are called treasures of wickedness. It is an opinion
        generally held by men, that riches, in whatever way procured, will do
        them great service. If, therefore, they cannot come at the possession of
        them by honest means — then they will scrape them together by any means
        in their power.
        <p align="justify">
          But here the Spirit of God tells us, that if a man should heap up
          immense riches to himself, they will profit him nothing. And how can
          they? They are cursed to him. If a moth in his substance, and stings
          in his conscience, and the damnation of Hell — can bring any advantage
          to the robber and extortioner — let them rejoice in their portion.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">"But righteousness delivers from death."</p></b
        >No righteousness but that which is by the faith of Jesus Christ,
        delivers from eternal death. However, he is a gross deceiver of his own
        soul, who pretends to be clothed with it, while be continues to live
        unrighteously. By righteousness, we give to everyone his due; first to
        God, and next to men. This righteousness is a preservative from death
        and misery of every kind. How?
        <p align="justify">
          Through the gracious protection of Him who keeps the path of the
          righteous, as the wise man tells us in the next words:
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 3.</p></font> "The
          LORD does not let the righteous go hungry — but he thwarts the craving
          of the wicked."</b
        >
        But was it never known that the just man perished by hunger? Are ravens
        always commissioned to feed the people of God in times of famine? God
        has them at his command, if he sees it proper to make use of them; and
        when he pleases, he can administer to his people's necessities as easily
        by miracle as by the use of ordinary means.
        <p align="justify">
          Let them, then, joyfully commit the care of their bodies to his mercy.
          So long as his infinite wisdom shall see their continuance in life fit
          for them, their bread and their water shall be sure; and though their
          <i>bodies </i>should in some rare instances be pinched with hunger, he
          will nourish their <i>souls </i>with bread which the world knows
          nothing of.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the wicked are not so. While the righteous are sure of being
          satisfied in days of famine, the wicked are near to ruin in their
          greatest abundance — for the Lord casts away that which they call
          their substance. Many of them will take care not to spend it upon
          riotous living, and harlots. None of them will part with it, from
          motives of generosity and charity. But while they grasp it fast with
          both hands — God will pull it out from between their fingers, and toss
          it irrecoverably from them. Should they even be permitted to hold it
          all their days — death, that terrible messenger, shall at last drag
          them from it! Nor shall their glory descend after them to the grave —
          but that wickedness by which they acquired it, shall lie down with
          them in the dust, and torture their souls in Hell.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You see from this verse, how it comes to pass, that righteousness
          delivers from death — and that treasures of wickedness are so
          unprofitable. But let none from these truths conclude, that honest
          labor is useless. God takes care of his people — but he makes use of
          their labors in the performance of his promise about their provision.
          Whoever indulges himself in idleness, may expect poverty as a matter
          of course; for,
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 4.</p></font>"Lazy
          hands make a man poor" </b
        >Idleness was never designed for man. Adam in paradise, was to dress and
        keep the garden. Why should men expect any good from slothfulness, since
        that doom was pronounced, "In the sweat of your face shall you eat
        bread!" Show me a slothful man, and I will show you a wicked, a poor,
        and a miserable man.
        <b> <p align="justify">"But diligent hands bring wealth."</p></b> Riches
        are dispensed by God at his pleasure, and he commonly gives them to the
        man employed in honest industry.
        <p align="justify">
          How then do we see some men laborious — and yet poor? Perhaps they
          trust too much to their own labor. Perhaps they are
          <i> earth-worms</i>, abhorred by God. Or if they fear the Lord, and
          look to him for a blessing on the labor of their hands, he sees that
          riches are not the best thing for them. To prevent pride and vanity
          from being increased in them by the wealth of the world — he keeps
          them poor, designing to bestow upon them the better and enduring
          substance. Would you complain of one, who promised you one acre of
          ground, and gave your instead of it a hundred acres in a better soil?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But are not some indolent people enriched by unexpected means? No; at
          least their wealth is not substantial nor enduring. It is worse than
          poverty. Let us, therefore, be at once fervent in spirit and diligent
          in business; and if we would deserve this character, we must carefully
          improve the proper seasons of profitable labor; for,
        </p>

          gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during
          harvest is a disgraceful son."</b
        >
        Summer and harvest are the fit seasons for raising and gathering in the
        fruits of the field. He who improves these and similar opportunities for
        honest gain, does honor to himself, and to those parents who had the
        care of his upbringing. He who neglects them, is like one who sleeps all
        the time he should be working. It would be a shame for a man in health
        to spend all his days in bed. The idle man might as well be there, for
        anything he does out of it. He brings disgrace to himself, and to his
        father, who ought to have trained him to habits of prudence and
        diligence.
        <p align="justify">
          Are prudence and diligence so commendable, when employed about the
          food that perishes? How much more necessary and profitable are they,
          when we are called to labor in the strength of divine grace, for the
          food that endures unto everlasting life! He who trifles away the
          acceptable time and the day of salvation, is a thousand times more
          foolish, then the man who defers the reaping of his fields until the
          end of December.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Riches are the ordinary fruit of labor — but the fruit of
          righteousness shall be peace and every good thing; for,

        The just man is not only commended by men — but by God. He not only
        expects — but <i>possesses </i>blessings. He is not only enriched — but
        <i>crowned </i>with blessings coming down from the Father of lights. He
        shall not be confounded — but his mouth is opened to bless the Author of
        his blessings.

        violent man is condemned already, and when the Judge of all shall return
        his violent dealings upon his own head, his face shall be covered with
        confusion, nor shall he be able to open his mouth in extenuation of his
        crimes.
        <p align="justify">
          The happiness of the just, and the misery of the wicked, is not
          confined to this life. The just man shall not all die. His spirit is

        not only follow him — but live behind him.

          Lamb's book of life, which were written in it from the foundation of

        It shall either perish, or be covered with disgrace. Have they performed

        These may be useful, indeed, to keep up and to recall their
        <i>infamy </i>to recollection. The names of the Alexanders and Caesars
        of the days of old, are honorable among bad judges of character. Among
        the wise, leopards and other voracious beasts are accounted no less
        deserving of glory and fame.

        </b>
        All men desire to be accounted wise; but who is truly a wise man?
        Solomon being judge, the man is wise who receives commandments. He will
        not admit of any lord to his conscience — but the Judge of all — yet he
        hearkens to instruction from all who are authorized or qualified to give
        it. He receives with meekness the instructions of parents and teachers,
        and yields a cheerful submission to lawful authority. He is much readier
        to <i>hear </i>
        than to speak, and his feet stand upon an even place.
        <b> <p align="justify">"But a chattering fool comes to ruin."</p></b>
        Loquacity is a sure sign of vanity and folly. This kind of fool, in his
        endless talk, speaks many vain and sinful words — for which he must give
        an account. He speaks many proud and senseless words — which bring upon
        him contempt. He speaks many rash, malicious, and provoking words —
        which lay him open to hatred and mischief. Sooner or later, his
        ungoverned tongue must fall upon him with unsupportable weight, and hurl
        him to ruin!
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 9.</p></font> "The
          man of integrity walks securely, but he who takes crooked paths will
          be found out."</b
        >
        Men's characters are discerned by their lives. The good man walks
        uprightly, for he regulates his steps by the unerring rule, and
        constantly endeavors to follow it, unbiased by self-interest or honor,
        persuasion, terror, or example. He abhors deceit in his dealings either
        with God or men — but speaks as he thinks, acts as he speaks, and makes
        the example of Christ his constant pattern.
        <p align="justify">
          This man walks securely, or confidently. None of his steps shall
          slide. If he should fall, he shall not be utterly cast down. If he
          meets with enemies, and tribulations — he receives joy from the
          testimony of his conscience. The name of the Lord is a strong tower,
          to which he runs and is safe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The hypocrite walks in crooked paths. Like Judas, who put on a cloak
          of charity to hide his covetousness — he conceals the selfish
          principles which regulate his behavior under the appearances of piety,
          prudence, and other good qualities. But he cannot hold the mantle so
          tight about him, as to conceal from the wise observer, his inward
          baseness. It will occasionally be shuffled aside, it will at length
          drop off, and he shall be known for what he is, abhorred by all men,
          and punished by God with other hypocrites!

        another, which shall return upon himself. For he who does a bad thing to
        others, in whatever way he does it — is doing a worse to himself.
        <i>Better to suffer an hundred wrongs, than to commit one. </i
        ><b> <p align="justify">"A chattering fool comes to ruin."</p></b>Such a
        fool is often boasting that he is no hypocrite; but his plainness is no
        virtue, nor shall it make atonement for the follies of his mouth. The
        scorner, the plotter of mischief, and the chattering fool — shall be
        involved in equal misery.
        <p align="justify">
          Some ancient translations read the verse thus: "He who winks with the
          eye causes sorrow; but he who reproves causes safety." In this
          contrast, winking with the eye is the gesture of one who hides his
          eyes from his neighbor's fault, because he is unwilling to risk his
          favor by administering necessary reproof. Such a man is not a true
          friend, for he allows sin upon his brother, when he might, by faithful
          admonition, have prevented it. And he who does not prevent sin when it
          is in his power, is the cause of grief, the sure consequence of sin.
          But he who faithfully reproves, causes safety to his friend, and
          shall, in the end, receive more thanks than he who winked with the
          eye, and flattered with the mouth.

        <b>"Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning."</b> He who is wise
        in heart will receive reproof. That is one mark of a wise man — but he
        shows his wisdom in speaking, as well as in hearing. Wisdom seals not up
        — but governs the mouth, and dictates to it useful words. On whatever
        occasion you consult the possessor of it, you will find wisdom, whether
        you want instruction, or direction, or comfort.
        <p align="justify">
          Should you consult him about matters that come not within the compass

        Here we learn how the lips of the wise are furnished with wisdom. Their

        they come by it? By reading the Bible, by meditating, by hearing
        sermons, by holy conversation, by observation and experience, by prayer,
        and by faith in Christ, who is made of God unto us wisdom. And when they
        have found it, they take care not to lose it — but lay it up in their
        memories and hearts, where it is kept to be used by themselves, and
        communicated to others.

        <b>"The rich man's wealth is his strong city."</b> Can this be true?
        Yes, if you will believe himself. The rich man's wealth is his strong
        city, and as an high wall in his own conceit. It is not a strong city —
        but <i>his </i>strong city. He thinks it will prove a sufficient defense
        to him from that destruction which his mouth has merited. You see how
        justly the worldling is called an idolater, for he makes not God his
        confidence — but trusts to a thing of nothing; for his riches, if they
        are a city, are not a strong city — but a city broken down, and without
        walls.
        <p align="justify">
          How hard is it for rich men to obtain an entrance into that city that
          has foundations, when it is a miracle for a man that has riches, not
          to trust in them!

          But are we to suppose poor men exempt from the temptation to idolize

          <b>"The destruction of the poor is their poverty." </b>That was a good
          prayer, "Give me neither poverty nor riches." Poor men, by envying the

          despondency and fear of ruin — do often make themselves as wretched

        disposition, is increased by it. The righteous man feeds many with
        knowledge, for he finds it sweet to himself, and wishes not to eat his

        what is far more precious — wisdom and grace. This blessing confers
        riches and preserves them — without exposing to harassing cares, their

        >
        The hopes of wicked men are contracted within narrow bounds. The objects
        of their hope are things which the unerring Word calls vanity and
        vexation of spirit. They may obtain the body of their wishes — but alas
        without the soul.
        <p align="justify">
          Happiness is the object of hope to all of us. With a view to this, we
          seek the riches and honors, and the pleasures and friendships of this
          life. But should we possess the richest abundance of these things, and
          not find happiness in them — what does it profit?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But if the wicked man should have his belly filled with worldly
          treasures, and should rejoice in them — his hope shall nevertheless
          come to nothing. Misfortune or death shall rob him of all that he
          placed in the room of God — and the remembrance of former pleasures
          shall greatly embitter his miseries.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is one dreadful ingredient of torture which the poor man that
          goes to Hell will not experience — the remembrance of prosperity
          enjoyed and abused.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Does the wicked man expect Heaven? How terrible will be the punishment
          of his presumptuous hopes, when he shall be hurled down headlong into
          the depths of despair!

          way of the LORD is a refuge for the righteous, but it is the ruin of
          those who do evil." </b
        >Christ is the way, into which the upright man enters by faith, and he
        walks in it by holiness of life. He hates all deceit — and hypocrisy is
        an abomination to his soul. While other men strengthen themselves in
        their own imaginations by fraud and cunning — he derives all needful
        supplies of grace from him in whom all fullness dwells. The testimony of
        his conscience emboldens and invigorates his soul, and he waxes stronger
        and stronger.
        <p align="justify">
          He is weak in himself; but his dependence is not on himself — but on
          God. Out of weakness he thus waxes strong, surmounts every difficulty,
          and turns to flight armies of aliens. How weak was Peter when he
          denied his Lord! But the way of the Lord was strength to him, and when
          near the end of his pilgrimage, he looked forward to the death of the
          cross with as much composure as a man does to taking off his clothes
          when retiring to rest. Upright men, when feeling the weakness of their
          own strength, are sometimes filled with anxious thoughts, lest they
          should become weary and faint, and fall before their enemies. But
          through the grace of Christ, their strength shall increase, and shall
          be suited to their needs. They shall reach in safety the end of their
          journey, and be more than conquerors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But what shall be the end of those who walk in crooked ways, and
          endeavor to secure their wishes by deceit and iniquity? Ruin and
          destruction shall be their portion. Destruction and misery are in
          their ways. If they cannot now <i>see </i>this, they shall
          <i>feel </i>it at the end of their journey!

        <p align="justify">
          The righteous man is founded upon the Rock of ages, for his dependence
          is placed upon a better righteousness than his own. He is guarded by
          Omnipotence. Death and Hell may rage, and seem to prevail — but he is
          safe from every <i>real </i>evil. He may be removed to another land,
          or to the eternal world — but Heaven is his country, and the mightiest
          of his enemies are unable to prevent his entrance into it, or to
          banish him from it.

        <p align="justify">
          Even in this world the enemies of the righteous have not the power of
          which they imagination themselves possessed. Neither Chaldeans, nor
          Sabeans, nor devils, could deprive Job of a camel or a sheep, without
          the permission of Him who would allow no evil to befall that righteous
          man, without making it work for good.

        the wicked?" No. It is given into their hand for
        <i>a little moment</i> — but they are frequently driven out of it by
        visible judgments. At the best, when a few years are gone, the
        <i>king of terrors </i>shall chase them away to Hell, and those who made
        shipwreck of faith or a good conscience for the treasures of earth —
        shall make shipwreck of these treasures also.

        >Our first care must be to keep our hearts with all diligence; and our
        next to govern our tongue, which will otherwise be an unruly evil, full
        of deadly poison! The tongue will best be governed, when the heart is
        well furnished with wisdom, for the mouth of the just brings forth
        wisdom, as naturally as a good tree brings forth good fruit. Wisdom is
        said to be a tree of life, and this tree of life brings forth the fruits
        of holiness in speech and behavior, not once a year — but every day. How
        valuable would a tree be thought, that would bring forth the most
        delicious fruits in such abundance, and such frequency! When our speech
        is with grace, and seasoned with salt, it ministers grace to the
        hearers, and keeps ourselves from mischief.
        <b> <p align="justify">"A perverse tongue will be cut out."</p></b>It
        provokes God, and it oftentimes provokes men. Perverse talk may escape
        punishment from man — but it shall not escape God's righteous judgment,

          wicked only what is perverse."</b
        >
        How is knowledge ascribed to the lips of the righteous? Because their
        lips are directed by their hearts. They speak not thoughtlessly — but
        intelligently. Their lips are not devoted to flattery, nor do they
        slavishly comply with the sentiments and humors of men. They know
        <i>when </i>it is fit to speak, and <i>what </i>is fit to be spoken.
        They know how to address people of different dispositions, in a
        different manner, so as to please them — or what is of more importance
        in their estimation, so as to serve their best interests.
        <p align="justify">
          It is said of a certain General, that he had such a grace in his
          manner of behavior, that a suppliant who had met with the refusal of a
          petition from him, returned better satisfied than he would from
          another who had granted the solicited favor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A prudent Christian has so much grace in his speech, that his reproofs
          and rebukes often gain him more favor and esteem, than others gain
          from their insinuating address.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the wicked man speaks the words of deceit and folly and
          perverseness — for what can be expected from a bad tree but corrupt
          fruit? And what shall be the end of a corrupt tree — but to be cut
          down, and cast into the fire?
