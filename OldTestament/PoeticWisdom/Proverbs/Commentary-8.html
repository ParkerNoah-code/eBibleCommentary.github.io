              The happiness of the followers of Christ is not entirely reserved
              to the eternal world. Even in this life, they are admitted to a

            The church of Christ is a house, wherein he dwells and takes
            pleasure. It must be a <i>glorious </i>edifice, for wisdom is the
            builder of it. It is a <i> strong </i>and <i>durable </i>building,
            for it has many pillars, hewed out, not by, the wisest of kings —

            give us his own flesh and blood, to nourish and refresh our souls?
            Then what grace, what comfort, what privilege, will he withhold? He
            is most willing to communicate this provision to us. </font

            The voice of these maidens, is the voice of that wisdom which sends
            them. It is she who gives the invitation by their mouth; and she
            does it in the most public and audible manner, crying with a voice

            The simple and unwise are welcomed to this feast. They are called
            not only by the servants — but by the master of the feast, to
            partake of these precious provisions. The poor, the maimed, the
            lame, and the blind — those who have no money, and those who have
            spent all their substance for things that do not profit — are
            graciously invited to come, and eat and drink abundantly, by
            receiving Christ and his salvation, as they are freely offered in
            the gospel. But we cannot be partakers of the Lord's table — and the
            table of devils. When we come to Jesus by faith, and partake of his
            precious blessings, we must forsake the society and the course of
            the foolish. </font

            words of Christ, we will forsake the foolish, and go in the path of
            understanding.

            <p align="justify">
              But may we not associate with the foolish, in order to reclaim
              them. There are two sorts of foolish people. Some have naturally a
              pliable and modest disposition; though destitute of the grace of
              God; or though conversant in the ways of sin, they are not yet
              hardened in sin by long practice. There may be some hope of making
              good impressions on the minds of such people as these. But there
              are others who are stubborn and determined sinners. To them, in
              ordinary cases, there is no hope of doing any good.

            If we reprove the profligate sinners that mock at everything sacred,
            we are not likely to benefit them — but to procure hurt to
            ourselves. Such men, when we have irritated them by our admonitions,
            will pry into our characters with all the keenness of malice and
            revenge. Few characters can stand the scrutiny of a malicious eye.
            So that instead of serving them, we shall be in danger of losing
            much of our usefulness to others, by making them our enemies. Yet
            reproofs are like pearls when they are administered with the
            meekness of wisdom, and met with an obedient ear. </font

            There is scarcely a man so wise and holy as not to need instruction
            and reproof. Wise men are not above reproofs — but they know their
            need of them, and are disposed to receive them with meekness, and to
            improve by them, and to love and thank their reprovers. The wise and
            the just man are the same in the view of Solomon, for this is a
            fundamental maxim in his writings — </font

            Solomon knew how to appreciate that wisdom which directs men in the
            prudent management of their own concerns, and in the wise
            administration of public affairs. But he rightly judged that
            religion is the true wisdom, and that, compared with it, all other
            kinds are vanity and folly. He examined with the eye of the prince
            of philosophers the objects of nature; but the knowledge of the most
            holy God, was in his estimation true understanding. This kind of
            knowledge excels the other as much as the light of the sun the
            glimmer of a glow-worm. He who knows God in truth, is possessed of a
            never-ending life. </font

            God can receive no additions of blessedness by our wisdom, though he
            delights in it. He cannot lose his glory by our contempt of his
            gospel and laws. The ministers of wisdom will rejoice in our
            compliance with their calls — but the profit or the loss of our
            behavior under a dispensation of the gospel, must be felt by
            ourselves. Life and death are set before us. May God grant us a
            disposition to pursue life.

            those things that are forbidden by God, and afraid to appear in open
            day. Yet such is the corruption of the hearts of men, that they
            relish things so contrary to reason, as well as to Scripture. We are
            naturally prone to things forbidden, and until our souls are renewed
            by the grace of God — can taste an unaccountable sweetness in that
            which is poison to the soul" But when we are restored to a sound
