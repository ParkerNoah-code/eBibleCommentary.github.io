          In this chapter, Solomon renews his exhortations to us to get wisdom,
          verses 1-13, and to avoid temptations, verses 14-19.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The chapter concludes with a <i>short sum of practical religion</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In his exhortation to wisdom, Solomon makes use of many of the same
          motives by which he had already recommended it. Solomon had a heart
          filled with knowledge, beyond all the sons of men; and he could have
          charmed and astonished us by the discoveries of new truths in every
          sentence. But he had <i>wisdom </i>to manage his knowledge, and
          therefore prefers those discourses which are solid and useful — to
          those which, by their dazzling brilliancy, are fitted only to produce
          admiration and wonder. He desires not our applause — but our benefit.
          His aim is not to shine — but to instruct. He was a wise householder,
          instructed into the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven, and brings out
          of his treasure old things as well as new.

          God speaks to us more than once or twice by this inspired penman, and
          shall we not listen to his voice? We have precept upon precept, and
          line upon line — and if we do not receive instructions pressed upon us
          so warmly — we must go and fall backwards, and be broken, and snared,
          and caught. May God open our hearts to hear what is said by him who
          was the wisest of men, and who spoke under the guidance of unerring
          Wisdom.

          <i>orphans</i>, and supply than with the best and kindest
          instructions. He calls upon all of us to attend to his understanding,
          for he still opens his mouth in wisdom through Solomon.

          All the things that men can desire, are not to be compared to good
          doctrine. But is it befitting in a wise man to commend his own
          discourses? Solomon might well commend them, for they are not his —
          but God's, and God is graciously pleased to commend them to our
          acceptance. He calls us to buy wisdom without money, and reveals as
          much earnestness in recommending this precious merchandise, as if he
          were to be enriched by the price.

          Were a thousand volumes to be written in commendation of this holy
          book, they could not say so much for it, as it can say for itself in a
          few words. God is not only the <i>author</i> — but the
          <i>recommender </i>of it. He calls it good doctrine, and requires us
          not to forsake it in our practice. To despise it, is to despise the
          authority and love of him who guided the pen of Solomon in writing and
          commending it to us. To forsake his law, is to forsake the king's
          highway, which is ever under his eye and protection — and to turn into
          those paths which are haunted by ravenous beasts.

          His parents had, in his tender years, instructed him in the principles
          of religion; and the reason why they did so, was, that they loved him
          — for the best evidence of parental love is to instruct, and when
          necessary, to correct children.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon was the best loved son in the family, and the greatest pains
          were employed in training him up in the way wherein he should go. Of
          him, accordingly, we find, that his parents had more joy than of all
          the rest. His mother gave him instruction, as well as his father. Her
          sin had lost her a child — but her religious care was rewarded with
          double comfort in the best and dearest of her sons. Were there more
          women of the spirit of Bathsheba, and Lois, and Lemuel's mother — we
          might hope to see a greater number of Solomon's, and Timothy's, and
          Lemuel's in the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon communicates to his children the instructions which his father
          had given him. We do injustice to our children, if we do not endeavor
          to leave them that <i>estate </i>which our forefathers acquired for
          their posterity. It is a more grievous iniquity, if the fathers do not
          transmit to their children those pious instructions, which in their
          tender years they received from their own parents. Families are
          reckoned honorable, when a rich estate passes from father to son,
          through many generations. But it is a far more lovely sight, to behold
          the same faith dwelling in a rising family — which dwelt in their
          mother, and father, and remote ancestors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have a specimen of David's instructions to Solomon in the
          twenty-eighth chapter of the first book of Chronicles. The reading of
          it is sufficient to warm our hearts, and make us wish to hear more of
          the venerable king's instructions to his son. Solomon, who did not
          forget what his affectionate father said, gives us more of them in
          this place. Let us hear them with reverence, that we may not be found
          despisers of him — by whose direction David spoke, and Solomon wrote.

          Children must attend to the words of their pious parents, and treasure
          them up in their hearts, to be observed in their lives; for it is no
          vain thing — but their life, to which they are called to hearken. When
          our fathers leave us money or land, we will not part with these gifts
          of their love — but the <i>instructions of life </i>are more precious
          than any earthly heritage. The <i>wisdom </i>which Solomon learned by
          his father's counsels, was better than his <i>kingdom</i>. When tested
          by God, it appeared that he valued an increase of wisdom, above an
          addition to his dominions, or his wealth, or even to the years of his
          life.

          How earnestly are we called to seek after wisdom, until we find it! It
          would be a happy token of getting it — were we so deeply convinced of
          its value; as to make the attainment of it our grand concern. Blessed
          are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, they shall be
          filled. If we cry for wisdom, and lift up our voice for understanding
          — our cries shall not remain unanswered. The success of Solomon's
          petition is recorded as an encouragement to our prayers and our hopes.
          It is not enough to <i>get </i>wisdom — we must also <i>use </i>it,
          and <i>walk </i>in its ways. They are all pleasantness and peace — but
          pain and misery will meet us, if we turn either to the right hand or
          to the left.

          There are some who think it necessary, in particular cases, to forsake
          wisdom, lest their strictness should expose them to damage. But David
          here tells Solomon and us, that this must be a dangerous error. The
          way of duty and of safety is still the same. Those who walk by faith
          will believe this, though it appears to such as walk by sight, an
          absurdity contradicted by a thousand facts.

          It is incomparably safer and happier, to lose our credit and our life,
          by cleaving to the truths and ways of Christ — than to preserve both
          by base compliances with the enemies of the truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That we may not forsake wisdom, we must embrace and love her. A miser
          will never forget where his treasure lies, and he will lose his life
          sooner than be robbed of his precious store. The love of wisdom will
          in like manner induce us to lay it up in our hearts, and to keep fast
          hold of it in defiance of every danger. When people receive not the
          truth in the love of it — they provoke God to leave them to the
          influence of strong and soul-ruining delusions. When we receive it
          into our hearts, it makes us strong and victorious over the wicked
          one.

          >
          David had got wisdom and understanding by meditating on God's
          testimonies, and he found it the principal thing. His crown and palace
          were not comparable to it in his eyes. Setting so high a value upon it
          himself, it was his great desire that his beloved son should get it
          also. And those parents who are possessed of David's spirit, would
          rather see their children wise unto salvation, than rich and great in
          the world. Evil parents are not so bad as to refuse bread and fish to
          their children. Good parents use every means to make them sharers of
          that wisdom, which they have found to be their own happiness.

          Whatever we get, let us get wisdom. I remember to have read of two
          religious women in the reign of Queen Mary of England, who parted with
          a considerable portion of their estate, for a few leaves of the Bible.
          Those who look upon the bargain as a foolish one, have little
          knowledge of the worth of the scriptures. If a man has acquired
          thousands of gold and silver, and is without wisdom — he has but
          gained thousands of <i> shining nothings</i>. If he has acquired
          wisdom, and nothing besides — he has gained the one thing needful.
          Having gained wisdom, we ought to value her as she deserves to be
          valued.

          All that truly know wisdom, must embrace and exalt her. The only
          reason why any treat her with indifference, is that they are entire
          strangers to her. None knew her better than David and Solomon — and we
          hear how eloquent in her praises they are. We must prize wisdom as a
          pearl of inestimable value, and we must testify our regard for her:<br />
          by growing in grace and in knowledge; <br />
          by improving every means and opportunity afforded us of increasing
          this divine treasure; <br />
          by valuing, for the sake of wisdom, the teachers and lovers of it;
          <br />
          by earnest endeavors to make our friends and neighbors sensible of its
          value;<br />
          and, in a word, by giving it the throne of our hearts, and the
          government of every action of our lives.

        <p align="justify">
          Those who honor wisdom, obtain the noblest honors; for by wisdom, they
          are promoted. Their heads are adorned with a diadem of beauty, and a
          crown of glory is delivered to them. None are so apt to be vain of
          earthly honors as those who, like David, are unexpectedly raised to
          the possession of them; or who, like Solomon, surpass in majesty all
          their contemporaries. Yet we find, that neither David nor Solomon was
          greatly charmed with the luster of a crown.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The reason is obvious — their eyes were open to the glories of true
          wisdom — and all the glories of earthly kingdoms were lost in the
          superior brightness! They would rather have exchanged conditions with
          the poorest saint in Israel — than with the most magnificent monarch
          in a land where God was not known.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon received and readily assented to his father's good doctrine;
          we need not wonder therefore that he prayed for <i>wisdom </i> rather
          than for long life, or glory, or power. He had learned not only that
          wisdom was a nobler possession than any of these things — but that it
          brings these along with it. If we receive in faith and love these
          instructions of the holy man — then our desires will be like his.

          hidden treasure.

          Stumbling-blocks lie before us in our journey through life, and those

          Sometimes we are under the necessity of running, and there is then

          the risk of being hurried forcibly along by our passions, without time
          to take due care of our steps. In such cases as these, it is needful
          to have religious principles rooted in our hearts, and religious
          knowledge stored up in our minds, which through divine grace will
          prevent us from adopting any course of action displeasing to God, and

          But when we have given our tongues a license, whereby others also have
          been drawn into sin — we must remember that, though pardoning mercy
          may clear our consciences from the terrors of guilt, deep remorse must
          still be felt for the irreparable injury done to others. Who can tell
          how far its baneful influence may have spread?

          The Pharisees abounded in prayers and giving of alms; but the praise
          of men was in their eye, and our Lord tells us that they had their
          reward. Their desire was to be seen and honored by men, which they no
          doubt by their religion obtained — but it was <i>all </i>that they
          obtained by it.

          Jehu thought himself a very zealous man — but he took no heed to walk
          in the way of the Lord with all his heart; and it is testified of him
          that he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam all his days. He did
          many good things — but his eyes looked aside to
          <i>his honor and profit</i>. All the splendid actions he performed,
          were but so many <i>splendid sins</i>.

          None of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself. The glory of
          God must be our great aim — otherwise it appears that redeeming grace

          Heaven is in the Christian's eye — and from it his views must never be
          turned aside to the world. No doubt the enjoyments of the world may be
          sought by us — but still in subordination to the hope of our heavenly
          calling. Heaven is our home — and earth is our inn. If the world is
          our home — we are not strangers and pilgrims here, neither are we
          citizens of Heaven.

          We must not, under the pretense of serving God, make earthly motives
          our end — otherwise we are guilty of that kind of sacrilege which is
          of all others the worst — that which consists in alienating God's own
          service from him. It is not less dishonorable to God, when in our zeal
          for the accomplishment of good ends, we have recourse to means
          disapproved by him — for the command of God combined with his glory,
          must be ever kept in our eye. Our actions must be all ordered in the
          word of God.

          <i>Consideration </i>is one of those things in which man excels the
          irrational animals, and it is absolutely necessary in the religious
          life. If we do not think like men, we never please him, who made us
          wiser than the beasts of the earth! If we do not walk wisely — we can
          with no propriety be numbered among the wise. Our actions will be
          weighed by God in an even balance at last, and it is necessary for us
          to weigh them now in the same balance.

          As we ought to compare our past actions with the word of God, in order
          to know what occasion there is for repentance. So in like manner those
          actions which we design to perform, that we may know whether it is
          lawful to perform them or not. This is necessary for the direction and
          establishment our ways. Those who do not ponder their paths are like a
          waves of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed hither and thither.
          But in the hearts of such as receive and apply it to the cleansing of
          their way — the word of God has an establishing efficacy.

          Our ways ought to be stable and consistent. It is disgraceful for men
          to have their religion modeled and varied by their company and
          circumstances of life. Let us resemble, not the flexible willow — but
          the stout oak. Our goodness, if like the morning cloud, is no goodness
          at all, for the path of the just is as the morning sun. To be
          unsteadfast in God's covenant, is to be treacherous to God.

          The truly righteous man is faithful unto death. His frames of mind may
          vary, and his steps may sometimes be seduced from the straight way —
          but the Spirit of God will restore his soul, and make him again to
          walk in the paths of righteousness.

          David slipped with his feet, and he once turned aside — yet he could
          say in truth that he had not wickedly departed from his God. He

          It is dangerous to turn either to the left hand or the right from the
          way of God's commandments. On each side of the King's highway are
          those crooked paths, which are full of precipices and pitfalls.

          Men may be destroyed by being over-righteous, as well as by being
          wicked overmuch. The Pharisees in the days of Christ's flesh, sinned
          as much by adding to God's law as by taking from it. To add to God's
          precepts, is a reflection upon the wisdom of the Lawgiver. To violate
          them, is an insult upon his authority.

        <p align="justify">
          It commonly happens, that when men have the presumption to make some
          new articles of religion, they make compensation to themselves for
          their additional restraints on their liberty, by straitening the law
          of God in some other points — and thus make it on the whole much
          easier to flesh and blood, than it was made by God.
        </p>

          Our foot must be removed from all evil. Sin must not be indulged in
          thought, word, or action. No degree of this abominable thing is to be
          allowed in our practice.

          Saints have fallen into some of the greatest sins — but is
          inconsistent with holiness to take liberty in the least sin. Even the
          garment spotted by the flesh must be hated by us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          From this whole directory, we may see our need of pardoning mercy; for
          which of us can say, "We have made our hands clean, or kept our
          tongues from every evil thing?" But the blood of Jesus is a fountain
          opened to cleanse from all sin. Without renewing grace, our labor in
          guarding our <i>hearts</i>, and restraining our <i>tongues </i>and
          <i> feet </i>from evil, will be as vain as to attempt washing an
          Ethiopian white. The old heart cannot be reformed — but God has
          promised to give us a new heart, and to put a new spirit within us.
          With our vigilance — faith and prayer must be joined.
