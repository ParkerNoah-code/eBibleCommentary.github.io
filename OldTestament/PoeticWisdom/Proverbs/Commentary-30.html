            >"The sayings of King Lemuel — an oracle his mother taught him"</b
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Women have sometimes been used to write Scripture under the
          inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Deborah and Lemuel's mother were
          honored to be the composers, under the direction of God, each of them
          of a chapter in the Bible; and the prophecy of Lemuel's mother will
          make every woman who governs her life by it an ornament to her gender.
          It is the duty of mothers, as well as fathers, to instruct their
          children. Although Lemuel was a king — yet his mother was directed by
          God to give him instruction and admonition.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, was renowned for the pleasure she
          took in the education of her children. When a certain lady was one day
          showing Cornelia her jewels, and desiring a sight of Cornelia's jewels
          — she told her that <i>her children were her jewels</i>. Certainly the
          richest diamonds cannot give so much luster to a lady, as the proper
          discharge of this duty to her children.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Cornelia was an unenlightened heathen — but why should Christian
          mothers blush in her presence? If we were as great as kings, it would
          be a scandal to us to despise the instructions and counsels of a
          mother. King Lemuel remembered, and wrote the prophecy that his mother
          taught him, and transmits it to posterity. Whoever he was, we have
          reason to believe that he practiced the instructions which he so much
          respected. Lemuel shall be forever held in honor for the respect which
          he showed to his mother, and his mother's name will be renowned for
          her part in forming her son to virtue, and religion, and public
          usefulness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 31:2.</p></font>"O
          my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows"
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          When this venerable lady was instructing her son, her heart was
          overflowing with inexpressible tenderness of affection to him. Parents
          often take a very absurd method of expressing their fondness for their
          children — but when they gratify every one of their humors, and allow
          them to live without restraints and admonitions — they do not truly
          love, but hate their children. He who spares the rod hates his child.
          The love of parents to their children is best showed by doing their
          utmost endeavors to make them good Christians, and useful to their
          generation. For this purpose they ought to dispense their instructions
          and their reproofs in the language of love, and to let their children
          see that everything they say to them is dictated by the warmest
          affection.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows." This fond mother
          considered and pondered in her mind what way she should express her
          tender regard, and she could find no better way of showing it than by
          teaching him who wisdom which befits his station; for what greater
          testimony of love can any mother give to the son of her womb? Every
          mother loves the son of her womb. If she does not, she is not a mother
          — but a sister to the ostrich, to which God has denied understanding.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The love of a mother to the son of her womb is so fervent, that God is
          pleased to use it as an illustration of his own love to his people.
          Although the love of a mother bears no proportion to it — yet that is
          one of the best emblems of it which the world can afford.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lemuel was the son of her vows, as well as of her womb. Every son of
          the womb should be a son of the mother's vows and prayers. And the
          instructions of a parent must be joined with prayers for their
          success. For mothers may plant, and fathers may water — but it is God
          who gives the increase. When <i>Monica </i>was shedding tears for her
          beloved son <i> Augustine</i>, at the time that he was a debauchee,
          and a heretic — one of her friends told her that the child of so many
          prayers could not be lost, and perhaps no mother since the days of the
          Virgin Mary had in the end, greater comfort in a son.

          kings."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Whoredom, as Solomon tells us, is the ruin of any man — but none are
          in greater danger of being ruined in their bodies and fortunes by this
          vice than kings, who have too often the misfortune to need a check or
          a reprover, while the temptations that lead to sensuality are ever
          surrounding them. David and Solomon involved themselves in great
          distress by the love of women; and it is well known, that in later
          times, the kingdom of Spain was totally ruined, and the Saracens
          introduced into the possession of it, through the unbridled lust of
          King Roderick.

        <p align="justify">
          Wine, as well as whoredom, takes away the heart when it is drunk to
          excess — but other men cannot do so much hurt as kings or magistrates
          when they are drunk.

        <p align="justify">
          When Nadab and Abihu were destroyed by fire from the Lord, for their
          unhallowed incense, it is probable they were drunk; and therefore a
          law was made on that occasion that priests should drink no wine when
          they went in before the Lord, lest they should blunder in any part of
          the sacred service. The more important any man's work is, he is the
          more obliged to be temperate in all things. Drunkenness, which is a
          damning sin in any person, is attended with prodigious aggravations in
          those men who dispense the mysteries of the gospel, or administer the
          public affairs of the nation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The most oppressive and execrable laws that Scotland was ever plagued
          with, were made by a parliament called <i>the drunken parliament</i>.
          Alexander the Great, when he was drunk, killed one of his best
          friends, who had, on a former occasion, saved his life in battle; and
          when Alexander recovered his judgment, he had almost killed himself.
          His father Philip was less unfortunate. He once forgot the law in his
          cups, and passed an unrighteous sentence upon a poor widow — but soon
          recovering his senses, he condemned himself to refund her damages.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some think that drunkenness is an <i>excuse </i>for the faults that
          are committed by men under the influence of it. Lemuel's mother, under
          the influence of the prophetic spirit, was of another mind — and even
          unenlightened heathen have been sensible how frivolous this excuse is.
          Zaleucus made a law among the Locrians, that if any person committed a
          crime when he was drunk, he should be punished for both crimes — for
          he did not judge that one crime was a proper excuse for another. If
          men are insane without any fault of their own, they are not
          accountable for their actions — but a voluntary madness has no excuse
          for itself, and will be no excuse for anything else.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To pervert judgment in any case is not good. To pervert the judgment
          of any of the afflicted, is such a complication of injustice and
          inhumanity, that none but a man who is drunk, or is of a disposition
          that makes him perpetually like a man in liquor, will be guilty of it.
          The wise woman knew that her beloved son could never commit this
          unpardonable iniquity while he was sober.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is not for ministers, or teachers; it is not for parents, or
          masters, or mistresses, to drink wine to excess, lest they forget
          their duty and commit some pernicious error, in the discharge of that
          trust which lies upon them, and corrupt their inferiors by their
          example.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But is wine useless? Why then did God create the fruit of the vine? It
          is not useless. Mahomet reproached his Creator, when he prohibited the
          use of it without restriction. It is useful for the refreshment of any
          man, when his labors, or the dejection of his mind, or the state of
          his body requires it. It is peculiarly useful to those who are
          oppressed with calamity and grief.

        <p align="justify">
          We must not give wine in immoderate quantities to any person, however
          dejected, for sin is never to be chosen rather than affliction — but
          wine <i>moderately used </i>is of great use to revive the languishing
          spirits of the disconsolate; and it may be a piece of as real charity,
          to bestow this generous liquor upon them, as it is to give bread to
          the hungry. The Psalmist mentions this among other instances of God's
          bounty, that he gives not only bread to strengthen us — but likewise
          <i>wine to cheer our hearts</i>, and oil to make our faces shine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some of the people that were present at the crucifixion of our blessed
          Lord, gave him wine mixed with myrrh to render his sufferings more
          tolerable to him — but our Lord, who allows and requires us to bestow
          cordials on those who are ready to faint under their sorrows — refused
          them in his own severest sufferings, for he was not disposed to
          decline the bitterest dregs of that cup of sorrow which was put into
          his hands by his father. But when his people are made partakers of the
          sufferings of Christ, he puts the <i>cup of consolation </i>into their
          hands, and calls them to drink of that generous wine which goes down
          sweetly, and causes the lips of those who are in the deepest distress
          to sing. "As the sufferings of Christ abound in us," said one who was
          pressed with affliction above measure, "so our consolation also
          abounds by Christ." We ought to be followers of Christ in the exercise
          of <i>compassion </i>to the sorrowful and the distressed. It is
          devilish to add to the sorrows of the afflicted — but it is
          Christ-like to wipe away the tears from the eyes of the fatherless and
          widows, and to deserve the blessings of those who are ready to perish.

          Job was an excellent pattern to all princes. He was eyes to the blind,
          and feet to the lame, and a father to the poor; and no doubt he was a
          mouth also to those who cannot speak for themselves. Such a prince the
          mother of Lemuel wishes her son to be. She exhorts him to do judgment
          and justice to his people — but to regard with peculiar tenderness
          those unfortunate men who were in danger of losing their estates or
          lives, by reason of accusations brought against them. If they were
          unable, through ignorance, or awkwardness, or fear, to plead their own
          cause, she would have him to be their advocate, and to plead
          everything that truth and equity would allow on their behalf.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The appointment of advocates to plead for prisoners at the bar, agrees
          with this instruction. Those who are appointed to this charitable
          office should open their mouths, and interest themselves in the cause
          of their distressed clients, with all the warmth that justice can
          admit — that none may be condemned, unless the evidence against them
          clearly overbalances every argument that can be adduced on their side.
          It is certain that charity to the poor, and clemency to the accused,
          must not interfere with the due administration of justice. For a poor
          man is not to be countenanced in his cause — but there is less danger
          of erring in this, than in the contrary extreme. It is the business of
          princes to take care, that, in the administration of justice, the poor
          may not suffer by their unacquaintedness with law, or their lack of
          ability to take the benefit of it when they are oppressed, or to
          defend themselves against their wealthier adversaries.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord Jesus Christ is at once our king and our advocate. He saves
          the poor and needy, and breaks their oppressors in pieces. He stands
          at the right hand of the poor and needy, to save them from those who
          would condemn their souls. Princes, as they have opportunity, should
          imitate him by whom kings reign, and princes decree justice. The
          mother of Lemuel having instructed him in the virtues of purity and
          temperance, justice and mercy — proceeds next to instruct him in the
          <i> choice of a wife</i>.

        Those who are in public stations have peculiar reason, for their own
        sakes, and for the sake of their connections, to consider well who those
        whom they take into such close connection with themselves. Paul gives
        directions about the wives of deacons; and the instructions about the
        choice of a virtuous wife are here addressed to a king. Although his
        instructor was his mother — yet she says nothing about high birth, or
        wealth, or great alliances. For these things were trifles to her view,
        compared with virtue. Besides, the spirit of God designed these
        instructions not merely for kings — but for all who have wives to
        choose, and for the whole female gender. The last part of this chapter
        should be learned with great care by all women. The spirit of God was
        pleased, in the composition of it, to begin every verse with different,
        letters, according to the order of the alphabet, like the 119th Psalm,
        which would render it more easy to be retained in the memory.

        <p align="justify">
          Those who wish to have a good wife, ought to consider that one who
          deserves this character is not easily to be found; and therefore they
          ought to be very cautious in their choice, to be well acquainted with
          the disposition and behavior of those women who are to be their
          constant companions through life, and to address fervent supplications
          for the favor of him from whom alone a prudent wife is to be had.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But why are virtuous women so rarely to be found? Is the female gender
          more corrupted by the transgression of their first mother, than her
          sons? This cannot be supposed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Women were so ill used in ancient times, that it is not to be wondered
          at if there were few virtuous women to be found. In our times, when
          the yoke of marriage is become much lighter on the woman, it may be
          reasonably supposed that it would be to dishonor to the female gender
          to be compared with the male, and that the virtues in which they are
          inferior, are abundantly balanced by those more lovely accomplishments
          in which they excel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Men have no reason to reflect that virtue is rarely to be found in
          women. The imputation is not just, if it is meant to state an odious
          distinction between the sexes — but if it were, the fault lies as much
          in men as in women. <i>Virtue </i>is not duly esteemed — but
          <i>riches </i>and <i>beauty </i>are preferred to it. "Who can find a
          wife that will bring a large portion?" is the general question. Were
          the judgment of the princess by whom this character of a good wife was
          drawn, to be followed by the generality of men, parents would alter in
          a great measure their plan in educating their children; and women
          would endeavor to recommend themselves, not by setting off their
          beauty to advantage, or giving themselves out for great fortunes — but
          by the practice of religion and of every praiseworthy virtue.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The price of a virtuous woman is far above rubies and diamonds.
          Although she has no portion but her clothes, she will be preferred by
          a wise man, to one who is destitute of her qualifications, although
          she were possessed of all the riches of the east.

          All Christians ought to walk so inoffensively, that the adversary that
          wishes to defame them may find no evil thing to say — but wives in a
          special manner ought, for the sake of their husbands and themselves,
          to keep at a great distance from everything that might sully their
          character, because it is easily stained, and not easily cleared. Some
          husbands will suspect their wives of indiscretions without the least
          shadow of reason — but such brutes are so rare, that the prophetess
          takes no notice of them. She takes it for granted, that the husband of
          the virtuous woman will trust to her fidelity and prudence, when she
          merits it so well at his hands. To give cause of suspicions, is bad in
          a woman; to suspect without any cause, is extremely ungrateful in a
          man.

          Confidence in a virtuous wife is a piece of duty to herself, and
          pleasant to her husband. The harmony of hearts arising from mutual
          esteem in husband and wife, affords the most delightful pleasure which
          anything less than religion can give; and when true piety in them both
          is added, it makes a kind of Heaven upon earth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The heart of the virtuous woman's husband rejoices not only in his
          present pleasures — but in his agreeable prospects of future happiness
          and contentment. He knows that his house is managed with such
          <i> frugality </i>and <i>prudence </i>that he can entertain no
          apprehensions of poverty. He is under no temptation to injustice, to
          make up any waste in his substance. For every part of it is managed to
          the best advantage.

          The virtuous woman does good to the soul of her husband as well as to
          his body. For her behavior is a preservation from those temptations to
          iniquity, by which others, not blessed with the like happy marriages,
          have been drawn to sin, and to disgrace, and to a gibbet.

          There are some wives who are a constant plague to their husbands,
          vexing them with their ungodly and perverse behavior, every day and
          every hour of their life. There are others who do <i>some </i>good to
          their husbands — but at the same time do them so much evil that they
          cannot with any propriety be called virtuous wives. They take good
          care of their substance, and will not spend a penny without necessity
          — but they irritate their husbands, and eat the very life out of all
          their comforts, by perpetual contentions, and by fretting at every
          trifle and every nothing. But the virtuous woman does good and not
          evil to her husband, and that not only at particular times — but every
          day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some wives are like the days of April; at one time they are serene and
          pleasant — but at other times they are all tempest and fury, and at
          another time they are like a continual dripping.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The virtuous wife is as careful to please her husband, by an even and
          sweet temper — as she is to manage his affairs with discretion. She is
          the same today, and will be the same tomorrow, that she was yesterday.
          She is the same twenty or fifty years after marriage, as she was the
          first month. Neither sickness, nor poverty, nor old age, nor even the
          errors into which her husband may fall in managing the business of his
          family, will dampen her love. The more he needs — the more he enjoys
          her tender sympathy. If he should sometimes, through the frailty of
          human nature, be so ungrateful as to speak harshly to her — she will
          bear with him, and forgive him. When he is dead, she will cherish his
          memory; and when the relation is loosed by the parting stroke, she
          will still do him good, by showing kindness to his children for his
          sake.

          Some women will rather sit idle while they live, than seek wool or
          flax. If their husbands do not provide them proper materials for their
          work, they will consider it as a very sufficient excuse for idleness.
          But the virtuous woman abhors idleness, and loves her duty; and
          therefore she takes care to provide every necessary material and
          implement for work, that she may employ her <i>time </i>to the best
          advantage. It is not enough for a wife to manage the fruits of her
          husband's industry with frugality, or to keep her servants at work;
          the virtuous woman works with her own hands; and it is not a burden,
          but a pleasure to her to work with her hands.

          When Abraham's wise servant sought a wife for his master's son, he
          prayed to God to direct him to a woman who would give proof of her
          virtue, by her industry and politeness. Men and women have different
          tasks assigned them, and each must employ themselves in their proper
          work. She is not a virtuous woman who neglects the work of a woman,
          and intrudes herself into her husband's affairs. The good wife employs
          herself with cheerfulness about her wool and flax, and leaves others
          to mind their own affairs. At the same time, if there is anything
          necessary for the family which cannot be provided at home, she will
          take proper care that it shall not be lacking.

          She does not contract a narrow habit, by her close application to
          labor, nor employ her endeavors to

          may contribute to the happiness of her family — but cheerfully
          exchanges the fruits of her own labor for those necessities and
          conveniences that are fetched from distant countries. While slothful
          wives can scarcely provide necessary clothing for their own families —
          the virtuous woman provides by her labor and good management,
          something to sell, that the price may serve for the purchase of other
          commodities.

          not procure both the commodities which the soil affords, and those
          which must be fetched from afar. The virtuous woman enjoys the fruit
          of other people's labor, and the produce of other climates. For divine
          providence bestows its blessing on her industry, and there is no lack
          of any good thing endured in her house.

          of the day, for she loves her duty more than her sleep. But it is to
          be remembered, that in the country where this inspired woman lived,
          the days and the nights were almost equal through the whole year, so

          not, under pretense of religion, forget what she owes to her family.
          She is a good steward in the house of her husband, and takes care that
          none of her servants lack their necessary portion of food. It is a
          happy thing to live under her roof; and her maidens are encouraged by

          it. Her labors give her health and vigor, and alacrity for new labors;

          Notwithstanding her activity, she is never in such a hurry as to do
          her work in a slight and superficial manner. Her merchandise is known
          to be good, and brings a ready market and a good price; and her
          knowledge of this is a sufficient reward of itself for her toils. For
          when the <i>lazy </i>are perpetually uneasy by their reflections on
          their own conduct, the consciousness of having done her duty, and the
          prospect of the advantages arising from it, are a constant source of
          satisfaction and cheerfulness to the virtuous woman. She does not deny
          herself of the necessary refreshments of sleep and rest. This would be
          a piece of foolishness. When the inspired moralist tells us that her
          lamp does not go out at night — her meaning is, that she never wearies
          of her labors, nor indulges herself or her maidens in sleep, beyond
          the call of reason and nature. In this sense Paul speaks of warning
          people day and night. For no virtuous woman ever labored so diligently
          for the good of her family, as the great apostle for the advancement
          of the kingdom of Christ.

          Very good employment for a servant maid — but will any

          Did Lemuel's mother expect that his consort would employ herself in
          such work? Why not? She was to be a woman as well as a queen; and
          where is the law that forbids queens to be virtuous women, or to make

          superior strength, to trifle away their days without doing anything;
          especially, considering that their sphere of labor is so much wider,
          and their opportunities so much greater, of choosing some profession
          suited to their dispositions. Do they allege that their patrimonies
          set them above the need of doing anything? This is the same thing with
          saying that God has been so good to them, that they are under no
          obligation of serving God, by serving their generation according to

          the poor, and will even grudge if their husbands bestow a little of
          the fruits of their labor upon them — but virtuous wives do not think

          they might be earning their livelihood by some useful employment — but
          they are kind to those whom they know to be really in need, and unable

          herself by it, and bringing down the blessing of God upon her labors,
          which could not be successful without it. They were blessed women who

          She deserves not the character of a virtuous woman, who is not
          concerned for the happiness and comfort of those who dwell under her

          happiness of her husband, as well as her own, and in the next place,
          to the welfare of her children — yet she extends her care to her
          servants also, and interests herself in their prosperity. But her kind
          and feeling temper is not the source of vexation, but pleasure. She
          takes care that every member of her happy family is well fed and well
          clothed; therefore she is not afraid that any of them will be hurt by
          the snows and cold of winter. The care of providing clothes for
          servants does not come so much within the province of those who keep
          none but hired servants — yet a virtuous woman will still see to their
          welfare in every article of importance. The scarlet clothes that are
          here spoken of were not costly and fine ornaments, as they are with
          us, otherwise it cannot be supposed that all her household would be
          clothed with them. Some translators make them to signify double
          garments. Convenience and health are studied by the virtuous woman,
          far above ornament and fashion.

          millions have been impoverished by pride and profusion — but none have
          been impoverished, and many have been enriched, by charity. The
          virtuous woman after reaching forth her hands to the poor, has enough
          remaining to provide proper and elegant furniture for her house, and a
          dress for herself suitable to her station.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is no part of the character of a virtuous woman who will please
          some ladies so much as this part of it, which seems to allow some
          scope for <i>finery</i>. And it is not to be denied, that ornaments of
          a decent kind may very lawfully be used by those who can afford them —
          but Isaiah and Zephaniah, Paul and Peter, testify against that
          <i>vanity of dress </i>which is too much coveted by some of the
          gender.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The adorning recommended to women by the apostles, does not consist in
          gold, and pearls, and costly array — but in modest apparel, humility,
          sobriety and good works, and a meek and quiet mind. And Lemuel's
          mother says nothing inconsistent with this doctrine. If the virtuous
          woman has coverings of tapestry for her house, she makes them to
          herself; if she is clothed with silk (or fine linen, as it may be
          rendered) and purple, she earns it by her labors and godly management.
          She does not starve her charity by her finery, nor spend upon her
          dress that which might support a poor family. She does not reckon
          herself superior to the duties of a wife, nor exempted by wearing silk
          and purple, from using her spindle and distaff. From all this it
          appears, that the inspired writer allows the use of costly array to
          none but those who can afford it in a full consistency with the duties
          which they owe to their families, to the poor, and to all men.

          to transact public business, or to decide in causes that are brought
          before them. The wife of such a man may be allowed to wear silk and
          purple — but she is as careful to have her husband, as herself,
          dressed in a manner suitable to their rank. A man who sees him in the
          gate may easily judge that his wife is a virtuous woman. His clothes
          are decent, though not gaudy; his looks are cheerful; and the

          lies in their power to procure them a great deal of respect. For it is
          a greater honor to have it said that a man has a virtuous wife, than
          to be admired for riches and titles. Phocion's wife, when she was
          asked about her jewels, said that her husband was her jewel; and a man
          who is married to a virtuous wife has Solomon's warrant to say that he
          is possessed of a crown!

          It is astonishing to think what industry will accomplish. We think
          that the virtuous woman has done great things, when she has provided
          her house and her family with every convenience: but besides all this,
          she makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants
          with sashes. When other women impoverish their husbands by buying —
          she enriches her husband by selling those valuable commodities for
          which there is a constant demand.

        <p align="justify">
          It is only modern pride and laziness, which has introduced the idea
          that it is inconsistent with the dignity of a fine lady to make profit
          from her own accomplishments. This virtuous woman, although her
          husband sits among the elders, does not think it a discredit — but an
          honor to herself, to make linen garments and sashes for sale; and the
          wise will praise her on account of it.

          "The virtuous woman is clothed with silk and purple;" but she has much
          nobler ornaments than anything of that sort. She possesses a greatness
          of soul, an inward vigor and resolution of mind, which sets her above
          all those little and tormenting fears which keep many of her gender in
          perpetual uneasiness. The strength of her mind displays itself in her
          behavior, and gains universal esteem from men; and she wears those
          ornaments which are of great price in the sight of God himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those ladies that wear gold and jewels, dazzle the eyes and draw the
          regard of ordinary understandings — but how much brighter are the
          <i>ornaments of a meek and quiet spirit, of strength and honor</i>,
          which are the constant dress of the woman of virtue! Those who wear
          costly array, rejoice for the present, because they think themselves
          the object of all men's admiration — but they are often preparing
          future sorrow for themselves by their extravagance, and their neglect
          of those accomplishments which would gain them respect in old age.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The virtuous woman is not only cheerful at present — but she shall
          rejoice in time to come. It is a pleasure to her to reflect on her
          past conduct, and when she looks forward, she is not afflicted at the
          thought of the fading and uncertain nature of all earthly enjoyments.
          Besides that, she has made all the provision that human wisdom can
          reach against future contingencies, she can place a quiet confidence
          in the providence of God, who will not allow the righteous to be
          moved. She knows that her beauty must wither by old age — but the
          regard of her husband, and the esteem of others, is founded upon other
          motives that will never perish. The virtuous woman is one who fears
          the Lord, and light is sown for such people, and gladness for the
          upright in heart.

          As a sandy hill is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words
          to a quiet man. But the virtuous woman plagues neither her husband nor
          any other man with her talk. She has learned that <i>silence </i> and
          <i>subjection </i>which the Apostle Paul recommends to wives. She does
          not lock up her lips in a sullen silence — but when she speaks it is a
          pleasure to hear her, for she opens her mouth with wisdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Besides her other labors already mentioned, she rises in the morning,
          and finds time to read the Bible, and other instructive books. She
          meditates and reflects, and receives instruction from what she hears,
          and prays to her heavenly Father. And so she improves daily in
          knowledge and prudence; and when she opens her mouth, she says nothing
          but what is well worthy of being heard. She says nothing that savors
          of levity, or deceit, nothing that is unseasonable, nothing to gain
          herself the reputation of <i> wit</i>. All her words are expressions
          of that <i>wisdom </i>which adorns her mind, and that
          <i>virtue </i>which warms her heart, and regulates her conduct.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are some who gain a character for smartness at the expense of
          their reputation. They will speak the crudest things without
          provocation, and applaud themselves for it, as an evidence of their
          wit and boldness. But the virtuous woman abhors the thought of making
          any person uneasy. And when there is a necessity for reproving, and
          even then, she will be as gentle as can possibly consist with the
          efficacy of her admonitions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Kindness is painted on her <i>countenance</i>, and flows from her
          <i>tongue</i>. For it possesses the throne of her <i>heart</i>, and
          gives law to all her words and actions. She is a living explication of
          that beautiful description of charity which the Spirit of God gives us
          by the pen of the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 13.

        <p align="justify">
          She carefully inspects the behavior of her maidens and children. She
          is not idle when she is not working with her hands — but promoting the
          welfare of her family, by doing the duty of her place as mistress of
          the house. Her authority cannot fail of being respected in her family,
          when she sets such a <i>noble example of diligence </i>before them.
          She will take care that nothing indecent or offensive stains the honor
          of her family. When she is served by the labor of her maidens, she
          will not allow them to neglect the service of God. She will be very
          careful of the behavior of her children in their tender years, and
          will not see them trained up in <i>idleness</i>, or indulged in any
          <i>vanity </i>which may afterwards grow up into a vice. Lying, and
          evil speaking, and corrupt communication, are banished from every
          place where her influence extends. Her bread is well earned by her
          labors — and therefore she eats it with pleasure and appetite, and
          derives from it health and vigor to her body, and cheerfulness to her
          mind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>bread of idleness </i>has a very contrary effect; it is eaten
          without relish, and produces indigestion, and an innumerable train of
          lingering diseases. He who eats it, sins against God, who commands
          every man to work at his business with quietness, and to eat his own
          bread.

          Were women to consider their own interest and satisfaction — they
          would all endeavor to be virtuous. Every person counts it a great
          happiness to enjoy the esteem of those whom he loves — and the
          virtuous woman finds herself blessed in the tender affection and high
          esteem of her dear children, and her dearer husband.
          <i
            >Her children are constant spectators of her virtue, and experience
            the sweet fruits of it</i
          >. They cannot forbear to express their sense of it, by pouring out
          blessings upon her.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A mother deserves the tender regard of her children, although she
          cannot lay claim to the character of a virtuous woman. If an imperious
          mother is entitled to respect — then how can children express
          sufficient regard to one who is the ornament to them, and a happy
          instrument in training them up to piety and virtue? If their tongues
          were silent in her praise — then their dress, their cheerfulness,
          their good behavior, when they follow her precepts and example, would
          be a constant eulogy on her virtues.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The praises of her husband will be still more delight fill to her ears
          than those of her children. What earthly happiness can a good wife
          desire, like the affection and approbation of her husband? And this a
          virtuous woman can scarcely fail of possessing, for what heart has so
          much marble in it, as to be able to resist those virtues which every
          hour appear in his <i>other self? </i>He cannot refrain from bestowing
          praise on one whom he finds . . .<br />
          the <i>sweetener </i>of all his cares, <br />
          his faithful adviser in perplexities, <br />
          his comforter in every distress,<br />
          the instrument of a great part of his earthly felicity, <br />
          his best friend, <br />
          his unceasing joy, and <br />
          his brightest crown.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No wonder if the experience of such goodness and happiness makes him
          eloquent in her praise, and draws commendations from his tongue. He
          prefers her to every other woman who ever lived upon earth; and he is
          sincere in doing it, for she ravishes his heart by the beauties of her
          <i>mind </i>and <i>conduct</i>. Piety will dispose a man to think
          lowly of himself, in comparison with other men — but highly of his
          wife, when he compares her with other women.

          the Lord is to be praised."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Why is not <i>beauty </i>mentioned in the character of the virtuous
          woman? Is not beauty a bright ornament to her virtue? But there is no
          mention made of it in this description, because it is a lowly quality
          in comparison of those which are here enumerated. It is but a flower
          that fades in a day; and the love produced by it is but a transient
          passion. When beauty is not sweetened by virtue, the woman who
          possesses it is but like a swine with a golden jewel in its snout, as
          Solomon tells us. At the best, beauty cannot secure that love which it
          raises, for when it becomes familiar to the lover, it palls upon his
          sight; and sometimes tempts him to curse that
          <i>enchanting influence </i>which blinded his eyes to more solid
          virtues.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But a woman who fears the Lord, whether she has beauty or not — shall
          be praised. For <i>true piety </i>is the beauty of the soul, and
          excels that which lies in complexion and features, as much as Heaven
          is higher than the earth, or eternity is longer than time.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the most
          essential part of the virtuous woman's character. It is this which
          sanctifies every other part of it, and makes her all glorious within.
          The pleasant effects of the fear of the Lord spread themselves into
          every part of her behavior, and cannot but excite the admiration of
          all beholders.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The flowers of poetry have been exhausted in dressing out
          <i>beauty </i>to the greatest advantage — but this one verse of
          Scripture is sufficient to give us just notions of its real value. It
          is indeed a lovely trait when it is joined with piety and humility —
          but without them it is a snare and a trap. In choosing a wife, fools
          will follow their imagination — and the wise will act according to
          reason and the Word of God.

          Her children praise her, her husband praises her — and let every man

          she may be imitated by all her gender. There are multitudes who never
          fail to trumpet abroad the <i>faults </i>of their neighbors — but it
          would be much better to conspire in spreading abroad the
          <i>virtues </i>of those who are an ornament to human nature, and
          models for the behavior of all their neighbors. She is entitled to
          honor; and if no tongue should give it to her, the works of charity
          and wisdom, which she is constantly practicing, will be a monument to
          her name. She is praised by all the wise who know her, and she shall
          have praise of God on the day when the seal shall be set to every
          character.
