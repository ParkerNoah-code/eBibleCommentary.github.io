          "Wine is a mocker and strong drink is a brawler; whoever is led astray
          by them is not wise."
        </b>

        <p align="justify">
          Wine and strong drink are creatures of God, which are very useful to
          men when they are seasonably and moderately used — but by
          <i> abusing </i>them, we sin against the goodness and law of God, and
          against our own souls and bodies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wine deceives and mocks those who use it to excess, and punishes those
          who abuse it as an instrument of dishonor to him who gave it to men to
          cheer their hearts. It promises refreshment — but it steals away men's
          senses, until it makes them the objects of scorn to the sober. It made
          the venerable patriarch Noah a laughing-stock to his own son. It
          deprives men of their reason, and gives the government of the mind to
          the passions; and then those who were men of good behavior in their
          sober moments — become insolent and brawling. When the king of Israel
          was made drunk with bottles of wine, he forgot his dignity, and
          stretched out his hand with scorners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wine has been the beginning of many quarrels which have ended in
          wounds and blood. For it rouses the passions, it turns
          <i> suspicions </i>into certainties in the eye of the drunkard, and
          thus inflames resentments into irreconcilable animosities. It gives
          full range to all the hidden vices of the soul, and produces new vices
          of a dangerous kind. It destroys the power of reason, and infuses into
          the soul all the fury of a wild beast!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He who allows himself to be led astray by it is not wise, for he
          wastes his memory and his mind, as well as his money. He wounds his
          conscience, he enslaves himself to a tyrant, and enters upon a course
          which, when it becomes habitual, will render him useless and miserable
          upon earth, and exclude him from the kingdom of Heaven! When wine and
          strong drink are greedily swallowed down — they swallow the drunkard,
          and turn him into an raging beast.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wine had the honor of being used in the service of God under the law,
          and is still used in it under the gospel — so why should we use it in
          the service of Satan? It is not allowed by God but with
          <i> moderation</i>, to the greatest men on the greatest occasions.
          Neither birth days of kings, nor happy meetings of friends, nor the
          transacting of the most important businesses, will justify men in
          excess of wine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We should remember, that the day of Christ is approaching, and take
          care that our hearts be not overcharged with excess and drunkenness.
          We must remember from whom we receive the refreshments of life, and
          endeavor to glorify him in the use of them. We are called to the hope
          of drinking of the rivers of God's pleasures — and shall we fill
          ourselves with wine, wherein there is excess?

          king's wrath is like the roar of a lion; he who angers him forfeits
          his life."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon had probably seen too much evidence of a seditious disposition
          in that people over which he reigned, and therefore warns them again
          and again of the sin and danger of provoking kings to anger. Men have
          such a degree of self-will and pride, that they can scarcely be
          prevailed upon to submit to the necessary restraints of their liberty.
          Liberty is a valuable thing — but
          <i>licentiousness is the ruin of nations</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If the fear occasioned by the displeasure of a king is so intolerable
          — then what must it be to encounter the wrath of him whose voice is
          not only like the roaring of a lion — but like the sound of many
          thunders. His voice shakes the Heaven and the earth, and neither men
          nor devils shall be able to endure the terrors of it. To sin against
          Christ is to sin not only against our lives — but against our immortal
          souls!

          It is to a man's honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to
          quarrel."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          It is an honor for a man to avoid strife, and to overlook those things
          that might stir up anger. But when a man is engaged in contention — is
          it an honor for him to give it up? Will not the world say that we have
          a bad cause, or weak arguments, or a cowardly spirit, if we have not
          the last word? It does not matter what the world says — if the Spirit
          of God says other things. It is here declared to be honorable for a
          man to give up a debate for the sake of peace and quietness. By so
          doing, we testify our humility and meekness, our obedience to God, and
          our aversion to sin.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Christ</p></i>did not strive, nor cry out, nor
        cause his voice to be heard in the street — and surely it is a man's
        honor to imitate, as far as our weakness will allow, the meekness and
        gentleness of Christ. It was wise in <i>Paul </i>to make an
        acknowledgment of his error in speaking disrespectfully of the high
        priest, although that partial judge well deserved the sharpest reproof
        for his partiality and tyranny. It would have been wise in Job's friends
        to have yielded to the force of his convincing arguments, rather than,
        by endeavoring to maintain their errors, to expose themselves to the
        displeasure of God, and to the just mortification of being obliged to
        have recourse to the intercessions of that godly man whom they had so
        deeply injured.
        <p align="justify">
          But every fool is quick to quarrel. For a fool is so
          <i> self-conceited</i>, that he can bear no contradiction. He is so
          <i>insolent</i>, that he will have a hand in every other man's
          business. He is so <i>proud</i>, that he cannot bear to be found in
          the wrong. He is so <i>stubborn</i>, that he will have the last word,
          although his lips should prove his destruction.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Amaziah</p></i>was fairly warned of the danger of
        meddling with the king of Israel — but he would not hear reason, nor
        cease from strife, until he was brought with his kingdom to the verge of
        ruin. <i> <p align="justify">Zedekiah</p></i> entered into contention
        with the good prophet Micaiah, and had the insolence to strike that
        faithful servant of the Lord — but was soon after compelled to flee to
        an inner chamber to hide himself.
        <p align="justify">
          This is one difference between wise men and fools. The former are for
          peace — the latter are ordinarily keen for battle. This may be
          illustrated from the difference between the behavior of Nabal and
          David; Nabal had a very bad tongue, for as Nabal was his name, so
          folly was with him. He gave a very provoking answer to a very civil
          message from David, and thereby exposed himself and his family to
          ruin. David had human nature, and his passions were too fierce — but
          it was his honor that he was easily pacified, and although he did not
          leave off contention, as he should have done — yet he left it off
          before it came to a fatal extremity.

          "The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold, therefore he shall
          beg in harvest, and have nothing."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          It is one plain evidence of sloth for a man to be dexterous in finding
          <i>excuses </i>to shift of necessary work. If a small inconvenience is
          allowed as an excuse for idleness — then excuses will never be
          lacking. The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; and he will
          not sow because the ground is not in good order; and he will not weed
          his field because of the heat of summer; and he will not reap in
          harvest because he cannot endure to bend his back, and is afraid of an
          headache.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But is there any other useful business that can suit him, since
          farming is so disagreeable? No, one business would oblige him to a
          sedentary life; another is attended with too much fatigue; a third is
          too lowly for a gentleman; a fourth requires a man to rise early in
          the morning. He will sleep or lean on his elbow — or he will divert
          himself with any kind of sport — or he will talk until you are tired
          with him — or he will play at cards, for although he abhors business,
          he loves busy idleness. He will either do nothing — or what is worse
          than nothing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But he who will not work, must beg — and this is surely a base
          employment for a man who is <i>able </i>to work — but although he can
          conquer shame sufficiently to betake himself to it, his misery is,
          that nobody will give him anything, for
          <i>why should drones eat the labor of the bees? </i>Even in harvest,
          when plenty smiles all around, and when the hearts of men are enlarged
          with joy, and bestow liberal quantities of food upon their beasts —
          the wretched sluggard finds that every man's affections are shut
          against him. The <i>industrious </i>and <i>disabled poor </i>are then
          blessed, for the law of God requires the gleanings and leavings of the
          fields to be allowed them — but the same law requires that
          <i>he who will not work, should not eat</i>.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Spiritual sloth</p></i>is revealed by this mark,
        and attended with the like misery. The careless Christian will not
        attend the house of God, by reason of the cold of winter, or the heat of
        summer. He will not keep up the worship of God in his family, because he
        is encumbered with worldly business; or if shame and love of character
        obliges him to perform those services which the eyes of men behold —
        then there is so much attention of spirit necessary for the duties of
        the closet, that he cannot find in his heart to perform them at all, or
        to perform them to any good purpose. What will become of such
        <i>sluggards </i>at the end of the world? Our Lord tells us, they will
        beg and have nothing!

          >"The purposes of a man's heart are deep waters, but a man of
          understanding draws them out."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          The heart of man is a great deep — and there are thoughts and devices
          in it as much past numbering, as the creeping things and fish in the
          sea. God alone searches the heart, and tries the thoughts of men. By
          one glance of his eye, he pierces into the bottom of our souls, and
          knows our thoughts infinitely better than we ourselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But although a man cannot go to the bottom of a deep well, he may draw
          out some of its water for use by means of a bucket. And although a man
          cannot penetrate into the bottom of another man's heart, he may find
          out some of his thoughts and plans, his purposes and designs, or form
          such conjectures about them as are necessary to regulate his own
          motions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A man of understanding, without the gift of prophecy may know many
          things that are useful to be known about the counsels of those who are
          most desirous to conceal them. <i>David </i>revealed, and represented
          before his God the secret projects of his enemies against him, when
          both the inward thought and the heart of every one of them was deep.
          And <i>Job </i> saw clearly what his friends aimed at by all their
          flaming discourses about the misery of the wicked, before they named
          himself as the object of that vengeance which they described.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A man of sagacity has a knowledge of human nature, which assists him
          in finding out the plans and designs of particular men. He can avail
          himself of their gestures, their general course of behavior, their
          behavior in particular instances; and on sudden emergencies, their
          silence, their words, even when they are disguising their thoughts;
          their connections and company, their interests and humors, to form our
          judgment of their thoughts and designs. And by this means, he is often
          enabled to guard himself and his good name from the snares of the
          wicked. Wisdom is profitable, you see, not only for the life to come —
          but likewise for the present life — but hypocrisy and deceit profits
          little. It is often detected by men — it is always known to God; and
          the day is coming in which he will make manifest the secrets of all
          hearts.

          >"Many a man will proclaim his own goodness — but a faithful man who
          can find?"
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          It is very natural for men to have a high opinion of themselves. Many
          men who have a better opinion of their own worth, than any other man
          has — but a man of consideration will discern the folly of self
          conceit, and will be cautious of publishing his own imagined virtues
          to the world. There are few who have the good sense to consider these
          facts, and therefore it is very common in conversation to hear men
          proclaiming their own praises either directly, or by plain
          insinuations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If they are ashamed to talk of their own generosity and charity in an
          avowed manner, they catch at the good opinion, and applause of other
          men, by a variety of methods, sometimes commending virtue and goodness
          with a design of showing their own love to it — at other times running
          down their neighbors, for the lack of these virtues, imagining that
          the depression of other men will be their own exaltation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sometimes they insist upon particular instances of goodness, which
          they think, from some known pieces of their behavior, will be a means
          of leading people to think of themselves. And on other occasions, they
          will take occasion, from what others in the company are saying, to
          hale into the conversation some of their own good deeds, as if they
          had been led to mention them without any previous design.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But a man is not a proper witness in his own cause, for he is ready to
          form, from the influence of self love, too good an opinion of himself.
          If the love of our wives or children covers their faults, and
          magnifies their virtues — then self love must have a still greater
          influence in bribing our judgments, so that an honest man's testimony
          of his own goodness can scarcely be taken. But among boasters, you
          will scarcely find a man so honest as not to exceed, in his own
          praise, the bounds of what he himself knows to be fact.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Scripture declares, that a truly faithful and godly man is rarely
          to be found — and yet if men's own word could be taken, there is
          scarcely a bad man to be found. We have therefore great need to be
          <i> cautious in forming our judgment of ourselves</i>, lest we deceive
          our own souls, and pass a sentence upon ourselves, opposite to that
          which our great judge will pass upon us at the last day. Nor must we
          be rash in trusting men, and choosing friends. He is one among a
          thousand, who possesses such kindness and integrity, as will entitle
          him to the character of a faithful friend.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We learn, in the last place, from this proverb, to let strangers
          praise us, rather than our own lips, except when evident necessity
          obliges us. For self praise will make a hundred people to conceive a
          bad opinion of us, sooner than one wise man to entertain a good
          opinion of us.

          "The just man walks in integrity; his children are blessed after him."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          The just man lives by faith in the Son of God, for, like his father
          Abraham, he believes in the Redeemer, and his faith is counted to him
          for righteousness. But although he is pronounced by God a righteous
          person, for the sake of a righteousness not wrought by himself — yet
          he is not the less earnest in endeavoring to be holy in all manner of
          living, for he knows that those men deceive themselves who turn the
          grace of God into a license for sin — and that he who does
          righteousness is righteous, even as God is righteous.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The just man is a man of integrity, for he follows after perfection,
          although he knows that he cannot reach it. He does not think that a
          good and kind behavior towards men, will compensate for the neglect of
          his duty to God, any more than a social behavior will atone for
          disloyalty to his prince — and therefore he makes it his daily
          practice to walk in all good conscience before God, and to testify the
          utmost gratitude to him who loved us and died for us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          At the same time, he feels the force of that saying of Scripture,
          which is sufficient to strike an alarm into the most hardened
          consciences of those who neglect morality while they profess religion,
          "If a man says I love God, and hates his brother — he is a liar, and
          the truth is not in him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The integrity of the just man, is not like the pretended integrity of
          the moralist, for it includes piety, justice, sobriety, and a
          conscientious regard to every precept of God, without excluding those
          who appear to vain men to be of small importance, or those who most
          directly oppose the prevailing disposition of the mind. The just man
          walks in his integrity, for his righteousness is not like the morning
          cloud — but like the light of the sun, which shines more and more unto
          the perfect day. God tries him — the devil and the world, and the
          flesh, solicit him to sin — but he will not turn aside into the ways
          of iniquity. Or if he should, he will not <i>continue </i>to walk in
          them — but returns with bitter regret to that good and straight way,
          which leads unto life, and continues in that path until the end of his
          life, for his heart is set upon it, and upon that heavenly city to
          which it leads.

          his children. And will the God who delights in mercy, exercise less
          kindness to his own people, than severity to the wicked? Far from it.
          While the rich man rejoices that he has much treasure laid up in his
          house, to be enjoyed by his family after him — the godly man has much

          law. This awe of royalty is impressed by God upon the minds of men,
          for the peace and benefit of human society. Kings are obliged to use
          that authority with which the Most High God has dignified them as his

          vice.

          them! How can men presume that the Judge of all the earth will allow
          sin to go unpunished — when he will not permit his viceregents on

        <p align="justify">
          It we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, for we were
          conceived and shaped in iniquity, and unless our hearts are made pure,
          we must remain forever abominable in the sight of the most holy God.
          The depravity of the human race is not here expressly asserted — but
          it is taken for granted, as an incontestable truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The call of God to sinners is, "Wash and be clean. Cleanse your hands,
          you sinners, purify your hearts." But neither our righteousness nor
          our strength lies in ourselves. Except Christ washes us, we have no
          part in him, and remain under the reigning power of sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But even those who are washed by his blood and Spirit, cannot say that
          they have made their hearts so clean, that they are entirely pure from
          their sin. They are daily employed in cleansing themselves from all
          pollutions — and yet <i>the leprosy of sin </i>will cleave to their
          earthly tabernacles, until they are pulled down by death.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If sin dwells in the best of us — then our dependence must be on the
          grace of the Redeemer, by whose blood our sins are expiated, and by
          whose powerful agency we crucify the flesh with its affections and
          lusts. Purity of heart ought to be our constant study — for so far as
          our hearts are cleansed, we are pure from our sin. Under all the
          imperfections of our holiness, we have reason to join thanksgiving
          with our sorrows, for although no man on earth can lay claim to
          perfect purity — yet every believer in Jesus has abundant
          encouragement to hope that he shall be presented in due time, without
          spot or blemish, before the throne of God!

        <p align="justify">
          Once has God spoken, yes twice have we heard this, that unjust weights
          are detested by God. It is plain that unjust measures come under the
          same condemnation. But here they are expressly mentioned, so that no
          man can pretend to observe the <i>letter </i>of the law, while he
          transgresses the <i>spirit </i>of it. If a man keeps one measure or
          weight for selling, and another for buying; or if he keeps one for
          selling to people that have too much skill to be cheated, and another
          for selling to the ignorant and unwary — then he exposes himself to
          the hot anger and severe vengeance of God, who hates all
          unrighteousness, especially that which lies in perverting the means of
          justice.

          administration of government, in church or state. Injustice in
          merchants is very bad — but unrighteousness in those who rule by the

          <i>Sincerity </i> is one of those qualities wherein we ought to
          resemble children, for they cannot disguise their inclinations — but a
          little attention to their childish talk and behavior will enable a
          person to reveal their present dispositions, and to form a probable
          conjecture concerning their future behavior.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          One thing appears in the behavior of children with too much evidence —
          that they are the descendants of Adam. The selfishness, vanity, and
          revengeful spirit, that appears in all of them, are lineaments of the
          image of the first transgressor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But there is a very great difference among them in their temper, which
          may be justly considered as an indication of a greater difference in
          the manner of their conduct, when they arrive at manly years. Some are
          kind and obliging, and easily managed. Others are intractable, sullen,
          and spiteful. It is the duty of parents to improve and nourish the
          good dispositions which their children reveal, and to check every
          appearance of vice — before it is matured by time into settled habits.
          Parents generally consider the mental status and inclinations of their
          children, to direct them in the choice of a profession — but they
          ought to be no less careful to consider their turn of mind in their
          earliest years, to direct themselves in their religious education.
          Herein several parents reveal their <i>partial fondness </i>for their
          children, regarding with applause every appearance of goodness as a
          happy presage — but considering every instance of perverse behavior as
          an instance of childish ignorance, which time will reform of course.
          But Solomon tells us that their bad, as well as their good behavior,
          when they shall become men — may be conjectured from their childish
          doings.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Children of a pleasant disposition may disappoint the expectations
          that have been formed of them — but in that case parents may generally
          blame themselves for neglecting to avail themselves of their good
          dispositions, to graft on them religious instructions, or for
          permitting them to fall into the dangerous society of those who not
          only live in sin, but, like Jeroboam, make Israel to sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When bad dispositions appear in children, it is necessary for parents
          to early use those means which God has appointed for reclaiming them.
          The rod and reproof give wisdom — and when these, and the like means,
          are neglected, or not accompanied with fervent prayer — then parents
          have great reason to reflect on themselves with shame, if their
          children prove <i> thorns </i>in their eyes, when their vices have
          attained the vigor of riper years, and confirmed habit.

          from the ministry of this admirable organ.

        <p align="justify">
          The <i>ear </i>is that sense by which we enjoy the pleasures of
          society and friendship, by which we learn the most interesting and
          entertaining truths, and by which we receive the instructions of life.

          It is by the kind agency of our Maker that our eyes see, and our ears

          companions of Saul in his journey to Damascus.

          To use these instruments of sense as inlets to temptation and sin — is

          How shocking is it to deserve the reproof that the prophet gave to

          We are God's creatures. Our senses are his; our souls are his; all our

          all-governing providence. Whether, therefore, we see, or hear, or
          think on those objects which we are acquainted with, by means of our
          bodily senses, or the exercise of our rational powers — let us mind
          above everything, the glory of God.

          nor sleep must be used for their own sakes, nor must we be intemperate
          in either of them. <i>Sleep </i>taken in a moderate degree, is the
          nurse of nature, it recruits our physical and mental powers, and
          prepares us for the labors of life. But excess of sleep enervates the
          body, and stupefies our souls, and is loved only by sluggards.

          degree, for all the time that we sleep beyond what is needful for us,
          our talents are unemployed, and our time is running out in vain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Long life is universally desired, and death is set at as great a
          distance as possible — but the lover of sleep voluntarily gives up a
          considerable part of his life. And during all the time that he wastes
          in needless sleep, he might as well be in the state of death, for
          anything he does, or enjoys.

          several years more in the course of a life than the other.

          Poverty and hunger, in the course of things, according to the

          rising.

          his family.

          It is not said that he shall have everything that an unbridled

          bread to eat, and clothing to put on. These things will generally
          satisfy a man diligent in his business, for his work makes both sleep
          and food pleasant to him. If people who love their work, should prove
          unsuccessful in business, or be disabled from working — they will meet
          with pity and relief; while starving sluggards are hated and despised.

          the lower sort of dealers, and is scarcely reckoned a piece of
          unrighteousness. It is the art of buyers to get a good bargain, by
          depreciating the commodity which they mean to purchase.

          The inspired moralist, that he might come home to men's bosoms, gives

          and no lie is of the truth, nor is any lying habit consistent with the
          character of an honest man. Men may, if they please, form to
          themselves rules of morality from the general practice of the world —
          but these are not the rules by which they must be judged at the last
          day. If we were heathen, we could not be excused in using little
          deceitful tricks which do not come within the compass of the criminal
          law — but we are Christians, and our bibles testify against them, and
          threaten punishment to those who go beyond and defraud their brother.
          Indeed, very little is to be made by such poor artifices but guilt —
          for they are so common that almost every man sees through them. The
          people that use these pitiful tricks in making a bargain, don't think
          there is much evil in them, for they boast of their trickery and good

          goodness of the commodities which they formerly depreciated — they
          denounce this woe against themselves.

          the price which they cost him, or of the price that he was offered for
          them, or when he uses deceitful means to conceal their bad properties
          — then he is dealing unrighteously, and seeking the gain by fraud — by
          which he is not so likely to fill his purse as to wound his character,
          and bring the curse of God upon his substance.

          The wisest and richest of kings, inspired by the Author of wisdom and

          mines of the east! A deep impression of this truth, would be of very
          great advantage to our souls. When a man values gold and rubies above
          wisdom, he lies exposed to a thousand temptations of a very dangerous
          kind. For he is like a blind man who knows not where he goes, and will
          leap into a pit, if he imagines that money is at the bottom of it,
          because he sees not how deep it is, and how impossible it will be to

          We lately heard that the love of sleep will soon reduce a man to
          poverty and hunger. It is not, however, the speediest method of
          becoming poor, for nothing will so soon ruin a man's estate and
          credit, as rash suretyship. If you see a man who engages in putting up
          security for one who is a stranger to him, and especially for a
          immoral woman, trust him not if he should swear, and offer you the
          surest bonds for payment. He will in a very short time become a
          bankrupt, and therefore lend him nothing. And if you sell him anything
          without ready money, be sure to have a sufficient pledge. You may even
          take his garment without any breach of charity, for the law about
          restoring the garment taken by way of pledge, was made for the benefit
          of the poor and unfortunate, and not for those who are running to ruin
          by their own willful folly.

          from their sins, to compensate for the guilt and danger of them. A man
          would not do a piece of injustice without the prospect of some gain

          Wisdom lies, in the first place, in forming right purposes; and
          secondly, in devising, and executing proper plans for bringing these
          good purposes to pass. However good our designs are — yet rashness and
          inconsideration will be sure to render them abortive. And, besides our
          own wisdom, it is necessary for us, in all matters of importance, to
          take the advice of the wise and upright. If we have such a high
          opinion of our own wisdom, that we think we have no need of counsel
          from other men — then we prove ourselves fools of the worst kind, for
          there is more hope of any other kind of fools, than for those who are
          wise in their own conceit.

          Do we limit wisdom to ourselves? Are we wiser than Solomon, who had

          Above all things, war is to be made with good advice, for the lack of

        They sooth and caress a man to fish his secrets out of him, and they
        tell the secrets which they have got by these base means, to the next
        companion they meet, and perhaps make very considerable additions to
        them, for they take the liberty to add conjectures of their own to what
        they have heard. By spreading their stories, they
        <i>sow the seeds of contention </i>among neighbors, and their words are
        as dainties which go down into the innermost parts of the belly. Beware,

          the most dangerous enemies we have. If we give them our company — we
          are very likely to hear stories that will vex us. If we tell them any
          of our secrets — we may be sure of having them divulged, and
          represented to our disadvantage. When they tell us stories about other
          people, we may judge how they will behave to us — for when they were
          in the company of these people, they flattered them as much as they
          now flatter us — and by their pretenses of friendship, they made a

          universe.

        <p align="justify">
          When those crimes that deserve death are unpunished by men, the

          permits them to fall into other crimes, that bring them to the
          gallows, as we may learn from the confessions and last speeches of
          many malefactors who have lamented their disobedience to their

          The punishment prepared for all impenitent sinners, is described in

          fraud and extortion. This does not, however, militate against anything
          which the inspired moralist has said, for he never meant to deny that
          treasures may be obtained by wickedness. Those who will be rich may
          get riches by cheating and lying, by fraud and oppression, by grinding
          the faces of the poor, and by toiling their poor servants until they
          groan under their hard bondage. These and a thousand other ways of
          unjust getting, may put money in their pockets — but the fact is that
          it is of no use to them, when they have got it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, for a very plain reason,
          because they are not attended with the blessing of God, and it is only
          this blessing which preserves riches and makes them a comfort to men.
          It is far better to have nothing — than to have the riches of kingdoms
          without the blessing of God; for those who lack it, will find
          everything they have a curse.

          up mountains of gold, they will be found only mountains of snow, which
          the curse of God will soon melt! He shall not be rich, neither shall
          his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection
          thereof upon the earth. What he gets unjustly, shall not only be
          blasted — but it shall blast everything that he had got by fair means.

          impression upon the minds of some people, than any other. It is
          addressed to the only ear by which the covetous man can hear, for he
          is deaf to everything but what concerns the mammon of unrighteousness.
          If he believes anything that God says, he must see that he is taking a

          under their power, to the most dangerous irregularities. By indulging
          them, we would be driven on to make very disproportional returns for
          the wrongs done to us. We might wreck our vengeance on the blameless,

          entangled in a dangerous snare by the devil, who will endeavor to
          persuade us that our honor is doubly enraged by the provocation
          received. To say that we will recompense evil, is the same thing with
          saying, that we will step into the throne of God, and wrest his
          thunderbolts out of his hand, to hurl them against all whom we judge

          pass unrevenged," says one, "I expose myself to every shaft of malice,
          and may expect still greater injuries than those I have already
          received." There is no fear of that, says Solomon, wait on the Lord,
          and he shall save you. Are you defrauded in your interests? Wait on
          the Lord who gives and takes away at his pleasure, and he will make
          up, if he sees it good for you, all your loss.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Are you wronged in your credit? Trust in the Lord, and he shall bring
          forth your righteousness to the light, as you find he did in the cases
          of Job, and David, and Mephibosheth. Whatever injury you have felt, or
          fear — commit yourself to God with a calm and forgiving spirit, and he
          will either prevent your fears, or make a rich amends for the malice
          of your enemies. Only you must wait his own time for doing it, for he
          who believes does not make haste — but waits God's leisure, as it well
          becomes us to do when it is God whom we trust.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must not wait on the Lord for destruction to our enemies. David was
          blessed with divine inspiration, and had directions for praying
          against some of his spiteful enemies — but herein we are not to
          consider him as a pattern for us. We have the noble example of our
          Lord Jesus Christ, who did not repay evil with evil — but prayed for
          his persecutors, leaving us an example that we should follow his
          steps. Wait on the Lord, and whatever way he deals with your enemies,
          he shall save you, and that is all you can reasonably desire.

          Will you will insist that it is better to secure yourself against new
          injuries, by revenging the old? The question is clearly this: Is your
          safety and protection best lodged in God's hand — or your own? By
          indulging your revengeful spirit, you do yourself a greater hurt than
          your greatest enemy can do you — for you gratify his ill-nature, when
          you allow it to make a deep impression on your spirit, without which
          it could do you little or no hurt. But by committing your cause to
          God, you turn his ill will to your great advantage, making it an
          occasion for the exercise of the noblest graces, which are attended
          with the sweetest fruits, and with the rich blessing of God.

          eye of God, who laughs at their impious imaginations, and without
          suspending the freedom of their wills, determines them to concur in
          the execution of his holy and immutable purposes.

          They know not, when they are consulting — how they will determine; and
          when they have determined — whether they shall succeed in their
          purpose; and when they are fixed in their minds — whether they shall
          be able to perform what they intend; and if they perform it — whether
          it shall answer their intention, or some purpose entirely opposite to

          particular people, and all the weighty businesses of states and
          kingdoms — are in God's hand like the potter's clay, to be molded into
          any shape he pleases. And he will manage everything wisely for his own

          their thrones, or chased out of the world; and of the kingdom of our
          Redeemer there shall be no end. For he who sits in Heaven saw from his

          If you should be able to accomplish your designs — are you sure that

          crucified Christ to gratify their spite, and to secure their place and
          nation from the Romans — but Christ conquered every enemy by his
          cross, and the Almighty executed the most tremendous vengeance by the
          hands of the Romans on the murderers of his beloved Son.

          A conviction of this truth would make us to acknowledge the Lord in
          all our ways, and to endeavor to walk before him unto all pleasing. It
          would raise us above those strong temptations which have all their
          force from the fear of men's displeasure, or the hope of their favor.
          It would make the believer in Christ cheerful under every cross, while
          he could say: "My heavenly Father rules all, and my enemies can do
          nothing without his providence."

          This truth has also a mighty influence to destroy our confidence in
          our own strength and wisdom. The children of Israel made great
          promises to God at mount Sinai — but they soon broke them, for the
          Lord had not given them eyes to see, nor ears to hear, nor hearts to
          understand. Peter was very sincere in promising to cleave to Christ,
          although all men should forsake him — but by his self-confidence,
          provoked God to withhold the supports of his grace, and was left to
          behave, not like a rock — but like the slender twig which bends before
          the gentlest blast.

          Stealing and robbery are crimes so detestable and pernicious to men,
          that they are everywhere severely punished. But God is greater than
          men, and to rob God is a greater and more dangerous crime than those
          by which our fellow men are wronged in their substance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But will a man rob God? Can any man be so <i>foolish </i> as to try
          it, or so <i>mighty </i>as to accomplish it? Malachi complains that
          this crime was very common in his time, and there are too many
          instances of it, even in these latter days. He who gives to the poor,
          lends unto the Lord; and that which is appropriated to the service of
          the Gospel and the support of the ministry, belongs unto God, and
          should be given to his servants as the receivers of his revenues.
          Therefore, when the poor are cheated of their dues, or those who labor
          in the gospel are deprived of their hire, or anything alienated that
          was justly devoted to the service of God — a robbery is attempted,
          and, in some sense, executed, upon God himself, who cannot be pleased
          with so base and ungrateful conduct towards him, from whom we receive
          everything that we possess.

          The man who applies to his own use, and devours that which is holy, is
          greatly mistaken if he thinks himself a gainer. He is just in the same

          snatches at the bait which the fowler has placed for it to draw it

          The people of Judah in <i>Haggai's </i>time, were crossed and
          disappointed in all the labors of their hands, because they bestowed
          their money upon building houses for themselves, rather than in
          building the temple of the Lord. And in <i>Malachi's </i>time, the
          whole nation was cursed with a curse for robbing God in tithes and in
          offerings.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is no less a snare for a man, after vows, to make inquiry, in order
          to evade the obligation of his solemn engagements. Some men are much
          more forward in making, than in paying vows. Their religion lies in
          transient flows of affection — not in solid piety. When their
          affections are roused by some remarkable providence, or allured by
          some pleasant blessing; or roused by some alarming sermon — then they
          are ready with their vows to the Most High God. But when their
          affections return to their usual temper, they endeavor to find out
          some shift, to free their consciences from their obligations, which
          they voluntarily took up on themselves. Their conduct draws them into
          the snares of the devil, who will suggest an hundred pretenses to
          excuse the breach of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must therefore be cautious and considerate in <i> making </i>vows —
          and speedy in <i>performing </i>them. If we are Christians, we have
          engaged ourselves to be the Lord's. Justice and truth and gratitude
          require us to pay our vows, and every transgression derives the great
          aggravation of treachery from our sacred promises. If our promises to
          men must be kept inviolate — then how much more our promise to God! If
          it is sinful to make inquiry after vows — then who can express the
          guilt that arises out of downright violations of them!

          In like manner, the king who does not loll in his palace to indulge

          they may not prove a nuisance to society, an infectious plague to the
          country, and provocations of the wrath of God against the whole

          confine their punishments within the bounds of law. But the king of

          The Father of our spirits, has bestowed on us a glorious distinction

          were framed by his powerful agency — but our spirits were created by
          him within us. In our animal bodies we have some resemblance of the
          brutes — but our intellectual faculty raises us to some degrees of
          likeness to the angels of God, for they are candles lighted within us,
          by him who breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, and made
          him a living soul.

          By the light of <i>reason</i>, especially when it is brightened by
          divine revelation, we are enabled to survey many of the wonderful
          works of God, and to discern the evidences of his eternal power and
          Godhead. By this candle, we can take a view of the wonderful structure
          of our own bodies, which are fearfully and wonderfully made.

          But the most necessary kind of knowledge which it gives us, next to

          A king who was perfectly acquainted with the constitution, laws, and

          thoroughly versed in every art and science, in all histories, and
          every branch of commerce and law — and yet is unacquainted with his

          Heathen themselves were so deeply impressed with the importance of
          <i>self knowledge</i>, that it was a general opinion among some wise

          from Heaven.

        <p align="justify">
          Reason rightly employed, will make us acquainted with the excellent
          nature and uses of our faculties, with our personal dispositions and
          talents, with our defects and constitutional faults, with our
          prejudices, and the temptations by which we are most ready to be
          overcome, with our state and frame in relation to God. The mention of
          these different branches of self knowledge, is enough to show the
          value and necessity of it. We are commanded to keep our own hearts
          with all diligence — and how can we keep them without some knowledge
          of their most important concerns?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But we cannot know ourselves unto perfection; and therefore we ought
          to search deeper and deeper into our own hearts, to keep an eye upon
          the movements of our own minds, and the frame of our hearts under
          prosperous and adverse providences, and under injuries from men, or
          while we are employed in the performance of our duty to God — that we
          may improve in self-acquaintance.

          Above all, we ought to compare our hearts with the Word of God, and to

          A king must scatter and crush the wicked — but he will prove a tyrant
          unless he tempers his severity with mercy and goodness. Severity to
          criminals is exercised by a wise king, from a principle of mercy to
          the community at large — and he will spare where he can spare without
          betraying his trust. Such behavior secures the affections of his
          subjects; and is attended with the blessing of providence, by which
          thrones are established.

          Equality of age and dispositions naturally produces affection and
          friendship — but difference of age and talents tends too much to

          and the young in mind that each of them have their different
          endowments, which should endear them to one another.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Old</p></i> men should not despise the young for
        their lack of experience and gravity, for God has honored them with
        vigor of body, which qualifies them for active service to God and their
        generation. How could old men defend their lives and properties, or how
        could they exist, if they were not assisted by the strength of the
        young?
        <p align="justify">
          Far less should the <i>young </i>despise the old for their
          infirmities, or for that fretfulness of temper which old age too often
          produces. For God has favored them with length of days, and crowned
          them with gray hair, the badge of their <i>experience</i>, and, it is
          to be hoped, of their <i>wisdom</i>. If the hoary head is the splendor
          of old men, it should draw respect from the young, who are commanded

          It was a saying of Lewis IX of France, when he was old, that if he had

          God is wise and good in distributing his gifts among men of all ranks

          <i>idol </i>to himself and others; and none, by lacking everything

          our aversion. Correction and affliction for the present, seem to be
          not joyous — but grievous. There is a far worse evil from which they
          are a means of reclaiming us. Sin is infinitely worse than affliction,
          and affliction is really turned into a blessing to those who rightly
          improve it, for those wounds cleanse away evil, and stripes are
          instrumental, not only in reforming the life but in cleansing the
          heart.

        <i> <p align="justify">Parents</p></i>ought not, therefore, to spare the

        <i>instruction </i> and <i>prayer </i>with chastisement — for still it
        must be remembered that the blessing of God alone can make it useful for
        cleansing the inmost being.

        <i> <p align="justify">Children</p></i>ought to welcome the rod of
        chastisement, as a necessary means for their spiritual advantage.

          The chastisements inflicted by magistrates upon malefactors who do not
          deserve death, may have the same happy effect — and therefore mercy
          ought to mingle itself with the punishments inflicted upon them.
          According to the law, when a man deserved stripes, he was not to
          receive more than forty, and the reason given was, "lest your brother
          should seem vile unto you." He was to be considered as a brother that
          might be reclaimed, and was not to be treated contemptuously, lest, by
          despair of recovering his character, he should be hardened in sin.
        </p>

          Corrections from God are gracious and merciful, even when they are
