          "Better is a poor man who walks in integrity, than he who is perverse
          in his lips, and is a fool."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          So depraved are the understandings of men, that the rich are generally
          honored for their wealth — although their conduct shows them to be
          destitute of any noble virtue. While the poor are despised — though
          they are adorned with the beauties of religion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To give an outward respect to the rich, according to the innocent
          fashions of the place where we live, is not a sin; for if providence
          makes a distinction, we may do it likewise, between the rich and the
          poor. But it is a sign of great corruption in our minds, to
          <i>value </i> the rich as if they were worthier men, and more
          deserving of our esteem and affection than the poor — when grace has
          made a plain difference in favor of the poor, of a kind infinitely
          more important than the outward gifts of providence ever made.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The bad effects of this unjust preference are censured by the apostle
          James, in the second chapter of his epistle. We ought undoubtedly to
          follow God, in the judgment which he gives of things and people, as
          far as that judgment is revealed — and we find that<i>
            he sets no value upon riches</i
          >. He oftentimes bestows riches on those whom he abhors — and denies
          them to his favorites. But the upright, however poor, are his delight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God esteems Job as a perfect and upright man, and he still bestows
          higher commendations on him, after he was stripped of all his
          substance, because he had given additional proof of his steadfast
          integrity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When Christ was on earth, he was a poor man who walked in his
          integrity. Surely the lovers of Christ will never value a man the
          less, because he is as Christ also was in the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In short, the upright man, however poor and lowly, is not only a man
          of better dispositions and behavior than the rich worldling — but he
          is also incomparably happier and richer, and shall be rich as long as
          God himself is rich!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Be satisfied and thankful, you who are taught by the Spirit of God, to
          walk in integrity. You are rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom —
          and in this world you have and shall have everything that infinite
          wisdom and divine love sees fit for you!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here the poor may see a certain method of being rich, or of obtaining
          what is far better than riches. Do not labor to be rich in gold and
          silver — but seek after that which Christ calls the
          <i>true riches</i>, and which he will dispense unto those who seek
          them in his appointed way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let not the rich man glory in his wealth — if he is perverse in his
          lips, he is poor and miserable, and blind, and naked; and the esteem
          of men will not counterbalance the abhorrence of God. Go to Christ
          under deep impressions of your poverty, and buy from him gold tried in
          the fire, and you shall be truly rich!<br />

        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 19:2.</p></font>
          "It is not good to have zeal without knowledge, nor to be hasty and
          miss the way."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          To lack that knowledge which we need for our direction through life,
          is very pernicious. For we are in a dangerous world, full of pits and
          snares; and the man who has not eyes in his head, must fall, sooner or
          later, into destruction!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When the blind are led by the blind, they cannot well avoid falling
          into the ditch. But blind sinners are led by a quick-sighted and
          crafty devil, who will certainly land them in eternal perdition.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Although we have knowledge in our heads, it will not profit us, unless
          we have it also in our hearts. Knowledge, when it is not loved and
          reduced into <i>practice</i> — will only serve to bear testimony for
          God against the abuser of light, and to heighten his condemnation. A
          man of much knowledge, and a bad practice, carries about him, like
          Uriah, that which will prove his own death. To lack knowledge, is not
          good. To have knowledge, and not to use it as the directory of our
          life, cannot be one jot better! He who hastens with his feet, and
          takes no heed to his way, sins!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is no sin — but a duty, to run in the way of God's commandments. It
          was an evidence of David's wisdom, that he made haste, and delayed not
          to run out of the paths of sin, when he considered where they would
          lead him. To run on, without consideration, wherever our imagination
          or our passions lead us, exposes us to much sin and danger. Therefore
          we are commanded to walk circumspectly, keeping our eye upon the
          ground we tread, that we may not slip; and observing the rule of duty,
          that we may not transgress it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Even in those businesses that are lawful, we will be drawn into sin,
          without circumspection. For the devil has snares spread for us
          everywhere in this evil world, and he who makes haste to be rich,
          shall not be innocent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Although we ought to run in the ways of the Lord, and not faint — yet
          <i>rashness </i>in our religious course will be attended with much
          sin. We must carry the <i>lamp of truth </i>with us, otherwise, by
          running in the dark, we will certainly stumble.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As rashness and inconsideration are sinful — so they are also the
          causes of a great deal of the sin that is in the world. Men would not
          choose, or at least they would not so resolutely keep the ways of
          iniquity — were it not that they lack knowledge and thought, as Isaiah
          clearly shows in the case of idolaters.
        </p>

        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 19:3.</p></font>
          "A man's own folly ruins his life, yet his heart rages against the
          LORD."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Let no man say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God." God tempts
          no man — but every man is tempted when he is seduced into evil by the
          blindness of his own mind, and the perverseness of his own heart. The
          world and the devil may indeed <i>persuade </i>us to sin — but none of
          them can <i>force </i>us. When a man sins, he does more harm to
          himself than all the legions of Hell can do to him. Therefore,
          whenever our way is sinful, we must chiefly blame ourselves. It would
          be <i>blasphemy </i>to charge the most holy God with our sins — and it
          is <i>folly </i>to transfer the fault unto our seducers. For if our
          enemy should persuade us to stab ourselves to the heart, it is our own
          madness to comply.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When our way is sinful, we soon feel the miserable consequences of our
          folly. For wretchedness, in one form or other, follows sin, as the
          shadow follows the body. But we are so reluctant to blame ourselves
          for the consequences of our own folly, that our hearts will rather
          fret against the Lord, as if <i>he </i>were the cause of our ruin!
          Adam laid the blame of his sin upon the woman, whom God gave to be
          with him, indirectly transferring his own folly to his Maker — and it
          is natural and common for men to follow the example of their common
          parent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This corrupt disposition is not entirely rooted out of the saints
          themselves. It was David's fault that he did not cause the ark to be
          carried in the proper manner from the house of Obed Edom. Yet when God
          made a breach upon the people on that account, David was displeased.
          Men are oftener guilty of this sin than they imagine. Our hearts fret
          against the Lord, by fretting at the <i>instruments </i>of his
          providence. Therefore, when the people murmured against Moses in the
          wilderness, he tells those who their murmuring was not against him and
          his brother Aaron — but against the Lord!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David would not fret against Shimei, because he looked upon him as an
          instrument employed by God for his correction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Instead of fretting, it is our duty to accept of the punishment of our
          iniquity, and to bless God that matters are not as bad with us as we
          deserve. For why should a living man complain, when the damned have no
          just reason to do it? If our troubles come upon us without any
          particular reason from our own conduct — yet bad reflections upon God
          would be very unjust. Job's troubles were extremely grievous, and they
          came upon him without cause in himself, as God testifies in chapter 2.
          Yet he was made humbly to acknowledge his great folly in reflecting
          upon God for his distresses, before his captivity was turned back.

          "Wealth brings many friends, but a poor man's friend deserts him."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          God commands us to love our neighbors as ourselves, whether rich or
          poor, and to show a peculiar tenderness to the poor on account of
          their destitute circumstances. But such is the depraved disposition of
          men, that the rich have many friends — but the poor man is not known
          by him who lives at the next door. The rich have many temptations to
          high-mindedness, and this is one of them — that they meet with a great
          deal of respect, and every person professes friendship to them, and
          they naturally think that they are possessed of many good qualities,
          which draw to them the esteem of mankind. But they ought to consider
          that money is the answer for all things, and is one of the chief
          attractives of esteem in the world. Let them throw away their money,
          and those who once made their court to them will leave them, as
          quickly as the eagles leave a field of battle when the carcasses are
          all devoured.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Job</p></i>was the most respected man in the
        east, when he was the richest — but when he was spoiled of his wealth,
        he who had been venerated by the people, became their byword.
        <i> <p align="justify">Jerusalem</p></i>, in her prosperity, was the
        princess among the provinces — but in the day of her calamity, all her
        friends dealt treacherously with her, and became her enemies.
        <p align="justify">
          A very <i>ordinary </i>virtue in an ordinary man, is a
          <i> shining </i>virtue in a man of fortune. But if he should become
          poor, all the luster of his virtues is entirely gone! When the poor
          man is separated from his neighbor, let him remember and imitate the
          apostle of the Gentiles, who was often reduced to poverty and hunger.
          Paul laid very little stress on good report or had report, for he knew
          that none of these things, nor anything else, could separate him from
          the love of Christ!<br />

        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 19:5.</p></font>
          "A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who pours out lies
          will not go free."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          A false witness does one of the greatest injuries to his neighbor, and
          one of the greatest possible dishonors to God. He breaks at once the
          two great commandments, of loving God, and loving his brother — and
          therefore deserves more severe punishment. But if he escapes
          punishment from the magistrate, he shall be punished by God with the
          loss of credit, and other miseries, in this life — or at the least,
          with an eternal punishment hereafter. For those who bear false witness
          against their neighbors are an abomination to the Lord, and how is it
          possible for them to escape?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Liars are here classed with those who bear false witness, for they are
          so much alike, that the ninth commandment, which directly forbids the
          bearing of false witness, does also, by good interpretation, forbid
          whatever is harmful to truth. Those who can allow themselves to tell
          lies in common conversation, will, in all probability, bear false
          witness, and confirm it by an appeal to Heaven, when they have a
          sufficient temptation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some liars may expect to be safe, because their lies are not of a
          mischievous kind — but when they do evil that good may come, they
          expose themselves to just condemnation. "All liars," says our great
          judge, "shall have their part in the infernal lake!"

          who gives gifts."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          It is, no doubt, a right thing to honor princes, and to seek their
          favor when we need it — if God is not neglected, from whom every man's
          judgment comes. The Lord is the king of kings, and it is a plain
          evidence that we forget God, when we are less anxious about his favor,
          than men are about the favor of our <i>fellow worms</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Princes need not pride themselves in the homage that is paid to them,
          for their favor is sought by men, not so much out of regard to their
          <i>persons</i>, as from a regard to their <i>power</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Kindness and liberality have a greater influence for gaining the
          hearts of men, than dignity of station. There are many who seek the
          ruler's favor — but every man loves him who is generous. When
          <i>power </i>and <i>generosity </i>meet in the same person — he
          becomes an object of universal esteem, like Marcus Antoninus, who was
          lamented by every man when he was dead, as if the glory of the Roman
          empire had died with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How inexcusable are we, if we do not love God with all our hearts. His
          gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are the
          fruits of his bounty, conveyed by the ministry of those whose hearts
          are disposed by his providence to kindness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "I have seen your face," said Jacob to Esau, "as the face of God." His
          brother's favor he knew to be a fruit of the mercy of him with whom he
          spoke and prevailed at Bethel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In our love to the rich and liberal, we exceed the bounds of duty, if
          we reserve not a proper share of out regard for the poor, who cannot
          give us anything — but have a title to receive from us. But the
          greatest part of men are of a different mind from Christ Jesus, and
          think it more blessed to receive than to give.
        </p>

        <b

          "A poor man is hated by all his relatives — how much more do his
          friends avoid him! Though he pursues them with pleading, they are
          nowhere to be found."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          The brethren of the poor shun him — this is very hard. He might have
          expected that though all men had forsaken him — yet his brethren would
          have shown him compassion in the time of distress. A brother is born
          for adversity, and he ought chiefly at such a season to show that he
          is a brother — and if he does not, he greatly aggravates the distress
          of such a near friend by his unkindness, and gives a fair pretense to
          those who are not connected with the poor by such endearing ties, to
          forsake them altogether. We make ourselves guilty of other men's sins,
          when we tempt them to sin by our example, especially when our
          obligations to the opposite duty are much stronger.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This sin is very general, and almost universal among men — although
          nature, as well as Scripture, testifies against it. The best of men
          have often complained in the time of their afflictions, that they were
          forsaken and abhorred by those whom they most loved, and those from
          whom they had reason to expect the greatest kindness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But how do they reveal their hatred? By behaving like strangers, and
          turning a deaf ear to their entreaties for help. This is a sufficient
          evidence of hatred in the wise man's view, and therefore we may justly
          conclude, that there is more of this abominable sin in the world than
          those who are chargeable with it will be willing to acknowledge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The lack of love is hatred, though in a lesser degree than malice or
          spite — and therefore the apostle John distinguishes the righteous
          from the wicked, by this mark of loving or hating their brethren. By
          extending this observation into its native consequences, we might
          convict all wicked men of enmity against God himself, for they do not
          love him — but despise his laws, and have a reigning aversion to every
          means of fellowship with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When poor men are real Christians, it is a double iniquity to despise
          them for their poverty, for they have a double claim to our regard,
          and their Redeemer is a severe avenger of their wrongs. To disregard
          the importunity of the poor when we are able to help them, is a sign
          of a very hard heart, and provokes God to disregard the prayers of
          such unmerciful creatures in the day of their own distress, and to
          punish them without mercy!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When the poor are overlooked, let them remember this text to their
          comfort. When God testifies against this conduct of their friends, it
          is a clear evidence that his ways are not as men's ways, nor his
          thoughts as their thoughts. When Job's friends scorned him, his eyes
          poured out tears unto God. Christ was left in his distress by all his
          disciples — but he was not alone, for the Father was with him. It is
          an encouragement to our faith, that he had, in the days of his flesh,
          so large experience of the sorrows of poverty, for in that he himself
          has suffered, being tempted — he is able also to support those who are
          tempted.

          Spiritual wisdom is not natural to men, and the best scholars, and
          greatest philosophers, live and die fools, unless they get into their
          possession that wisdom which comes from above, and is taught in the
          holy Scriptures. The way of getting this wisdom is to be sensible of
          our need of it, to trust in him to whom all the treasures of wisdom
          and knowledge belong for the communication of it, and to be diligent
          in the use of the means which he has appointed, and will bless, for
          conveying it to us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must not only <i>get</i> — but <i>keep </i>this precious treasure,
          retaining it in our hearts, showing it forth in all our behavior, and
          refusing to part with it on any account. Many think that those men who
          are so careful to seek and retain wisdom, are great losers — buying it
          at too high a price, and refusing to part with it at the risk of
          everything that is valuable in the eyes of men. But the Spirit of God
          assures us in this place, that they are great gainers, and never can
          be losers. They may despise their wealth and ease, their friends and
          life, for the sake of wisdom — but when they do so, they are lovers of
          their souls, for the wealth of the whole world is not to be put in
          competition with an immortal soul. They may meet with loss and
          disgrace, with persecution and death — but still they will prosper,
          for they not only find those eternal advantages which infinitely
          outweigh every temporal loss — but even these losses themselves are
          good to those who find wisdom, which, like the pretended philosopher's
          stone, turns everything into gold.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That is truly good to us, which does us good — and that does us good
          which makes us good, or brings us nearer to the possession of the
          chief good. The keeper of wisdom does not always find that which
          appears good to a carnal eye — but he always finds that which appears
          good in the eyes of God, and consequently in his own eyes. Paul found
          much good in the things that appear to be the most frightful objects
          in nature, to the greatest part of men.

          have rule over princes."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Wisdom turns everything to a man's advantage and honor — but folly
          turns gain into loss, and makes a man ridiculous and contemptible,
          when he is surrounded with everything that might make him happy, and
          procure him respect.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Happiness is a thing that all men wish to enjoy — but when a fool is
          furnished with every mean of pleasure, his folly is heightened into
          madness, and he is found to be seven times more a fool than he
          appeared to be when he was in other circumstances.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A whip is proper for an donkey, and a rod for the fool's back — but
          delight and the means of procuring it are the same thing to a fool, as
          a golden bridle to that lazy animal.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is still more unfitting for servants to have rule over princes, for
          although servants have as good blood in their veins as princes, and
          are born with the same rational powers — yet their education and
          habits of life make them quite unfit for the arts of government. And
          <i>pride</i>, that <i>universal vice</i>, has never a greater
          opportunity of gaining full dominion in a man, than when he is
          unexpectedly raised from the lowest to the highest stations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But this proverb, like many others, is <i>true only in general</i>,
          and not in every particular instance. For Joseph was very justly
          raised, from slavery and imprisonment, to reign over princes. Solomon
          himself assures us, that a wise and poor youth, is worthy of much more
          respect than an old and foolish king.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Besides the instruction contained in this sentence, to those who have
          the disposal of high offices in their hands — it teaches us all to
          value wisdom above pleasure, and all the means of pleasure. Wisdom can
          make a man happy without pleasures, and wisdom alone can make
          pleasures the means of happiness to us, and enable us to use them
          without abusing them into means of our own dishonor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wisdom also teaches us also to be pleased with our own condition. How
          ridiculous would an illiterate rustic appear, were he to be placed in
          a pulpit — or a man of low birth if he were seated on a throne! It is
          God's office to choose our stations, and ours to discharge the duties
          of them with cheerfulness. When God raised Joseph, and Saul, and
          David, to power, and when he called fishermen to be apostles — this
          proverb could not be applied to them, because God gave them a spirit
          suited to their offices. In like manner, when he raises the lowest of
          men to spiritual honors, he bestows upon them a suitable disposition
          of mind and soul. Those who are made kings and priests unto God, have
          the spirit of sons, working in them those heavenly tempers which befit
          those who are exalted so highly by the grace of God.

          Have you been offended by any person? Now is the time for knowing
          whether you are a wise man, or a fool. If you are a <i>fool</i>, you
          will follow that maxim of fools, that a man behaves honorably when he
          will not allow any man to give him the least shadow of affront,
          without forcing him to repent of it, if possible; or at least showing
          that it is rather the lack of power than will, which hinders him from
          taking revenge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If you are <i>wise</i>, then you will not allow anger to domineer in
          your heart — but when you find it raising insurrections, you will
          force it to yield to the dominion of reason and piety. Before you
          display anger in your words and behavior, you will consider calmly
          whether you have reason to be angry, or so much reason as passion
          would make you believe. And if you have reason — yet another question
          still remains: Do you well to be angry? Do you well to be angry to
          such a degree?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A wise man will not only defer his anger — but pass over offences.

        <i> <p align="justify">Joab</p></i>could suppress his anger at Abner for
        killing Asahel — but he was not a wise man, for his resentment broke
        forth at a fit opportunity, and instigated him to shed the blood of war
        in the time of peace. <i> <p align="justify">David</p></i>was a man of a
        very different spirit. He not only restrained Abishai from killing
        Shimei, when he was fleeing from Jerusalem — but he pardoned that
        offender when he was returning in triumph to his palace. It was not
        revenge — but the love of peace, and a desire of the public welfare,
        which made David charge Solomon, on his death-bed, to keep his eye on
        that dangerous traitor.
        <p align="justify">
          It is our duty and wisdom to pass by, not only
          <i>slight offences</i> — but injuries of a deeper dye, such as may be
          called <i> transgressions</i>. For we need sometimes the forgiveness
          of such from men, and every day we are obliged to supplicate the
          forgiveness of transgressions from God. We are bound to forgive men,
          even as God, for Christ's sake — has forgiven us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the wisdom of a man to be <i>slow to anger </i>and
          <i>ready to forgive</i>. For as it is not the water that surrounds a
          ship — but the water which soaks into it, that sinks it — so it is not
          the injury done by another man who endangers us, so much as the
          impression it makes upon ourselves. Our fretful and revengeful
          thoughts are the torment of our hearts, and deprive us of the
          government of our own souls! It is a piece of folly, when our neighbor
          does us an injury, to do a much greater to ourselves, when we mean to
          be revenged on him. It is a greater glory for a man to govern himself,
          than to take strong cities, and rule over mighty nations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the wisdom and honor of sinning creatures, to behave to
          offenders as men who need pardon for themselves. It is the glory of
          Christians to learn meekness and lowliness from Christ. It is the
          glory of pardoned sinners, to show forth the virtues of him who called
          them — to whom they owe so much, not only in their praises but in all
          their holy conduct.

          We must be loyal to the king because of his power, if we will not are

          represents the great danger of disobedience, to affright those who
          will not be governed by a sense of duty. As the <i>lion </i>among the
          beasts of the forest — so is a king among men; and as the roaring of
          the lion is terrible to the beasts — so is the displeasure of the king

          the dew upon the grass.

          <i>conscience </i>interferes with the king's commands, we must obey
          God rather than man, for what is the roaring of a lion, or the rage of
          a tyrant — compared to the torments of a mind enraged with a sense of
          guilt. Or what is the dew on the grass, or the smiles of a monarch —
          compared to that peace of God which surpasses all understanding, and
          made the martyrs happier in their dungeons, and at stakes, than their
          tyrants were upon their thrones.

          When children behave badly, they are a great cross to their parents.
          But a peevish and contentious wife is a much greater cross, for
          children may be turned out of doors when they cannot be reclaimed —
          but death only, in ordinary cases, can separate those who are joined
          in marriage.

          As the rain that drops through an old house rots the timber, and will,

          complaints of a peevish woman prey upon the vitals of a man, and
          consume his heart with unceasing anguish. Women were made to
          <i>assist </i>and <i>comfort </i>their husbands, and therefore they
          ought to behave with a meek and quiet spirit, for it will never be of
          advantage to a woman to cross the end of her creation. Those who make
          such a near friend unhappy, must bring a double share of unhappiness
          on themselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But husbands must not impute peevishness to their wives, without good
          ground. We are all the sons of Adam, and all women are the daughters
          of Eve, and it would be very unjust to call a woman contentious, for
          every instance of contention to which vexations may provoke her. If a
          man has a froward wife, let him consider his own behavior. Few women
          have so little of the heart of a woman, or a human creature, as to
          make those men unhappy who treat them with discretion and tenderness.
          Or if women really deserve this character, gentle admonitions, and
          kind usage are the best means of reclaiming them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If a wife has so much of the <i>spirit of a tiger</i>, as still to vex
          a good husband, his duty is to acknowledge God in this providence, and
          to consider it as a <i>just correction</i>, or a
          <i> necessary trial</i>. This will dispose him to perform his duty to
          a wife who does not perform her duty to him, and to become better
          himself by her means — if he cannot make her better by all his
          endeavors and prayers.

          for appointing them a happier lot. It is not <i>chance</i>, nor our

        <p align="justify">
          Houses and lands are given us by God — but he gives them to us by
          means of our parents, whose industry acquired them. The providence of
          God shines more remarkably in bestowing <i>good wives </i>on men, for
          they cannot come by inheritance — and no man can guess beforehand what
          wife shall fall to any man's lot.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Prudence in a wife, includes not only skill in the management of
          domestic affairs — but likewise that good sense that makes her an
          agreeable partner, and directs her to that kind of behavior which
          makes her husband happy in this connection. To these qualities, if
          <i>piety </i>is added, it renders her a far greater blessing than any
          possessions that parents can transmit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are to thank God for every outward enjoyment — but chiefly for
          those in which his favorable providence appears most plainly. Houses
          and lands may tend, in a great degree, to render life comfortable —
          but a <i>virtuous woman </i>is an uncommon blessing, for her price is
          far above rubies! He who finds a wife has reason to thank God. He who
          finds a good wife has many reasons to be thankful. It was God who gave
          her prudence. It was God who brought him into acquaintance with her.
          It was God who disposed him to choose her for a wife, and determined
          her mind to comply with his desires. When we receive a rich present
          from a friend, gratitude obliges us to use it according to his wishes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If a wife is a rich present from God — then her husband is bound to
          show her all that respect and kindness which God requires.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Whatever treatment a wife deserves, God commands her husband to love
          her — but when a wife is prudent, the husband would be inexcusable who
          did not love her with the tenderest affection.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If a man desires to have a wife, he must acknowledge God by earnest
          supplications. For he alone knows the hearts of men and women, and
          exercises a sovereign influence over their affections. But let him not
          presume to affront God by pretending to seek a wife from him, without
          seeking prudence in her — preferably to houses or land. For God
          declares, that a prudent wife is a far richer gift than those things
          which are so much valued by the generality of men.

          When children wish to enter into marriage, they cannot expect the

          heavenly Father should give us his favor, in pursuits opposite to his
          declared will?

        he is at work, he is idle. Slothfulness is to the body like rust to iron
        — it is a consumption to all the powers of the mind, and by its stealing

          it, not only as the apple of our eye — but as our life and soul. He
          who keeps the commandment keeps his own soul from those sins that
          would bring death and ruin upon him, and from the temptations of the
          adversary who watches our halting, and seizes every opportunity he can
          find to do us harm.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But how can a man keep his own soul? Is not the Lord our keeper?
          Certainly — but in converting and keeping men, he deals with them as
          rational creatures.

          Although the glory of salvation belongs entirely to Jesus — yet he
          condescends to give to faithful ministers the honor of being workers
          under him. And although the glory of the strength of Christians stands
          in him — yet when he communicates the influences of his grace, he
          makes themselves instrumental, under his agency, in their own
          preservation from the snares of the destroyer. He who is born of God
          keeps himself, and the wicked one touches him not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Care and thought are absolutely necessary in those who resolve to keep
          the commandment. The saint must not only endeavor to understand and
          remember the rule of the law — but likewise to observe his own way,
          that he may direct his steps, and form his course of behavior in an
          agreeableness to it. The travelers who have their faces towards the
          better country, must have their eyes in their head, for there is no
          going to Heaven by chance, and those who live at random must die. This
          truth is clearly taught by the apostle Paul in language sufficient to
          alarm the stoutest sinner, if anything could alarm him. "If you live
          after the flesh, you shall surely die!"

          How great is the mercy of the Lord to the poor! He has appointed them
          to be the receivers of a part of his revenue, and what is given to
          them, he accounts to be lent to himself. This mercy is not confined to
          the poor of his own people; although he interests those especially in
          our bounty — yet he would not have us to restrict the fruits of our
          compassion to believers alone. Our Lord dispensed his cures to the
          ungrateful, although he knew what was in man. God causes his sun to
          rise, and his rain to descend, upon the evil and the good. He requires
          us to give a portion to seven, and also to eight, dispersing the
          fruits of our liberality, as the gardener scatters his grain, although
          he does not certainly know whether it shall prosper.

          "He who gives to the poor, lends to the Lord." This is an argument of
          wonderful force for charity. No Pagan moralist could ever produce a
          motive for any social duty, equal to this. It is sufficient to open
          the closest fist, and to enlarge the most selfish heart. Does God show
          so much regard to the poor — and shall we be indifferent to their
          happiness? Can we lose anything by lending it to the Lord? Men refuse
          to give when they do not expect to receive — and they expect no return
          from the poor. If the rich were desirous to borrow from us, we would
          think our money safe in their hands, and esteem their bonds as good as
          money in our purses. But all the earth belongs unto the Lord, and
          shall we not trust our money in his hands, by giving to the poor? Here
          is his bond, and it must be a good one, if the Scripture is the Word
          of God.

          The richest man in the world may, for anything we know, be poor

          Had we lived in the days of Christ's humiliation, when he lived on the
          contributions of pious women, it is natural for us to think that we
          would have cheerfully given to him all our living, and thought
          ourselves greatly indebted to him for accepting it. We no longer have
          <i> Jesus </i>with us — but the <i>poor </i>we always have with us;
          and when we have them to receive the fruits of our bounty — it is the
          same thing as if we had Christ himself. God will be sure to repay what
          is given to the poor at his command, with great increase.

          The greatest usurer on earth cannot make so much of his money, as the
          man who gives to the poor. "You shall be recompensed," says Christ,
          "at the resurrection of the just!" Is that a long time to wait for it?
          Then you are assured, by the same faithful witness, that you shall
          have an hundred-fold, even in this life, for everything you part with

          Men who may be safely trusted with our money, are not always ready

          time; and if he does not return it in money, he pays it in what is
          incomparably better.

          deliver him once from discipline, you must deliver him again and

          A friend who can give us good counsel is a precious treasure, and
          nothing but folly and self-conceit can keep us from valuing his good
          advice as more than fine gold. If the counsels of our friends deserve
          respect — then the counsels of the Word of God are infinitely more
          useful. The testimonies of the Lord were David's counselors in all his
          difficulties, and they made him wiser than the ancients.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Every <i>name </i>of our Redeemer is dear to the true Christian, and
          one of them is <i>Wonderful Counselor</i>. He gives us counsel by his
          word and Spirit. Our ears and souls are his, and shall we not employ
          them in hearing and treasuring up his counsels, that we may direct all
          our actions by their light?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Instruction is very much needed by us, for we are naturally ignorant
          and foolish. When God gives us instruction, either by his word and
          ordinances, or by the rebukes of his providence — we must receive it
          with submission and meekness. Instruction, either by words or blows,
          would be welcome to us, if we had a due sense of our own stupidity,
          and of the value of our souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But what will we gain by hearing counsel, and receiving instruction?
          It will make us wise; "for the entrance of God's Word gives light, it
          gives understanding unto the simple." The rod and reproof give wisdom,
          and wisdom is far more precious than gold and rubies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Without counsel and instruction, we must be fools forever. If we
          refuse wisdom, when it is presented to us in those means of God's
          appointment — then our folly is desperate and stubborn, and admits of
          no excuse. But we have used these means, you will say, and have
          acquired but very little wisdom from them. But a little wisdom is a
          very great attainment, and if you think that you have got none at all
          — yet you must still continue to use the means, and so you shall be
          wise at your latter end.

          A man will spend several years in learning a business which will
          enable him to live comfortably through the remainder of life. Just so,
          we have no reason to grudge a whole lifetime employed in receiving
          instruction, if it makes us wise at our latter end. At our latter end
          it will be seen whether we have been fools or wise men. If our days
          are spent in the pursuit of perishing things, to the neglect of our
          eternal interests — then we shall be forced to leave these vanities to
          which we sacrificed our souls, and at our end we shall be fools. When
          the men who choose the world for their portion come to the close of
          life, and their former conduct presents itself to their eyes — how
          will they curse and tear themselves in their rage, at their own
          blindness and madness! Even while they are eager in the pursuit of
          vanity, and flattering themselves with the delusive hopes of many days
          of pleasure before them — they cannot forbear from wishing, like the
          covetous soothsayer, that they may die the death of the righteous, and
          that their last end may be like his.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But mark the follower of wisdom, and behold him who hearkens to the
          counsels of the Almighty. His latter end is peace and happiness. Those
          who hated his holiness, and despised his condition — are now obliged
          to acknowledge that his life was spent in wisdom, and that his last
          hour is blessed.

          Do you think that you have already gained enough of wisdom? You are
          quite mistaken. He is yet a child, and speaks as a child, who thinks
          himself a scholar if he can repeat the letters of the alphabet. A

          Men's hearts are perpetually filled with plans, and they seldom

          But the counsel of the Lord revealed in his word, shall stand good
          after all the plans they can form. It is the way of happiness to hear
          his counsel and receive his instruction. For the world passes away,

          But the counsel of God is generally used in Scripture to signify the

          counsel comprehends everything that <i>has </i>come or
          <i>shall </i> come to pass in the world, either by the immediate
          agency of God, or by means of any creature. For the worst of men, and
          devils themselves, are employed by the providence of God in executing
          his decrees. Men and devils act in an agreeableness to their own wills
          as far as their power reaches — but they are still under the absolute
          dominion of the Lord; and whether they are able or not able to execute
          their own devices, they are executing his decrees.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How inscrutable is the wisdom of divine Providence! Millions of
          creatures know nothing of the true God, millions of them are his
          constant enemies, and are incessantly employed in devising and
          executing those purposes which have for their objects, the
          gratification of selfish and corrupt affections; and are filled with
          enmity against God — and yet they all concur in fulfilling his secret
          will. His counsels leave them to their own will — and their will,
          however corrupt, is managed by his holy providence to serve his own
          glorious designs — and where it would lead men beyond the line of his
          decrees, he powerfully and invisibly controls it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is vain for men to form any purpose, and to think of carrying it
          into execution, without acknowledging the providence of God. The
          Apostle James warns us in strong language against this piece of
          <i>practical atheism</i>. When we meet with hardships from the cruelty
          of men, let us consider this truth, and behave meekly and humbly. They
          can do nothing without the observation and permission of God. Christ
          submitted quietly to those sufferings which he underwent from the
          hands of barbarous men, because it was necessary that the Scriptures
          should be fulfilled, and the determinations of God's hand and counsel
          performed. What <i>David </i>did, pleased all the people — and shall
          not we be pleased with what the King of Heaven does?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let the people of God rejoice. The counsels of God concerning them are
          glorious in wisdom and grace, and though hand joins in hand, they
          shall not be unaccomplished. The counsels of their enemies are
          dangerous — but no weapon formed against Zion shall prosper. All the
          counsels of the wicked shall be executed or frustrated according to
          the good pleasure of God, whose eyes run to and fro through the whole
          earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of those whose heart is
          perfect towards him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let sinners tremble, for their counsels and works are in the hand of
          God. He may allow them to prosper for a time in evil, and to bring
          some of their wicked devices to pass — but their evils shall rebound
          upon themselves, and their nets shall entangle their own feet. God may
          use them for a time to accomplish his gracious though solemn designs
          upon his people — but he will in a short time call them to account,
          and punish them for all the evils they have <i>done</i>, and for the
          greater evils they have <i>imagined</i>.

          On the other side, a man may give only two mites, or nothing at all —

          As God alone knows the heart, the day of judgment will be the grand
          revealer of the real characters of men. In the meantime, we must not
          love those only who bestow much kindness on us, nor confine our esteem
          to those who signalize themselves by their extensive liberalities. For
          the virtues, as well as the vices of men, are often concealed under
          rags, and pinched by poverty, so that they cannot display their
          blossoms, or produce their proper fruits. The poor man who cannot
          give, and is obliged to receive, is a much better man than the liar
          who professes kindness — and yet does nothing to verify his
          professions by works. Good <i>words </i>are good things in their
          proper place, and do well befit the mouth of the Christian — but good
          <i>words </i>instead of good <i>deeds </i>are mere hypocrisy; of so
          gross a kind, that even men often discern it, and despise the pitiful
          wretch who endeavors to shelter the baseness and selfishness of his
          spirit, under empty professions.

          Do you say to your poor brother, be warmed and clothed, while you give
          him nothing to shelter him from the pinching cold, or to fill his
          craving appetite, although you are well able to do it? You only join
          hypocrisy and lies to the lack of charity — and a poor man who lives
          upon the bounty of the parish is a more respectable man than you.

          Let us learn to value men by their <i>hearts</i>, as far as they lie
          open to the judgment of candor and charity — rather than their
          <i>professions </i>and <i>appearances</i>, which are so frequently
          delusive.

        <p align="justify">
          Thus shall we be enabled to choose our friends, and to put a proper

          injustice so frequently condemned by the wise man, of despising the
          poor, and paying an undue respect to the rich.

          This proverb also teaches us to examine our own hearts, that we may
          know how far we are under the influence of a kind and charitable
          spirit. God will not accept of all the substance of our houses —
          instead of the charity of the heart. At the same time, desires are not
          real, nor are they genuine marks of godliness — if they are not
          followed by suitable performances, when the providence of God puts it
          in our power.

          Religion is the soul of happiness. It makes the present life long and
          happy, as far as a long and happy life is really for our advantage —
          and it is the beginning of eternal life in the soul. He who is
          governed by the fear of the Lord enjoys heart-felt satisfaction; and
          the joys that spring from it are not like the short-lived joys of the
          world, which die away into sadness and misery; they last through life,
          they are vigorous in old age, when the pleasures of sense have lost

          Christians are indeed exposed to heaviness through manifold
          temptations — but the fear of the Lord, and faith in Christ, has often
          produced joy unspeakable and full of glory in such seasons. The
          disquiets which the people of God often feel, are owing for the most
          part, to the imperfections of their religious dispositions, and are
          blessed by God as means of improving their grace, and introducing
          sweeter joys into their souls.

          Christians have unfailing grounds of satisfaction, for they have
          health in their souls, they know that all their affairs are managed by
          a wise and gracious Providence, and they have the sure promises of the
          life to come. If God himself can give satisfaction to the souls which
          he has made — then they have it, or shall have it in due time — for he
          manages all things for their good, and his eternal excellencies are
          their portion.

          <i> unstinged </i>to him through the Redeemer's cross, which, like the
          tree that Moses cast into the waters of Marah, makes bitter things
          sweet. He is not visited with any unnecessary evil, and those evils
          that visit him are made good on the whole by the tendency which they
          have to do him good, and make him good. Reproaches and tribulations,
          sicknesses and deaths, are the common lot of men, and they are very
          evil things to those who are strangers to God — but they are good to
          those who love God, for they are appointed and useful means to make
          them partakers of God's holiness, and prepare them for that blessed
          world where sins and sorrows are no more.

          Solomon was a mortal enemy to sloth, as every wise man will be. He has
          often told us of the mischievous effects of this vice, and here he
          holds up the sluggard as an object of contempt and laughter, to make
          him ashamed, if possible, of his laziness, and to awaken us to
          diligence in the duties of our calling and religion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a mark of a sluggard to make a great business of a little
          affair, and to make much ado about nothing at all. It is a business to
          the sluggard to take his hand out of his bosom, and it is a grievous
          affair for him to put it to his mouth to feed himself. Were it not for
          shame, he would desire to be fed like an infant, and he will at length
          be tempted to grudge that men cannot live like trees, on which their
          proper nourishment falls down from the clouds.

          A man who employs his hands with diligence, is able not only to
          support himself and his family — but to give something likewise to him
          who is in need. He finds less trouble in his work, and enjoys more
          contentment than a sluggard would do, if you should bring everything
          to him that is needful for his support, without any labor of his own
          hands — because the things that no man can do for him are oppressions
          to his sluggish soul. It is a greater burden to a sleepy man to strip
          himself and go to bed, than for another man to perform some laborious
          service.

          burden to pray, and to read God's Word, although by these duties we
          only ask, and receive, and eat our spiritual food. The lively
          Christian admires the grace of God, which has made these holy

          Solomon has already told us that it is needless to reprove a scorner,
          because his pride will make reproofs useless to him. What, then, is to
          be done with him? Shall he be allowed to proceed in his wicked
          courses, and to corrupt others by his example? No, he ought to be
          smitten — at least when he lays himself open to the vengeance of the
          laws. And although there is little hope of reclaiming one who is so
          much hardened in wickedness — yet his punishment will be useful to
          other men, who will hear, find fear, and no more do wickedly. The
          simple and thoughtless will be made to see how dangerous it is to
          follow the example of one who has suffered imprisonment, or whipping,
          or death, for his vices — and those who would not be restrained from
          evil by the fear of God, and the thoughts of an eternal world, will be
          checked by the fear of men, and the terror of present punishment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a necessary thing in a land to punish criminal offences. For
          without the execution of justice on the wicked, iniquity would
          overflow all its banks, and men would not live with safety among their
          fellow-creatures. We have, therefore, reason to bless God for the
          institution of magistracy, and should concur in our stations to assist
          in the execution of the just laws against vice.

          But a wise man needs not be smitten for his faults, which are
          generally of a much less atrocious nature than those of the scorner.
          He is not, however, to be connived at, or left to his own wisdom, to
          inform him of his miscarriages. Men are commonly too dim-sighted to
          discern their own miscarriages in a proper light — and
          <i>reproofs </i>are means appointed and blessed by God for bringing
          wise men themselves to the exercise of a lively sorrow and repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Are you afraid to reprove a wise man, lest he should take it amiss?
          You need not fear this, if he is really a wise man. He will love you
          for reproving him, and will understand knowledge. A fool is displeased
          when he is supposed capable of falling into a fault — but a wise man
          is meek and lowly, sensible of his imperfection and frailty, and when
          he goes out of the road of duty, is glad and thankful to be set right.

          This proverb teaches us, how vain it is for men, through the pride of
          character, to cavil at admonitions, and endeavor to
          <i>justify themselves </i>in opposition to plain fact. Instead of
          serving our character by this behavior, we greatly hurt it. When we
          receive reproof with gratitude, we show ourselves wise men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When we are displeased with reproof, we show that we are fools, or at
          least that our wisdom is mingled with much folly. To affect the
          character of perfect men, is a plain evidence that we know not
          ourselves, and do not remember the present state of human nature.

          exhortation in this verse speaks to us as children, warning us to
          beware of their artifices and insinuations. Error may be rendered very
          plausible, for the Devil himself came to men with Scripture in his
          mouth; and no wonder if his ministers can presume to plead both

          <i>Error is error </i>after all that can be said for it — and all the
          shapes which it can be made to assume. It is, no doubt, our duty to
          prove all things, and to take nothing upon the mere testimony of men
          which concerns our precious souls. Yet it is the property of a sincere
          soul, like Nathaniel's, to be open to conviction, where there is
          danger of a mistake. But this does not imply that we are to be ever
          learning, without coming to the knowledge and assurance of the truth.
          The truth may be known, because it is plainly revealed in the Bible.
          And when we have found that which is good, we ought to hold it fast,
          that no man take our crown. We are to contend earnestly for it against
          all opposition, and to shut our ears against those instructions that
          would shake our regard to those things which are most surely believed

          It is dangerous for men to lend a ready ear to those who would exalt
          the dignity of human nature, to the dishonor of the righteousness and
          grace of Christ; or loosen the obligations of men to obey every law of
          God, because the corruption of our natures gives countenance to
          everything that favors pride or carelessness. When we think we are
          well fortified against the delusions of seducing spirits and false
          teachers, and rashly venture to hear what they can say for themselves
          — then we are in great danger of being perverted, and filling from our
          imagined steadfastness. The apostle John tells us, that it is a great
          and dangerous sin, when a man comes to teach false doctrine, to
          receive him into our houses, or to give him any kind of encouragement.

          given too much ear to the teachers of corrupt doctrine. The
          exhortation is chiefly addressed to you, by him who knows your danger.
          Cease to hear such instruction. The time past is sufficient to have
          listened to it. Examine carefully how far your judgment or practice
          have been perverted, by comparing them with the Scriptures. Adjust
          your profession and practice to that <i>unerring standard</i>.
          Endeavor to know the present truth, and to be established in it. Learn
          by the Word of God, and prayer, to distinguish between truth and
          error. Hear those teachers that are of God, and preach sound doctrine.
          Beware of itching ears, which would tempt you to drink poison into
          your ears and hearts, instead of the sincere milk of the word.

          iniquity down like water.

        <p align="justify">
          Every sin tends to harden the conscience, and a conscience long
          hardened in sin, will in time be seared as with a hot iron. However
          stupid the consciences of ungodly men are, and whatever flatteries
          they use for deceiving themselves — their iniquity will in the end be
          found hateful to God.

        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 19:29.</p></font>
          "Penalties are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of
          fools."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Scorners and mockers, in the pride of their hearts, think themselves
          secure from the vengeance of the law, and are sometimes so profane as
          to laugh at the threatenings of the Almighty. But the day is coming
          when their laughter shall be turned into heaviness. The God whom they
          despise, is the <i>Judge </i>of all the earth — and it is his glory to
          exercise his high office in righteousness. He takes no pleasure in the
          death of the wicked — but if they will not turn and live, they must
          die, and their blood shall be on their own head, and the Lord shall be
          known by the judgment which he executes. The judgments that shall be
          inflicted on scorners, are already prepared, and determined for them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the triumph of lively Christians that they can look to the days
          of eternity, and rejoice in the contemplation of a kingdom prepared
          for them before the foundation of the world. But the wicked have great
          reason to tremble with astonishment, when they reflect upon the
          immutable decrees of God — for an everlasting Hell was designed in
          them for every unrepenting transgressor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As kings have their officers of justice, and instruments of vengeance
          ready to terrify profligate subjects into obedience to the laws — so
          the Everlasting King has every instrument of vengeance reserved among
          his treasures, to terrify men from sin, or to destroy them if they go
          on in their trespasses. Their punishment shall be disgraceful to the
          last degree, for stripes are prepared for the backs of fools. They
          shall suffer ignominious wounds as the basest of criminals, and their
          reproach shall never be wiped away.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Because the wicked feel not the strokes of judgment, they foolishly
          think that they shall forever escape. But did the old world of the
          ungodly escape, although they were spared a hundred and twenty years?
          Christ himself, the beloved Son of God, when he was bearing iniquity
          of his people, was not spared. Justice and judgment took hold of our
          blessed Surety, and he gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to
          those who plucked off the hair. If God spared not his own Son — will
          he then spare stubborn transgressors?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Perhaps you imagine, sinners, that vengeance will be long delayed, and
          that your sufferings are reserved to the eternal world. Perhaps it may
          be so — and for anything you know, it may not be so. But, allowing
          that you should enjoy all the prosperity that your hearts can wish
          until you die — are you sure that you shall live another year, or
          another day? Your life depends absolutely on him whom you treat as an
          enemy; and when his much abused patience is at an end — then where, O
          where are you! "Then the King will turn to those on the left and say:
          Away with you, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the
          devil and his demons!"
