        <p align="justify">
          In this chapter, Solomon gives us an account of the writer, and the
          design, of this book. He recommends the fear of the Lord, a dutiful
          regard to the instructions of parents, and diligence in guarding
          against the temptations of bad company — as principal parts of wisdom.
          It is concluded with an earnest call to the unwise to learn wisdom.
          Let us hear, first, what Solomon has to say, for recommending this
          much neglected book to our attention.

          "The Proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, King of Israel." </b
        >This book consists of proverbs, which are wise, and short sayings of
        great use to direct us in the conduct of life. Proverbs were much valued
        in ancient times. But no proverbs deserve so much esteem and attention
        as these, for they are the proverbs of Solomon, another name almost for
        wisdom. In his days he was honored like an angel of God, for his
        understanding. All kings that heard of him, admired him, and thought
        themselves happy if they could hear some of his wise instructions. The
        Queen of Sheba came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear his
        wisdom; although she had not heard the half of what she found to be true
        concerning him — yet even these imperfect accounts were such as to
        exceed her belief.

        <p align="justify">
          Did she come so far, upon uncertain reports, to hear
          <i> his </i>wisdom? And shall not we receive with gladness his
          instructions, since he has come to us, to be our teacher? We have no
          need to cross dangerous seas, and travel into distant countries, to
          hear the lectures of this divine teacher — he cries to us in our
          streets, he talks with us in our closets. He died some thousands of
          years ago — but he yet speaks.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Though Solomon had been the son of some poor herdsman — his wisdom
          would have entitled him to our respect. But this <i>wisest </i>of men,
          was the son of the <i>best </i>of men. He who was raised on high — the
          anointed of the God of Jacob — the man after God's own heart — was his
          father. This wise son enjoyed all the advantages to be expected from
          the instructions and the example, the prayers and the blessings, of so
          good a father. Solomon was a prophet, and the son of a prophet — he
          was the son of the best of kings; and of the many sons whom God had
          given to David, he was chosen to fill his father's throne.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Great men are not always wise — and except from their own subjects,
          the words of kings are seldom entitled to more regard than those of
          other men. But it was in Israel, where God was well known, that
          Solomon was king — and he was advanced to that dignity, because he was
          the worthiest of it in the kingdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These words are the instructions of that king who excelled all the
          kings of the earth in wisdom and grandeur. This great prince is our
          teacher; but not he alone — the only wise God here condescends to
          become our instructor. He, then, who disregards this book, despises a
          greater than Solomon. This book is the work of a noble writer, and
          truly it was written with a noble design.

        >To give us the knowledge of wisdom, and that instruction by which
        knowledge is conveyed into our minds. For man is born without wisdom,
        and without instruction must continue foolish all his days.
        <p align="justify">
          The words of understanding are the instruction of wisdom, and this
          book will lead the simple and inexperienced to perceive these words.
          But what sort of wisdom is it that Solomon means to teach in this
          book? The best kind of wisdom!

          "To receive the instruction of wisdom; justice, and judgment, and
          equity."</b
        >
        The careful reader of this book will receive the instructions of that
        wisdom which directs men to practice justice, regulated by discretion,
        and tempered by moderation and mercy. It teaches us our duty to God and
        man, and leads us in every good path. Solomon could have given us
        lectures on Astronomy and Poetry, on the nature of birds and beasts, and
        everything that attracts the curiosity of men — but as the wisdom of the
        prudent is to understand his way, he is directed by the Spirit of God to
        give us in this book the <i>instructions of divine and moral wisdom</i>,
        to remain for the use of men until the last posterity.
        <p align="justify">
          They thought themselves happy that were admitted to hear the
          discourses of this great philosopher, while he lived among men. But
          the best of his instructions are left on record for our benefit. The
          best knowledge is the knowledge of God, and of Christ — who is his
          representing image to men; and holiness, which is the image of God in
          men.<i>
            The most necessary truths are first to be learned, and these are
            clearly represented in this little book. </i
          >But who are the people that may receive benefit from it? This you may
          learn from the next verse.

          "To give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
          discretion."</b
        >
        Plato wrote on the door of his Academy, "Let no man unskilled in
        Geometry come hither." Solomon writes the very reverse on the door of
        his school: "Let the simple man who is easily deceived come hither — and
        he shall learn that prudence which is necessary to preserve him from the
        snares of the destroyer, and is yet fully consistent with integrity. Let
        the young and inexperienced come and learn knowledge and discretion."
        <p align="justify">
          Which of us does not need prudence to preserve us from the wiles of
          the great deceiver and his agents? This book not only
          <i> teaches</i> — but <i>gives prudence </i>to the simple. When its
          truth enters into the soul, and takes possession of the heart through
          the grace of the Spirit who dictates the Scriptures, and makes use of
          them as his instrument of illumination — then the simple are made
          wise, and the hearts of the rash understand knowledge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It would be our happiness if we understood our own simplicity, that we
          might thankfully receive the instructions of wisdom, and fervently
          pray for the Spirit of God to open our ears and seal our
          instructions.<i>
            If any man would be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that
            he may be wise.</i

        <p align="justify">
          People to whom books are dedicated, may be expected to give them a
          careful perusal. Solomon dedicates this book to the <i>young</i>, as
          well as to the <i>simple</i>. He knew that young people stand in great
          need of advice and direction, and earnestly desired to do them good;
          and could they be persuaded to accept Solomon as their teacher — he
          will speak to them with the kindness of a father, and communicate to
          them knowledge and discretion. But is this book of no use but to the
          unwise and the untaught? It is of great use to the wise also — and if
          men are truly wise, they will value it above much fine gold, and by
          the diligent use of it, will greatly improve in wisdom.

        >
        The dark sayings of fools and triflers are not worth a thought — but the
        dark sayings of the wise are worthy to be studied until we obtain a
        complete knowledge of their meaning. For they are dark at first hearing
        only, on account of the sublimity of their views, and the force of their
        manner of expression, which contains much useful instruction in small
        compass.

          It is Solomon the son of David, and king of Israel, who speaks. He
          speaks to the simple and inexperienced — and to the wise. He speaks of
          the most important points of truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And a greater than Solomon is here. Christ spoke by his Spirit in the
          prophets, and he still speaks from Heaven to us — he speaks by his
          word and by his Spirit. He opens the understandings of men, that they
          may understand the Scriptures. Christ is the Word and the Wisdom of
          God — and he is made to us wisdom. Let us depend upon him as our
          wisdom, that his Spirit may write in our hearts the things written in
          this book. So shall we be the epistle of Christ, written not with pen
          and ink — but with the Spirit of the living God — and
          <i>our lives will be living commentaries on the proverbs of Solomon</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some of the most necessary parts of wisdom are explained and enforced
          from the 7th to the 17th verse. The first of these is that,
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 1:7.</p></font>
          "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge." </b
        >The fear of the Lord, so often recommended in this book, is not that
        fear which has torment in it, and is excluded by love. Rather, it is
        that fear which is joined with faith, and keeps it from degenerating
        into presumption — while faith keeps fear from sinking into despondency.
        It is a lively impression of the excellency of God upon the soul,
        whereby a man is disposed to walk before him unto all pleasing — and to
        put far away everything provoking and offensive to the eyes of his
        glory. It is therefore justly made to signify the whole of religion in
        the heart and life of man.
        <p align="justify">
          Great commendations are bestowed on "the fear of the Lord" in
          Scripture. It makes a chief part in the noble characters of Abraham
          and Job, and here Solomon tells us that it is the beginning, the
          ground-work, and the comprehensive sum of all true knowledge. He who
          lacks the fear of the Lord, does not know him — and he who knows not
          God, knows nothing as he ought to know it. He knows neither his
          business in life, nor his happiness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A rational creature without the fear and knowledge of God, is like a
          soldier who never saw a sword, or a lawyer who never read a law of the
          land. But he who knows the Lord so as to fear him — knows Christ,
          through whom we see those glorious perfections that are the object of
          our reverence. He knows his duty and happiness — and he is on the
          plain road to the knowledge of everything necessary to make the man of
          God perfect.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let no man say that this kind of knowledge deserves not our study,
          because it is generally despised. It is indeed despised — but by whom?
          The wise man tells us,<b>
            "But fools despise wisdom and instruction." </b
          ><i
            >Who would despise a diamond, because an idiot would not give his
            rattle for it? </i
          >It is no dishonor to the divine wisdom to be despised by any man —
          but it is the utmost dishonor to any man to despise the wisdom of God.
          He is an unreasonable and foolish man who has not the fear of the
          Lord. The next part of doctrine taught by the wise man, respects the
          reverence due to the instructions of parents.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 1:8.</p></font>"My
          son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of
          your mother."</b
        >
        This exhortation speaks to us as unto children. Solomon is entitled to
        the authority, and addresses us with the tenderness of a father. If
        such, then, is the affection with which he addresses us — then surely we
        owe him the reverence of children.

        <p align="justify">
          God is our heavenly Father. All his precepts are the expressions of
          divine goodness, and we are unnatural to our Maker if we forget them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is here supposed that parents will instruct their children. They
          are monsters rather than parents, who do not love the fruit of their
          own bodies. Love will dispose people to do all the good they can to
          the objects of it — and the best thing that can be done for children,
          is to teach them the fear of the Lord. To be careful about providing
          the supports of life, or raising portions for children, without taking
          care of their souls — is like taking care of the clothes, and being
          indifferent about the body that wears them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "O you people," cried an ancient philosopher, "why do you toil in
          raising estates for your children, and neglect to prepare them by
          needful instructions for enjoying them?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Mothers are to instruct their children, as well as fathers. Solomon
          gratefully remembered the instructions he received in his younger
          years from Bathsheba — and the last chapter of this book contains the
          noble instructions which a wise king had learned from his mother.
          Perhaps the reason why the names of the mothers of the kings of Judah
          are recorded along with their characters is, because the lessons and
          example of their mothers had a considerable influence in forming their
          behavior.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Children are required to hear, and reverence, and obey the
          instructions of their fathers. Next to the duties we owe immediately
          to God, the commandments require us to obey our parents in the Lord.
          He who despises his earthly father, is no doubt a despiser of the
          heavenly Father. A proper regard to the wise and godly instructions of
          parents, gives a happy presage of good behavior in after life. Vice
          and ruin, on the other hand, are the ordinary consequences of
          disrespect to these natural guardians of our tender years.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The sages of heathen antiquity, though themselves born of women,
          usually held them in such small respect, that they almost confined to
          the father, precepts that regarded filial duty. The more enlarged
          wisdom of Solomon, however, pleads the cause of the mother in forcible
          words. The instructions of a mother are to be considered by us as a
          law that we are never to forsake. When old, she is still entitled to
          our respect; and we are never to leave those good paths into which her
          affectionate care has directed our steps.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But what <i>advantage </i>is proposed to us by attending to the voice
          of parental admonition?
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 1:9.</p></font
          ><font color="#008000"> </font>"They will be a graceful ornament for
          your head, and a chain to adorn your neck." </b
        >Young people are generally fond of fine clothes, and of ornaments to
        their bodies — but with regard to this, Solomon here sets their notions
        right. Reverence to parents, a dutiful regard to their instructions, and
        the wisdom which is learned from them — is by far the most beautiful
        ornament. It will make the face to shine; it will be a chain to adorn
        the neck; it will be a graceful ornament, more beautiful than a crown of
        gold, to the head.
        <p align="justify">
          With such ornaments was our Lord himself arrayed, while he dwelt among
          us. He was subject to his parents — though himself their Maker and
          Savior. Young people are generally disposed to hearken to advice — but
          because human nature is in a corrupt state, they are generally more
          prone to follow bad advice than good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Having therefore exhorted them to reverence and to obey God and their
          parents, Solomon now proceeds to warn them against hearkening to the
          enticing words of seducers to sin, verse 10-19.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 1:10.</p></font
          ><font color="#008000"> </font>"My son, if sinners entice you, do not
          consent!"</b
        >
        Sinners have generally so much of the venom of the old serpent in them,
        that they do not wish to go unattended to Hell — but desire to make
        others as much the children of the devil as themselves. Sinners, after
        complying with the suggestions of their tempter, generally proceed from
        evil to worse — until they become devils themselves, and aid their
        master in ruining others!
        <p align="justify">
          The young ought to remember that they will meet with evil advisers —
          and if so, how firmly should they resolve, through the grace of God,
          to hold on in the way of virtue, and to refuse the least compliance
          with that advice which causes to err from the words of knowledge!
          Solomon arms us against these deceivers, by making us acquainted with
          their subtle devices.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 1:11.</p></font

          wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without
          cause."</b
        >
        These are not the express words of seducers — but a translation of them
        into the language of truth. They will say, 'Come let us pick the pocket
        of some covetous miser, who has made himself rich by cunning, and
        scraped money together by such cowardly practices, as cannot expose him
        to the vengeance of the law.'
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon does not tell us the express words of the tempter — but puts
          into his mouth such language as expresses the real meaning and
          tendency of his solicitations. When transgressors varnish over their
          crimes, it is our part to pluck off the false covering, and to

        murderer led was more miserable than death, and his name is remembered
        only to be execrated. The sinner designs harm to his neighbor — but all
        things are under the direction of the just Lord, under whose
        administration mischief recoils upon its author, bringing him to the

        must have it. If it cannot be had to fill their desires (which indeed
        are insatiable) by fair means — then it must had by chicanery or
        thievery. When the conscience has been brought to this, it is prepared
        for advancing in wickedness, until at last it offers but small
        resistance — even at the commission of crimes, from the very thought of
        which their author would once have shrunk!

          Can they anticipate comfort in that ill-gotten wealth which has proved
          fatal to its honest possessor? We must therefore flee from
          unrighteousness, and stand at a distance from the way of sin. Everyone

          words." </b
        >How can wisdom cry out? Is not wisdom a quality, and not a person?
        Wisdom cries to men when God speaks to them — for he is the fountain of
        wisdom. The words of men may be wise — but when God speaks, Wisdom
        itself addresses us! He opens his mouth in infinite wisdom, and speaks
        to us by him who is the Word and Wisdom of God. He who despises that
        wisdom which is from above, despises the Father and the Son, and brands
        the emanations of unsearchable wisdom, with the imputation of folly!
        <p align="justify">
          Wisdom desires to be heard, and therefore speaks not in secret. She
          does not whisper in the ears of a few favorites — but in the public

          that will listen. She cries outside — in every place where a crowd is
          likely to be collected, in the streets, in the chief place of
          concourse, in the gates, the place of judgment, and in every part of
          the city.

          No disobedient sinner can make a valid excuse for his conduct. The
          voice of wisdom is heard everywhere. It sounds from the pulpit. From
          every creature it is heard. The word is in our very hearts — and
          conscience echoes the voice to our souls. Let us go where we will, we
          must hear it — unless we willfully shut our ears.

          excuse <i>Eve </i>for hearkening to the voice of the serpent, or
          <i>Adam </i> for hearkening to the voice of his wife — in opposition

          creature to shut his ears against the reproof of a Savior, who
          addresses us in earnest and affectionate language, and calls us to
          turn our feet from the paths of death.

          Let not sinners imagine that it will excuse them to say that they had
          no ability to repent. They were not called to turn by any power of
          their own — but in the strength of divine grace. They were unwilling —
          and therefore unable. Their sins were so dear to them — that they
          disliked the reproofs of Christ, and resisted his Spirit.

          unconquerable aversion to it in our hearts? Let us plead for the
          abundant communications of the enlightening and renewing Spirit. If
          people are made heartily willing to submit to his influence — it is a
          happy presage that he will be granted, or rather a sign that he has
          already begun to work. But there are many so foolishly devoted to sin,
          that they reject the counsel of God, and instead of welcoming the
          Spirit, resist his motions until they provoke him to depart. The doom

          Sinners feel some presage of that vengeance in their own guilty
          conscience. Fears of punishment often make them uneasy. They would
          gladly persuade themselves that these are but the terrors of a
          distempered imagination. Yet the day is coming when they will find
          them to be terrible realities! No passion is so tormenting as fear —
          and no fear can equal the power of God's anger!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The fear of sinners shall come upon them, and their feet shall slide
          in due time. It shall come like a desolating judgment, which with
          resistless violence, lays waste a country. It shall come like a raging
          tempest, and a furious whirlwind, at once sweeping away every comfort
          and every hope! Then shall distress and anguish seize upon the mind of
          the stubborn transgressor, when he feels himself involved in
          remediless sorrow.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This threatening will have its great accomplishment in the everlasting
          world, when the torrents of wrath shall swallow up the impenitent
          sinner, and the whirlwind of fury shall beat upon him with ceaseless
          violence. Wrath and indignation shall press him down in the lake of
          fire! Anguish and despair shall prey upon his soul, without the
          intermission of a moment! No ray of hope shall ever enter the abodes
          of darkness and of horror.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But will the poor victim of suffering find no pity from the benevolent
          Savior? No! says the Spirit of God, 'I will laugh at your calamity,
          and mock when your fear comes!' With relentless eye shall he behold
          that terrible vengeance which now overtakes the wicked!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked — but rather that they
          should turn and live — yet he will take pleasure in the death of those
          who turn not, for in this manner is his <i>justice </i> glorified, and
          the dishonors done to his love are repaid. God took pleasure in
          bruising his own Son — and he shall laugh at the pain of the wicked.
          But may not prayer avail in this deplorable condition? By no means!

        <p align="justify">
          The prayer of faith is ever heard, and those who seek God shall find
          him, when they seek him with all their heart. But the prayers of these
          desperate rebels are like the howlings of a dog. They are cries
          extorted by strong necessity, and intolerable anguish. They are the
          cries of such as sought not the Lord while he was to be found, nor
          called on him while he was near.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sinners miserably delude their own souls by proposing to
          <i>live in the indulgence of their sins</i> — and
          <i>die in the exercise of repentance</i>.
          <i
            >True repentance is never too late — but late repentance is seldom
            true. </i
          >Christ is not every day hanging on the cross — nor are thieves every
          day converted, and sent from the place of punishment to the paradise
          above.<i> Prayers are of no use in the eternal world. </i>The day of
          grace is at an end, and the wretched shall cry in vain to the rocks
          and mountains to fall upon them, and hide them from the wrath of the
          Lord God and of the Lamb.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Behold, now is the accepted time, now the Lord waits to be gracious.
          But the day is coming that is cruel with wrath and fierce anguish! No
          place shall then be found for mercy, though sought with an ocean of
          tears!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But why does he who takes pleasure in the voice of prayer, and listen
          so graciously to the cry of the supplicant — why does he refuse to
          accept the petitions of those who are reduced to such an extremity of
          distress? The reason is,
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 1:29-30.</p></font
          ><font color="#008000"> </font> </b
        >"Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD — since
        they would not accept My advice and spurned My rebuke!" The punishment
        is indeed tremendous — but the sin that cause it is atrocious! It is no
        less than a contempt and hatred of the counsels of the Lord. What is
        this, but an undeniable proof of enmity against God himself? And will
        not God avenge himself of his enemies?
        <p align="justify">
          When men do not chose the fear of the Lord — but prefer the base
          pleasures of sin — they give plain proof of their hatred to God. How
          can they escape the damnation of Hell?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If we think that the punishment is greater than the sin, the reason
          is, that we are under the power of iniquity. Self-love disposes the
          malefactor to prescribe to his judge. Let us impartially consider what
          malignity lies in impenitence, and what a multitude of wickednesses
          are contained in the rejection of God's great salvation — and we must
          acknowledge that the ruin of sinners is entirely owing to themselves!
          God is not to be blamed — but on the contrary, he will be eternally
          glorious as their avenger. His insulted mercy will be glorious in the
          punishment of its despisers. His justice shall shine in dispensing to
          the workers of iniquity the wages of their wicked works! "They
          despised all my reproof!"

        <b

          of their own way, and be filled with their own devices."</b
        >
        They laughed at God's threatenings, as if they had been idle tales — and
        God shall laugh at them! They despised his counsels — and he shall
        despise their prayers. They were always rebellious, and continued
        unchanged under all admonition — and God will prove an immutable
        avenger, and will pay no regard to their cries for help. They took
        pleasure in sin — and God will take pleasure in punishing them on
        account of it.
        <p align="justify">
          If a man plants and dresses a poisonous tree in his garden — it is
          just that he should be obliged to eat of its fruit. If our vine is the
          vine of Sodom, and our clusters the clusters of bitterness — we must
          leave our complaint on ourselves — even if we must drink until we are
          drunken, and fall, and rise no more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sinners never think they have drunk deep enough of the poisoned cup of
          sin — but they shall at length be filled with it. Then shall it
          satiate them — when they find that intolerable misery is its native
          consequence. That cup which now delights the lover of evil — will then
          be found a cup of fury, and the wicked of the earth must drink it down
          to its bitterest dregs!

        >The sins of men, unless pardoned through the blood of Christ, shall be

        eternal happiness. And
        <i
          >he who cherishes iniquity — warms in his bosom the most venomous of
          serpents!
        </i>
        <p align="justify">Lost sinners owe their ruin to . . .</p>
        <p align="justify">their willful hardness of heart,</p>
        <p align="justify">their abuse of divine mercy, and</p>
        <p align="justify">their indifference to God's salvation.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          It may be alleged, that sinners often prosper — but their prosperity
          is a part of their misery, for it will increase their guilt, and
          render their damnation terrible. It nourishes their wicked affections,
          and tends to inspire them with pride and insolence, with sensuality
          and earthliness of mind. It is so strong a temptation, that our Lord
          has declared it almost impossible for a rich man to enter into the
          kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This saying has been justified by fact. In times of persecution, the
          prosperous have been ordinarily the apostates who made shipwreck of
          faith — while the poor loved the world less, and stood out more firmly
          against temptation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If the prosperity of fools leads them to the indulgence of sin, and
          the neglect of holiness — it renders their damnation more certain and
          more dreadful! Their provocations are like those of the Israelites,
          who provoked God, by turning the Egyptian gold and silver, which he
          had given them — into an idol of jealousy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They are like the impious ingratitude of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
          whom God raised to a throne — but who degraded God into the image of a
          four-footed beast!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When the favors of God are turned into means and instruments of
          unrighteousness — Oh! what wrath is then treasured up against the day
          of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the prosperity of the wise has a very opposite tendency. When they
          act like themselves, it excites their gratitude; it stimulates them to
          serve God more effectually and to do good to men more diligently.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wisdom teaches those who hearken to her voice, to make friends of the
          mammon of unrighteousness. So that while riches serve to expose the
          folly of the foolish — they prove a crown to the wise. But though
          disciples of Wisdom should never attain prosperity, they are happy.
          For says Wisdom,
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 1:33.</p></font
          ><font color="#008000"> </font>"But those who hearken unto me shall
          dwell safely, and be quiet from the fear of evil." </b
        >Those who love knowledge, and chose the fear of the Lord, and value the
        instructions of wisdom more than thousands of gold and silver — are the
        men who hearken to Wisdom, verse 29, 30.
        <p align="justify">
          Many of these once loved folly, and took pleasure in scorning — but
          they have received the atonement, and all their unrighteousnesses are
          blotted out. They now share in the privileges of the children of
          wisdom — and while prosperous sinners are set in slippery places, they
          dwell safely, for they dwell in God, and God dwells in them. They are
          safe from the <i>devil</i>, and from the power of <i>sin</i>, from
          <i>death </i>and from <i>Hell</i>. They may endure tribulation in the
          world — but in Christ they shall have peace. They enjoy quiet
          consciences, and pleasant hopes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They are quiet, not only from evil — but from the <i>fear </i>of evil.
          They may indeed have fears — but they are clouds that shall soon be
          blown away, and followed by everlasting serenity. Even while these
          fears continue, they have a refuge where they can find safety, and
          hopes sufficient to give them such happiness as worldly men cannot
          enjoy amid their ill-grounded confidence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Paul had often fightings without, and fears within — but this was his
          comfort, that nothing could separate him from the love of God, which
          is in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us examine ourselves impartially, whether we are the
          <i>despisers </i>of wisdom<i> — </i>or the <i>lovers </i>of wisdom.
          The question is not, whether we attend the means of grace, and make a
          profession of religion. <i>Herod </i>heard John gladly, and did many
          things. <i>Ananias </i>and <i>Sapphira </i>parted with a considerable
          share of their substance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But do we chose the fear of the Lord? Do we value Christ above the
          whole world? Do we prefer holiness, in its most painful exercises — to
          the most pleasant sins?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Then let us tremble at the vengeance
          threatened! Let our prayers ascend up on high, that the Lord by his
          Spirit would open our hearts that we may attend to the dictates of
          heavenly wisdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Are we lovers of wisdom? Then let us bless God who has opened our ears
          to discipline, and instructed our hearts. Let us thankfully rejoice in
          the blessings that Wisdom bestows. Let us testify our regard to
          Wisdom, in the manner directed in the following chapter. In vain do we
          pretend to religion, unless that which we call by this honorable name,
          is approved by that Word whereby we must be judged.
