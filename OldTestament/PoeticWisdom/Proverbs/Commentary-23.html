        <p align="justify">
          We must be careful of our hearts as well as our lives, for out of the
          heart are the issues of life. Our hearts are well known to God, and he
          warns us, in the precepts of his Word, against indulging an evil
          disposition, or corrupt passion, which might pollute our souls and
          conduct.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He warns us particularly in this passage, against all envious thoughts
          at the sight of wicked men's prosperity, which are so natural to us,
          that the best saints have not been altogether free of this root of
          bitterness. When we see the material blessings poured out to the
          wicked, and behold these gains and pleasures which are the present
          fruits of sin, we are too ready to say in our hearts, "O that God
          would relax in some degree his laws, that we might without incurring
          his displeasure, revel in those pleasures which the sons of Belial
          enjoy. Those men have a happier life at least than we have, whose
          consciences will not allow us to imitate their lawless conduct." Such
          wicked imaginations are strictly prohibited in this place of
          Scripture. We must not account the proud happy, although they enjoy
          the world at their will. We must not entertain a thought of imitating
          their cursed manners. Why? Their hearts and their lips are as black as
          Hell!

          trouble."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          And which of the two is best for us, to have our hearts beautified
          with the luster of holiness, and purified into sincere love of our
          brethren — or turned into a den of every malicious fiend? To have our
          tongues sweetened with honey and milk — or set on fire of Hell? The
          punishments of sin are very dreadful — but sin itself is such a
          deformed ugly monster, that we are lost to understanding if we do not
          abhor it for its own sake.

          But you will say, that the wicked enjoy great advantage from their way
          of life. They acquire fine houses and elegant furniture, and
          everything delightful in the service of sin. Is sin then attended with
          better fruits even in this world, than wisdom and holiness? By no
          means.

        <p align="justify">
          Houses have been sometimes <i>built </i>through wickedness — but never
          <i>established</i>. By wisdom and knowledge they are built as it were
          on a rock, to stand firm against every blast. Convenient furniture is
          desirable, as well as a sure house; and this also is a fruit of that
          wisdom and industry which belongs to religion.

          Wicked men are represented by Solomon as entertaining their
          imaginations with high expectations of the precious substance, with
          which robbery and fraud will fill their houses. But what wicked men
          vainly expect — godly men find, if God sees it to be good for them.
          Should the wicked prosper in their pursuits, their joy is mingled with
          the racks of a tormenting consciousness of guilt, and the
          apprehensions of a speedy end to the pleasures of sin. If godly men
          are disappointed in their expectations and wishes as to this world —
          they have the consolation of knowing that they have mansions of
          blessedness prepared for them in Christ's father's house, and that
          their substance is the better and enduring substance, laid up for them
          in Heaven.

        <p align="justify">
          Although the Old Testament dispensation of grace abounded in promises
          of earthly blessings — yet many of the ancient saints met with
          innumerable crosses and afflictions. They were obliged to dwell in
          dens and caves of the earth. They were destitute, afflicted, tormented
          — and still they believed that God was faithful to his word, although
          outward events contradicted it. Or if at any time, doubts of God's
          faithfulness and goodness arose in their minds, they resisted the
          abominable thoughts so derogatory to the Most High, and called
          themselves brutes and idiots before God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How inexcusable then must it be for us, who live in the sunshine of
          the Gospel, to give place to blasphemous doubts of the providence of
          God, and the truth of his word — when God does not think fit to give
          splendid palaces and fine furniture to his people! The promises
          respecting this life, belong to godliness under the new testament as
          well at the old — but they are to be understood in a consistency with
          the nobler promises that respect <i>spiritual </i>blessings, and the
          happy influence which <i>crosses </i>of different kinds have in the
          accomplishment of these promises.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When God appoints poverty and losses to the wise, and bereaves them of
          the native fruits of their honest labors and temperate course of life,
          he is not breaking, but fulfilling, his word. And the most afflicted
          saints will find reason to say in the end of their curse, "we know
          that all your judgments are righteous, and that you in faithfulness
          have afflicted us."

        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Health and vigor of body are not inseparable from that temperance and
          labor which religion requires — but they <i>ordinarily </i>
          accompany these virtues. Religion is at any rate fitted to give us
          strength, and animate us with courage, because it directs us to depend
          on the arm of the Almighty, and to be strong in the Lord, and in the
          power of his might.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wisdom teaches us not only to trust in God — but to take advantage of
          that wisdom which God has granted to other men, not merely for their
          own benefit — but to render them useful to others who have the
          meekness and humility of wisdom to consult with them.

          there is safety."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Wars are too often necessary because of the pride, covetousness and
          ambition of men. Those who have most of the meekness of wisdom, are
          sometimes dragged into them — and then wisdom is found to be of far
          greater value than strength, or weapons of war. A multitude of wise
          counselors are far more useful to a nation engaged in war, than a
          great number of valiant soldiers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The wisdom of statesmen and generals is of great use in its proper
          sphere — but the wisdom of saints is of incomparably greater use in
          fighting for the cause of liberty and religion. In the wars of Israel,
          piety was commonly attended with success, for those who knew their God
          were strong and did exploits. If the wisdom of one poor man could
          deliver a city besieged by a powerful king — then what may not be
          expected from the combined wisdom of many? But as useful as wisdom is,
          there are some men so egregiously foolish that they cannot attain this
          quality.

          >"Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the assembly at the gate he has
          nothing to say."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          A fool does not see the excellency of wisdom. Although he may value
          the reputation of it — yet he lacks eyes to behold the real glory of
          wisdom. Or if he has any sense of its value — yet he cannot bring his
          mind to that degree of care, and diligence, and self-denial, which is
          necessary to obtain the knowledge of it. Far less can he resist the
          imperious tyranny of his passions, to put his soul under the
          government of wisdom. Therefore he continues a fool under all the
          means of wisdom that are used with him. A desire to get wisdom is of
          no use but to render his folly more inexcusable. For he has no heart
          to it — but is deeply in love with his folly, and must bear the shame
          and misery to which it exposes him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But if wisdom is too high for a fool — then how can he be blamed for
          not getting wisdom? Because the fault is not in wisdom, nor in the
          means of it, which God has given us — but in the fool himself. Wisdom
          speaks to men in plain language. But fools have corrupt minds, and
          perverse hearts, and refuse to hear the voice of wisdom, or to receive
          the instructions of wisdom into their hearts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A fool, through his incapacity of getting wisdom, is unfit for
          speaking in the assembly — the place of concourse and of judgment. He
          is either made speechless by his consciousness of having nothing to
          say which deserves to be heard — or if his self-conceit opens his
          lips, he betrays his folly by speaking, more effectually than others
          do by their silence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That the wisdom which is the gift of nature and learning is necessary
          to qualify men for public offices is universally allowed; and that
          wisdom which is the gift of the Spirit, is likewise highly requisite,
          if not absolutely necessary. Jethro would have none to be rulers in
          Israel who did not fear God and hate covetousness. For
          <i

          That tree is rotten which is broken by a gentle gale of wind. Just so,
          that man has a rotten heart, who sins upon a slight temptation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But words are insufficient to express the malignity of that man's
          heart, who needs no temptation from the devil at all — but contrives
          and plots sin in his own mind, spending his thoughts devising iniquity
          when he is lying on his bed, or sitting in his house, and searching
          out the most dextrous and effectual methods of gratifying his own
          depraved mind, and doing harm to others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To be driven or drawn to sin is a bad thing — but to draw iniquity
          with cords of vanity, and to sin, as it were, with a cart rope, is
          hellish! The person who does so shall be loaded with infamy. He may
          think himself a man of genius and wisdom; he may acquire to himself an
          honorable name among fools — but the God from whose sentence,
          promotion or infamy comes, calls him a master of harm, and by this
          vile title he shall be known among all that are wise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He may be really a man of genius and learning — but all his talents,
          natural and acquired, concur to sink him so much the deeper in
          <i>the gulf of disgrace</i>. All his honor shall consist in his being
          not a private soldier — but <i>a leader in the bands of Hell</i>. And
          in this dignity he shall share with <i>Balaam</i>, the son of Beer,
          who taught Balak to seduce the Israelites; with <i>Jeroboam </i>the
          son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; with <i>Jezebel</i>, the wife
          and tutor of the most infamous of the kings of Israel; and with

        <p align="justify">
          It is too general a notion that <i>thoughts </i>are of little
          consequence, and that <i>words </i>and <i>actions </i>only expose men
          to danger of punishment from God — but we are to remember, that there
          is an infinite distance between the judges of this world, and the
          Judge of all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Earthly judges cannot penetrate into the <i>hearts </i>of men, and
          have no business with their <i>secret thoughts</i> — but it is the
          glory of the universal Judge, that He is the sovereign and searcher of
          minds. He requires from us, truth in our inward parts; and when he
          comes to judge the world, all shall know that he searches the hearts,
          and tries the thoughts of men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If we study to show ourselves approved unto him, we must not only
          cleanse our hands — but likewise purify our hearts. For foolish and
          sinful thoughts are contrary to his law, and abominable in his sight.
          He beholds with detestation, all the impure workings of the mind — in
          wicked contrivances, in impious reasonings, in vain and foolish
          musings. When he bestows the grace of his Spirit upon any man, he
          makes him to hate vain thoughts, as well as wicked actions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If the thoughts of foolishness are sinful — then how sinful are
          scornful words. There is much more sin in the thoughts of wicked men,
          than in their lips or lives — but when the lips are employed to
          express contempt of all good admonitions, it is an evidence that the
          heart is desperately corrupt, and that thoughts of foolishness abound
          and overflow.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The thoughts of foolishness are abominable only to him who sees the
          heart — but the <i>scorner </i>is an abomination to men also. And if
          he is abominable even to those who have so much impurity of their own
          — then how detestable must he be to him who sees more evil in the
          least sin, than we can discern in the greatest sin?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How long, you scorners, will you delight in your scorning? You are so
          miserably polluted with the defilements of sin, that your fellow
          sinners cannot bear with you — and how then will the Most Holy God
          allow you to escape unpunished? Sit no longer in the seat of the
          scorner — but humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, lest your
          bands be made strong.

          If we sink into despondency, and think that our happiness is forever
          lost, because God has been pleased to afflict us with some grievous
          calamity — then it is plain that our strength and courage is but
          small. Where is the vigor of our <i>faith</i>, if we cannot believe
          that there is help for us in God?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A lively faith in the God of Jacob as our refuge and our strength,
          would make us to stand firm and unshaken, although the mountains were
          removed, and the earth shaken, and overwhelmed by the swelling waves
          of the sea. It would make us to rejoice in the Lord, when everything
          looks dreary around us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If we faint in our Christian course, and use unlawful means of escape
          when dangers surround us — then it is a sign that our strength is
          almost nothing. The church of Philadelphia had a little strength, and
          she held fast the name of Christ, and did not deny his faith. Peter's
          strength was so far lost, when he denied his master's name, that he
          needed in some sense a new conversion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As gold is tried in the fire, so our strength is tried in the furnace
          of affliction. And surely when men are tried, it is their interest and
          honor to see that they come forth as gold, and not as reprobate
          silver. <i>Trials </i>are necessary for us, and appointed to us — and
          the times of trial are critical seasons. Therefore we ought to be
          prepared for them, that the trial of our faith may be found unto
          praise, and honor, and glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But how shall we be furnished with strength to stand in the evil day?
          Paul gives us necessary directions for this purpose. Christ is the
          author of all grace. Faith, hope and patience, are fruits of his
          Spirit; and we must not only receive those militant graces — but
          depend on his power to maintain them in our souls. And then neither
          persecution, nor distress, nor anything else shall be able to
          overthrow our souls, or destroy our comfort.

          to destruction. Christ laid down his life for us — and we ought also
          to lay down our lives for the brethren, and to risk everything dear to
          us, in the cause of righteousness. By the same law of love, we are
          required to interest ourselves in the cause of those who suffer any
          injurious treatment, and to do it without hesitation or delay. We must
          not be slack to afford relief to our enemy's oxen or donkeys, if they
          have fallen into a pit — far less may we defer the giving of needful
          relief to our distressed brethren.

          The wise man represents this piece of charity as a duty which we owe
          to our neighbors without exception — and our Lord agrees with him, in
          the parable of the good Samaritan. We are not the disciples of Solomon
          or of Christ, if we show love only to those who are nearly related to
          us, or who are of the same religious profession with ourselves.

          The wise man knew that this is a duty against which we are too ready
          to muster up <i>exceptions</i>, because the performance of it may
          expose us to trouble or danger — so he answers every
          <i>exception </i> that can be made to it in few words — and with
          strong and convincing arguments. We cannot pretend that it is not our
          duty to relieve the oppressed, as far as our power extends. As the
          priest who passed by the wounded man, kept at a distance, that he
          might not behold that object of compassion — so we are too ready to
          allege that we knew not the peril in which our neighbor was involved,
          or did not know that he was an innocent man, that did not deserve such
          treatment. If this is strictly true, and if our ignorance was not
          voluntary and affected, the excuse is good — but it is to be
          remembered, that no excuses for the neglect of duty ought to be
          sustained by our own minds, that will not be sustained by God our
          judge.

          Excuses may serve to blind the eyes of men who are short-sighted, and
          who are obliged to judge on the charitable side in a doubtful case —
          but God is greater than men, and knows all things, and will not be
          imposed upon by any false pretense. God ponders our hearts, and knows
          with certainty how far we act from a careless and selfish spirit, when
          we neglect the offices of charity to the distressed. In weighing the
          hearts of men, the lack of charity alone serves to turn the balance;
          and the omissions of charity, which are known by God to spring from
          the lack of that necessary virtue, exclude men from the kingdom of
          Heaven.

          everything dear to us in the service of him in whom we live, move, and

          man to be a loser by them. The greatest <i>gains </i>in the world —
          are the losses suffered for the sake of a good conscience. The
          greatest <i> losses —  </i>are the gains of sin. If we neglect duty
          from the prospect of safety or advantage — the honor of God is
          engaged, to convince us by experience, that no profit is to be found
          in disobeying his will.

          of his Son Jesus Christ, which makes us wise unto salvation. Honey is
          sweet to the mouth — but knowledge and wisdom are sweet to the soul.
          The sweetness of honey lasts for a moment — but the sweetness of
          wisdom is everlasting. Honey soon satiates, and when it is taken in
          too large a quantity it is bitter in the belly, and hurtful to the

          wicked, that they will not scruple to lay wait for their lives or
          properties. Christians may entertain assured hopes of the eternal rest

          find themselves mistaken. They have, nevertheless, a ground for strong
          consolation under every attack, and every instance of success in their
          enemies. They must not expect <i>exemption</i> — but they may firmly
          hope for <i>deliverance </i>from the cross. They may fall — but they
          shall not be utterly cast down. For strong is the Lord God who helps

          It is vain for the wicked to hope that they shall be able to do any

          the hopes of success in their unrighteous designs; they see the
          righteous fall before them, and persuade themselves that they shall
          not be able to arise — but the God who maintains their cause, allows

          enemies are like stubble, fully dry. Be not afraid, you righteous, of
          the strength or cunning of your adversaries. Do not believe those
          tempters, who tell you that there is no help for you in God. Be not
          dismayed at their success, nor let your falls into calamity dampen
          your hopes. You are taught by Solomon and Micah, to triumph even when
          you are defeated, because your losses will end in victory, and the
          victories of your enemies will end in ruin. "Rejoice not against me, O
          my enemy, though I fall, I shall arise, though I sit in darkness, the

          twice — but many times, and still he rises. Your experience of former
          deliverances should encourage your hopes of new deliverances, for the
          salvations of the Lord are never exhausted. In six troubles he will
          deliver, and in seven there shall no evil touch you.

          not rejoice, on such occasions, from a vindictive or selfish spirit.

          because harm has befallen our fellow men, or because we expect some
          advantage from the misery of our enemies — is to behave like heathens
          or devils — and not like Christ, or his saints. We must still remember
          that the eye of God is upon us, and he observes all the movements of
          our hearts, and the workings of our passions. He is well pleased when
          we look with a pitying and generous eye upon the sins and miseries of
          our worst enemies — but looks with displeasure on those selfish souls
          who rejoice at the calamities of those who hate them. An unforgiving
          and revengeful spirit, in those who need so much forgiveness from God

          cannot procure their reconciliation to God — but it may kindle God's
          displeasure against us. He may suspend the present execution of
          judgment against them — and transfer it to ourselves. For if they
          wronged us, and exposed themselves to punishment — we have wronged
          both God and them, and have exposed ourselves, in no less a degree, to
          punishment. If we rejoice at the fall or danger of our enemies, we
          ourselves have fallen into a greater evil, for <i>sin </i>has more

          The excellencies and works of God, <br />
          the favors we have received from him, <br />
          the relations we stand in to him, <br />
          the account we must give to him, <br />
          and our absolute dependence upon him<br />
          — loudly call upon us to fear him. He is so much to be feared, that
          the wise preacher tells us that to fear God and keep his commandments
          is the whole duty of man.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To the fear of God, must be joined reverence to the king, for God's
          sake. For by him kings reign, and they are his ministers for our
          protection from enemies and wicked men, and for promoting virtue and
          suppressing wickedness. God has conferred dignity and power upon them,
          and they are entitled to honor for the sake of their office and work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yet we must not carry this reverence of royal dignity to a degree of
          adoration. We must be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
          sake — but to the Lord for his own sake, because absolute dominion
          belongs to him. Although kings are called gods — yet they shall die
          like men. When their commandments clash with the authority of God,
          they are worthy of no regard. Our safety lies in fearing him who has
          power to kill both soul and body, and to cast both into hell-fire. If
          the wrath of a king is like the roaring of a lion — then the wrath of
          God is infinitely more to be dreaded!

          If we would preserve our religion and loyalty, we must not meddle with
          those who are fond of changes either in religion or government — for
          "evil companions corrupt good character." The people of Israel, when
          they mingled with the nations, learned their ways, and changed their
          glory for that which did not profit. They were so fond of being like
          their neighbors, that they rejected the Lord from being king over
          them, and desired rather to have <i>a royal tyrant </i>like the other
          nations.

        <p align="justify">
          When Absalom rebelled against his father, many followed him in the
          foolishness of their hearts. The Scripture does not require us to be
          subject to the wicked laws of tyrants — but single acts of bad
          administration do not justify men in casting off the yoke of
          government. In most cases, it is our duty and wisdom to be quiet and
          peaceable subjects, to those who have the possession of the throne
          granted them by divine providence, and to say with more sincerity than
          Hushai the Archite, "whom the Lord and this people choose — his will I
          be, and with him will I abide." Impiety and disloyalty are great and
          dangerous sins.

          Kings are terrible enemies. But God is infinitely more dreadful, and

          How many were destroyed in the gainsaying of Korah, and in the

          tempest of vengeance may hurl those men into perdition, who fear not
          God, or do not reverence those who are authorized by him to administer
          justice among men.

        <p align="justify">
          The apostle Paul spends a large part of a chapter in considering the
          sin and danger of those who do not submit to the higher powers. How
          miserable shall they be, who refuse subjection to that great king whom
          God has placed on the throne of grace, and to whom he has given a rod
          of iron, to crush those rebels that attempt to break his bands, and
          cast away his cords! The princes and judges of the earth must serve
          him, as well as the lowest of their subjects, and his enemies shall
          lick the dust. Blessed are all those who put their trust in him, and
          obey him.

        <p align="justify">
          Princes usually have a sufficient sense of those duties which their
          subjects owe them; and they would generally find these duties better
          performed, if they had a proper sense of their own duties. The
          precepts of wisdom are binding on them, as well as on poor men — and
          the dominion of God extends alike to the prince and to the peasant.
          All the precepts already delivered are precepts of wisdom, and those
          which follow were likewise dictated by the father of lights to the
          wisest of men. The best proof we can give of our wisdom, is to observe
          the precepts of God. They are fools that will not hear the voice of
          wisdom, or look upon any of her precepts as superfluous.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We may more reasonably complain of too much money in our purses, or
          too many clothes in our closets — than of too many precepts of wisdom
          in the book of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have no reason to complain that God is strict in requiring our
          obedience to rulers. He is no less strict in requiring rulers to
          govern justly, and to make their subjects happy. In this verse, he
          commands them to do justice and judgment to all their people. Whatever
          favors they may confer on particular people — they must be impartial
          in judgment. They must not show partiality to the rich and great, nor
          their own favorites, nor even a poor or a righteous man in his cause.
          To show partiality to any man is not good — but very wicked. Elihu
          dared not show partiality to Job, although he was the best man on the
          face of the earth, when he gave his judgment about the cause which he
          had debated with his friends.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Although absolute dominion belongs to God, and he dispenses his favors
          according to his sovereign pleasure — yet in judgment he shows no
          partiality to his own favorites.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When he determined by his providence the cause between his beloved
          servant David, and Saul whom he had rejected — he examined David, and
          found nothing, judging him according to his righteousness, and not
          according to the special favor he had to him. And when the same David
          had dealt injuriously with Uriah, he was punished before all Israel,
          and before the sun. In like manner, when the Gibeonites were treated
          with abuse and cruelty by the king of Israel — God gave full
          satisfaction to the Gibeonites. Kings and judges are honored with the
          name of gods on earth, and they ought to imitate the justice of God in
          all their administrations. But may not criminals be allowed to escape
          by a merciful perversion of the law, although the righteous must not
          be wronged? No!

          Job looked upon it as one part of his happiness, that he enjoyed the

          him. We may safely risk the abhorrence of all mankind, and despise
          their favor — when our duty requires us. For if we seek to please men
          at the expense of sinful compliances, we are not the servants of
          Christ. But as far as we are allowed by the law of God, it is our duty
          to practice those things that are of good report, living unblamably
          and usefully in our respective stations — that we may adorn the
          doctrine of God our Savior in all things.

          How important is the behavior of men in elevated stations. Thousands
          or millions of men are losers or gainers by it, and applaud or abhor
          those who rule over them. Kings and magistrates have much need of our
          <i>prayers</i>, that they may receive wisdom from God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We who are in inferior stations, have likewise
          <i>our contracted sphere of influence</i>, and ought to consider how
          much others are affected by our behavior. Let us endeavor to deserve
          at least their blessings, and to avoid everything that may justly
          incur their displeasure, or hurt their interests.

          If it is of so much consequence to the public, that magistrates should
          punish the wicked; and if they would incur universal hatred by the
          neglect of this part of their duty — shall we then deny to the
          sovereign Ruler of the world, that praise to which he is entitled for
          his acts of just vengeance? He is glorious in his administrations of
          <i>justice </i>as well as <i>mercy</i>. Who would not fear him and
          glorify his name, for he alone is holy, for his judgments are made
          manifest! If he did not punish the wicked, we would have reason to say
          that everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he
          delights in them — and where is the God of judgment? Those magistrates
          who give a right judgment in any cause that comes before them, procure

          History of all ages proves the truth of this proverb. When we are
          asked an important question, or consulted on an affair of consequence,
          every man will esteem and love us, if we give an honest answer; and
          that our answer may be honest, it is necessary that it should be
          sincere, prudent, and meek. We must not give an answer calculated
          merely to please the person who questions us. For that would not be
          consistent with integrity. We must consider all the circumstances of
          the affair, that we may give a proper and pertinent answer; and we
          must speak with that meekness, which renders wisdom lovely. If our
          answers to those who question us have these qualifications, although
          they may be sometimes distasteful, because truth compels us to speak
          things disagreeable — yet they will tend, on the whole, to the
          advancement of our character. Our character is no contemptible object,
          because the goodness of it is necessary for us in accomplishing the
          great business of life, glorifying God, and doing good to men.

          Things absolutely necessary are to be sought after, in the first

          and satisfaction. For this reason we are commanded by our Lord, in the

          this kind is not unreasonable, only it must be kept in due
          subordination to our most important concerns. The work of the field,
          on which our subsistence depends, is of more importance than the
          building of a better house, and ought therefore to be first attended

          perfection without learning the first principles, is as foolish as to

          >"And behold, it was all overgrown with thorns; the ground was covered
          with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down!"
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          How could it be otherwise? Thorns and thistles, since the fall of man,
          spring up everywhere, to remind us of our rebellion against God — and
          the greatest industry can scarcely keep them down. But where
          slothfulness leaves them to spring up at will, the field must be
          covered with them, and every useful plant choked. Or, if anything
          useful springs up among them, it becomes a prey to every spoiler,
          because the stone wall is broken down and left in ruins. Such is the
          situation of the sluggard's field and vineyard!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Just so, spiritual sloth is productive of the like effects in the soul
          of man. If we are careless about our spiritual interests, our souls
          will soon be overrun with noisome and pernicious vice, and left
          without guard against those destructive enemies, "who go about seeking
          whom they may devour."

          A neglected garden is disagreeable to the eye — but a neglected soul
          is a spectacle of horror! The stinging nettles of envy, the thorns of
          anger, and ungovernable lusts — spring up abundantly in that scene of
          desolation. Every lust and every temptation have an uncontrolled
          influence — and the roaring lion out of the bottomless pit wastes it
          at his pleasure!

          But what pleasure could Solomon have in looking at the sluggard's
          vineyard? He saw nothing that did not afford instruction to his
          enlightened mind. For wisdom teaches us to improve every object,
          however unpleasant, to useful purposes, and finds nourishment for
          itself even in the folly of other men:

          >"I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what
          I saw"</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon did not take a cursory and superficial view of this field —
          but spent many thoughts upon it. How useful is MEDITATION? It is the
          nurse of knowledge and prudence. It furnishes our minds with truths,
          and applies them to the heart, and teaches us to live in a manner
          suitable to them. Solomon was already wise — but he wished to be
          wiser, and learned wisdom every day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Another man would have learned self-conceit or self-indulgence, from
          the field of the sluggard. Some people, when they see the faults of
          others — applaud themselves for their superiority in virtue. No man,
          they think, can say they are wicked men, because they know that some
          other men are worse. There are other people that think it safe for
          them to do like other people, and to let alone what other people omit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our wisdom lies in learning from the example of other men, compared
          with the law of God, what we are to do, and what we are to avoid. We
          see the sluggard, the drunkard, the lukewarm professor — but we see no
          good arising out of their vices — but much harm to themselves. They
          are condemned by the providence as well as the Word of God. Their
          souls are unprosperous, and the outward circumstances of some of those
          kinds of sinners, have the marks of divine displeasure mingled with
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is it not better to learn wisdom at the cost of other people, than at
          our own expense? Solomon learned instruction from this dismal
          spectacle, the field and vineyard of the sluggard; and the instruction
          which he received, he communicates to us in a proverb, which, for its
          importance, is repeated from a former chapter.

          >"A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
          rest — and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an
          armed man."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          The sluggard had no intention of allowing his field to be all covered
          with weeds, he only wished to indulge himself a little while in ease
          and sleep, and then he designed to rouse himself and root up all the
          weeds. His ruin was, that, when he had got a little sleep, he wished
          for a little more; and when he had taken the little more, he felt
          himself as little disposed to work as before. And so he loitered and
          wasted away the time, day after day, doing nothing at all, or nothing
          to purpose — until his field was all overrun with noisome weeds, and
          every good plant destroyed, and his vineyard lay in ruins. Thus
          poverty came upon him swiftly and unexpectedly, and with irresistible
          fury, and plunged him into the gulf of misery and remorse!

          Would you avoid sloth? Beware of every temptation to it, and allow no
          place to any thought of <i>delaying a necessary business</i>. It was a
          maxim of a certain prince, who was celebrated for his success in every
          undertaking,
          <i
            >never to defer that until tomorrow, that which should be done to
            day</i
          >. Putting off things until tomorrow, is the thief of time. It is
          unsafe in any business. It is infinitely dangerous in our spiritual
          concerns. Boast not therefore of tomorrow. For you know not what a day
          may bring forth — but whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all
          your might!
