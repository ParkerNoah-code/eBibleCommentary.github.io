            >"The preparations of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the
            tongue is from the LORD."</b
          >
          A man cannot put his heart into a proper order, nor manage his
          thoughts so as to be ready for any good word or work, by his own
          abilities. We cannot expel sin from our hearts, nor furnish them with
          holy dispositions. Even when our hearts are purified by the grace of
          God, we cannot, without new supplies of grace, prepare them for
          praying, or speaking to the edification of our fellow Christians. One
          of the best of men, tells us that he was not sufficient of himself to
          think anything as he ought. It is our duty to prepare our hearts, and
          fix our thoughts for every religious service to which we are called —
          and it is our sin when we are careless about it. But we must not
          attempt this work in our own strength. In everything we must direct
          our eyes to God, the fountain of all goodness, praying to him, as
          David did for his people, that he may prepare our hearts unto himself.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          To encourage us to apply to God for his needful assistance, we are
          here told, that the preparation of the heart belongs to him; and in
          other passages of Scripture we are encouraged by his promises, to
          expect this favor at his hands. We must depend on God for everything.
          The answer of the tongue is from the Lord, as well as the preparation
          of the heart. He fashions the hearts of men, and makes their tongues
          to speak what he pleases.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He pressed <i>Balsam's </i>tongue, against his desires, into the
          service of Israel, and would not allow <i>Laban </i>to speak to Jacob
          either good or bad, when he came to him with a full resolution to do
          him some harm. <i>Caiaphas </i>was made to speak a noble truth, when
          he designed only to suggest a political counsel; and <i>Pilate </i>had
          not power to pronounce the condemning sentence against our Lord, until
          it was given him from above.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          However well our thoughts are arranged in our minds — yet we cannot
          utter them to the advantage of men, and the glory of God — unless the
          Lord enlarges our hearts and looses our tongues. Therefore David prays
          that his lips, which were closed, might be opened; and Paul begs the
          prayers of the Ephesians, that utterance might be given. We must beg
          from God the gifts of utterance for ministers, and the gift of prayer
          and Christian conference for ourselves — under a firm persuasion that
          we are altogether unable of ourselves to think or speak, or perform
          any good thing, and that every good and perfect gift is from above,
          even from the Father of lights, who bestows his gifts freely — but
          requires the praise of them to be rendered back to himself. The truth
          contained in this text must not slacken — but encourage our Christian
          diligence.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 16:2.</p></font
          >"All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by
          the LORD." </b
        >How different is the judgment which men form of themselves, from that
        which God makes of them! He looks down from Heaven to see how men
        behave, and behold, be sees all men walking in sinful ways. They are
        filthy and abominable — and yet so blind, that they generally think
        their way is clean and pure. They will acknowledge that they are not
        free from sin — but they have no impressions of the evil of sin. Their
        great transgressions, they account venial trespasses. Their lesser
        iniquities, which they daily commit, are accounted mere <i>motes</i>,
        not worth the minding. And every slight appearance of goodness, their
        vain imagination exalts into a shining virtue.
        <p align="justify">
          The reason of men's good opinion of their ways is, that they are
          unacquainted with their own hearts, and take no pains to be acquainted
          with the secret principles and aims which animate and direct the
          course of their life.
          <i
            >No kind of knowledge is more necessary, nor seldomer sought after
            and obtained — than the knowledge of a man's self.
          </i>
          But it will profit us nothing to be pure in our own eyes, if we are
          abominable in the eyes of him with whom we have to do. It is not he
          who commends himself who is approved — but he whom the Lord commends.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The better that a wicked man thinks of himself, he is the more
          abhorred by the Lord, who is the irreconcilable enemy of pride and
          self-conceit, and calls those men who boast of their goodness, a smoke
          in his nostrils — a fire that burns all the day. The Lord is our
          Judge, and our sentence must come from him. He weighs our hearts in a
          just and unerring balance — and if they are destitute of faith in
          Christ, and love to God and holiness, he will condemn our way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The most splendid actions, and shining appearances of virtue, without
          purity of heart, will make us, in his sight, only like white-washed
          sepulcher — beautiful on the outside, but inwardly full of rottenness
          and dead men's bones.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us examine our own hearts and ways under a deep impression of this
          truth — that God is greater than our hearts, and knows all things. The
          Word of God is the rule by which we must search and try ourselves —
          for God will judge us by it at last. We learn from God's Word, that
          none shall be able to stand in judgment before God, who have not been
          made to discern the impurity of their heart and lives, and compelled
          to build their confidence upon him who saves the lost. It is not
          impossible for men to attain a comfortable knowledge of their own
          salvation. Although a ragged beggar, when he dreams of crowns and
          scepters, thinks himself as sure of his imagined dignity, as if it
          were a reality — yet a king will not doubt of his royalty, nor imagine
          that it may be only a dream. But those who have obtained this precious
          blessing of knowing assuredly that they are purified in heart and life
          — have, at the same time, a humbling sense of remaining impurities.
          Their dependence is not upon themselves — but upon Christ; and they
          would dread the thoughts of being brought into judgment with God on
          the ground of their own righteousness, knowing that no flesh can be
          justified before him.
        </p>
        <b

          >"Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed." </b
        >The just God has appointed much toil to the sons of Adam, to be
        exercised therewith — and it often becomes a burden that makes us to
        groan and cry out for ease. And here God in his mercy directs us to a
        method of finding ease and comfort under the heaviest burdens — Commit
        to the Lord whatever you do.
        <p align="justify">
          But how shall we cast them upon him? Shall we ascend into the heavens
          to find him for this purpose? No, David explains this point of
          instruction at great length in the thirty-seventh Psalm, and tells us
          that we are to commit our work unto the Lord, by trusting and resting
          in him, and waiting patiently for the outcome. Paul directs us to do
          it by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving. And as Hannah, when
          she had prayed about her sorrows, went away, and was no more
          sorrowful.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          So when our burden is cast upon the Lord by fervent supplications, we
          ought to banish every anxious thought, believing that God is mighty
          and faithful, and will give a good account of that which is entrusted
          to him by his own direction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must not, however, neglect the use of proper and warrantable means
          for accomplishing our designs, for it is presumption, and not faith,
          to believe God's promise, and disregard his command.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Joshua</p></i>was to depend upon God alone for
        victory over the Canaanites — and yet he was required to be strong and
        courageous, to fight with them, and observe all God's commandments. He
        seems to have erred when he sent only 3000 men against Ai, to save toil
        to the people.
        <p align="justify">
          Our <i>temporal </i>affairs are to be committed to God, is well as our
          <i>spiritual </i>concerns. In everything we must depend upon God's
          help, ask his direction, and refer ourselves to his will. In the
          meantime, we must undertake nothing inconsistent with our duty to God
          and men, for it would be gross impiety to concern the most holy God in
          things opposite to his own will.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Had David been employed in acknowledging God when he prepared his men
          for marching with the Philistines against Israel, the Amalekites would
          never have found an opportunity to destroy Ziklag. And yet David's
          encouraging himself in the Lord his God, after he had felt the bad
          consequences of his rashness, teaches us this comfortable lesson —
          that although we have been turned by our own rashness out of God's
          way, we are not excluded from the benefit of this gracious direction.
          David still committed his work to the Lord, and the harms occasioned
          by his unadvised conduct were soon retrieved. What a pleasure is it
          for a weary man to be allowed to cast his burden upon one who is well
          able to bear it!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But it is our mercy, that we are allowed to cast our works and burdens
          upon the Almighty God. And we are assured that he will then establish
          our thoughts, and bring what concerns us to a comfortable end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Perhaps the event will not suit our present views — but in that case
          it will appear that our views were not agreeable to the gracious
          intentions of God — and in that case it will be our happiness to have
          them disappointed. May the will of the Lord be done, and let our own
          will be done as far as it consists with his. It was a prayer of a
          famous divine,
          <i>'Let my will be done, O Lord — my will, because it is Yours.' </i>

          the day of disaster."</b
        >
        Every rational being has some end of his work in view. And God, in all
        his works of creation and providence, has the noblest of possible ends
        in view — the glory of his name, and the manifestation of his divine
        excellencies. He is infinitely blessed, and needs no glory from us — but
        he is infinitely wise and holy, and he will be glorified <i>by </i>us,
        or <i>upon </i>us. Every creature should be used by us as a means of
        raising our thoughts to its Creator, for what being is there that lacks
        a tongue, to declare his glory to the rational mind? The silent fish
        will declare unto us that the hand of the Lord has made them.
        <p align="justify">
          But does not God lose his glory in some of his creatures? Are not
          <i>wicked men and devils </i>dishonoring him every day to his face?
          Yet God shall never be disappointed of his great end. He will obtain a
          revenue of praise from those who will not give him the glory due unto
          his name, and will force the wrath and wickedness of his enemies to
          praise him.

        <i> <p align="justify">Pharaoh</p></i>was an insolent rebel against the
        Sovereign of the world — and yet in very deed God raised him up, to show
        his power in him, and that his name might be declared throughout all the
        earth.
        <p align="justify">
          Tremble, you stubborn sinners! God must be glorified in you, and if
          you will not be persuaded to give him glory by accepting of his
          gracious salvation, and turning from your sins — then there remains
          nothing for you but a fearful looking for of judgment, and of fiery
          indignation. The Lord Almighty will be exalted in judgment, and God
          who is holy will be glorified in righteousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The<i> day of disaster </i>is the day of the display of the glorious
          holiness of God. You cannot expect to escape, unless God could be
          persuaded to renounce his glory for you. You may with much more
          reason, hope that the earth should be removed out of its place. Aaron
          was a highly-favored saint — and yet when his two sons affronted God
          by offering strange fire, they were immediately consumed by fire. The
          reason was, because God would be glorified in all who came near unto
          him. The flames of Hell will shine forever to the glory of God, and
          afford a subject for the songs of Heaven!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How admirable are the glories of the Lord! Every creature in every

          <i>through </i>him, and <i>to </i>him are all things! To him be glory
          forever and ever. Amen. The proud among those who do wickedly, shall
          be dreadful <i>monuments of the vengeance of the Almighty God</i>, and
          not one of them shall escape!

        We have seen already, that a <i>proud look </i>is greatly offensive to
        God — but although there is no appearance of pride in the countenance or
        behavior to provoke the displeasure of the Almighty — yet he is the
        searcher of the heart, and if he finds it governed by pride, he will
        execute the vengeance written in his word upon the haughty sinner.
        <p align="justify">
          Man looks on the outward appearance, and frequently makes false
          judgments. The demure Pharisees were counted humble and pious men,
          when they were hunting after the praise of the people — but their
          inward pride was well known to our Lord, who tells them, that what was
          highly valued by men, was abhorred by God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The proud abound in the world. This abominable sin is natural to the
          posterity of him who fell by attempting to be like God. The forms of
          it are quite various, and the grounds of it cannot be reckoned up, for
          it is<i> an insatiable monster </i>that will find nourishment in
          anything. Some are proud of their dignity and power, and high birth.
          Others boast themselves because of their great riches. Some are proud,
          like Goliath, of their stature and the vigor of their limbs. Others
          boast of their beauty — and that pleasing form which shall soon be
          turned into corruption. Some are proud of their righteousness, and
          others (O the infatuation of the human race!) glory in the shame! But
          whatever shape pride may assume, and whatever is its ground, it is
          seen by the all-seeing eye of God, and makes the man in whom it dwells
          and reigns, an object of his abhorrence and avenging justice! None can
          imagine the terrors of that punishment which inflicted by the hand of
          the Lord, on those whom his heart abhors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But is there no possibility of avoiding it? None, unless the haughty
          spirit is humbled into a submission to the righteousness of faith.
          Though hand join in hand, those who walk on in pride shall be abased,
          and spurned into eternal Hell. Unknown myriads of angels fell by pride
          into the bottomless pit, and are groaning, and shall forever groan,
          under the power of God's righteous wrath! Although all the proud on
          earth should enter into a confederacy with all the legions of devils
          and damned spirits in Hell, and exert their utmost combined force to
          oppose the execution of Almighty vengeance — they will only be like
          heaps of dried straw, reared up to oppose the progress of a raging
          flame!

          >"By mercy and truth iniquity is purged; and by the fear of the Lord,
          men depart from evil." </b
        >It is plain from Scripture, that Christ has by himself purged our sins,
        and by one offering forever perfected all those who are sanctified. To
        pretend to substitute anything of our own in place of his perfect
        atonement, or to join our own works to his blood to procure our pardon,
        would be as foolish as an attempt to extinguish the sun, and supply its
        place with a candle; or to improve the brightness of that luminary, by
        lighting a torch at mid-day. We must not therefore imagine, that Solomon
        meant in this place to recommend mercy and truth to us, as means of
        procuring the favor of God and the pardon of our sins, for Scripture
        cannot contradict itself.
        <p align="justify">
          Some, by mercy and truth, understand the mercy and truth of God, two
          attributes which shine with illustrious brightness in our salvation,
          and are frequently mentioned together by the sacred writers, when they
          celebrate the glories of it. Christ, our atonement, was the mercy
          promised unto the fathers, and when God bestows pardon through Christ,
          he reveals the riches of his mercy according to his Word; for he is
          faithful and merciful when he fulfills that promise of the covenant,
          "I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins and
          their iniquities will I remember no more."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          None shall receive the benefit of pardoning <i>mercy</i> — but
          consistent with the <i>truth </i>of God in his Word; and therefore
          hopes of safety, not grounded on the Scripture, shall end in shame and
          disappointment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Hebrew word which we render <i>purged</i>, is sometimes used to
          signify the cause or means of deliverance from temporal harms, or
          death. In this sense I think it may be said, that by mercy and truth
          in men, iniquity is removed; according to that exhortation of Daniel
          to the king of Babylon, "Break off your iniquities by showing mercy to
          the poor, so be it may a lengthening of your tranquility."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is mighty recommendation of mercy and fidelity towards men, that we
          are so infinitely indebted to the mercy and faithfulness of God, to
          whom we are to show our gratitude, by imitating those amiable
          attributes that appear with such lovely glories in our pardon and
          salvation. And while we thus show forth the virtues of our God and our
          Savior, in doing good to men, we are consulting and pursuing our own
          best interest and comfort.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But mercy and truth to men, must have the fear of the Lord joined to
          them, to make them Christian graces.

          When Joseph's brethren were terrified that he would do them some

          thought, for, says he, "I fear God!" The fear of God will not only
          dispose men to abstain from manifest acts of injustice — but it will
          keep them from every instance of harsh and ungenerous conduct.

        a man that has the fear of God in him, for herein he will exercise

          Every true Christian is disposed, by the grace of God, to endeavor to

          what this world affords, it would still be our wisdom to prefer the
          pleasing of God to the favor of men — because the hearts of all men

          When we have lost the favor of our friends or superiors, we are

          we should rather consider seriously, whether we have not provoked our
          great Benefactor to deprive us of the good-will of men, by our
          ingratitude to himself. Wolsey made this melancholy reflection, when
          he was turned out of his Master's favor: "Had I served God as
          faithfully as I served my prince, he would not have forsaken me thus
          at last." But if he had served God more faith fully, it is probable
          that his prince had not forsaken him at last; or if this calamity had
          in that case befallen him, it need not have produced such a bitter

          work should be, to make our peace with God, if we have offended him —
          for he fashions the hearts of men according to his pleasure; and
          whether they act as friends or enemies, they are ministers of his
          providence.

          Jacob did well in giving large presents to Esau, and addressing him in

          turned his brother's alienated heart to him. These were, indeed, means
          which God blessed for that purpose — but the principal means which
          Jacob used for this purpose, was weeping and supplication, and by
          these he had power with God, and, by consequence, with men, and
          obtained the glorious name of Israel.

          God has often given favor to his faithful people in the eyes of

          <i>Joseph </i>in Egypt, <i>David </i>at Gath, and <i>Daniel </i>in
          Babylon. These and the like examples of God's sovereignty over the
          hearts of men, and goodness to his people, may satisfy us that God
          will sooner or later reconcile the hearts of enemies to his servants,
          when he sees it for their real benefit. <i>Job </i>was long an object
          of indifference to some of his friends, and aversion to others of them
          — yet at last the hearts of all his acquaintances were disposed to
          love and serve him.

          providence will make the wrath of men to promote his noblest
          interests. The martyrs, when they lost their lives, were overcomers,

        The fruits of unrighteousness may be pleasant in the mouth — but they
        are bitter in the belly; and a man that consults his true interest, will
        rather live on bread and water, or starve, with a good conscience — than
        enjoy the revenue of kings, without the approbation of God and his own
        conscience. There are too many in the world who would rather be rich by
        unfair means — than enjoy the pleasures of a good conscience with
        poverty. Therefore the Spirit of God cries to us again and again, that a
        little with honesty and the fear of the Lord, is better than affluence

        the same truth. "To man belong the plans of the heart — but from the
        LORD comes the reply of the tongue." The Lord has a sovereign influence
        over the hearts and thoughts of men. They can devise nothing without the
        concurrence of his providence, for in him we live, and move, and have
        our being. When men are even taking unhallowed means to determine their
        conduct, the holy providence of God, by undiscerned influence, overrules
        their minds, and decides in their councils.

          When the king of Babylon used divination to direct him whether he
          should direct his march to Rabbah or Jerusalem, it was the Lord who
          determined him to come against his own people, to punish them for
          their iniquities. Yet Solomon affirms with truth, that a man's heart

          The decree and providence of God do not interfere with the free-will

          fortunes of men. The sovereign dominion of God shines clearly in the
          disposal of men's ways. They either execute their counsels or not, as
          his wisdom has determined. They sometimes accomplish their own
          counsels — but whether they do or not, they never fail to accomplish

        It is too evident that this sentence contains not the character of all
        kings — but only of those who deserve this noble title by their wisdom
        and goodness. It would not be a perversion of the original text, in this

        translate them as <i>advice</i>, rather than <i>descriptions </i>of
        their behavior.
        <p align="justify">
          Let a divine sentence be in the lips of the king, and let not his
          mouth transgress in judgment. Great sagacity and insight is necessary
          for those who govern whole nations. The higher men are exalted, they
          need the more wisdom — because ignorance and folly are attended, in
          men of station and power, with very destructive consequences. Kings
          are not born wiser than other men — but they are under stronger
          obligations than their subjects, to use with unceasing diligence the
          means of attaining wisdom, and to pray for it to him who is the
          Fountain of wisdom and royalty. When God calls men to any station for
          which great degrees of wisdom are requisite, let them ask it of God,
          who gives liberally and upbraids not.

        <i> <p align="justify">Justice</p></i>is equally necessary in kings, for

        ascribe all good inventions to the one living and true God. It was he
        who taught the merchant, as well as the gardener, discretion. The
        appointment of weights and measures, as instruments of justice in trade,
        is to be ascribed to him. A man who puts the royal stamp upon base
        metal, is accounted a traitor to his prince. Just so, it is a daring
        wickedness for men to use those weights and balances, which are God's
        appointments for the benefit of society, as means of injustice to their
        fellow-men. But a just weight and a just measure are approved by him,

        and punish it. It is their interest to do so, for great armies cannot
        save a king, nor is his throne secured by the largeness of his
        dominions, and the valor of his soldiers — but by righteousness, which
        brings down the blessing of God, and attaches to him the hearts of his

        within him, which is a constant and indwelling temptation. Therefore he
        walks circumspectly, not as a fool — but as a wise man, and daily prays
        that he may be led and kept in the way of uprightness by the Spirit of
        the Lord.
        <p align="justify">
          Happy is the man who guards his way — he walks in safe path wherein he
          shall not stumble, for it is the highway of the King of Heaven. He
          preserves his soul, for he is preserved from the paths of the
          destroyer. He walks in Christ, and is led by the Spirit of Christ, and
          no lion nor ravenous beast shall be let loose to destroy him — but he
          shall come at length to the Zion of blessedness with songs and
          everlasting joy upon his head.

          "Pride goes before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall." </b
        >Pride is a common and dangerous iniquity, and our kind instructor
        multiplies his cautions against it. The danger of pride is plain from
        every history of the great transactions that have come to pass in Heaven
        and in earth. The prophets describe the destructive consequences of this
        sin with all the strength of their divine eloquence, and all the
        sublimity of the prophetic style. The history of the evangelists shows
        us what amazing humiliation was necessary to expiate the guilt
        contracted by the pride of man. The tendency of the preaching and
        writings of the apostles, was to cast down every high imagination of
        men, that no flesh might glory — but in the Lord.
        <p align="justify">
          Might not this loathsome disease become a cure for itself? Can
          anything afford us greater cause of humiliation, than to find
          ourselves guilty of a sin so exceedingly unreasonable and presumptuous
          as pride? Shall a worm swell itself into an equality with the huge
          leviathan? What is man that he should be great in his own eyes? What
          is the son of man, who is a worm, that he should magnify himself as if
          he were some great being? Was the Son of God humbled for us, that we
          might not perish forever — and shall we allow pride to reign in our
          souls?

          >"Better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide
          the spoil with the proud."
        </b>
        Although pride were not followed by destruction, and humility were
        attended by the most afflicting circumstances — yet humility is to be
        infinitely preferred to pride.
        <p align="justify">
          The word here rendered <i>humble </i>might signify <i> afflicted</i>.
          Humility and affliction are often in Scripture expressed by the same
          word, and described as parts of the same character. Low and afflicted
          circumstances are often useful, by promoting humiliation of spirit.
          The reverse sometimes takes place — but it is an evidence of a very
          intractable spirit — if we cry not when God chastens us, and continue
          unhumbled under humbling providences. The cottager who has his little
          tent of straw, is less excusable than the mighty Nebuchadnezzar
          walking in his pride through the splendid chambers of his stupendous
          palace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          However mean the circumstances of the humble man may be, he is
          incomparably happier than the most prosperous of proud sinners.
          Alexander and Severnus, after all their mighty conquests, are said to
          have lamented the emptiness of their acquisitions. "I have been all
          things," said the last of these mighty men, "and nothing is of any
          use."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The joys and triumphs of the prosperous sinner are as unsubstantial
          and fleeting as the wind. But the humble and afflicted Christian is a
          happy man, for his poverty of spirit makes him content and thankful.
          The God who knows the proud afar off, looks on him with delight, and
          dwells with him, to revive his contrite spirit. The humble man
          believes that he is in the circumstances which his heavenly Father
          knows to be best for him. Christ declares him blessed, and he shall be
          blessed through eternity.

        >He who handles a matter wisely shall find good; and whoever trusts in
        the Lord, happy is he. We ought not only to avoid everything sinful and
        foolish, and to exercise ourselves diligently in our necessary
        businesses and duties — but likewise to do everything that we undertake
        <i> wisely </i>and <i>discreetly</i>. The prudent management of affairs
        is attended with great comfort and advantage. It will give us reasonable
        hopes of success, command esteem from others, and prevent the evil
        consequences that usually result from indiscretion.
        <i> <p align="justify">David's</p></i>name was much honored when he was
        in the house of Saul, because he behaved himself prudently on every
        occasion. <i> Solomon's </i>prudent administration filled the Queen of
        Sheba with amazement, and made her almost to envy the servants that had
        the pleasure of attending him, and seeing and hearing his wisdom.
        <p align="justify">
          In our religious course, we are required to do everything in a decent,
          orderly, and prudent manner. This will conduce to our own comfort and
          happiness, to the glory of the God of order, and to the edification of
          the body of Christ. It will prevent our good from being spoken evil of
          by those who desire to find occasion against us. But whether we are
          employed in the business of the world, or in that of God — we must not
          trust to our own skill and prudence. To God we must look, and on him
          we must depend for direction, and help, and success; for a man's heart
          may devise his way — but the Lord directs his steps. Happy is the man
          who trusts all his concerns in the hands of God. <br />
          His heart is freed from anxious cares.<br />
          He receives all needful supplies of wisdom and strength.<br />
          He is led in the way of safety, and shall at last inherit the eternal
          kingdom of God.

        >A good name is better than precious ointment, and this blessing is
        enjoyed by the wise in heart, and enables them to be serviceable to
        other men by the communication of their wisdom. Although the heart is
        the seat of wisdom, it must not be buried there — but wisdom must reveal
        itself in the speech and conduct, that many may be edified. We were not
        born for ourselves alone — but as we are made of one blood, and joined
        together by endearing relations, so we are bound to be useful to one
        another.
        <p align="justify">
          That our wisdom may be useful, we should endeavor to produce it to
          advantage, by a graceful and engaging manner of expression. It is not
          uncommon with wicked men to set off their corrupt sentiments by
          dressing them in all the beauties of language, and by this means
          multitudes are seduced into error and folly. Is not wisdom far better
          entitled to this recommendation than folly?
          <i>The expression of our thoughts in proper language </i>will increase
          our learning, by making them more clear and distinct to ourselves, and
          thus enabling us to pursue them into their native consequences. And
          learning will be diffused among others, while it is conveyed to them
          in a clear and engaging manner. What satisfaction must it give a man
          to improve his neighbors in the most useful knowledge? It makes him a
          public good, as we are told in the next verse.

        Our plenty of water makes us less sensible than the inhabitants of
        Palestine, of the propriety of that metaphor, whereby everything that is
        <i>useful </i>or <i>pleasant </i>is in Scripture compared to
        <i>water</i>. It was one of the recommendations that God himself gave to
        his people of the land of promise, that it was a land of fountains of
        water, as well as a land of milk and honey; and the blessings of Christ
        are compared to water in many passages of the Scriptures.
        <p align="justify">
          As waters in a thirsty land — so is a wise man to his friends and
          neighbors. He has in him a well of living waters, and these issue
          forth in quickening and refreshing discourse. His wise and edifying
          converse is not confined to those times when he is professedly
          instructing or counseling his family or friends — but when he acts in
          character, his familiar converse ministers grace to the hearers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But when fools are giving their instructions and counsels, they cannot
          hide that folly which cleaves to them continually. They must still be

          more consistent than wise men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wise men have folly still remaining in them, and therefore are not

          reveal their foolishness when they are most earnestly endeavoring to
          appear wise.

        The wise man commended a graceful manner of expression to us, but there
        is a <i>false eloquence </i> which he rather wishes to guard us against.
        Pompous words, and turns of wit, and fine thoughts which lack solidity,
        will not make a man truly eloquent. The true excellence of language
        consists in expressing just and important thoughts with clearness and
        force, that they may be understood and felt by the hearer. A man who
        understands a subject well, although he is but an ordinary speaker —
        will do more justice to it than the finest speaker in the world, who has
        not a clear view of it.<i>
          We cannot expect to make others feel the importance of the things we
          speak — unless our own hearts are duly impressed with them.
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          This text is a good rule for preachers, and directs them to a proper
          taste for pulpit eloquence. They ought to <i>understand </i>and
          <i>feel </i>the truths they explain and recommend, and this will
          greatly assist them to find out acceptable words, by which their
          hearers will be edified.

          It likewise directs hearers in the choice of their pastors. A voluble

          cannot expect to be fed with knowledge and understanding by one whose
          heart is not furnished with the truths of the Word and impressed with
          a deep sense of their importance.

        <p align="justify">
          The tongue of every wise man is governed and taught by his heart. God
          is our great Teacher, and he has directed us to be teachers to
          ourselves. "My thoughts," says David, "instruct me in the night." The
          heart, by its wise deliberations, must instruct and guide the members
          of the body, the eyes, the hands, the feet, and particularly the
          tongue, which is hardest to be taught of them all. The tongue of the
          just is as choice silver — when that of the wicked is little worth;
          and it is the heart that makes this mighty difference.

          Christians should accustom themselves to useful and pious
          communications. Our Lord, in the days of his humiliation, set us an
          example of entertaining one another with them at ordinary meals and
          social meetings. How greatly would our comfort and spiritual strength
          be increased by such holy converse! Such discourse is pleasant in the
          ears of God himself, and why should it not be pleasant to those who
          profess to be followers of God as dear children?

          One of the most dangerous of these classes of men that sow strife, is
          that of the <i>whisperers</i>. These men do not think fit to slander
          their neighbors openly — but <i>secretly defame </i>one man to
          another. They report their idle or false stories by way of
          <i>secrets</i>, and generally endeavor to procure credit by pretending
          to lament these faults which they tell with pleasure, and which they
          even <i>forge</i>, or at least make them a great deal worse by their
          spiteful manner of relating them.

          This kind of evil-speakers is like venomous serpents in the way, or
          adders in the path, which hiss and sting men when they are dreading no
          evil. Men may oppose open enemies, and ward off blows which they see —
          but how can a man guard himself from the invisible arrows that is shot
          by the whisperer, while he keeps himself concealed from view.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By these agents of the wicked one, irreparable breaches are often made
          in families and neighborhoods, and incurable jealousies excited among
          the dearest friends.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is our duty never to lend an ear to the whisperer, nor to believe
          anything bad of our friend and neighbor — unless the
          <i>cowardly backbiter </i>will venture to become an open accuser.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If our own characters are in any danger from these arrows that fly
          about in darkness, let us commit them to God, "Deliver my soul, O
          Lord, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue."

          The devil never did any good to any of his servants — and yet some of

          Such tempters to wickedness are to be abhorred as the greatest plagues
          of mankind! Thieves deprive us of our money, and murderers deprive us
          only of a short life — but these emissaries of Hell who would seduce
          us to sin, attempt to rob us of heavenly treasures, and to destroy our
          immortal souls! The Spirit of God warns us at great length, in the
          first chapter of this book, to avoid their snares.

          Whenever any man would seduce us into a way that is harmful, let us

        >The wicked takes so much delight in wickedness that he shuts his
        <i>eyes</i>, to meditate harm with an undisturbed mind, and vigorously
        employs the faculties which God has given him, in the service of his
        grand enemy. His <i>tongue </i>is a fire, a whole world of iniquity —
        but it has not enough of wickedness in the compass of its power to
        gratify his infernal thirst for sin, and therefore he speaks with his
        feet, and teaches with his fingers, and winks with his eye, to express
        the malignity of his heart, and give the signal to his companions in
        wickedness.
        <p align="justify">
          Strange that the sons of Adam should thus abandon themselves to
          wickedness, and serve sin with so much toil, when the wages of it is
          death. Men complain that the way to Heaven is full of difficulty and
          danger. But as broad as the way to Hell is, there are many who undergo
          much more fatigue in it than the way to Heaven requires — and they
          have not the comforts and joyful hopes to entertain them under their
          toil and sweat, that the travelers to Zion enjoy.

          not always wise, neither do the aged always understand judgment, and
          thus they forfeit that honor which they might otherwise expect.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Old age is an honor, and royalty is an honor — but better is a poor
          and wise <i>child</i>, than an old and foolish king who will no more
          be admonished. His self-conceit and intractable disposition, debase at
          once the luster of his crown, and the glory of his gray hair — but to
          be an <i>aged saint</i>, is an honor that entitles a man to the
          highest respect. None but fools will despise him for those
          infirmities, which are the inseparable attendants of gray hair.
        </p>

          How provoking to God such insolence is, may be learned from the story
          of the two she-bears that tore up forty-two children for saying to

          The honor bestowed by God upon old Christians in lengthening their
          days, the <i>experience </i>they have gained, and the
          <i> usefulness </i>of their former life — should engage us to pay them
          great respect. We honor those whose heads have been encircled with
          <i>crowns </i> by the hands of men — and will we refuse honor to those
          whom God himself has crowned with silver hair. It is a comfort to aged
          Christians to find due respect paid to them, and they should endeavor
          to secure this respect, by avoiding peevishness and covetousness,
          which are vices incident to this period of life, by bearing with young
          people, although they have not learned so much wisdom as themselves —
          by submitting with cheerfulness to the unavoidable weaknesses of age,
          by trusting in God, by showing the faithfulness of God and the
          advantages of religion to the rising generation, and by bringing forth
          the various <i>fruits </i>proper to that time of life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Young people should remember that old age is fast hastening to them —
          and show that regard to the aged, which they will then expect to meet
          with when old themselves. They ought to enter into the narrow way of
          righteousness, that they may be found in it by old age or death. If
          old age should find them in the broad way of sin — their situation is
          very dangerous, though not altogether desperate.

          controls his temper, than one who takes a city."</b
        >
        The meek obtain the noblest victories, and enjoy the happiest kind of
        authority. They have power over their <i>passions</i>, which are brought
        under the dominion of <i>reason</i> — and are not allowed to make such
        insurrections as those which disquiet the spirits of the proud and
        haughty.

        <p align="justify">
          The conquerors of nations and cities have been celebrated by
          historians and poets, and their valor and success dazzle the eyes of
          the generality of men; and yet few of them deserve praise. Seneca
          observes, that such heroes as Alexander the Great deserve the same
          kind of honors with wild beasts, and earthquakes, and pestilences, or
          any other instrument of desolation to mankind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some <i>conquerors </i>are nevertheless truly honorable, who have
          exposed their lives in <i>just and necessary wars</i>, for the service
          of their country and the suppression of tyranny. Gallant exploits of
          such true heroes, are celebrated in the inspired writings.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But he who is slow to anger and rules his passions deserves far higher
          praise, for he gains a nobler victory. Others conquer the bodies of
          men — but he conquers his own soul. The conquerors of nations fight
          with the arms of other men — but the meek have no soldier to deprive
          them of any part of their praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Most of the celebrated heroes conquered at the expense of their
          fellow-creatures, and spread horror and devastation around them like
          the tigers of the desert — but the meek of the earth are public
          blessings, and deserve the love of all men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Of earthly conquerors it may be said, that they have slain their
          thousands and ten thousands of men, by their swords and warlike
          artillery. But of the meek we may say, that they have put to flight
          armies of devils by the sword of the Spirit and the shield of faith;
          for these malignant spirits fight against our souls, to support the
          dominion of our <i> passions </i>over our <i>reason</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Other conquerors have their praise from men, and chiefly from men of
          foolish minds — for the wise look upon the generality of them as the
          <i>plagues </i>of the world. But those who are slow to anger have
          their praise from the unerring Judge, who exalts the meek to inherit
          the earth, while he looks upon the proud ravagers of nations with
          disdain, and spurns them into the dust.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The conquerors of cities and nations are wretched slaves to their own
          imperious passions, which forced Alexander to kill some of his best
          friends, and made him so unhappy, that he almost killed himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The meek enjoy the sweet and glorious liberty of the sons of God. The
          crowns of conquerors soon wither — but the honors of him who rules
          over his own spirit shall continue forever. Do we wish to enjoy honor
          and power? Let us fight against the corruptions of our own mind, with
          the armor of righteousness on our right hand and on our left.

        >Verse 28. The lot is cast into the lap — but the whole disposing
        thereof is of the Lord.
        <p align="justify">
          By <i>lots </i>men refer the determination of an event to that which
          in respect of men is purely chance, and comes not within the compass
          of men's knowledge or power — but it is wholly determined by the Lord,
          who does all things, great and small, according to the counsel of his
          on will.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A remarkable instance of this truth we have in the division of the
          promised land among the tribes of Israel, which was done by casting
          lots — but these lots were managed by divine providence in such a
          manner, that Jacob's predictions in blessing his children were exactly
          accomplished.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          For this reason, <i>lots </i>are not to be used by way of amusement —
          but in matters of importance worthy to be referred to the arbitration
          of God, and incapable of being otherwise decided to advantage.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This proverb teaches us that the things that fall out to our view by
          pure chance, are within the compass of Providence, which so entirely
          regulates everything, however inconsiderable, that not a sparrow falls
          to the ground, nor a hair from our head — without our heavenly Father.

          Time and chance happen to all men, and the most important events of

          The safety of the Jewish nation in the days of Esther, depended upon a

          the Lord Almighty, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in
          working, was their Savior and hope in the day of evil.

          prophets; for the things that are to come to pass, depend upon a very
          complicated chain of causes, consisting of innumerable links, which
          are quite out of the reach of our view and control. But every one of
