        <p align="justify">
          It is men's ordinary way to court the favor of princes and great men,
          as if their happiness depended on the smiles of kings — while they
          make little scruple of forfeiting the favor of God, by bending their
          consciences into a compliance with the humors of those for whom they
          entertain such undue respect. The like compliances are too often made,
          to avoid the displeasure of those who have power to hurt or kill the
          body.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon directs us not to forfeit the favor of princes, or incur their
          displeasure, by any needless or wanton instances of disrespect. At the
          same time, he instructs us in the first, place, to seek the favor of
          God, which is infinitely more necessary for us, than the friendship of
          the greatest men — and to avoid everything that may displease him,
          even if we should offend the mightiest tyrant in the world. For the
          favor of God is <i>all in all </i>to us, and his wrath is tremendous
          beyond all conception. While kings are entirely dependent on the King
          of kings, and have their hearts governed by him, in such a powerful,
          though invisible manner, that they must, whether they design it or
          not, execute his unchangeable counsels.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The currents of water may be directed into any channel that is cut out
          for them by the hands of men — even the mighty river Euphrates had its
          course changed by Cyrus, at the siege of Babylon. The waters still
          retained their nature and properties — and yet the power of that great
          prince managed their natural tendency to descend, in such a manner as
          to gain his purpose, and to take that great city, whereof they were
          reckoned the sure defense.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The like influence has God upon the hearts of kings. He does not
          destroy their natural faculties, nor take from them the freedom of
          their wills; and, what is still more astonishing — he leaves them for
          the most part under the power of those natural corruptions which
          dispose them to exalt themselves above God, and to oppose his will.
          Yet still he makes them <i>the instruments of his pleasure</i>, and
          the ministers of his providence.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Nebuchadnezzar</p></i>thought himself almost a
        God, and laid waste the Lord's land, and burnt his temple — and yet God
        calls him <i>his servant</i>, and used him to accomplish his work upon
        his people, as really as that noble king of Persia, Cyrus, whom he
        called <i>his shepherd </i>and <i>his anointed</i>, and employed in
        doing his pleasure upon Babylon, and delivering his captives.
        <p align="justify">
          Those that walk humbly before God, may behold the stern countenances
          of tyrants without trembling — for God can easily turn their hearts to
          favor those whom they hated.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The history of the three heroes in Babylon is a noble encouragement to
          all who are called to the like encounter for conscience sake. The fury
          of the king was raised to madness, his countenance was like a flame,
          and his fiery furnace burnt with a fierce rage — but when the king
          commanded them out of the furnace, and he almost adored those whom, a
          few moments before, he could have torn like a wild beast with his own
          teeth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is certain that God has often allowed kings to wade in the blood of
          his people. This is a strange providence — but we can understand the
          consistency of it, with the truth delivered in the text. If the heart
          of kings is in the hand of the Lord — then why does he allow them to
          use their power so frequently in opposition to the interests of his
          kingdom? This is a piece of the <i>mystery of providence</i>, which
          will be cleared up in due time — but appears dark to us at present.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Meanwhile, we must believe that God is righteous and holy in all that
          he does, and allows men to do. He has brought a rich revenue of praise
          to himself, out of the dark administrations of providence in former
          ages, and will in the end pour such light upon his ways, that he shall
          appear in all things to be wonderful in counsel, and excellent in
          working.

        <p align="justify">
          This is the same useful instruction which the wise man already gave
          us, and no admonition is more necessary to be inculcated than this:
          that men are too often flatterers of themselves, and ought to remember
          that they have an omniscient judge who will not be mocked nor imposed
          on — but searches their hearts, to give to every man according to his
          ways, and the inward disposition of his heart. The inspired writers of
          both testaments insist greatly on this point, and our Lord in his
          sermons frequently warned men against the dangerous influence of
          self-deceit.

          >"To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the LORD than
          sacrifice."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          It was a very common fault among the Jews, to lay too great a stress
          upon the performance of sacrifice, as if that could atone for their
          sins, and give them a title to transgress the moral law. The wise man
          warns them against that piece of self-deceit, in this verse. Solomon
          was far from under-valuing sacrifice as an institution of God, and a
          means of faith. No man ever offered a greater number of beasts to God,
          or did so much to encourage men in the observation of the ceremonial
          law — unless we may except the lawgiver himself. And perhaps the glory
          of the temple which he built, and the splendor of the temple service,
          might dazzle the eyes of men in his days, and occasion them to
          entertain too high an esteem of the ordinances that belonged to it. If
          any man had reason to say, "the temple of the Lord, the temple of the
          Lord" — Solomon had much more — but he learned otherwise from the
          Spirit who instructed him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sacrifices were appointed by God, they typified Christ, they were
          acceptable to God, as expressions of faith and obedience — but they
          were detestable to him when they were valued on their own account, as
          if they had been instituted for their own sake, or to give men
          opportunity of pleasing God so much as to procure an allowance for the
          neglect of more important service.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sacrifices were appointed for a single nation — judgment and justice
          are required from every nation, and from every man under Heaven.
          Sacrifices were required by a positive law, which depended on the
          sovereign will of God, not on the nature of God — and the observation
          of them was dispensed with on many occasions. But the justice is
          founded in the nature of God, obliges all men at all times, and can
          never be dispensed with. The law of sacrifices is long ago abolished —
          but the law of righteousness is an eternal statute. Sacrifices had no
          goodness in their own nature; and when men rested on them, they were
          abominable to God. Righteousness and justice are a part of the image
          of God in man, and have an everlasting excellency in their nature.
          Sacrifices typified Christ, and were set aside in consequence of his
          great atoning sacrifice — but justice is not abolished by faith in
          Christ. Nay, it is established, and shall continue when Heaven and
          earth are no more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If we would show ourselves to be Abraham's seed, we must keep the way
          of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice. It is a gross hypocrisy,
          it is a grievous dishonor to Christianity, and a ruin to the souls of
          men — to pretend religion, and observe the forms of divine service —
          and yet live in the neglect of those duties which we owe to our fellow
          men.

          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 21:4.</p></font
          >"Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the plowing of the wicked is sin."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          The state of wicked men is miserable beyond expression, for they are
          every day and every hour adding to their
          <i>treasury of guilt </i>which is already more than sufficient to sink
          them into the bottomless pit. They are impure before God in all the
          labors of their hand — and those works which are accepted at the hands
          of others, as instances of obedience to God, are reckoned to the
          wicked in the number of their sins. That a haughty look is abominable
          to God, is no surprise to us — for it is abominable even to men, and
          must be infinitely more abhorred by God. We do not wonder to hear that
          the proud heart is hateful to him, for he is the Searcher of hearts,
          and is jealous of his own honor, and cannot bear that men should exalt
          themselves into a rivalship with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But how the plowing of the wicked should be sin is not so plain,
          because they are commanded to plow, and severely reproved for the
          neglect of that work by which they ought to support themselves and
          their families. If they are plowing when they should be praying, or on
          Sabbath days, every man will see that they are sinning — but how can
          their ordinary plowing be sin, when we are told that plowing is a
          duty?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are required to do all
          to the glory of God. But the wicked man neither eats nor drinks, nor
          plows, nor sows, to the glory of God — and therefore he lives in a
          course of sin, even when he is employed in those actions that are most
          innocent or necessary. His soul is infected deeply with the venom of
          sin, which spreads itself over all his life. For to the unbelieving
          and impure, there is nothing holy. They are corrupt trees, and no
          fruit that grows upon them can be good. Their hands are defiled with
          sin, and their fingers with iniquity — and, therefore, everything they
          touch must be defiled by their impurity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What then must the wicked do? Must they leave off all work lest they
          should sin in doing it? By no means. Idleness would bring upon them
          far more guilt than the labor of their callings — for that is sinful
          in itself. Whereas plowing is sinful, only by means of their own
          impurity communicated to it. Their business is to get free of that
          plague of sin that spreads infection to everything they meddle with.
          Let them have recourse, like the leper, to Christ — that he may make
          them clean, and then being pure, everything will become pure to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some render these words thus: "The <i>lamp </i>or
          <i> prosperity </i>of the wicked is sin." Their prosperity is turned
          into a snare, and an occasion of sin to them by their wicked
          dispositions — which use it as an incentive to pride and impiety.
          Because their candle shines with brightness, they think it will never
          be put out, and think they stand in no need of the Sun of
          Righteousness to illuminate their souls. Wickedness is a most unhappy
          thing, for it perverts the objects that are most desirable in
          themselves — into means of sin and ruin.

          to poverty."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Is not the hasty man a diligent man? He is often busier than those who
          think before they act — and one would think that he must carry the
          prize of industry. Yet Solomon will not allow him a share of the
          praise that he bestows upon the diligent, because his activity is not
          under proper direction, and therefore cannot serve any good purpose.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          True diligence lies between laziness and hastiness — and is directed
          to its proper end by prudence and consideration. We must remember that
          we are rational creatures, and act as such both in our religious and
          civil affairs — and not allow ourselves to be hurried hither and
          thither, by the impulse of humor and passion — or to be pushed on in
          any enterprise, however commendable, without thinking of the means
          proper for obtaining success.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Saul</p></i>was in too great haste to make an end
        of the Philistines, and, therefore, he put the people that were fighting
        with him under a curse, if they should eat any meat until the sun went
        down — by which step the victory was hindered from being complete.
        <p align="justify">
          In common life, we see multitudes of people who make too much haste to
          be rich — and so make themselves poor, by plunging into a multiplicity
          of business, and bringing confusion and financial embarrassment into
          their affairs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A man, by <i>running </i>himself out of breath, weakens his strength,
          and is later in arriving at the end of his journey — than another man,
          who walks at leisure, and puts himself under no necessity of stopping.
          And a man who minds his business, and carries it on with a prudent
          activity, is in a fair way of being rich — when another man, who
          drives on post haste to get an estate, becomes a bankrupt.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Although <i>lukewarmness </i>in religion is a very detestable
          disposition — yet <i>rashness </i>is no less dangerous. No business of
          life requires so much thought and prudence. Many, under the impulse of
          a rash zeal, have run briskly, and soon stopped and turned aside.
          Young converts, when their <i>passions </i>were more deeply tinctured
          with religion than their <i>judgments</i>, have too often hurt their
          own comfort, and the cause of religion itself, by their indiscreet
          forwardness in displaying their attachment to it. Christ would not
          have any person to embrace his cause, without considering the cost of
          it.

        >
        <p align="justify">
          A lying tongue is an abomination to the Lord — and yet some will
          venture upon his displeasure, if they can make any profit by it. It
          must be confessed that some <i>present gain </i>may be made by lying —
          but then it answers no good purpose. Who would part with his
          sincerity, and the pleasure of a good conscience — for a little smoke,
          or for a handful of chaff? And all the treasures that can be made by a
          lying tongue, however great, are no better. They are vanities and lies
          that deceive the possessor, making him to believe that he is rich —
          when he is miserably poor. They are a vanity tossed to and fro, like
          chaff or smoke in the wind, which will soon be out of sight. For
          riches gotten by vanity are soon consumed into nothing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But this is not the worst of the matter. For the people that use such
          methods of obtaining riches, seek death. Although they abhor the
          thoughts of death — yet in the judgment of God they love and seek it,
          for they take a sure method of bringing <i>eternal </i>death upon
          themselves, if not a miserable death in this world. While others are
          <i> walking </i>towards the region of destruction, they are
          <i>running </i>to it post haste! They make haste to be rich — but
          greater haste to be damned, for neither their dishonesty nor their
          lies, will allow them to be admitted into the kingdom of God!

          It is impossible that the unrighteous should escape punishment, for
          they bring it upon themselves by the work of their own hands. Although
          there should be no magistrates to pass sentence upon them, or
          executioners to execute the sentence — yet their own violence will
          destroy them. Their sin, is the <i>seed </i>of misery — and it cannot
          fail of producing its proper <i>fruit</i>. They have none but
          themselves to blame for the vengeance to be poured out upon them.
          Their punishment comes forth from the Lord Almighty — but the cause is
          in themselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is their sin then unpardonable? No. The blood of Jesus can cleanse
          from all sin. Zaccheus the publican was probably an extortioner — but
          salvation came to his house. His sin was pardoned, and he was made to
          abhor it as much as ever he had loved it; and if he had taken anything
          from any man by iniquitous means — he resolved to restore fourfold —
          but this was a rare miracle of grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When men have entered upon a course of violence or injustice, they are
          seldom brought to repentance — for they are entangled in the snare of
          the devil, in such a manner that they seldom get out. Repentance
          brings with it restitution of what is gained by unrighteousness; and
          when men restore, they are obliged to confess to their shame, their
          former acts of unrighteousness, and sometimes to impoverish themselves
          and their families. These are terrible inconveniences, to which men,
          in general, will not submit — but the very thought of them is often
          sufficient to stifle all motions of their hearts towards anything that
          is good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They will rather run the risk of God's wrath — than think of exposing
          themselves to disgrace and poverty in this world! Thus they go on in
          sin, and violently suppress the remonstrances of conscience while they
          <i>live</i>. And when they <i>die</i>, they envy those grosser
          offenders who were condemned to the gallows, because the shame and
          punishment to which they were doomed, were effectual means of removing

          Beware of entering into this snare of the devil, if your hands are yet
          untainted by the pollution of filthy lucre — for they are mighty
          impediments to repentance for this sin. If you are entangled in these
          snares, remember that shame and poverty at present, are but
          <i>painted misery </i>in comparison of Hell fire. Fly to Christ's
          atoning blood — which purged away the sins of the great transgressors
          at Corinth. Repent, restore, shake your hands free of unrighteous
          gains. For while you hold them fast, you are exposed to the
          destruction threatened in the Word of God, because your hands refuse
          to do what is right.

        <p align="justify">
          The way of man is devious. Is the way of <i>every </i>man devious? Or
          may we contrast the way of man in general — with the conduct of the
          upright? Are not men justly distinguished into the deceitful and the
          upright? Why then does Solomon speak as if all men were deceitful?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is certainly truth in the division of men into the pure and
          impure — but this distinction is the work of <i>grace </i>and not of
          nature — for men are all sprung from the first transgressor, and have
          derived a corrupt disposition from him, and until they are renewed by
          the grace of God, their way is deceitful. They are all together become
          corrupt, and have done abominable things — if we may believe the
          testimony of the omniscient God himself.

          In our state of innocence, our way was straight and even, while the
          <i>glory </i>of God was our great end, and the <i>will </i>of God was
          the rule of our practice. But in our fallen state, we all walk in a
          crooked and perverse way, following the bent of our own evil
          inclinations, and seeking after happiness in creatures, which are like
          <i>broken cisterns </i>that can hold no water. Our course of life is
          directly the reverse of what it ought to be, for instead of making the
          will of our Creator the rule of our behavior — we make it our business
          to provoke him to anger continually, by trampling upon his authority
          and despising his laws.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our way is a <i>strange </i>way, being a course of estrangement from

          Until we are restored to communion with God through the mediation of

          But as for the pure, he is raised above other men, and his work is

          directed to the noblest end — for his constant endeavor is to cleanse
          his way by taking heed thereto according to the Word of God, and to

          <i> saints</i>. While we are following the course of this world, we
          are walking in the broad road that leads to destruction — and not in
          the narrow way that leads unto life. Let every man prove his own work
          — but it must not be tried by the maxims or example of the world — but
          by the Word of God, by which God will judge us at the last day.

          A man might live on a roof, if it were flat like the houses of the
          ancient Israelites — but it would be a very uncomfortable place of
          dwelling, because it is exposed to rain and wind, to frost, and snow,
          and lightning. But as the <i>least </i>of two evils is to be chosen —
          a wise man would rather choose to dwell on a house-top, and be
          confined to a single corner of it — than to have his ears tormented,
          and his spirits crushed, with the endless brawls of a peevish and
          quarrelsome wife.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A man on a house-top would have at least some intervals of comfortable
          weather — but a quarrelsome woman will never lack something to make
          her uneasy to herself, and a torment to those who have the misfortune
          to be connected with her. She is perpetually vexing her children and
          servants — but her husband is most to be pitied, because she is of one
          flesh with him. She may be a scourge in the side of others in the
          family — but she is rottenness in her husband's bones. She is the
          greatest plague to him to whom she is bound by every obligation to be
          the greatest pleasure. She is one flesh with him — and yet she is a
          constant grief to his heart. She torments herself most of all, and,
          next to herself, all others in proportion to the obligation she lies
          under to behave in the very opposite manner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God said that it is not good for man to be alone, and therefore made
          woman to be a help-meet for him — and yet the contentious wife is such
          a perverse creature, that she perverts the design of our Creator, and
          proves a <i>scourge </i>instead of an help. She makes it better for a
          man to be in the most solitary circumstances imaginable, than with
          her.

        <p align="justify">
          Those who choose a wife for her wealth, rather than the sweetness of

          place, that it is much better to live alone in the deepest poverty —
          than to enjoy affluence with a quarrelsome and peevish woman.

          >"The wicked man craves evil; his neighbor gets no mercy from him."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          The difference between evil and godly men, does not lie in complete
          freedom from what is evil on the side of godly men. Paul was one of
          the best men that ever lived — and yet he confesses that he had not
          obtained perfection in goodness — but found evil present with him,
          when he was most inclined to do good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But herein lies that goodness which the saints attain in this life —
          that they love what is good with an ardent affection, and hate that
          which is evil with their whole soul, although they cannot do all that
          good they wish to do, and too often do that evil which they hate.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          On the contrary, wicked men are not only doers of iniquity — but their
          souls are fully inclined to it. With their souls they crave evil; and
          although their consciences frequently remonstrate against sin, and are
          a strong bridle upon the lusts of most unregenerate people — yet sin
          dwells as a <i>king </i>in their inner man, and is not resisted with
          hatred like a tyrant — but is allowed to possess the throne of the
          heart. This is a miserable disposition, for sin is the worst of all
          evils. No man expressly and directly desires misery — and yet all who
          love sin desire the worst of misery in reality — for sin is the
          sickness, the death, the ruin of the soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The desire of all unrenewed men is towards evil, and not one of them
          would think himself happy, if he were not allowed to enjoy the
          pleasures of some sin. Yet their relishes for these
          <i>cursed pleasures </i> are very different, and the desires of evil
          in some are stronger than in others. There are many who have some
          regard to the voice of conscience, and the great principles of
          morality — and many others that push on in their pursuit of the
          pleasures that suit their vitiated taste, in spite of their own
          consciences.

        <p align="justify">
          Saul persecuted David, although he had been the champion of Israel,

          over his conscience and feelings, and he pursued the gratification of
          his malice with unrelenting fury. This is the tendency of sin — to
          sink a man deep in the abominable gulf of self-love, and to harden his
          spirit against those whom he ought to love most tenderly.

          Let us therefore choose our friends from the number of those who love

          Those are wicked people, who are so entirely swallowed up by a selfish

          men, let us show it by doing good. Our neighbors and friends have a
          special title to expect good at our hands.

          It is a bad thing in a family, or church, or nation, when
          <i>mockers </i>are not duly corrected or punished. It was a sign that
          the inhabitants of Laish were a ready prey for any invader — when
          there was no magistrate in the land to punish them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who are too unwise to see the evil of sin, have sense enough to
          see the evil of shame and pain; and when they behold these
          disagreeable consequences following sin, their dispositions to
          wickedness receive a check, to their own great advantage, as well as
          the good of the society to which they belong. If the fear of censure
          or punishment does not make men <i>holy</i> — it will make them
          <i>sober</i>; and this is a good thing in itself, and puts men in a
          fair way to become still better, by leading men to the means whereby
          holiness is ordinarily produced.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The wise who do not expose themselves to punishment, are not beyond
          the need of instruction, and sometimes of admonition and rebuke. David
          was one of the best of men — but he was not faultless in his behavior,
          and we find what happy effect <i>instruction </i>and <i>rebuke </i>had
          upon his soul. He improved in knowledge and grace, by the
          ministrations of the sanctuary, and the rebukes of the prophets.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A rebuke enters more into a wise man, than an hundred stripes into a
          fool. Even the simple man receives knowledge from the instructions and
          rebukes which are given to the wise. He is so foolish, that an attempt
          to instruct himself awakens his jealousy and anger. He thinks you know
          him, or take him for a fool, when you begin to instruct or admonish
          him. But when he sees that the wise are instructed, and are thankful
          for it — then he is forced to see his own stupidity, and his
          conscience tells him, "If the men that are so much wiser and better
          than I can pretend to be, are so thankful for instruction — then
          surely I have much greater need of it! The rebukes that are
          administered to them, ought to enter ten times deeper into my heart,
          who deserve them so much better."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The simple begins to learn wisdom, when he applies to his own case
          that which is said or done to other men.

          overthrows the wicked for their wickedness."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          We have a clear illustration of this truth in the conversations
          between Job and his three friends, all of whom had considered the
          house of the wicked, and God's providence in overthrowing it — but
          with very different degrees of wisdom. Eliphaz had considered the
          sudden overthrow of the wicked man, and the unhappy end of his
          prosperity — and from thence inferred the justice of God, the danger
          of sin, and the necessity of repentance to sinners. His two friends
          joined with him in opinion; and we have no reason to doubt that they
          had received great benefit from the observations which they made upon
          the providence of God, to the wicked in their own days, as well as in
          ancient times. For they had taken advantage of the wisdom of the
          ancients, and of the histories which had been handed down to them, to
          increase their own stock of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Job had considered the house of the wicked with more wisdom, and
          learned much instruction from the providence of God concerning it. He
          had observed so many instances of the downfall of prosperous
          transgressors, that he saw wickedness to be a very dangerous thing,
          however prosperous it might be for a time — and therefore he abhorred
          the counsel of the wicked. At the same time he observed, and
          understood from the reports of travelers, that some wicked men lived
          and died in affluence, and were buried with great pomp, and had
          stately monuments erected for them. From thence he justly inferred
          that the wicked were reserved to a future day of wrath, and defended
          his own character against his friends, with solid arguments drawn from
          the unequal distributions of providence in this world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a great point of wisdom to learn instruction from the calamities
          that befall the wicked, or have befallen them in former times. By this
          means we may render all the histories of past ages very beneficial to
          ourselves. We find that the destruction of the old world by the flood,
          and the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah — were means of impressing the
          mind of Eliphaz with an abhorrence of sin. And the prophet Ezekiel
          severely censures the Jews in his time, because they had not taken
          warning by the fate of Sodom and Israel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is not safe for us to pronounce men wicked merely because they are
          overthrown — but when God makes his judgments upon sinners manifest,
          it is our duty to observe it, and to glorify and fear God. And
          although we have no reason to think that those who meet with signal
          calamities are worse than other men, unless we have good evidence of
          it — yet their calamities are loud warnings, and calls to repentance.

        <p align="justify">
          There may be a very good excuse for not giving to the poor — but
          insensibility to their extreme distress is an unnatural and a crying
          iniquity. Our <i>eyes </i>and <i>ears </i>are organs fitted by nature
          for working upon the <i>heart</i>, and exciting affections of
          compassion in us. And if we do not regard the cry of the poor with
          sympathy, we put a force upon nature by stopping our ears. When
          Eliphaz meant to convince Job that his transgression was great, he
          charges this among other horrid crimes upon him, that he had not given
          water to the weary to drink, and had withheld bread from the hungry.
          But Job was innocent, and could with a good conscience declare that he
          never withheld the poor from their desire, nor caused the eye of the
          widow to fail.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who are hard-hearted to the distressed, should remember that
          they cannot make a covenant with death, nor hinder the scourge of
          distress from reaching themselves. They also shall cry — for the days
          of distress will come upon them; and while they show no pity to the
          poor, they harden the spirits of men against pity to themselves, and
          provoke God to leave them to fall without support.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If we should never fall into distress that needs relief at the hand of
          our fellow creatures — then it is certain that we need help from God
          to our souls, and although we feel not our need of his pity at
          present, the day is coming when we shall feel it at our hearts, and
          cry out for mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our poor fellow creatures need a few pence from us — but we need great
          mercy at the hand of God. And when we disobey his voice, and refuse to
          show mercy unto men — we have just reason to fear that we shall have
          judgment without mercy to ourselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God is a most gracious God. He delights in the voice of prayer, and
          continually answers those requests that believers present unto him in
          the name of his Son — but he has not bound himself to hear those cries
          which <i>necessity </i>extorts from the <i>wicked</i>. This is a part
          of the extreme misery of those who refuse to hear the cries of wisdom
          — that they shall cry out in their time of calamity, and he will not
          hear them. The same punishment is here threatened to those who will
          not hear the cries of the poor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What extreme wretchedness is this — to cry and not be heard by a most
          merciful God! How provoking is the sin which is so severely
          threatened! When David's enemies cried unto the Lord, and were not
          heard — it was plain that they were doomed to irremediable misery.
          This is the height of the misery of the damned — that their cries are
          not regarded with pity by God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This truth need not however discourage us from presenting the prayers
          of faith to the throne of grace. For the prayers here spoken of, are
          only the cries of strong distress <i>extorted </i>from men that have
          not the love of God, or the love of Christ in them. It is rather an
          encouragement to pray. For it shows us that the refusing of prayer is
          God's <i>strange </i>work, and a piece of his severity to great
          sinners who are destitute of compassion to their fellow men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When we have reason to complain that we cry and shout — but God shuts
          out our prayer — let us consider our ways. Perhaps we have shut our
          ears on some occasions against the cries of the poor. This was one
          reason why God accepted not the prayers and fasts of those people whom
          Isaiah speaks of in the 50th chapter of his book.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The poor may see in this threatening, great encouragement to
          themselves to apply to his throne of mercy. He who condemns
          uncharitableness so much in others — is full of love and pity, and
          listens with a gracious ear to the sighs and groans of the poor and
          destitute.

          cloak pacifies great wrath."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Anger is a very outrageous passion, and strong wrath makes a man like
          a savage beast, which attacks in its fury, any creature that comes in
          its way. Yet such is the power of money and gifts, that the fiercest
          rage is assuaged by them. And therefore when a good conscience allows,
          it is often a piece of prudence to disarm an enemy by gifts, rather
          than to fight with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By such means did Jacob and Abigail secure themselves from those
          enemies that threatened them with destruction. But to give, or to
          receive <i>bribes</i>, is a very sinful thing, because it is a
          perversion of justice. For ministers to receive gifts to soften their
          severity in censuring offenders (if such unfaithful ministers can be
          found) — is one of the worst instances of corruption.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Although men are generally fond of receiving — yet they are as
          generally unwilling to be reckoned fond of gifts. Therefore those who
          have the art of giving will do it in secret, and avoid every
          appearance of ostentation in themselves, and everything that might
          cause a blush in the receivers of their gifts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If the love of gifts is so universal and so powerful in the hearts of
          men, we ought to try our own hearts, how far we are influenced by it,
          or whether we believe our Savior's words, that it is more blessed to
          give than to receive.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Take heed, says our Lord, and beware of <i>covetousness</i>. We must
          keep a double guard against this sin, because it is so
          <i>natural </i>to us — and yet so <i>dangerous</i>. Those who receive
          gifts should take heed to themselves lest they receive a bribe under
          the gloss of a gratuity. What is given in such a manner as to shun the
          light, deserves to be suspected.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Have gifts such a powerful influence to disarm resentment? Then let no
          man plead, in apology for the fury of his passions, that he is not
          able to conquer them. If <i>money </i>can conquer them — then shall
          <i>reason</i>, and the fear of God, and the command of Christ, be too
          weak to bridle them? Surely the commandments of our God and Savior
          have too little authority with us, if they have less influence upon
          our spirits than gold and jewels have upon the spirits of almost all
          men.

          Men that are utterly unacquainted with the spirit of religion, and
          view it only at a distance, form very false and harmful notions, and
          are affrighted from it with much the same reason that children are
          afraid to walk in the dark. They imagination that religion is a dull
          and melancholy thing, and that it affords and allows no pleasure to
          saints, at least while their present life continues — but the wise man
          here tells us, that the very doing of what is right is a part of its
          own reward, bringing with it an heart-felt satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Love is the soul of our obedience; and a well-regulated love is a
          delightful passion, communicating pleasure to all the toils and
          dangers that are endured for its sake. Jacob endured the sultry heats,
          and chilling frosts, for seven years, with great pleasure, for the
          love he had to Rachel. And the holy love of Christians will dispose
          them with greater joy to encounter the assaults of the tempter, to
          mortify the deeds of the flesh, to strive against sin, and to continue
          resolute in piety — notwithstanding of all the discouragements which
          often attend it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The joy of the saints in doing justice is not complete in this world,
          because the flesh which remains in them lusts against the spirit — yet
          it vastly exceeds in purity and vigor the highest joys of the wicked.
          <i

        <p align="justify">
          This sentence is a mark by which we ought to try ourselves. Many do
          justice without taking pleasure in it; their consciences will not
          allow them to do otherwise — but their hearts are on the side of sin.
          Or they will do many good things with pleasure, because their
          constitutional and beloved sins are not affected by them. But there
          are other things at which, like King Herod, they stop short, because
          they will rather risk damnation, than part unreservedly with the
          pleasures of sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the just man takes pleasure in the way of God's testimonies,
          without any exception to particular steps of it, as far as it is known
          to him. He cheerfully obeys the commandments of God which he loves,
          and in his measure he resembles Christ, whose food and drink it was to
          do his Father's will. Nor is his love of the commandments confined to
          the first table of the law. It is as much his joy to pay his debtor,
          as to receive payment of what is owing to himself; and to bestow
          charity on the poor, as to receive a present from some rich friend.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The wicked have an aversion to justice. Perhaps they are not immoral
          in their conduct — but it is no pleasure to them to render unto God
          his due; and they say of his service, "Oh! what a weariness it is!"
          Their religion is but a dull lifeless form. But there is some iniquity
          which is relished as honey by them, and drunk greedily as water. But
          that sin which is sweet in their mouth is bitter in their belly, and
          shall be found more deadly than poison! For destruction shall be to
          the workers of iniquity.

          The way of holiness is the way of understanding. All those who do
          God's commandments have a good understanding — and all besides are
          fools. While men wander in the forbidden paths of sin, they are dead
          while they live, and are sinking themselves deeper and deeper into the
          dungeon of misery!

          But of all the wanderers in the ways of sin, those are in the most
          dangerous condition who were once to <i>appearance </i>walking in the
          ways of understanding, and have now turned aside into the ways of
          darkness. It had been better for them never to have known the ways of
          righteousness, for they bring great reproach upon the ways of God, and
          behave as if they had found iniquity in the Holy One. They sin against
          convictions and vows; they prejudice multitudes against the way of
          truth; and bring the blood of many souls upon their own heads. They
          harden their hearts against God, and if their consciences are ever
          again awakened, they are in danger of sinking into the hideous gulf of
          despair!

          Although <i>apostasy </i>is not in itself an unpardonable sin — yet it
          is sometimes an introduction to it, and never fails to render
          repentance extremely difficult, and almost impossible. These unhappy
          wanderers once ranked themselves, and were ranked by their neighbors,
          among the living in Jerusalem — but they were no better than stalking
          ghosts — they belong to the congregation of the dead. Without
          astonishing exertions of omnipotent grace — they must forever remain
          among that wretched crew.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who walk in the light must die — but their death is an entrance
          into a better life — or it cannot dissolve their blessed connection
          with the Lord of life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But those who wander out of the way of understanding, are twice dead,
          they are like trees plucked up by the roots. Death will be the king of
          terrors to them, because it opens their passage into the lake of fire
          and brimstone, which is the second death.

          Consider, you straying sinners, the greatness of your guilt and

          but fly to him without delay, before the fierce anger of the Lord

          Pleasure is not to be absolutely renounced. The truly pious man finds
          more pleasure, even in his earthly enjoyments, than the happiest
          sensualist — but pleasure must not be loved as our
          <i>chief </i> happiness. Our hearts must be given to God, and nothing
          earthly must be allowed to usurp <i>his throne </i>in our souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is no hardship imposed on us, to be forbidden the love of pleasure,
          for the sensualist by his love to the delights of the flesh, undoes
          everything that is dear to him. He not only wounds his soul — but
          harms his health, and wastes his estate. If he is rich, he makes
          himself poor. If he is poor, he reduces himself to beggary, and
          perhaps to a prison.

          We see every day instances of the truth of this proverb, in men who

          of pleasure. Gluttons, and drunkards, and revelers, are fools for this
          world, as well as the world to come. They exhaust, by their
          intemperance, the very source of their pleasures — and after
          contracting by habit an unconquerable desire after wine, and other
          objects of a sensual taste, they are reduced to a lack, not only of
          the <i>luxuries</i> — but even of the <i> necessities </i>of life.

          Let us therefore, if we wish to be happy, follow the Apostle's rule:

          and will in due time make it to appear that they are gold and jewels
          in his eyes, and that he puts away the wicked of the earth like dross.
          God's people need not despair when they are in trouble and see no
          likely way of getting out of it. God can see methods of relief — when

          Israel in Egypt was brought very low, and their oppressors were too

          pursuit of their enemies. But their Redeemer was wise and mighty, and
          gave Egypt for them. By the plagues of Egypt, their release was
          accomplished — and by the drowning of Pharaoh and his army, they were
          preserved from their pursuers.

          But God's people must walk uprightly, if they wish to enjoy the

          cost. Jonah for his flight from the presence of the Lord, was made a
          ransom for the heathen sailors that were with him in the ship. Those

        <p align="justify">
          Contention and anger commonly go together, and they kindle a flame
          that can scarcely be extinguished. The wise man has already told us,
          that it is better to dwell in an ill-thatched house, or even on a
          corner of the house-top, without any covering from the storm — than
          with a contentious woman. But here he goes further, and says that it
          is better to dwell in the <i>wilderness</i>, than with a contentious
          and angry woman. The wilderness would make a very bad habitation,
          because there are the lion's dens, and the habitation of jackels — so
          that a dweller in the desert would be not only destitute of every
          convenience — but exposed to constant perils of his life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yet it would be a more desirable habitation, than a costly house with
          the company of a woman who was tormenting her husband with everlasting
          contentions. The contentious woman is a greater monster than the tiger
          of the desert, and her tongue is more noisome than the tongue of the
          viper!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A contentious woman is not worse than a tyrannizing husband. A man may
          more easily make his escape from the presence of a scold — than a
          woman from the face of a brutal tyrant. The delicacy of her mind makes
          her more susceptible of melancholy impressions from bad usage, than
          men ordinarily are.

        <p align="justify">
          When a husband and wife find the marriage yoke sweetened by love and
          peace, they should bless God for the happiness they find in each
          other's society. Their pleasures are the most delightful which this
          world can afford, and they are indebted for them to that
          <i>kind providence </i> which has made them one flesh and one soul.

          Works of charity are requisite — but don't imagine that they will make
          you poor. Christ commands us not to lay up treasures on earth — but to
          lay up treasures that never decay, nor become a prey to thieves. But
          he does not require us to give <i>everything </i>away to the poor — on
          the contrary, he insinuates that a prudent householder has in his
          treasure, things new and old. We must give alms of all that we possess
          — but we are not called to give all that we possess in alms. That
          would be at once to drain up the fountain of beneficence, and preclude
          ourselves from doing good, as we see occasion, through the remaining
          part of our lives. Solomon directs us to be liberal in charitable
          distributions — and yet he tells us in this place, that the wise have
          a desirable treasure, not only of the <i> necessities</i> — but
          likewise of the <i>comforts </i>and <i>conveniences </i>of life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Charity dispensed with wisdom, will not hurt but improve a man's
          estate. Was there ever a more liberal man than <i>Job</i> — and yet he
          was the richest of all the men in the east. <i>Abraham </i>abounded in
          hospitality, and he abounded no less in flocks and herds. It seems a
          riddle — and yet it is a certain truth, that expenses and losses on
          God's account are real gains.

        <p align="justify">
          Poverty is often the lot of the wise and pious — but it is not the
          native consequence of piety. Industry, and temperance, and frugality,
          are recommended by religion — and these are natural means of plenty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Above all, godliness has the promise of the life that now is, and
          therefore it must be a great error to imagine that worldly prosperity
          is inconsistent with the grace of God. For God delights in the
          prosperity of his servants — and if he does not smile upon their
          outward estate, it is because his love is directed by infinite
          knowledge, which sees a different condition to be, for the present,
          more conducive to their best interests.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But if the godly man has not a treasure of the good things of this
          world in his house, he possesses a large treasure for himself and his
          family in the promises of God. A man is not poor, although he has no
          money in his pocket — if he has plenty in the bank. The Christian may
          lack everything that glitters in the eye of flesh — but he has rich
          treasures laid up in Heaven, and the written Word of God is his
          security.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But a foolish man spends and devours the substance of his family. His
          wealth is consumed by <i>idleness </i>or <i>extravagance</i>, or by
          the blasting curse of God. Or if he is still rich in possession, he
          does not hold it by a sure tenure.

          This world is not the place of perfection. The best Christians must
          confess their daily failings — but their <i>desires </i>for holiness
          are sincere, and accompanied with vigorous endeavors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Slothful professors have some cold desires after holiness, and
          sometimes their desires are accompanied with endeavors — but these are
          weak and ineffectual. Or however ardent they may appear to be — yet
          they soon spend their force, and all their goodness is like the
          morning cloud and the early dew.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Christians that deserve the name, are like Caleb and Joshua — of
          another spirit — for their endeavor is to follow the Lord fully. They
          are followers of the Lamb wherever he goes — and whatever it may cost
          them. The grace of the gospel teaches us, not only to live godly — but
          to follow righteousness and mercy, and these two virtues cannot be
          separated in practice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To be <i>righteous</i>, is to render unto every man his due. Now
          <i>love </i>is a debt we owe to every man, and <i>mercy </i>is due to
          the miserable. The great rule of righteousness is to do to others, as
          we would wish to be dealt with, if we were in their circumstances. And
          certainly we all wish to enjoy kindness and pity from our neighbors,
          as circumstances require.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>righteous</i>, says David, shows <i>mercy</i>, and gives. And
          in another place he says that the righteousness of the merciful man
          endures forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is in the strength of Christ, that we must follow after
          righteousness and mercy. As his <i>righteousness </i>is the ground of
          our hopes — his <i>grace </i>is the fountain of our supplies. He is
          the vine, and unless we are branches engrafted into this vine — our
          fruits will be bad.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Love and faithfulness are mentioned among the fruits of his Spirit,
          and those who have not his Spirit are sensual and selfish, and bring
          forth fruit only to themselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Men think they will be losers, by following righteousness and mercy
          with too much eagerness — but the Scripture assures us that they shall
          be great gainers. They may suffer <i>present </i>loss — but their
          <i> eternal </i>gains will be infinitely greater. They shall find
          life, and life is the foundation of every enjoyment. What is sweeter
          than life?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And yet the life of most men is but a vain shadow and an empty dream —
          but that life which comes from the special favor of God, and is
          secured by divine promise, must be a pleasant and happy life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some have lost their life for the sake of righteousness — but Christ
          assures us that their loss was unspeakable gain. They shall find
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          For as those who love cursing — they shall have cursing poured into
          them like water, and like oil into their bones. Just so, those who
          love righteousness shall meet with righteous dealing from men, and the
          righteous God will take care of their interests, and fulfill his
          faithful promises to them. The justice of God is engaged on their
          side, through the mediation of Christ, and he cannot be unrighteous,
          to forget their works and labors of love.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They shall find honor, for their upright and generous behavior is very
          likely to procure to them honor from men. If fools should despise
          them, they will be respected by the wise and godly. If all men should
          despise them and cast out their names as evil — they are precious and
          honorable in the eyes of the Lord. They shall at last be dignified
          with a place at Christ's right hand, with approbation from their
          judge, and with an eternal crown!

          This divine wisdom even in war has a vast superiority over the wisdom
          of generals and ministers of state, for it leads men to victory,
          because it teaches them to trust in the Lord Almighty. By this wisdom,
          <i>Abraham </i> conquered four kings when they were flushed with
          victory. By this wisdom, <i> David</i> the stripling, overcame lions,
          and bears, and giants. By this wisdom, many of the old believers waxed
          valiant in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the aliens — for
          they knew their God, and were strong, and did exploits. By this wisdom
          the weakest believer is victorious through the blood of the Lamb, and
          the word of his testimony — over the dragon and his demons.

          Solomon has already said enough to banish sloth out of the world — if
          those who are under the power of this vice were not besotted with it.
          But here he tells us a worse thing about it than in any of his former
          proverbs, for he represents it as a degree of self-murder. The
          slothful man brings diseases upon himself, by reducing himself to lack
          of the necessities of life — for he will not labor for his food, nor
          take that exercise which prepares the body for quiet rest. But besides
          this, his very desires are hurtful to his constitution, for his mind
          must be employed, when his hands are idle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His needs, and the time that lies heavy upon him, are strong
          incitements to those insatiable cravings of desire which rack the
          heart and have a sickening influence upon the body. If the desire
          accomplished is a tree of life — then those desires that cannot be
          accomplished, must have the quite opposite effect. If hope deferred
          make the heart sick — then how cruelly must it be tortured by those
          insatiable desires that are not sweetened by any mixture of hope.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What is the reason that the slothful man's desires have such a
          pernicious influence upon him? His hands refuse to labor. If you bid
          him go and work, he will perhaps promise to do it, like that son who
          said to his father, "I will go, sir," to work in the vineyard. He is
          sensible of the necessity of it, he wishes earnestly to enjoy the
          fruits of labor, he has even some faint wishes that his hands would
          submit to the toil of labor — but the loss is that his hands will not
          comply, because they must be taken out of his bosom if they work. If
          he could work with his <i>tongue</i>, without his hands, he would be a
          very industrious man — but he hates work because it does not consist
          in talking or sauntering about.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Slothfulness is very harmful to the soul, as well as the body. The
          deep sleep into which slothfulness casts a man, is the nurse of the
          body of sin. The sluggard covets — he covets greedily; greedy
          covetings are his constant employment. Although he will not work for
          necessities, he could not be happy without the luxuries of life. Those
          greedy workings of covetous desire, are a strong temptation to him to
          pilfer and steal, and sometimes they push him on to those crimes that
          procure the gallows.

        <p align="justify">
          Wicked men disappoint themselves by their sins, of that wished-for
          enjoyment, which they seek and hope to obtain by their iniquities. The
          <i>sensualist </i>deprives himself not only of pleasures — but of
          necessities, by casting away that money that should procure them. The
          <i>vain </i>and <i>proud </i>bring infamy upon their name, by the very
          means they take to support their honor. And <i>slothful </i>men, while
          they seek rest and ease, endure much more fatigue than the diligent
          man, because they make themselves a prey to the restless workings of
          their own unbridled desires.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the <i>righteous </i>give without sparing. He does not say the
          <i>diligent </i>man gives. For all wicked and selfish men are not
          slothful. Some men toil hard, not from any regard to God's authority —
          but entirely for their own interest. They do not glorify God in their
          labors, for they do not work that they may have something to give to
          him who needs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The righteous man is of a nobler spirit, for he is ever merciful, and
          his mercy is one motive to his industry. He labors in his calling, and
          the blessing of God gives him success, and he shows his thankfulness
          to God, by giving with an unsparing hand. The slothful man covets the
          fruit of other people's labors — but the godly man does not wish to
          eat that morsel alone, which is procured by his own sweat and toil.
          God is well pleased with his bounties, for he is a cheerful and
          liberal giver.

          although it is presented with the very best dispositions that a wicked
          man is capable of. Some unregenerate men are anxious for eternal life
          — because they cannot always live on earth. Some of them have a great
          deal of seriousness in their devotions, and will even worship God in
          the exercise of tempers of mind that have some resemblance of love to
          God, and faith in Christ. Will not such service be accepted of God?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By no means! Our great teacher tells us to make first the tree good,
          and then the fruit will be good. For a corrupt tree, at the best,
          produces corrupt fruit. It must, therefore, be a very foolish thing,
          for men to dream of preparing themselves for Heaven by a course of
          serious devotions — before they will venture to commit the salvation
          of their souls into Christ's hands. Without his grace, we can have no
          good dispositions, nor do anything which is acceptable to God — for it
          is only <i>in the Beloved</i>, that we are accepted.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What then must wicked men do? Must they be driven to despair? or must
          they give up performing duty? No. It is certain that without faith it
          is impossible to please God — but it is equally certain, that they are
          fully warranted to believe in Jesus. Let them make a thankful use of
          this privilege, and from henceforth do all that they do, in word or in
          deed, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

          If the sacrifice of the wicked at the very best is detestable to God —

          they can prevail on God by the multitude of their holy services, to
          dispense with sin, and allow them to escape unpunished — although they
          still live in the practice of injustice towards men, and in the
          neglect of several necessary duties which they owe to God.

          It is no less presumptuous for men to be diligent in the practice of

          Lord so frequently reproved in the Pharisees, and this fault is still
          too common among the professors of religion. It will be a comfortable
          evidence that we are not under the reigning power of it, if we are as
          conscientious in the <i>secret </i>performances of religion, as in

          Nothing can be more detestable, than to cover vice with professions of

          sin, and to practice the forms of duty — that their character may be
          shrouded under the mask of piety. These are followers of the Scribes
          and Pharisees, against whom our Lord pronounced so many dreadful woes.
          They walk in the cursed way of Jezebel, who caused a feast to be
          proclaimed, that she might destroy an innocent man — and yet keep up
          the forms of religion and law; and they are likely to perish in the

          crime deserves from men — then God says he shall perish, and his
          threatenings are not wind and vanity.

          For lying lips are but for a moment — but the lip of truth shall be
          established forever. Therefore, putting away lying, let us speak truth
          every man to his neighbor, especially in witness-bearing. If the
          commandment of God, and the mighty motives of his gospel, will not
          induce us to do so — then let us regard our own honor and interest,
          which suffer irreparable injury by every deviation from truth.

          >"A wicked man puts up a bold front, but an upright man gives thought
          to his ways."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          The wicked man walks in a crooked path, where peace and happiness
          never were, nor shall ever be found. God calls upon him to leave this
          cursed way, and to turn into the straight way of life. He thunders in
          the curses of his law, and orders his ministers to lift up their
          voices like trumpets, to proclaim in his ears the dangers of his
          course. He deals with him by his providence, and makes him to feel
          some of the first fruits of that vengeance which is the fruit of sin.
          He sets before him the peace and pleasure to be found in the way of
          holiness, that he may be encouraged to leave the way of destruction —
          but the perverse sinner disregards the voice and providence of the
          Lord. The ways of sin are so pleasant to him, that he will venture the
          consequences, rather than be turned out of them for the present. The
          wicked man has many devices to harden his face in his sinful course.
          He thinks that he only walks in the same paths as other men do, and
          many are much worse than himself. He thinks that he has time enough
          before him, to repent and serve God. He does many good things to
          overbalance his evil deeds, or he will make amends for all at once, by
          fleeing to the mercy of God at last. By such corrupt reasonings as
          these, he hardens himself in iniquity, and sets God at defiance,
          disregarding the terrors of his wrath, and trampling upon the grace
          and blood of the Redeemer, who came to turn ungodliness from Jacob. By
          degrees he contracts so powerful habits of sin, that his conversion is
          almost impossible; he casts off shame and fear, and sins without
          restraint, until he finds that there is <i>justice </i>and
          <i> vengeance</i>, as well as <i>forbearance </i>with God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the upright man directs and establishes his way. He may slip with
          his feet — but he recovers himself by the aids of divine grace. If he
          turns aside, as a godly man may occasionally do — he will not persist
          in sin, but, like Job, he confesses with self-abhorrence his vileness,
          and will proceed no farther in it. He endeavors, in the general course
          of his life, to keep at a distance from sin and temptation, and to
          order his conduct with such prudence, that he may not by surprise be
          ensnared in to sin, nor meet with any occasion of stumbling.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus did <i>David </i>direct his way, when he had the Word of God in
          his heart to keep him from sin, and fortified himself with firm
          resolutions, and fervent prayers, when he knew that he was to meet
          with snares in his path. Thus did <i>Abraham </i>direct his way, when
          he was commanded to sacrifice Isaac. He never told Sarah, nor even his
          servants that attended him on his journey, that he had received so
          strange a command from God, for he was fully resolved to obey the
          voice of the Lord, and wished to obviate every advice in opposition to
          his duty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us follow the example of these holy men, making straight paths for
          our feet, that what is lame may not be turned out of the way; and to
          him who orders his conduct aright, will God show his salvation.

          Lord.</b
        >"
        <p align="justify">
          Wisdom excels folly, as much as light excels darkness — and Solomon
          often directs us to manage all our affairs with discretion and
          counsel, by means of which purposes are established. But he warns us
          in this place, not to trust to our own wisdom or prudence, nor to
          dream that they can accomplish anything without the permission and
          pleasure of God. Wisdom and counsel can do much with the blessing of
          God — but all the wisdom of men and angels could do nothing in
          opposition to his counsels, which are all executed by the arm of
          omnipotence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is, no doubt, wisdom and strength in human counsel — but with
          God is wisdom and strength in an infinitely superior degree. One wise
          man excels another wise man, so much that he can manage him as if he
          were a child. But the only wise God turns the wisdom of all the
          philosophers in the world into foolishness — and the foolishness of
          God is infinitely wiser than the best wisdom of creatures.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Herod formed a project as deep as Hell to destroy our infant Savior —
          but Jesus lives and reigns. Herod and his family were soon extinct.
          The like success has attended all the contrivances of men to destroy
          the church of our Redeemer, and God has glorified himself upon the
          mightiest and wisest enemies of his people, by making their infernal
          devices the means of ruining themselves, and of advancing the
          interests of Zion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let Zion rejoice because of God's judgments, and let all the daughters
          of Judah be glad, for the Lord of hosts has purposed
          <i>good </i>concerning her — and who shall disannul his purpose? The
          enemies of Zion may associate and combine, and form their plans for
          her destruction — but they shall not stand, for the Lord has founded.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are men who aspire to honors, and in their pride would exalt
          themselves in opposition to the will of God, who has annexed honor to
          piety — and disgrace, to pride and ambition. But shall they succeed?
          The Lord has purposed to stain the pride of all glory, and they shall
          be scattered in the imagination of their hearts. There are some that
          try to carry on their plans for enriching themselves and their
          families, in spite of God. But poverty and ruin is the fruit of their
          presumption.

        <p align="justify">
          In short, all who seek for profit or pleasure in transgressing the law
          of God, shall find loss and misery. Trust in God at all times,
          acknowledge him in all your ways, and be not afraid that any of his
          gracious counsels shall be frustrated. But those who harden themselves
          against God shall be ruined without remedy.

          Solomon here teaches better than he practiced, for we need from God
          not only <i>light </i>to guide us in the way — but <i>grace </i>to
          walk in it. He provided 40,000 horses even though God had expressly
          forbidden the kings of Israel to multiply horses, lest their hearts
          should be drawn away from the hope of Israel. But this proverb was
          abundantly verified by the consequences of the change that Solomon
          introduced into the management of public affairs, for from his days
          the people never made such a figure in war, as they had done in former
          days, when the judges of Israel went on foot against those who fought
          from chariots of iron.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Horses and warlike preparations of every kind are nevertheless
          necessary to be used in war, when they are not expressly forbidden by
          God. Yet if you trust in horses, you will find that they cannot afford
          safety to those whose hearts are turned from the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When the people of Judah went down to Egypt for help, and trusted in
          the Egyptian horses for safety against the king of Assyria — the
          prophet <i>Isaiah</i>, with a loud voice, remonstrated against their
          conduct, and cried that their strength was to sit still, and wrote it
          in a book, that it might continue forever and ever as a testimony on
          record against those who trust in chariots and horses, rather than the
          name of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Are we obliged to fight for our liberty and religion? Then let us set
          up our banners in the name of the Lord, believe in him as the Lord of
          armies, who musters the hosts of the battle, and decides the fate of
          war — and beware of everything that might provoke him to sell us into
          the hands of our enemies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Prudence obliges a nation to avoid dangerous wars. Religion teaches
          us, if possible, as far as lies in us, to live peaceably with all men.
          But necessity is sometimes laid upon Christians to expose themselves
          to jeopardy in war for their country. In such cases the firm belief of
          this proverb will encourage us to venture into the field against a
          superior force, persuaded that
          <i>every bullet has its direction from God</i>, and that he is able to
          give us the victory, or to make defeats and deaths our advantage.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Salvations</p></i>of every kind belong to him.
        The means of safety must not be neglected — but God alone must be
        trusted, and when the means are attended with success, the glory is to
        be ascribed to him.
        <p align="justify">
          Joshua employed the whole force of the armies of Israel against the
          nations of Canaan, and he praised those tribes that generously and
          faithfully assisted their brethren to subdue the country — but he was
          fully sensible that it was not their sword and bow that had gotten the
          land — but God's right arm and favor, and the light of his
          countenance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Just so in our spiritual warfare, we must arm ourselves with the whole
          armor of God — but our strength must be in the Lord, and in the power
          of his might. If we must trust him for safety in fighting with flesh
          and blood, how can we wrestle successfully against the powers of Hell
          without his divine support?
