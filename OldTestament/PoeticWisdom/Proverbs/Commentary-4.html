          The wise man gives us this chapter, as an antidote against those
          youthful lusts by which so many are ensnared. Let such as are tempted
          by their own hearts or by the agents of Satan, to sins of immorality,
          seriously consider its contents, and pray that God may bless them for
          their benefit. None of us are superior to all temptations of this
          nature; let us therefore give heed to the things that are spoken, in
          order to represent the danger and mischief of impurity, and to show us
          in what manner to avoid it.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 1, 2.</p></font>"My
          son, pay attention to my wisdom, listen well to my words of insight,
          that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve
          knowledge."</b
        >
        The wisdom which Solomon teaches in this chapter cost him dear; but if
        we attend to his instructions, we shall have them at an easy rate. It
        may save us much bitter repentance, and preserve us from some of the
        most dreadful dangers. For it will teach us that spiritual subtlety and
        discretion, by which, like David, we shall become wiser than our
        enemies, and be enabled to escape their snares.
        <p align="justify">
          Attention will enable us to keep knowledge in our hearts, for a wanton
          imagination, ever dictating corrupt conversation to the lips, proves
          the beginning of ruin to many. They accustom themselves to speak of
          things not fit to be named among Christians; and from foolish talking,
          and impure jesting, by which they corrupt themselves and their
          companions — they proceed to the works of darkness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When the word of God enters into our hearts, it will banish all
          pollution from the tongue, and dispose us to entertain our companions
          with that discourse which is good for the use of edifying. Thus our
          own hearts will be more deeply impressed, God will be honored, and
          others guarded against the snares of the destroyer. Now it is of great
          importance for men, especially in their younger days, to furnish
          themselves with preservatives from that word which is able to keep us,
          against the snares of the immoral woman. Solomon had already warned us
          against her; but he is directed by God to do it a second time at
          greater length.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 3.</p></font>"For the
          lips of a immoral woman drop as a honey-comb, and her mouth is
          smoother than oil."</b
        >
        She talks of nothing but love and pleasure, and perpetual delights. To
        hear her, one would suppose that she possessed the most generous and
        unselfish spirit. Her tongue is taught by him who betrayed Eve to paint
        the vilest sin with the most beautiful colors, and to conceal all its
        deformity and danger. But it is the part of a reasonable creature to
        look beyond the present moment, and to consider the <i>outcome </i>and
        <i>end </i>of things, as well as their beginning.
        <p align="justify">
          There is sweetness indeed in the mouth of this immoral woman,
        </p>
        <b

          end is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edge sword."</b
        >
        The venom and sting of a <i>serpent </i>is concealed under the honey of
        her lips! Those who repent of their immorality will experience far more
        bitterness, than ever they tasted of pleasure in their unlawful
        gratifications. But few get so well off, and if people continue
        hardened, the <i>end </i>is more bitter than death! It is like a
        two-edged sword, which wounds and destroys both soul and body at once!
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 5.</p></font>"Her
          feet go down to death, her steps take hold on Hell." </b
        >She is on the highway to eternal ruin, and thither she is carrying
        those who listen to her bewitching voice. Her house is in the suburbs of
        the place of destruction, and her steps take hold of Hell.

        <p align="justify">
          David was in great fear when he said to his friend, "As the Lord
          lives, there is but a step between me and death." But there is not
          even this small interval between the steps of the immoral woman and
          Hell. They already take hold of it. But may not people, when they see
          this danger before their eyes, make a timely retreat to the paths of
          life? No. In most cases this is not to be expected.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 6.</p></font> "She
          gives no thought to the way of life; her paths are crooked, but she
          knows it not."</b
        >
        When men enter into a course of sin, they have no intention to be
        damned. They intend only to indulge themselves in the pleasures of sin
        for a time — and then to return to the paths of life. Millions of souls
        have been seduced to everlasting destruction by this one temptation of
        the old serpent, "You shall not die although you eat; grace is free, and
        there is abundance of time to repent."

        <p align="justify">
          Solomon gives what may repel this temptation, by letting us know how
          foolish it is for men to flatter themselves with the hope that they
          shall be truly disposed and enabled to repent of their sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Her paths are crooked, but she knows it not." She can form her mode
          of behavior into a hundred different shapes, to entangle the heart of
          the lover. She spreads a thousand snares, and if you escape one of
          them, you will find yourself held fast by another. She knows well how
          to suit her words and behavior to your present mood, to lull
          conscience asleep, and to spread before your eyes such a mist, as
          shall prevent you from being able to see the paths of life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If you ever think of the danger of your course, and feel the necessity
          of changing it, she will urge you to spend a little time longer in the
          pleasures of sin. If her solicitations prevail, if you linger within
          the precincts of guilt — your resolutions are weakened, and your
          passions gain new strength.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What is the awful result? The devil obtains more influence;
          conscience, forcibly repressed, ceases to reclaim with so loud a
          voice; God gives you up to the lusts of your own heart, and leaves you
          to chose your own delusions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Attend, then, to the wisest of men, who instructs you to keep free of
          these dangerous temptations!
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 7.</p></font>"Now
          then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say."</b
        >
        If a father saw his son walking on the edge of a precipice — how greatly
        would he be alarmed! How loud would be his cries! And if the adventurous
        youth still kept his dangerous post — the father would fly to him, and
        try to force him from the brink of destruction. No less earnest is this
        kind instructor to save us from impending ruin. His words are cries —
        they have life and power in them. He is deaf who will not listen; he is
        stubborn who will not comply.
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 8.</p></font>"Keep to
          a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house."</b
        >
        But what need is there for so much preciseness? May not a man be
        permitted to <i>talk </i>with her, merely by way of amusement? Is it
        unlawful to drink a glass in her house, and to satisfy our curiosity by
        observing what passes in it, and by what arts she contrives to seduce
        those who are less established in virtue than ourselves? Yes, it is
        unlawful to have the least interaction with her.
        <p align="justify">
          By the requirements of the ceremonial law, no man was to be in the
          same house with a leper. The moral law forbids us to enter into a
          house full of the <i>leprosy of sin</i>. Her house is full of snares,
          and her hands are as iron bands. The <i>devil </i>glances in her
          smiles, and lurks in her dress and in her motions. He is there, ready
          to discharge at you his fiery darts of temptation! And to aid his
          efforts, you have much combustible material in you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Dare you then delude yourself that the fire of licentious passion
          shall not be kindled, and blown up into a flame that you cannot
          quench! The devil will tempt you enough, without own help. To tempt is
          his business. As you love your life and your own soul, give him no
          assistance in the work of destruction.
        </p>

          "Lest you give your best strength to others and your years to one who
          is cruel, lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich
          another man's house. At the end of your life you will groan, when your
          flesh and body are consumed."

        <p align="justify">
          A good name is better than precious ointment — but this abominable sin
          is the ruin of a good name. The reputation of David and of Solomon was
          greatly sunk by it. By immorality, has the honor of thousands been
          irrecoverably lost!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A pure life is a great blessing, and may be regarded as the foundation
          of every earthly blessing. But immoral people part with everything
          that renders life worthy of the name, and in a literal sense, they
          often give their years unto the cruel. Their lives are lost in the
          pursuit of this sin by the just vengeance of God, by its native
          consequences, or by the base incidents to which it exposes those who
          practice it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And for what are these years given away? Did men generously part with
          their lives in the defense of their country or for the sake of a
          generous friend — the loss would be amply compensated by honor, and by
          the pleasure of a good conscience. But how infatuated are they to give
          their years unto the cruel, who conceal a selfish and malignant heart
          under the mask of love!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All unlawful love is hatred, and all tempters to it are cruel enemies
          to our happiness. Shall we then gratify wicked enemies — at the
          expense of honor and life, and everything dear to us? These false
          friends and malicious enemies rob you of your honor and life, with as
          much eagerness as if they could enjoy these precious blessings of
          which you are deprived.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Their real views, however, are directed to your money or estate — and
          why should men give away fruits of their own labor and toil? Or if
          they wish to be rid of them, why should strangers be filled with them,
          rather than friends?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some are so foolish, as to live in the lust of immorality, to save the
          necessary expenses of a family. But observation, as well as Scripture,
          might convince them of their error. The followers of vice are often
          attacked by poverty, which comes upon them like an armed man; and how
          distressing is poverty to those who have indulged themselves in lewd
          courses, contracted insatiable desires after carnal pleasure, deprived
          themselves of their friends, and disqualified themselves for any
          business that might retrieve their circumstances, or supply their
          needs!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Poverty is still more distressing when it is attended by weakness and
          disease — the natural consequences which Providence has annexed to
          those courses by which men dishonor God and themselves. When the body
          is tortured, and the spirits dejected by the loathsome distempers
          which sin brings in its train — their conscience, which was formerly
          trampled under foot, rises up and regains its power, and inflicts
          severe vengeance for the injuries it has received. Then, O profligate
          sinner, you will mourn!
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 12-14.</p></font>"You
          will say: How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction! I

          the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly."</b

        Religion has received many testimonies in its favor from enemies, whose
        hearts have at last forced them to curse the day when they were so mad,
        as to turn a deaf ear to its friendly voice!
        <p align="justify">
          The word of God read and preached, is God's appointed means of keeping
          or reclaiming men from sin, and in a Christian land, the votaries of
          vice are rebels against the light. They are, to their own loss,
          fatally successful in fighting against that God who opposes their
          wickedness by the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, and
          preached by the ministers of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is not in vain for ministers, and parents, and tutors, to use means
          for acquainting young people with the Scripture, and imprinting it
          upon their hearts. The confession of profligates, when arrived at the
          end of their career, makes it evident, that if anything would have
          proved effectual to preserve them from ruin, it would have been the
          instructions and reproofs of parents and teachers. Such means have no
          doubt been the instruments of preserving many, and reclaiming some.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The confession of the wretch tortured by his conscience, is
          <i>not </i>introduced by the inspired sage as the humble confession of
          a <i>penitent</i>, who looks for pardon through the merits of Christ.
          How greatly are they deluded who think that <i>misery </i>can produce
          true repentance, or that <i>sorrow </i>pressed out of the soul by
          distress of body and anguish of conscience, are signs of real grace!
          People may cry out of their folly, and warn others, and beg others to
          pray for them — and yet, like Simon Magus, remain all the while in the
          gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sinners who will not comply with the calls of God, may now make them
          the object of their scorn — but at the latter end, when conscience
          shall preach with a voice louder than any minister, sorrow shall be
          their inevitable portion. Then, in the breasts of desperate sinners —
          despised admonitions shall burn like raging fire! Then shall
          multitudes of iniquities, once overlooked, present themselves like so
          many dismal apparitions to the eyes of the sinner, and make him a
          terror to himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The pleasure derived from the present moment is nothing. Our enjoyment
          is derived from the recollection of the past, or from the prospect of
          what is to come.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sensualists cannot flatter themselves so grossly, as to fetch any
          pleasure from that part of life which they have already spent — but
          their hopes are ever on the wing to seize on
          <i>anticipated </i> pleasure. It frequently happens, that when their
          course is run, and lust can no longer be indulged, their attention is
          forced back on the scenes of life, through which they have already
          passed. When in this manner they are brought to recollect their
          numberless sins, and to forebode the punishments that await them —
          their souls are convulsed with remorse, and horror takes full
          possession of them:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Wretched creatures that we are! Our impetuous passions have hurried
          us into all wickednesses — those only excepted, which our powers were
          too feeble and narrow to add to the rest. Would to God we had been
          brutes, or could yet have our portion with them, to be turned forever
          into earth and rottenness! O that we had been heathens, and had never
          heard the gospel of Christ, and the law of the Most Holy God! Our
          abominable iniquities are dreadfully aggravated by the opportunities
          we have had of being present in the assemblies of Zion, and receiving
          the instructions and reproofs of life. Instead of deriving benefit
          from the ordinances of God's worship and the communion of saints — we
          have exposed ourselves to the reproach of the whole assembly of the
          pious. By our example we have grieved some, and caused others to
          stumble.

          The words in the 14th verse may be translated, In a moment I am in all

          whole congregation.'

          It is an aggravation of that misery which is the fruit of a man's own
          ways, when <i>publicity </i>is one of its attendant circumstances.
          Those who will not <i>believe </i>the threatenings of God, shall
          <i>feel </i>them. There are no free-thinkers in Hell, and but few on a

          To avoid immorality, let every man have his own wife, and let him love

          Children are in the language of Scripture sometimes compared to
          waters. We find Solomon in this passage comparing both wife and

          joys of lawful and unlawful love — as there is between the waters of a
          clear spring, and those which are drunk out of an impure and poisonous
          stream.

          pleasant to others, and likely one day to become comforts to their
          neighbors as well as to their parents. Is not this far better than to
          have a bastard progeny imposed on him, which he does not know — and
          yet cannot deny to be his own?

          Husbands ought to praise God for virtuous wives, and to observe their
          good qualities, and call them blessed. They ought to love them as
          themselves, to wear a cheerful countenance in their company, to take
          pleasure in them as the companions of their youth, to rejoice in their
          love, and to treat them with the tenderest affection. They ought to
          view them with feelings of delight.

          The pleasant roes are the delight of their masters, who are charmed
          with that gentle and insinuating manner of behavior which nature
          teaches them. Much more may it be expected, that this human creature
          will be dear to our souls, whom God has given us to be the solace of
          our lives.

          In old age, when their beauty fades, the kindness of youth is to be
          retained for them, more especially if they retain those amiable
          virtues which fade not with the complexion of the countenance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wives are to be hated in comparison with Christ; but the sake of
          Christ, they are to be loved with an affection so ardent, that other
          women, however beautiful, may appear in their presence like painted
          flowers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the duty and the interest of wives, to be adorned with those
          beauties which will render easy the duties which their husbands owe
          them. It is indeed the duty of husbands to love their wives, for the
          sake of God's command, and Christ's example; but it is very difficult
          to love, where this pleasant affection is not engaged by lovely
          qualities in the object.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Why should husbands and wives tempt one another to sin against God to
          their own harm? This cordial love in the married state, will produce
          pleasures far sweeter than were ever found in unlawful love; and what
          chiefly recommends them is that they have no <i>sting </i>attending
          them — and give no offence to God, our Witness and our Judge.

          "Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of
          another man's wife? For a man's ways are in full view of the LORD, and
          he examines all his paths."

          Is it wise for men to affront their Judge, and to provoke the
          vengeance of an Almighty arm? Will they prefer these poor, and
          spiritless, and unsatisfying pleasures which he forbids — to those
          pure delights which are licensed by God's goodness? Remember, sinners,
          that God is present in your hidden retreats of wickedness! You see him
          not, because you are blind — but your stupidity cannot banish an
          omnipresent Deity! Your bars and bolts cannot exclude him who fills
          Heaven and earth. Darkness hides nothing from him of whom it is said,
          "The day is yours, the night also is yours."

          Why should men dare to affront Jehovah, their Maker and their Judge,
          by doing that in his presence, which they would be ashamed to do in
          the presence of a child?

          God will not be mocked. He will punish the wanton glance, and the
          lustful thought. Where, then, shall they appear who indulge themselves
          in <i>acts </i>of criminality? Will a thief steal in the presence of
          the judge — and yet hope to escape vengeance? And shall abandoned
          sinners flatter themselves with the thought of escaping the damnation
          of Hell, from Him who will come to judgment, and will be a swift
          witness against adulterers?

          Sinners think that they will repent, after having for a while enjoyed
          the pleasures of sin — pitiable delusion!

        >
        Sinners will find, when too late, if God's wondrous mercy does not
        prevent it — that the sorrow which springs from self-love, is a very
        different thing from repentance, and that it is not so easy a matter as
        the devil told them, to repent and to venture their salvation in the
        hands of a Redeemer.

          They now look upon <i>saints </i>as <i>slaves </i>who live an
          unpleasant life — but time will convince them, since admonition
          cannot, that they themselves are the slaves, bound in the strongest
          and most ignominious chains! They are fettered by wicked affections,
          and they have neither power nor will to assert their liberty. The
          cords of their own sins shall hold them fast, until they are cast into
          that <i>prison </i>from whence there is no release.

          This is a wretched condition — but they may thank themselves.
          <i>Their own hands forged the chains which are riveted upon them. </i
          >They refused that glorious liberty proclaimed to them in the word of
          Christ. The sinner flattered himself that he did not
          <i>refuse </i> redemption, he only <i>delayed </i>the acceptance of
          it. But such delays are refusals in God's estimation. To the sinner
          they are for the most part fraught with ruin.

        He despised instruction during life, and he shall die without it. He
        expected, that when his mortal life would draw near its close, good
        ministers would attend him and pray with him. He shall either lack that
        comfort, or it is to be feared that it will not be blessed to him.
        <p align="justify">
          None but God can awaken a sleeping and stupefied conscience; and when
          it is awakened, its clamors drown the voice of him who says, "Believe
          Christ, and you shall be saved."

        <p align="justify">
          In his amazing folly, he goes astray in his crooked ways, and is led

          not yet tainted by this vice bless God, and let them watch and pray.
          Let the <i>guilty </i>tremble and mourn — yet despair not.
