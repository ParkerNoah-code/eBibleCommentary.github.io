          >"The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh — an oracle. This man declared to
          Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ucal."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Agur was honored, like Obadiah and Jude, to write a very small portion
          of the Holy Scripture — but every part of the Word of God is precious,
          however small. The words of Agur are called an oracle or burden, for
          they were indited by the Holy Spirit, and are profitable for our
          correction and instruction in righteousness. This oracle is added to
          the proverbs of Solomon, because they treat on the same subjects, and
          are written in a like form.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The name of Agur is not given to a distinct book of the Bible — but
          his memorial shall be everlasting, for he was furnished with that
          wisdom which is from above. We can give no historical account of this
          wise man; we only know the name of his father, and his two chief
          disciples, who were doubtless men of credit in their generation — but
          their names only live in our days, for
          <i>the current of time </i>swallows up the names of the greatest part
          of men, and leaves little or nothing but the names of the rest. It is
          an honor to these men that their names are mentioned in the book of
          God as the disciples of Agur. If we are diligent learners at the
          school of Christ, and of those men who were inspired by the Spirit of
          Christ, although our names be not recorded in this blessed book — yet
          we may rejoice that they are written in Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In this oracle, Agur expresses his humble sense of his own ignorance,
          and tells us what need we have of a <i>divine teacher </i>to explain
          the glories of God to us. He recommends the Word of God to us, and
          calls us to the exercise of that faith for which we have a foundation
          in the Word of God. He directs us by his own example how to pray. He
          warns us against several dangerous sins, and makes several instructive
          observations on the characters of men, and the nature and qualities of
          many of God's creatures. These are perhaps a <i>summary </i>of what he
          spoke to Ithiel and Ucal while he lived; and although he is now dead,
          he speaks them to us.

          "Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding
          of a man."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          One of the best proofs of wisdom, is a sense of our own ignorance and
          folly. Pythagoras would not allow himself to be called a wise man —
          but a lover of wisdom. Socrates, who far exceeded him in wisdom, said,
          that he knew nothing — but that he knew nothing. Agur goes still
          further, and calls himself a brutish man.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All men are naturally brutish in respect of <i>spiritual </i>things —
          and Agur calls himself more brutish than any man. He was well
          acquainted with the fallen and degenerate condition of men, and deeply
          affected with his own particular share in it. Man is born like a wild
          donkey's colt; and a humble man is ready to acknowledge that there is
          none to whom this debasing comparison can be so justly applied as to
          himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But did Agur speak truth, or was he sincere in speaking so humbly of
          himself? No doubt he uses very strong language — but he was perfectly
          sincere in it. For he thought about God and eternal things — but felt
          so much difficulty in understanding them, he found himself naturally
          so much indisposed to the most important duties, and was filled with
          such grief at the darkness of his mind, and the perverseness of his
          heart — that he could not find words strong enough to express his
          inward sense of his own vileness and darkness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a literal truth concerning the wisest of us, that we are more
          brutish in relation to the noblest objects that can occupy our minds,
          than any man is about the affairs of life. Men have retained their
          wisdom about things of small consequence — but surely every man is
          brutish in his knowledge if divine things, until his mind is opened by
          the Holy Spirit to receive the knowledge of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place where gold is
          refined;" and men have found methods of forcing their way through
          mountains and rocks, that they may fetch out these shining metals; and
          bring out to the light of day, the stores of darkness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "But where is wisdom to be found, and where is the place of
          understanding? Man knows not the price thereof, neither is it found in
          the land of the living." None are so ignorant, and so likely to
          continue so, as those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in
          their own sight. None are so wise, and so likely to increase in
          wisdom, as humble souls who are deeply conscious of their folly and
          ignorance. They will open their mouths, and pant for God's
          commandments. They will rejoice to hear that Christ is made of God
          unto us wisdom, and will sit at the feet of Jesus, and receive from
          him the words of eternal life.
        </p>

        <b

          have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Perhaps Agur means the same thing with Amos, when he says, "I was not
          a prophet, neither was I a prophet's son." He was not trained up in
          the schools of the prophets — but God lays up sound wisdom for the
          righteous, and dispenses it with or without the ordinary means, as he
          pleases. For although he has required us to make a conscientious use
          of these means — yet he has not restricted himself to them in the
          distributions of his favor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Paul was of the same humble temper with Agur. He counted himself less
          than the least of all saints; and Agur accounts himself inferior in
          divine knowledge to other saints. The spirit of <i>Diotrephes </i>is
          in those men who court the pre-eminence among the brethren — but the
          lowly temper of a true saint will dispose us in honor to prefer one
          another.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When <i>Elihu </i>began to speak, in the dispute carried on between
          Job and his friends, he prefaces his discourse with high, though just
          praises on the wisdom that God had bestowed on him.
          <i>Agur </i> introduces his discourse with confessions of his own
          ignorance — but their situations were very different. Elihu was afraid
          that his friends would despise him for his youth, and lose the benefit
          of his speech. Agur thought he had reason to be afraid of the contrary
          extreme. When Ithiel and Ucal applied to him for instruction, they
          revealed a high opinion of his understanding.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We ought not to affect too great a name for knowledge and learning,
          nor to encourage men to expect too much from us, lest they should be
          disappointed to our own shame. Or lest they should place too great a
          dependence upon us, and too little on the Author of wisdom. A
          <i>good </i> name is valuable — but a <i>great </i>name is dangerous;
          and a wise man would rather decline than desire it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "As the refining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold — so is a
          man to his praise." A fool swells with vain conceit, if he finds his
          wisdom admired.
          <i
            >A wise man is humbled to find how far he falls short of the opinion
            that is entertained of him. </i
          >A fool, when he is praised, seeks more praise — for the
          <i>wind </i>after which he hungers cannot fill him. But a man of
          Agur's spirit will endeavor to moderate those high opinions which are
          entertained to his advantage.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Herod</p></i>was destroyed by worms, for the vain
        joy which he felt in the ungodly applause given to his wisdom and
        eloquence. <i>Agur </i>is recorded in Scripture as a pattern of humility
        to those men whose wisdom is admired. As Agur himself was insufficient
        to satisfy his friends' thirst of knowledge, so he directs them to look
        above all men for instruction.

          wind in the hollow of his hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in his
          cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his
          name, and the name of his son? Tell me if you know!"</b
        >

        <p align="justify">
          It is just as impossible for men, without divine illumination, to
          discover God — as to ascend into Heaven, or descend from it; to bind
          up the waters in a garment, or to gather the winds in their fists, or
          to establish all the ends of the earth. Has any man ever been able to
          achieve such wonders? Where did he live? What was his name? What is
          the name of any man who has the honor to spring from such a wonderful
          ancestor? If you can tell me the name of such a man as this, or his
          son, then I will confess that he is possessed of treasures of wisdom
          sufficient to supply all your needs, and to satisfy all your desires
          of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The God, whose name is beyond our comprehension, and whose Son's name
          is Wonderful, does all these things. Heaven is his throne, and the
          clouds are his chariots, and the earth has often felt his solemn
          presence. "God alone understands the way to wisdom; he knows where it
          can be found, for he looks throughout the whole earth and sees
          everything under the heavens. He decided how hard the winds should
          blow and how much rain should fall. He made the laws for the rain and
          laid out a path for the lightning. With him is wisdom and strength; he
          has counsel and understanding!" And from him, the Father of lights,
          every ray of useful knowledge comes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It deserves to be observed that our great Teacher makes use of the
          truth delivered in this verse to prove his absolute perfection as our
          instructor. "No man has ascended up to Heaven," to fetch down the
          knowledge of God to men — "but he who came down from Heaven, even the
          Son of man who is in Heaven." He showed his mission, by issuing forth
          his commands to the winds and the waves, which instantly obeyed him.
          He establishes all the ends of the earth, and by him all things in
          Heaven and in earth are held together. "He is the Lord our God, who
          teaches us to profit." Let us therefore acknowledge with Agur that we
          have no knowledge of our own, and wait for his instructions as the
          earth for the latter rain. All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
          are laid up in him, and these treasures are not sealed up — but spread
          before us in the word of Christ, which we ought to read with an humble
          dependence on him for his light and truth, that we may learn to set
          our hope on God.

          There are no superfluities in the Word of God, as we are too ready to
          imagine. Every Word of God is useful and holy, righteous and true.
          When we hear the words of men, our reason must try them, as the mouth
          tastes food — for any man may be a liar, or deceive us by his own
          misapprehensions. But the words of God are all worthy of himself. As
          the power of the Creator shines in all the works of his hands — so his
          inviolable truth and untainted holiness, give dignity and credit to
          everything that he speaks. The Bible has the same impression of
          divinity upon it that appears in the sun and the stars.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Because the Word of God is very pure, we ought to love it, and to
          believe it with all our hearts, and to trust in God, as he is revealed
          to us in it. For it reveals him to be forever possessed of all those
          infinite excellencies which make him the proper object of confidence
          to creatures, of all that mercy and grace, and plenteous redemption,
          which are sufficient to encourage the confidence of
          <i>guilty </i>creatures. Blessed are all those who put their trust in
          him.

          The world is full of harm and miseries sufficient to destroy or
          embitter our lives, and of invisible enemies, who seek to destroy our
          souls — but those who trust in the Lord, are completely safe and
          happy. His mercy is their refuge from condemnation, through Jesus'
          sin-atoning sacrifice which his word reveals. His power will shield
          them from every enemy, and they shall be kept in perfect peace whose
          mind is stayed on him, because they trust in him.

          "Fear not," said the Lord to Abraham, I am your shield, and your
          exceeding great reward." All who walk in the steps of the faith of
          Abraham, enjoy the benefit and comfort of this promise. They shall
          travel in safety through armies of enemies, and at last inherit the
          better country, where the father of the faithful now dwells. But our
          trust must be in the name of the Lord, as it is represented to us in
          the Word of God — the ground of our faith in him. To alter or to add
          to it is very dangerous.

          It is strange — but true, that men have been often disposed to add to
          the words of God, by establishing some rule of faith beside the
          Scripture, or intruding into the secrets of God, and devising
          religious doctrines not taught in the Scripture; or means of divine
          worship, which never came into God's mind. Surely such presumption
          shall be reproved and punished by the Most High. Princes would require
          the blood of those daring subjects who presumed to insert some
          additions in their laws — and God will add unto those who add to his
          words, all the plagues contained in the last and most dreadful book of
          the Scripture.

        <p align="justify">
          To add to the true meaning of the Scripture, in order to accommodate
          its doctrine to our own prejudices or taste, is a sin of the like
          kind. If we do so, we shall be reproved by God, and found liars, by
          saying that God has taught things which he never taught. Errors and
          sin are incident to man in his corrupted state — but we ought to guard
          against the former as well as the latter, by perusing the Bible with
          diligence and humility, and praying for that unction from the Holy
          One, which is truth, and will effectually preserve us from every
          dangerous mistake.

          Agur has taught us faith in God. He now teaches us by his own example,
          to pray, although he does not mention, by name, the object of prayer.
          He never dreamed that any person who professed to believe the Word of
          God, would think of any other object of prayer than God himself. But,
          since his days, men have found means to jumble together, in their
          systems of religion, the most incompatible truths and errors.

          Two things comprised the objects of his petitions. David had one thing
          that he chiefly desired, and our Lord sums up every necessary request
          in six petitions. The great blessings that we need from God should be
          habitually present to our minds, that when we have occasion to appear
          before the Lord, without time to premeditate, we may, in our requests,
          present the meditations of our heart in the words of our mouth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The wisest of the heathens were at a great loss to know what blessings
          they should ask from God — but God in mercy has instructed us what we
          should pray for, and has promised the Spirit to help the infirmities
          of our understandings and souls, in this duty. When we observe the
          directions of the Scripture about our prayers, we know to ask things
          agreeable to the will of God. The gracious Hearer of Prayer never said
          unto any of the seed of Jacob, "seek me in vain;" and he will not
          refuse hearing to those prayers that are dictated by his own Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But when we pray, we must pray in faith, nothing doubting. This holy
          man used great boldness at the throne of God. He insisted for these
          two things, and requires them, and pleads against a denial.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The revelations of the New Testament give us greater encouragements
          than Agur had, to exercise boldness in the presence of God, and to
          plead with unceasing earnestness until we obtain the blessings that we
          need. God sits on a throne of grace, and we have a great High Priest,
          who is passed into the heavens, and there appears in the presence of
          God for us. Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace. This
          great High Priest is also our <i>instructor</i>, and teaches us to
          pray always, and not to faint, assuring us that our importunity shall
          at length prevail.

          The most glorious name of any mere man spoken of in the histories of
          the world, was obtained by such importunate supplications.
          <i> Jacob </i>wept and made supplication at Bethel; yes, by his
          strength, he had power with the angel and prevailed, and his name was
          called <i>Israel</i>, because as a prince he had power with God, and
          received the blessing for which he wrestled.

          Agur prayed to God with proper impressions of his frailty and

          and requested that he might enjoy the blessings of God while he lived.
          Spiritual blessing were the grand object of his wishes; and if we duly
          considered the uncertainty of our lives, and the approaches that death
          is constantly making to us, we would never ask these blessings with
          such coldness as if we desired a denial. Thoughts of death should
          inflame our desires after heavenly things, and moderate our exorbitant
          desires for the blessings of the present life.

        <p align="justify">
          Agur's first petition is for deliverance from sin. Whether he means
          particularly the sins usually known by these names, or the sin of
          idolatry, or sin in general — he no doubt desired freedom from all
          sin.
          <i
            >The holiest of men need preservation from the worst sins, for they
            are conscious that they might fall into the deepest mire of iniquity
            — if God withheld his mercy. </i
          >"Hold me up — and I shall be safe!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But all kinds of sin may be justly called vanities and lies, because
          all sin is empty and unprofitable, and imposes the most mischievous
          falsehoods upon men, promising them pleasure and gain — and giving
          them nothing but disappointment and damnation. An impression of the
          unprofitableness and danger of sin would make us very earnest in our
          prayers for the removal of it from us. "O Lord, the Gentiles shall
          come unto you from the ends of the earth, and shall say: Surely our
          fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no
          profit."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The removal of sin includes in it both pardon and sanctification, and
          therefore the petition may include both the fifth and sixth petition
          of the Lord's prayer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When God pardons sin, he removes it far from us as the east is from
          the west, and casts it into the depth of the sea! When he sanctifies a
          soul, he removes sin from its throne, and gradually drives it out of
          its residence in the soul. Both these blessings are absolutely
          necessary for us. They are to be the subject of our most earnest
          petitions, and we have great encouragement to plead for them, because
          they are graciously promised in his word. These rich promises are yes
          and amen in Christ, who purchased them for us by his blood, and gives
          us all possible assurance of obtaining them from God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are not only to pray for the removal of sin — but for the removal
          of it at a great distance from us. "Keep vanity and lies
          <i>far </i>from me!" As God removes it far away in pardon, the soul
          that abhors sin desires to have it far removed from the heart and
          life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord teaches us not only to pray against <i>sin</i> — but against
          <i>temptation</i>. For there is a strong inclination in the hearts of
          men to comply with temptations when they are presented to the soul. If
          a man has a bag of gun-powder in his hands, he will certainly wish to
          keep at a distance from the fire.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must seek first the kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof —
          but we are not forbidden to seek also those things that are needful
          for the body. We are forbidden to seek great things for ourselves —
          but directed to seek daily bread. And accordingly, Agur prays for it
          in these words, "Give me neither poverty nor riches."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Poverty is a very disagreeable thing to all men, and none will wonder
          that Agur prays against it. Yet our Lord, for our sakes, endured
          extreme poverty. If Providence should appoint poverty to us as our
          lot, we ought to be content with that situation in which Christ
          himself lived among us. Yet such is the kindness of God to us, that we
          are warranted to pray against it, as a state of sore temptation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Had Agur prayed against poverty only, we would have all joined with
          him — but few men would choose to have him for their chaplain, because
          to poverty he adds <i>riches</i>, as a thing equally undesirable to
          him. Riches are the desire of all men — except for those who know the
          weakness of their own hearts, and believe what our Lord tells us of
          the danger of riches. Riches are good if they are rightly used, and
          have been the instrument of much good when they were in the hands of
          very godly and wise men — but there are few even of the saints who
          have a sufficiency of wisdom and grace, for using, without abusing
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Agur desired to have nothing, however agreeable to the natural and
          ordinary wishes of men, if it might prove injurious to his soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What then would this godly man have from God, if he desires neither
          poverty nor riches? He prays that God would feed him with daily bread;
          bestowing on him whatever was needful for his support and convenience,
          and suitable to the station in which he was placed. Having food and
          clothing, and all that is commonly included under the name of
          <i>bread </i>in Scripture language — he would be content and thankful,
          and ask no more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Agur teaches us, in this account of his prayers, to look upon God as
          the dispenser of the good things of life, who gives riches or poverty
          at his pleasure; from whom we receive our food and clothing; on whom
          we ought to depend for the supply of all our necessities; to whom we
          should pray for every good thing, and render thanks for every
          blessing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are taught likewise to offer our most fervent petitions for the
          blessings of God's salvation. Agur did not think that vanity and lies
          could be removed too far from him — but he thought that poverty might
          soon be too far removed. How opposite was his spirit to the spirit of
          the world!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The greatest part of men seek earthly blessings with all the desire of
          their hearts, and the blessings of salvation with more moderate
          desires, and only so far as they may consist with the main objects of
          their affection. But Agur desires outward conveniences for the good of
          his soul, and only in such a measure as might consist with his best
          interests.

        <p align="justify">
          He prays for daily bread, that he might not be led into temptation;
          and for the same reason he prays against riches. If his riches
          increased, he was afraid that, through the depravity of his nature,
          they would tempt him to the dangerous sin of luxury — to impiety,
          presumption and arrogance. Such are the effects of riches upon men of
          corrupt minds. "When I fed them — they were satisfied. When they were
          satisfied — they became proud; then they forgot me." Hosea 13:6
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Riches are the gift of God — but they are too often used to the harm
          of the giver; and those who receive those common gifts in the greatest
          abundance, are generally the most <i>ungrateful </i>of all men, to him
          from whom every good gift comes. They do not perhaps deny the Lord in
          words, or say with their tongues: Who is the Lord? But
          <i>deeds </i>speak louder than <i>words</i>. When men willfully
          transgress the laws of God, they say in effect, "Who is the Lord, that
          we should serve him?" When they neglect prayer to God, they say that
          they are their own masters, and will no more come unto God. Such was
          the practical language of a great part of rich men in former ages, and
          it is the same at this day.

          "They spend their days in wealth," says Job, "Therefore they say unto

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But are real saints ready to be snared into such sins by the influence
          of riches? Saints have flesh as well as spirit — and riches are a
          powerful temptation to them as well as other men.
          <i

          East. But where is the saint who has received such rich communications
          of grace as Job? God grant that we may never be so rich as Job, unless
          God is pleased to make us as good and upright.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some people think they are in no danger of making a bad use of riches,
          if they could but obtain them, because they feel no disposition to
          make a bad use of anything they have. "But he who trusts in his own
          heart is a fool!" Is there a greater fool in the world, than the man
          who thinks himself wiser than Solomon or Agur, or Christ himself — who
          tells us that it is hard for those who have riches to enter into the
          kingdom of God?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A wise man will not choose to leave a country of ordinary fertility,
          for another whose soil is far richer — but the air very pestilential,
          although his constitution of body is at present very healthful. Nor
          will he choose to walk in a flowery path where there are secret pits,
          and where the country is infected with robbers — if he can find
          another path, which is less pleasant and more safe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But <i>poverty </i>is not without its temptations also. Pinching
          necessity may tempt a man to use unlawful shifts for his subsistence,
          and even to steal. And therefore this wise man prays that he might be
          kept from poverty as well as riches, for he had no confidence in his
          own heart, which he knew to be so foolish and treacherous.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But what made him so much afraid of stealing? Did he think he would be
          disgraced and punished for it? That was not the thing for which he
          chiefly abhorred stealing — but he knew that this sin brings a great
          guilt, and a deep stain on the soul — and besides is a snare to the
          soul, which brings it into the devil's power, and gives him advantage
          for drawing on men to sins of greater guilt. One sin needs to be
          supported by another sin, and lying and perjury are the common refuges
          to which thieves have recourse for screening themselves from shame and
          punishment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Agur abhorred all sin — but the sin of profaning the name of the Lord
          was one of the most dreadful wickedness in his apprehension, because
          the Lord was his God. He believed in God and loved him with all his
          heart, and he earnestly wished to be kept at the utmost distance from
          everything hat might lead him to dishonor or profane the name of his
          God.

          you will pay for it."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Agur teaches us not only to keep a good conscience in the things that
          relate immediately to the worship and service of <i>God</i> — he
          enjoins us, likewise, to exercise ourselves to have a conscience void
          of offence towards <i>men</i>, not excepting the lowest of them. We
          must not hurt the lowest slave on earth. For although he is not able
          to revenge the injury — yet God will do it with severe justice. As we
          must do no hurt to a poor servant, so we must not tempt any other
          person to hurt him. Agur forbids us to accuse him to his master, lest
          we should expose him to severe treatment at his hands.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But is accusing a servant to his master in every case unlawful? Did
          not Abraham accuse the servants of Abimelech to their master for
          robbing him of his wells? He did — but there was no danger in that
          case, for Abraham knew that Abimelech was too selfish a man to punish
          his servants because they exceeded the bounds of justice in their zeal
          for his service.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are other cases in which we may lawfully accuse servants to
          their masters — but they are not common. Men are too ready to take too
          much liberty in this point; and Agur does not think it necessary to
          mention the excepted cases, because any man can see them, and most men
          would take too great a license in applying them to particular cases.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But what is the evil of accusing a servant to his master? It is
          inhumanity and cruelty. It is adding to the distress which we should
          rather relieve if it were in our power, (for servants in those days
          were generally slaves.) It is a sowing of discord in families; and it
          may provoke the poor man to curse you. And what if he does? It is his
          sin to curse me. It is your own sin; or if the sin is his, you are the
          <i>devil </i>that tempts him to it; and the weight of his curses,
          aggravated with the guilt of them, may come down from a just God upon
          your head. You may be found guilty of bringing a false accusation
          against him; guilty of the poor man's revengeful curses; guilty of his
          master's tyranny, through the bad opinion of his servant that you
          infuse into his mind.
        </p>

          Many of Agur's sayings are better remembered than many other things,
          by his method of classing his observations into a certain number of
          particulars. His petitions were two; and his observations on the
          manners of men, and the qualities of creatures, are four on each
          subject. He begins at this verse to speak of four sets of people, who
          deserve a particular remark on account of their extreme wickedness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "There are those who curse their fathers." It is the disgrace of human
          nature that ever one man was found that could be guilty of this sin.
          Will a man curse the instrument of his existence? This is the next
          degree of guilt to that of cursing the author of it. The prophet
          Isaiah pronounces a woe upon him who strives with his Maker, and
          proceeds next to pronounce a woe against him who says to his father.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But there is a whole generation of men upon whom this atrocious guilt
          may be justly charged, and therefore we find a law in the writing of
          Moses appointing the punishment of it; and the punishment is the same
          which was to be inflicted on the blasphemers of God himself. Although
          men do not expressly make use of their tongues to curse their fathers
          — yet they are to be ranked with this cursed generation, if they do
          not bless their mothers. Mothers are to be honored as well as fathers;
          and the neglect of duty to parents is criminal, as well as the
          commission of offences against them. But perhaps you will say, "My
          mother deserves not to be blessed." Is she not your mother? Then she
          deserves your good will and tender affection, and prayers. If you
          cannot praise her, you have no call to say anything to her harm.

        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          No man is truly pure, unless he is washed from his filthiness. All men
          are naturally polluted with sin, and rendered abominable by it.
          Nothing on earth is comparable to sin for vileness — and no creature
          on earth is so abominable and filthy as man, who drinks iniquity like
          water. We cannot be washed from our filthiness, but by the blood and
          Spirit of Christ. The <i>blood </i>of Christ is the fountain opened by
          God for sin and immorality, and it is the <i>Spirit </i>of Christ who
          applies it to our souls, and purifies our hearts by the faith of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But there are many who are strangers to Christ — and yet reckon
          themselves pure. They never saw their pollution, because they are
          unacquainted with the law of God, or with themselves. Or they have
          washed with soap, and flattered themselves that they could wash away
          their own filthiness by it. Or they are mistaken about the way of
          making use of Christ, for the cleansing of their souls. Or they
          persuade themselves upon false grounds, that they are cleansed by his

          Do you see a man who is clean in his own eyes, although he is yet
          impure in the sight of God? There is more hope of a publican or a
          harlot, than for him. He says unto Christ, "Depart from me, for I am
          not a sinful man." He is covered like the leviathan, with scales that
          render him impenetrable by the sharpest pointed arrows. No sinners do
          worse things than those who do whatever is right in their own eyes,
          (Judges 18. etc.) and none are farther from righteousness than those
          who are righteous in their own eyes. They are a smoke in God's
          nostrils, and a fire that burns all the day. Christ found such
          self-conceited men to be his greatest enemies while he was
          tabernacling among us, and spoke some parables, and denounced many
          heavy woes against them.

        <p align="justify">
          Let us examine our hearts impartially, lest we should deserve to be
          classed with this wretched generation, which, we have reason to fear,
          is more numerous than the generation of those whose hands are clean,
          and their hearts pure. We all <i>profess </i>to be Christians — but
          Christ will deny us if we belong to this set of men. For he has
          declared, that unless he washes us, we have no part in him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Men are unwilling to class themselves with the impure, lest their
          consciences should fly in their faces — but those who falsely pretend
          to purity are the people whose consciences shall lash them with
          greatest severity at last. Why should we seek to cover our nakedness
          with fig leaves? Why should we exclude ourselves from the
          <i>fountain</i>, through a pernicious shame of confessing our
          vileness? The promise of God stands upon record: "I will sprinkle
          clean water upon you and you shall be clean." Is it best, sinners, to
          claim the benefit of this promise, or to allege that you have no need
          of it? Men are generally ashamed to be thought poor — yet who would
          not confess himself to be poor, if the king should offer great wealth
          to every poor man in the town and to none else?

          There is a generation of men who are swelled with pride and vanity —
          and yet put on the dress of humility. Such are a great number of the
          generation last mentioned — but God knows their hearts; and the fruits
          of their pride often reveal them to men. But there are some men who
          seem to be proud even of their pride. They do not hide their sin — but
          declare it as Sodom; and the show of their countenances witnesses
          against them. Agur was surprised how the sons of Adam, who are but
          worms, should put on such arrogant airs, and behave with so much
          insolence. Solomon likewise speaks of this race of men as a generation
          abhorred by the Lord. The prophets, in their predictions against Moab;
          and Ezekiel, in his prophecies against Tyre and Egypt, give us a
          striking picture of their manners, and a terrible description of the
          vengeance of God against such insolent despisers of God and men. For
          God will save the afflicted and humble people — but will bring down
          those with haughty looks.

          to lions or tigers, for neither these nor any other kind of animals
          are so fierce and brutal. These men are brutes with iron teeth, sharp
          as knives, to cut off, and to destroy. While they grind the faces of

          <i> "Give, give!"</i> Hell is evidently set forth before them, and

          drags them on to purchase for themselves one of the chief places in

          But punishments inconceivably more dreadful, are appointed to them by

          Agur had been speaking of the dreadful effects of the lust of
          covetousness, which still cries, <i>"Give, give!"</i> Some think that
          he intends, in the two following verses, to represent the insatiable
          nature of this lust, by comparing it with the most <i>craving </i>and
          <i> unsatisfied </i>things which men are acquainted with.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He does not expressly draw any moral instruction out of the account
          which he gives of the four things that cannot be satisfied, only he
          teaches us to make observations on the works of God, and the nature of
          things that we see or hear of. Such observations enlarge our minds,
          lead us to admire the Creator, and to raise pious meditations in our
          minds. Besides, the Scripture makes use of such observations to
          illustrate the important instructions which it gives us about the
          things that we are to believe or do.

          The <i>leech </i>is a blood-sucker. It will suck the blood of other
          creatures until it bursts — but covetous men will suck the blood of
          their fellow-men until they are damned! Agur calls anything remarkable
          for its greediness, a daughter of the leech. Covetousness of spiritual
          and eternal blessings, deserves to be exempted from this humiliating
          comparison — but a heart set upon earthly treasure, is more like the
          leech than any of its daughters. For there is no satisfying of a
          covetous man; with shame he cries, <i>"Give, give!"</i> And if you
          should give him whole rivers of blood to drink, he will still cry for
          more; as you see in the example of those tyrants, who gratify their
          lust without restraint.

          Pride is a sin detestable to God; and its effects are such, that even
          men cannot bear them, especially when it is raised to an high pitch,
          by a sudden and unexpected rise from a low and despised condition.
          Therefore a wise man would not wish to be raised by God to a condition
          much above his present state, unless God would give him
          <i>grace </i>to bear it with moderation.

        <p align="justify">
          When a servant is raised to a throne, or to some high station in the

          him homage, he is filled with wrath and revenge. <i>Haman </i> was
          raised so high by Ahasuerus that he became giddy; and he thought the
          offence of one man who would not bow the knee to him so grievous, that
          it required the blood of a whole nation to make atonement for it.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Joseph</p></i>and <i>David </i>were indeed raised
        by God to high places, and behaved well in them — but God knew their
        hearts, and gave them such grace that they were still humble, when their
        condition was high.

        <p align="justify">
          The greatest tyrants in the world have generally been those who never
          expected to reign — such as Maximin the Roman emperor, who put to
          death all who knew him in his low condition, and, among the rest,
          those who had relieved his father and himself — that he might blot out
          the memory of his former baseness.

        <p align="justify">
          Servants have not more <i>seeds of pride </i>in their nature than
          other men — but they are sown in human nature, and are wonderfully
          nourished when the <i>sunbeams of prosperity </i>shine upon them with
          extraordinary warmth. Leave men of low condition where you found them,
          and they will behave in their station as well as kings. Raise
          <i>kings </i> to an unexpected height of grandeur, and they will
          become <i>Nebuchadnezzars </i>and <i>Alexanders</i>. This observation
          is of use in the affairs of the church as well as the state. Therefore
          Paul forbids a novice to be made a ruler in the church, lest, being

          but there is no bearing of him, when his lust of intemperance or
          greediness is fully satisfied. It is a blemish in David's character
          that he once broke out into such a violent rage, that he swore to
          destroy an innocent family — but we must remember that the provocation
          was given him by a fool when he was filled with food. In ordinary

          married, it would require all the patience of Job, and the meekness of
          Moses to bear with them! Before marriage their pride was checked by
          neglect, and covered with the mantle of prudence — but when they come
          into their new state of life, they throw off every restraint, and
          their new situation is a means of increasing their vanity and
          ill-nature, until neither their neighbors, nor their servants, nor

          duty one of their excuses — but let them go to the ants, and learn to
          be ashamed of their frivolous pretenses. These puny creatures do
          wonders by their exertions and perseverance; and men know not their

          summer, that they may not starve in the rigors of the winter months.
          How despicable, compared with these insects, are the rational

          teach sluggards to provide food for themselves, these animals reprove

          rock? If our place of defense is not the munition of rocks — but some
          refuge of lies, the coneys are wiser than we, according to their kind.
          The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and the rocks for the

          >"Locusts have no king, yet they advance together in ranks"</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          The locusts, notwithstanding their weakness as individuals, are strong
          and terrible by their order and unity. They go forth by bands, and
          nations tremble, and countries are turned into desolate wildernesses.
          The prophet Joel speaks of the armies of locusts in the same style
          which other prophets use when they are speaking of armies of Chaldeans
          or Persians; and history fully justifies the propriety of his
          language. The Saracen enemies are compared to locusts, for their
          number and harmony, and the destructive ravages which they were
          enabled by these means to commit. Shall the enemies of religion join
          so harmoniously in the service of the devil? And shall we who have
          Christ and not Apollyon for our king, betray his glorious cause by
          breaking our ranks, and violating that beautiful order which he has
          appointed? When the followers of the Redeemer stand fast in one
          spirit, and with one mind, striving together for the faith of the
          gospel, every one in his proper station — then the church is terrible
          as an army with banners; and the locusts that come out of the
          bottomless pit cannot prevail against her.

          palaces."

          The spider does not say, "There are servants in the palace appointed
          to keep it clear from every nuisance — I shall be slain in the
          window!" She provides herself a dwelling in the houses of the great,
          as well as in the cottages of the poor, for
          <i>labor and wisdom conquer every difficulty</i>. But to the sluggish
          soul, every easy thing is impossible. Does God furnish these despised
          creatures with wisdom so admirable in their rank of being? We are
          surely of greater value in his esteem than they are, and he has
          provided treasures of better wisdom for us. Let us have recourse to
          him, and he will furnish us with that wisdom which is proper to
          rational and immortal creatures.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord seems to justify this inference, in the instructions that he
          draws from the providence of God in clothing the grass of the field,
          and feeding the birds of the air. The locusts and spiders are hateful
          and mischievous creatures to men — but they are not for that reason
          useless. Those creatures that we despise and abhor, are a part of the
          riches of the Creator. They read lectures to us concerning his wisdom;
          and if they are well considered, they will instruct us in some
          articles of our duty.

          If a heathen will not believe in Christ, he cannot deny a God. For the
          invisible things of God are clearly seen in the things that he has
          made, and in those various endowments which he has bestowed on his
          creatures. As a garden is rendered pleasant to the eye by the rich
          variety of fruits, and herbs, and flowers, which it contains — so to
          the eye of the mind, the world is a beautiful scene, containing such a
          surprising variety of creatures, every one of them possessing
          qualities peculiar to itself. Agur had spoken of those creatures that
          are remarkable for their great wisdom in little bodies, and proceeds
          to mention some creatures that deserve admiration for their courage
          and spirit, and the dignity that appears in their motions. "O Lord,
          how manifold are your works, in wisdom have you made them all, the
          earth is full of your riches."

        <p align="justify">
          This celebrated animal is full of courage and fire; and no danger can
          subdue its valor, or force it to reveal any sign of fear. God himself
          is pleased to use it as an emblem of that majesty and resistless power
          which he displays in the defense of his injured people. And
          <i>Christ </i>our king does not disdain to borrow from it one of his
          glorious titles. <i>Christians </i>are furnished with such strength
          from their Redeemer, that they are said to be bold as lions; and by
          the courage of faith the saints have sometimes stopped the mouths of
          lions, or slain them outright. Wicked men have reason to flee although
          there is no pursuer — but Christians should learn, in the cause of
          truth and righteousness, not to turn aside for any adversary, or any
          suffering. For they shall be more than conquerors through him who
          loved them.

        >
        <p align="justify">
          The word, in the original, properly signifies, some creature that is
          girt in its loins; some take it to mean a rooster, and others a horse;
          which last animal has the honor to be celebrated by God himself, in
          the sublimest strains of poetry, and is used by the prophet Zechariah
          as an emblem of that conquering strength which God conveys into the
          hearts of those who faithfully fight his battles against the enemies
          of religion. "The Lord Almighty has visited his flock, the house of
          Judah, and has made them as his goodly horse in the battle." They are
          as weak as sheep in themselves — but furnished with the strength of
          war horses for maintaining his cause.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          An he-goat is an animal so remarkable for its strength and
          stateliness, when it marches at the head of the flock, that the
          Macedonian power which crushed the strength of the mighty Persian
          empire, is represented by it in the book of Daniel. The prophet
          Jeremiah calls the delivered captives to imitate the he-goat, by
          setting an example of vigor and courage to one another, in improving
          the merciful providence of God.

          Do not wonder at Agur for insisting so long in his little writing,
          upon the excellencies of the irrational part of the creation. The
          <i>creation </i>is a volume spread before our eyes, that we may read
          in it the perfections of the Creator. The Scripture is a commentary
          upon some parts of creation, which opens our mind to learn instruction
          from the rest. Great use was made of this volume before the Word of
          God was written, as you find in the book of Job; and the Almighty was
          pleased to humble Job for his unguarded complaints, by manifesting his
          own excellencies in a discourse upon his creatures.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A <i>king </i>with his army, is another of those creatures that are
          stately in bearing. For the God who has given courage and strength to
          lions, has given majesty to kings, and stamped on them such dignity
          that their subjects are awed by their appearance. Kings should
          therefore employ their authority and influence for the service of God;
          and their subjects owe them reverence as well as obedience; they are
          ministers of God, and are entitled to honor for the sake of their
          master and their work, and to obedience both for wrath and for
          conscience sake.

        <i> <p align="justify">Pride</p></i>is a very bad thing when it goes no
        farther than the <i>thoughts</i> — but it is still worse when it swells
        and overflows by the <i>lips</i>. If any proud or injurious thought come
        into our minds, it ought to be immediately checked and suppressed. To
        reveal it by our words is to declare our sin as Sodom, to give
        indulgence to those passions that ought to be mortified, and to add
        iniquity to iniquity. Besides, if we do not lay our hand upon our mouth,
        we shall rouse the pride of other men, and kindle up rage and strife
        that will not be easily allayed; and thus we shall be accountable not
        only for our own sin, which is heavy enough of itself — but likewise for
        those iniquities that we occasion in others, by the temptations which we
        throw in their way.

          produces blood — so stirring up anger produces strife."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Strife is not only provoked — but forced by haughty and spiteful
          words. For such is our weakness, that we are as easily kindled into
          anger by the angry words that are directed to us — as one coal is
          kindled by another coal that is burning. We should be meek when our
          neighbor is angry; but, alas! we have too little of the spirit of
          Moses, or rather of Jesus. For Moses himself has been provoked to
          speak unadvisedly with his lips.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As the violent shaking of milk in the churn produces butter, as the
          twisting of the nose makes blood to spring forth — so when we tease
          our neighbors, and set their passions into a ferment by bitter and
          galling words, we are the authors of strife, and kindle up that
          destructive and devouring fire, which perhaps cannot be quenched until
          it has done a thousand times more harm than we dreamed off.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The command of our passions and tongues is an attainment of vast
          consequence to our happiness and the welfare of our souls. Many of the
          wise instructions of Solomon and Agur are designed to recommend this
          point of wisdom to our regard, and, to assist us in learning it. Our
          Lord Jesus recommends it to us as one of the marks of a true
          Christian, and an evidence of our regard to his example.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The apostles Paul and James insist very much upon it; and that love
          which John is forever pressing upon us, will sweeten our tempers
          effectually into that calmness and meekness which are so absolutely
          necessary to our happiness and usefulness in the world, and will
          gradually extinguish those seeds of wrath and contention which lie in
          our corrupted natures. The apostle Peter recommends the calmness and
          meekness which is here enjoined by motives of irresistible force — the
          example which Christ left us when he was bearing our sin — the
          pleasure that God takes in meekness, and the happiness which he
          graciously confers on those who govern their passions, and their
          tongues, according to his will.

          Men of arrogant and outrageous tempers, murmurers and complainers, are
          condemned by Jude in his short epistle with great severity. The whole
          Scripture testifies loudly against the contentious and ill-natured.
