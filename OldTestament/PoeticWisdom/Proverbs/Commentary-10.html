            false balance is abomination to the Lord."</b
          >
          Commerce is a blessing of great value to men. In the same light are we
          to consider the invention of weights and balances, by which it is
          facilitated. These are instances of the divine goodness, for God has
          taught discretion to the merchant as well as to the gardener. But by
          corrupt men, these, as well as every other instance of the goodness of
          God, have been abused. While God furnishes them with the means of
          practicing justice — the devil teaches them to turn the instruments of
          righteousness into the means of defrauding one another. False balances
          are not only hated — but abhorred by God. They are abomination itself
          in his eyes.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          But what is the meaning of this? Is the Lord's indignation excited
          against pieces of wood or of stone? No, this manner of expression
          points out the greatness of his displeasure against such as use them,
          and shows that such instruments of iniquity should be dashed in
          pieces.

          As money was weighed in ancient times, <i>bad money </i> comes within
          the compass of this proverb. But not to limit its operations, we must
          observe, that villainy of every kind, and that especially which is
          committed under guise of justice — is condemned by it. As no iniquity
          is so odious to God as that which is cloaked by religion — so that
          injustice is the most detestable in his sight which is masked by
          hypocritical pretenses of fair dealing. How deep in the pit must that
          man sink, who is borne down by this double load of guilt in one sin!
          Or if this is not heavy enough, oppression of the poor, whose cause
          God has promised to avenge, will fill up the measure of the sin.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">"But a just weight is his delight."</p></b> For
        the righteous Lord loves righteousness, and beholds the upright with a
        pleasant countenance. Honesty in dealing, though not an infallible mark
        of true piety — must always form a part of it.
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></font>"When
          pride comes, then comes disgrace." </b
        >The contrast between the two branches of this verse gives us this
        meaning. Pride is joined with folly — and ends in disgrace. The humble
        man is wise, and shall be exalted to honor.
        <p align="justify">
          Pride consists in an immoderate self-esteem — and places its happiness
          in esteem and honor from others. No sin is more <i>foolish </i> than
          pride! It springs from ignorance of God, of ourselves and other men —
          and by the very means which it uses for the accomplishment of its
          ends, ensures disappointment. In seeking glory — it finds disgrace.
          Pride made Nebuchadnezzar a brute. Pride destroyed Herod with worms.
          Pride turned Lucifer into Beelzebub. By other sins, man rebels against
          God — by pride, he usurps God's crown and dignity. No wonder, then,
          that God looks upon all those who are proud, and disgraces them.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">"But with humility comes wisdom."</p></b> Humble
        men think of themselves as they ought to think. They desire that God may
        be honored, even at the expense of their own honor. Yet they shall be
        exalted by him to the highest glory. Christ humbled himself, and was
        highly exalted, and became the brightest example of what he so often
        declared, "He who humbles himself shall be exalted."
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 3.</p></font> "The
          integrity of the upright will guide them." </b
        >"I will teach you," says David. And what are the great lessons that he
        introduces by this preface? They are truths which the generality of
        mankind suppose they have already learned:
        <i>it shall be ill with the wicked — and well with the righteous. </i
        >Solomon knew that but few had learned these instructions sufficiently,
        and therefore we find that on them, he insists at considerable length.
        <p align="justify">
          Sincerity is one eminent branch of the godly man's character, and is
          of great use to him, for it guides him in a safe way. The upright man
          earnestly desires to stand perfect and complete in all the will of
          God. While others regulate their behavior by their interests and
          passions, and the course of this world — the upright man endeavors to
          know the will of God, and to comply with it in every instance. Nor
          does he deviate from this role, even when it leads in direct
          opposition to his dearest interests and friendships. Conscious that he
          cannot direct his own steps, he humbly commits himself to Jesus, who
          is given to be a Leader to the people, that he may be led by his
          Spirit to the land of uprightness. Thus the upright man is kept from
          every dangerous mistake.

            "But the crookedness of the treacherous will destroy them."
          </p></b
        >
        Their deceitful conduct shall be, not only the <i>cause</i> — but not
        unfrequently the <i>means </i>also, of their destruction. Nathanael was
        a man without deceit. We accordingly find, that though prejudiced
        against Jesus of Nazareth, his sincerity appeared in the means which he
        employed to arrive at the knowledge of the truth, and he was led by it
        in the right way. Christ's enemies were men of perverse spirits. They
        crucified him with a view to maintain their honor, and preserve their
        nation — but by their perverse conduct both were destroyed.

        <b
          >"Riches do not profit in the day of wrath — but righteousness
          delivers from death." </b
        >"Treasures of wickedness profit nothing," said the wise man, in a
        preceding part of this book. But mistake him not — he did not say that
        well-gotten treasures profit much. Though we should allow that they are
        of some little use in the time of prosperity, they are altogether
        useless in the time of calamity. When God punishes a land — riches only
        make their owners a fairer mark, and a richer booty to the spoilers.
        When conscience stings — its wounds are poisoned by reflections on the
        abuse of riches. They make death more terrible. To the wicked who
        possessed wealth, it shall be said at the last judgment, "I was hungry,
        and you gave me nothing to eat." Nothing of the world shall follow them
        to Hell — but the <i>bitter remembrance </i>of the good things they
        possessed, and the <i>guilt </i>contracted by the influence of such a
        possession.
        <b> <p align="justify">"But righteousness delivers from death."</p></b>
        In Jerusalem's day, the poor and the righteous alone escaped. The
        righteous shall not be held by the first death, nor touched by the
        second death.
        <b

        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          If the righteous man should turn aside from the right way, he shall
          not wander to destruction. His righteousness will rectify his way. He
          cannot enjoy pleasure in the way of sin, for it is contrary to the
          tastes that have been excited, and are still preserved, by the Holy
          Spirit. When Christ's sheep wander into the paths of sin and error —
          the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and his grace shall reclaim
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the wicked wander from mountain to hill, until they fall

        "Who can harm you, if you are followers of that which is good?"
        Righteousness disposes men to walk unblamably and inoffensively, so that
        none but savages will hurt them. There are such savages among the sons
        of Adam — but their mischief shall come down on their own head — while
        the righteous are delivered from their malice; for they wait on the
        Lord, and keep his way, which is the way of life and peace. They cry
        unto God, and God delivers them, not only from their troubles — but from
        all their fears. Christ is the Captain of their salvation, and he will
        lose none of his soldiers. Though they should lose their lives in his
        cause, they are still overcomers.
        <p align="justify">
          Were it possible to obtain a medicine of universal efficacy, who would
          not endeavor to gain possession of it? Or who would drink a poison
          always mortal, except when a remedy were speedily applied? There is no
          trouble from which righteousness does not deliver — nor did any one
          ever meddle with wickedness — but to his own sorrow.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 7.</p></font>"When a
          wicked man dies, his expectation shall perish; and the hope of unjust
          men perishes." </b
        >Men derive almost the whole of their happiness, from the hope of some
        <i>future good</i>. The wicked man laughs at the righteous, because he
        lives by hope. The wicked man himself does the same, with this
        difference — that while the hopes of the righteous are eternal, those of
        the wicked are bounded by time. The expectation of the one has for its
        object things heavenly and durable — while that of the other is fixed on
        objects circumscribed by the present life.
        <p align="justify">
          The present situation of the wicked man never yields him the pleasure
          which he wishes and expects — but there is ever something in view, in
          which, could he but obtain it, he would find rest. If his hopes are
          deferred — his heart is sick; if they are accomplished — he is still
          unsatisfied; but he comforts himself with some other hope, like a
          child, who thinks he sees a rainbow on the top of a neighboring hill,
          and runs to take hold of it — but sees it as far removed from him as
          before.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus the life of a wicked man is spent in vain wishes, and toils, and
          hopes — until death kills at once his body, his hope, and his
          happiness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wicked men may indulge themselves in hopes of eternal happiness too.
          They cannot deny themselves to be sinners — but they hope that they
          are not sinners of the worst sort, or at least that they will amend,
          and fly to Christ, and be as happy through eternity as those who are
          so foolish, or so timorous, as to come into the Lord's vineyard in the
          morning, and bear the burden and heat of the day, and have no better
          recompense in the evening, than those who began to work at the
          eleventh hour.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such hopes are highly pleasing to the devil, who keeps his slaves
          quiet by means of them, until they are brought into the same hopeless
          condition with himself! Were the sun literally turned into darkness,
          and all the worlds now enlightened by his beams, into dreary dungeons
          — it would not be so shocking, as for one immortal soul that looks for
          happiness, to be drowned in eternal despair!

          wicked instead." </b
        >Though Solomon celebrates so frequently the happiness of the righteous,
        he by no means insinuates that righteousness will exempt men from
        adversity. Christ himself suffered, and shall we claim uninterrupted
        prosperity? The wicked often possess wealth and ease, when the saints of
        God are beaten with the storm of adversity — but it shall not be always
        so.
        <p align="justify">
          The saints are delivered, and misery comes upon those who despised and
          hated them. But there is this difference between the troubles of the
          righteous and those of the wicked.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>righteous </i>have first their evil things, and when they
          receive their good things, the remembrance of former distress fills
          them with additional satisfaction. They rejoice, like the
          weather-beaten mariner who has escaped from the waves and tempests.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>wicked </i>have first their good things, and the remembrance of
          them envenoms their misery, and is oil to the fire where they are
          tormented. The wicked never comes out of trouble.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This proverb is often true in a more literal sense, for the wicked
          frequently comes into that very trouble from which the righteous man
          is delivered. The Philistines came into David's place, when Saul was
          pursuing him in the wilderness of Maon. Haman and his sons were hanged
          on the gallows designed for Mordecai; and the enemies of the Jews
          perished on that day which was expected to be fatal to the Jews. Herod
          thought to have destroyed Peter — but God put Peter's keepers and
          Herod himself in his place. The Jews, in the days of the apostles,
          persecuted the Christians; but the unbelieving Jews were put into
          their place, when the Roman eagle was brought to devastate their land
          and sanctuary!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These things are done by God, as often as he sees it proper for his
          own glory, and for the advantage of his people.

        >There are so many mischiefs in the tongue of a wicked man, that it is
        called <i>a world of iniquity</i>. None of them, however, is so bad as
        the deceit that is in the mouth of the hypocrite, whose tongue is like a
        sharp razor, working deceitfully. Abner's hands were not bound when he
        was engaged in fair battle, and we find, that over Asahel, though a
        mighty and a swift enemy, he gained an easy victory. But how different
        was the fate of this victorious champion, when attacked by Joab! Then he
        died as a fool dies, and for this reason — he was <i>deceived </i>by the
        ensnaring professions of friendship made by his treacherous assailant.
        <p align="justify">
          Such is the difference between an <i>open enemy </i>and a
          <i>false friend</i>. Many souls have been ruined by the mouth of the
          hypocrite, while the servants of Satan have artfully disguised
          themselves in the dress of the ministers of righteousness, and by fair
          words, and saint-like speeches, deceived the hearts of the simple.

          It was an ordinary prayer of King Antigonus, "Deliver me from the

        <b>"A man who lacks judgment derides his neighbor." </b>No human
        creature is to be despised, for he is our neighbor. He is our own flesh,
        our brother, sprung from our common father, Adam. We must honor all men.
        Men were made in the image of God; and though that image is now lost —
        it is still a sufficient evidence of the sinfulness of <i>despising</i>,
        as well as of <i>murdering</i>, our neighbor, who was made in the image
        of God. We cannot say whether the people whom we are tempted to despise,
        are not in that happy number of the chosen of God, for whose sakes the
        Son of God has dignified our nature by assuming it, and whom he will
        again beautify with that glorious image which was effaced by the fall.
        <p align="justify">
          Do you allege that your neighbor is worthy of contempt, on account of
          his poverty, or some remarkable weakness, by which he is rendered
          ridiculous? I ask you whether he is a fool. You say, <i>No. </i> Then
          confess that your contempt ought to rest on yourself; for Solomon says
          you are one — and lack of wisdom is far worse than the lack of riches,
          or beauty, or polite accomplishments.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Although it is a sin to despise any man, yet, wicked men are to be
          comparatively despised. The vile person, though clothed with purple,
          and adorned with shining talents, is to be despised — in comparison
          with the man that fears the Lord, though poor and scorned as Lazarus.

        <i>pity</i>. Should some mud stick to his clothes, he will not defile
        his hands by throwing it at his adversary — but rather leaves it until
        time makes it easy to be brushed off.

        <p align="justify">
          But what sort of people are we to avoid or to chose for our friends?
          We must not chose one that takes pleasure in telling everything he
          knows. You may be sure that such a one will betray your secrets; for
          though he should have no malignity of disposition, his delight to tell
          every private story that he has picked up, will prove to him an
          irresistible temptation to expose you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Scripture, however, does not condemn all revealing of secrets.
          There are some secrets which the laws of justice and charity bind us
          to reveal. But it is a proof that a man has no command of his tongue,
          when he can risk the uneasiness and displeasure of his neighbors, by
          publishing matters which can be of no benefit to him to whom they are
          communicated.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But that man is to be chosen as your friend, who is of an honest and
          faithful spirit. Your heart will be relieved of its sorrows, by
          pouring them into his bosom; and you may rest assured that he will
          cause you no uneasiness by <i>blabbing </i>what you would not have the
          world to know.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here we see that a well-governed heart will govern the tongue. An
          unrestrained tongue is an evidence of levity, or of some worse quality
          in the heart. And if the heart is faithful — then the tongue will be
          cautious and friendly. The communication between the heart and the
          tongue is so easy, that the one will certainly discover the quality of
          the other, for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.

          God confuses those whom he intends to punish; and there is not a
          plainer evidence of confusion than when men presume on their own
          judgments, or prefer the counsel of the vain and foolish, to that of
          the sober and the wise. Great is the judgment with which God visits a

          of its concerns. In our intercession for kings, then, let us pray that

          earthly things, that impart a security to which other men have no

        great gainers, by that mercy which they show to others. Though it should
        be considered in no other light than a debt which they already owed to

        If all the wicked on earth should combine with all the devils of Hell,
        to prevent the execution of judgment — it would only be a combination of
        dry thorns against the devouring flame. Do sinners imagine that they
        shall be safe, though so many dreadful threatenings stand pointed
        against them? Let them read with horror that portion of Scripture
        contained in Deuteronomy, chapter 29. from the 18th to the 25th verse.
        The man that hardens his spirit against these words, is an infidel
        indeed!

          But upon mount Zion, and upon Jerusalem, shall be deliverance, and the
          righteous shall enjoy it, and their offspring with them. No believer
          in Christ can secure his unbelieving children — but present
          deliverances are often granted to the ungodly seed of the godly. That
          blemish in David's line, king Ahaz, was not utterly destroyed, because
          God would still give a lamp in Jerusalem to his servant David.

        >Solomon does not deny that beauty is an amiable quality, for he
        compares it to a gold ring. But he denies that beauty without discretion
        can render a woman lovely. The nature of a swine is not altered by its
        being adorned with nose rings, such as those which some of the ladies of
        Zion used to wear. It is still, with all its decorations — a swine; it
        loves the mire, and its ornaments, instead of concealing its ugliness —
        only render it so much the more an object of scorn and of ridicule.
        Every eye will be attracted by it, and every beholder astonished by so
        unnatural a conjunction of vileness and adorning. A beautiful woman may
        be admired for a time — but when her vanity and folly are detected,
        admiration is turned into loathing.

          If beautiful women would gain and preserve the honor that belongs to
          the gracious woman — let them beware of those who are disposed to
          flatter. When their flatterers compare them to angels, and speak of
          their lilies and their roses — let them remember that a wiser and more
          honest man compares beauty, without discretion, to a gold ring in a
          swine's snout. Look to your face in a looking-glass, (said one of the
          wise men of Greece), and if you have beauty, disgrace it not by an
          unfitting behavior. But if you are ugly, make amends for it by the
          beauty of your life.

        Bible. In consequence, indeed, of the remaining darkness of his mind,
        and distempers of his heart — he may desire things not good for him;
        still, however, it is his wish that nothing may be granted him,
        inconsistent with the will of that God, who knows infinitely better than
        his people do, what is good for them; and who will give them what is
        good, though they ask not for it; and who will keep back nothing needful
        for them, however averse to receive it they may be.
        <p align="justify">
          For this reason it is that the desire of the righteous shall always
          end in what is good for them, for their desires are presented to that
          God who has assured them, that if they ask anything according to his
          will, he hears them. No righteous man would for a world consent that
          these words, "according to his will," should be dropped from this
          promise of Scripture. The righteous man is happy when his desires are
          either granted or refined.

        life. The king himself is served by the field. But the gardener, or
        trader in grain, must not withhold or sell merely as it serves his own
        interests — but must consider himself as a steward in God's great
        family, and use that talent with which he is entrusted, for the benefit
        of others, as well as for his own advantage. He must not withhold his
        grain from the market, in order to increase the price, and enrich
        himself at the expense of the poor, and the risk of their life and
        health. If he does so, he counteracts the kind design of Providence in
        making the grain spring out of the earth, and discovers a mean, selfish,
        and unfeeling heart. He grinds the faces of the poor, and tempts people
        to murmur at the allotments of Providence, and to utter imprecations
        against himself. Thus he at once shares in the guilt of their curses,
        and exposes himself to the effect of them; for though such curses are
        very sinful, the sin lies chiefly on the inhumane object who was the
        tempter to them, and they are not to be ranked among the causeless

        superfluous to give both a price and a blessing for their food. But we

          converting and saving the souls of others from death!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They are by the world counted wise, who, by means of their skill in
          business, leave their friends rich. But they shall at the great day be
          declared by the Judge of all wise, who can say, "Behold I, and the
          children which you have given me!" These are my joy and crown of
          rejoicing. Happy are all those who shall be able thus to speak on that
          eventful day, which seals the characters of men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us also learn from this passage, to value friendship and
          conversation of the righteous. If we knew of any tree that bore fruit
          which could prolong the life of man to a hundred years, it would be
          esteemed more valuable than the treasures of kings, and we would spare
          no trouble or expense to have it transplanted into our gardens. What
          value, then, should we put on those whose fruit is the fruit of the
          tree of life, and whose conversation is instrumental in saving souls
          from death!

        <b
          >"Behold, if the righteous receive their due on earth — how much more

        <p align="justify">
          This verse is introduced by a word that calls for our
          <i> attention</i>, and contains an observation which explains all the
          proverbs which express the happiness of the righteous, and the misery
          of the wicked — and answers an objection against them which naturally
          springs up in our minds. It is evident from experience, and Solomon
          himself observes it — that there is a righteous man to whom it happens
          according to the work of the wicked — and a wicked man to whom it
          happens according to the work of the righteous. How, then, can it be
          said of the righteous, it shall be well with them; and of the wicked,
          it shall be ill with them?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are to remember that
          <i>the righteous need trials, and deserve chastisements</i>. David
          suffered many afflictions — but he acknowledges that his sin and folly
          were the causes of them; and it was necessary, in order to keep the
          enemies of the Lord from blaspheming, that he should suffer in his
          person and family, when in the matter of Uriah he had turned aside
          from following the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the recompense of the sins of the righteous is confined to this
          life. They may suffer much severe <i>correction</i> — but there is no
          <i>condemnation </i>to them; for Jesus delivers them from the wrath to
          come and in his blood they have a complete pardon of their iniquities.
          So that their calamities are not the effect of divine <i>wrath</i> —
          but <i>trials </i>of their faith, or the <i>corrections </i>of a
          father.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, if the righteous are chastened so severely, how dreadful is the
          condemnation of the ungodly world! If fatherly corrections break the
          bones and drink up the spirits of God's people — then what imagination
          can conceive the horrors of that inflamed wrath which is the portion
          of the wicked!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Believers smart for sins committed through infirmity, fully forgiven
          through the blood of Christ, and sincerely lamented by themselves. But
          who knows the power of God's anger in crushing the wicked, when the
          day of grace is past, and the time is come to make the praise of God
          known in the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction! "If it is hard
          for the righteous to be saved — then what will become of the ungodly
          and the sinner?"
