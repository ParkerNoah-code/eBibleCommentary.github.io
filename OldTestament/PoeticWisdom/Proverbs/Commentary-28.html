          Asa, king of Judah, was a godly man — and yet when he was reproved by
          a prophet, he stormed instead of repenting. This piece of history
          shows us that we must not despair of reforming those who depart from
          the path of duty, although they are not reclaimed by the first
          admonition. Perhaps they may relent at the second or third admonition,
          and then we are richly recompensed for our trouble. But woe to that
          man who is stubborn and obstinate after many reproofs. He despises a
          merciful appointment of God for his recovery, and tramples upon
          precious pearls. He refuses to bow before the Lord — and he shall be
          dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel! He perhaps designs to reform
          at some other time — but he is hardened in sin, and puts off his
          intended repentance until judgment comes upon him unexpectedly, and he
          is ruined forever! The reproofs which he received will then be like
          hot thunderbolts to him, and the remembrance of them will feed the
          worm that never dies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All of us meet with many reproofs from God. The warnings of his Word,
          and the addresses made to the wicked by the ministers of Christ; the
          kind advices of ministers and friends, the <i>crosses </i>which
          providence brings upon men in the way of sin, and even the
          <i>favors </i> which are showered down from Heaven upon transgressors
          — are admonitions to them to leave the ways of sin. How shall they
          escape the most aggravated condemnation, who continue impenitent?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All of God's dealings with them are aggravations of their guilt, and
          they are not to expect that the day of God's patience will continue
          forever, or that he will strive with them for so long a space as he
          did with the old world. Today, O sinners, if you will hear the voice
          of God, harden not your hearts. Those who fell in the wilderness are
          examples unto you; your guilt will be heavier than theirs if you
          harden your hearts, when such a monument of vengeance is placed before
          your eyes in the Word of God. The oath of God still stands in force
          against those who always err in heart, and refuse to know God's ways.
          Unless God can lie, they shall never enter into his rest!

        <p align="justify">
          Like the ointment that was poured upon the head of Aaron, and flowed
          down to the skirts of his garments, is the administration of a wise
          and pious prince. He diffuses peace and happiness around him. He is
          blessed, and he is a blessing to thousands.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the people groan under the oppression of a wicked prince, and all
          the comfort they have is, that he is not immortal, and that either a
          kind providence will cut him off, or some provoked stroke of violence
          will rid the world of such an intolerable burden.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us bless God for the establishment of our happy constitution of
          government, by which princes are at liberty to do much good, and have
          their hands bound up, in a great measure, from harm, if they were
          disposed to do it. And let us rejoice in that blessed administration
          of grace, under which it is promised that the mountains shall bring
          forth peace to the people, and the little hills by righteousness.

          prostitutes squanders his wealth."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          It is not the youth who has got much knowledge — but he who loves
          wisdom, and takes more pleasure in it than in all the delights of
          sense, who is truly a wise son, and gives joy to the hearts of his
          parents. He who loves wisdom will regard the happiness of his parents
          as his own, and he will have no greater joy than in giving them
          pleasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The love of wisdom will be a preservative from those dissolute courses
          to which young men are too much disposed. But he who follows them
          reveals himself to be and under the reigning power of folly. He spends
          his father's substance, and grieves the hearts of those who are the
          means of his existence. There are indeed stronger motives than the
          loss of substance — but this is a consideration fitted to work on the
          minds of the thoughtless, unless they are so deeply plunged in
          sensuality as to be almost beyond hope of recovery. The everlasting
          world is at a distance, and, therefore, it appears to young men a
          piece of superfluity to think much about it at present — but poverty,
          and the unhappiness of those who love you, are miseries that follow
          hard upon a dissolute course of life. You are double fools — fools for
          time and fools for eternity, if neither present nor eternal punishment
          can convince you of the danger of lewdness and bad company!

          for bribes tears it down."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          If you would you practice integrity, then take heed and beware of
          covetousness. For the love of bribes is sufficient to prevent even a
          king from the paths of judgment. The prince that hates covetousness
          shall prolong his days — but that is not all his happiness. He has the
          pleasure of seeing millions made happy by his means, and rejoicing
          under the shadow of his government. He establishes a land, and bears
          up the pillars of it — for religion and righteousness, which are the
          safety and honor of a nation, are effectually promoted and encouraged
          by him. His authority and influence, his example, and his proper
          choice of magistrates, are unspeakable advantages to his people — and
          a race yet unborn shall rise up and call him blessed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the fountains of justice are poisoned, and the pillars of it
          subverted by a prince that is too fond of money. He perverts law into
          oppression, and makes his subjects unhappy. He destroys the
          foundations of his own throne, and plunges himself and his people into
          inexpressible miseries. He brings down the judgments of God upon a
          land, and is himself one of the greatest judgments that an angry God
          can inflict upon a nation.

          >"Whoever flatters his neighbor is spreading a net for his feet."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon was a great enemy to <i>flattery</i>. He tells us that the
          flatterer works ruin; and that he is as bad as the man who curses his
          friend. Here he illustrates the harm which he does, by comparing him
          to a fowler that catches the unwary birds with his net. The flatterer
          sometimes intends to ensnare the person whom he praises, and to
          persuade him to serve the flatterer's interest, to his own damage.
          "You are a man of a generous and friendly disposition," says the
          fawning hypocrite, "and I am sure that you will serve me in this
          matter." Such arguments win upon a man's vanity, and seduce him to do
          himself the greatest hurt, or to expose himself to very great dangers,
          that he may not disappoint the expectations that are formed of him.
          Many have been cheated into poverty, and many have been deluded into
          sin and Hell by such artifices.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But although the flatterer has no other design but to selfishly
          insinuate himself into the friendship of the person whom he caresses —
          he may be justly said to spread a net for his feet, by betraying him
          into the hands of his worst enemy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We all flatter ourselves; and our self-flattery makes the praises of
          other flatterers welcome, and these gratify and feed our pride, so
          that we are in double danger of falling into the condemnation of the
          devil. If flattery is a net — then we ought to be on our guard against
          it, and to keep a suspicious eye upon those who praise us to our
          faces.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Birds are silly animals, and there is no wonder that they allow
          themselves to be caught in the snare of the fowler; and yet when they
          find themselves fast in the snare, they flutter, and use every
          possible effort to escape. Men are like silly birds when they are
          caught in this net — and they are sillier than birds, when, after all,
          they make the flatterer welcome to their houses, and his fair words
          welcome to their ears!

          and be glad."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Wicked men are ensnared, either when they are seduced to sin, or when
          they are involved in miseries from which they cannot deliver
          themselves — and in both these senses, they find a snare in their
          transgression. One act of sin makes way for another act, and the
          second for a third. The repetition of many sinful acts produces a
          <i>settled habit</i>, which gains an irresistible power over the soul,
          so that the sinner who meant to repent after he had indulged himself
          for a time in the pleasures of sin, finds himself quite indisposed to
          put his resolutions in practice, and walks on in his trespasses until
          destruction comes upon him without remedy!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Besides this, one kind of sin prepares the way for another that is
          worse, because the natural effect of sin is to stupefy the
          understanding, and harden the heart. He who has entered into the way
          of the ungodly, proceeds, in the next place, to stand in the counsel
          of the wicked, and then sits down in the seat of the scorner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wicked men find the thorns and snares of inevitable and irremediable
          calamity in the way of sin, and this will make them at last to curse
          themselves for their folly, in drinking down the delights of sin,
          which they find, too late, to be sugared poisons! They think that they
          walk at liberty, because they have broken the bands of the Lord, and
          cast away his cords from them — but they will groan at the last, when
          they find themselves entangled in the cords of their own sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the righteous are free from these snares, and cannot but sing and
          rejoice, and praise the name of the Lord, when they think of that
          sovereign grace which has delivered them, like a roe from the hunter,
          and a bird from the snare of the fowler. They walk in a safe way, and
          the sins and miseries which others meet in the way of destruction,
          excite at once their sorrow for the miserable creatures that expose
          themselves to such tremendous dangers, and their joy at their own
          happiness in escaping them all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The way of sin is broad — and the way of holiness is narrow. Those
          have reason to mourn, who are traveling to the gibbet, although their
          path should be strewed with flowers. And those have reason to sing and
          rejoice, who are walking over a rugged path to take possession of an
          eternal kingdom!

          no such concern."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          The wise man does not say that a righteous judge will <i> favor </i>a
          poor man in his cause, for that would be to respect people in
          judgment, and to consider his poverty rather than his cause. But he
          tells us that a righteous man will endeavor so to investigate and
          manage the cause of a poor man in judgment, that he shall not lose it,
          for his inability to defend himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such a man was Job. The cause which he knew not, he searched out. He
          delivered the needy when he cried, the poor also, and him who had none
          to help him. He broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil
          from his teeth. Thus he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and his
          judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All just magistrates will endeavor to follow the example of that
          venerable prince, for this is one article of the commission which they
          have from the great King who entrusts them with this power. Lawyers,
          and people in every station, as opportunity offers, are bound to
          testify their righteousness and charity in like manner, as far as it
          consists with the station in which they are placed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the wicked have no such concern for justice to the poor. It is the
          <i>person </i>that he regards, and not the <i>cause</i>. He considers
          which of the two parties will give him most money, and passes such a
          decision, if he dares, as he thinks will tend most to his own
          interest. Or, if he is not yet so far gone in the ways of sin as to
          pervert justice in the most open manner — yet he will not be at the
          trouble of searching out the cause of a man who has no money to pay
          for it, and if his sentence should happen to be right, he is entitled
          to no thanks for it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let judges remember that they must give an account of every act of
          their administration to him by whom kings reign. Let the poor that
          suffer oppression, comfort their souls by considering the grace of the
          Redeemer's administration. He shall spare the poor and needy, and he
          shall save the souls of the needy. He shall redeem them from deceit
          and violence, and precious shall their blood be in his sight.

        <p align="justify">
          The proud in heart stir up strife; and the fire which they kindle is
          not confined within the narrow circle of their own immediate
          connections — but often spreads with fury through every part of the
          city where they dwell. They are <i>public incendiaries</i>, who must
          have everything done in their own way — or, if their pride and honor
          is not gratified, they excite universal disorder, drawing over as many
          as they can to their own party, by all the methods of fraud and
          villainy; and provoking other men by their conduct, until there is a
          kind of civil war raised within the society to which they belong, and
          the city or country is in great danger of destruction. These proud and
          scornful men are the <i>bane </i>of the place where they live — but
          divine providence has scattered some wise men through many places, who
          counteract their harms, and by prudent management, keep under or
          extinguish the flames of contention. To such people, the places where
          they dwell are under the greatest obligations, and they ought to be
          respected — as much as the haughty and insolent deserve to be
          abhorred.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is another sense in which this proverb is verified. Men that
          despise God and goodness, and laugh at instruction and admonition,
          kindle the wrath of God against the country to which they belong. For
          they not only provoke the displeasure of God against themselves — but
          their example corrupts their neighbors — and those who do not follow
          their pernicious ways are in a lesser degree sharers in their guilt,
          when they do not mourn for the abominations of the land, nor bear a
          proper testimony against them. And thus the whole community is
          involved in guilt, and exposed to punishment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But wise and holy men turn away wrath by their fervent prayers, and by
          the success with which their endeavors are sometimes blessed, to
          <i>stem the torrent of corruption</i>. Such men stand like Moses in
          the gap, and prevent the execution of deserved indignation, and they
          justly deserve that glorious character of the <i>protectors </i>of the
          nation. The wicked may call them the <i>troublers </i>of the land —
          but that is no strange thing, for Ahab reproached Elijah in such
          words. The holy seed are the substance and strength of a land. The
          wicked of a land are its most dangerous enemies. Have we any love for
          our native country? Let us reveal our patriotism by endeavoring to
          turn away wrath. If this cannot be done, then perhaps we shall be
          hidden in the day of the Lord's anger; and it is certain that we shall
          never lose our reward.

        <p align="justify">
          Those who keep the law contend with the wicked; and prudence must
          direct us in what manner we should contend with them. Men have very
          different dispositions; some must be addressed with severe and sharp
          reproofs, that they may feel the iniquity of their conduct. But others
          are to be addressed in the language of mildness and gentleness, and
          will be <i> won </i>to goodness, although they could not be
          <i>driven </i>to it. We find that the prophets sometimes thundered,
          and sometimes wept, and sometimes <i> allured </i>men by the language
          of love, to repentance. God, who is well acquainted with all the
          springs of conduct in human nature, taught them to deal with men in
          these various ways — but experience proved how generally this proverb
          agreed with the temper of foolish men. For the prophets seldom had
          much success in their exhortations, though diversified with all that
          wisdom and prudence in which God abounded towards men. The forerunner
          of our Lord, who was greater than the former prophets, lamented unto
          the people of his generation — and yet they did not mourn. Our Lord

          Let us endeavor to turn the wicked to the wisdom of the just by all

          This proverb teaches us to avoid all personal contentions with foolish
          men. For whether we are angry at them, or endeavor by gentle means to
          reason them out of their folly, they will give us no rest — but behave
          in such a manner as may throw us off our guard, and deprive us of
          peace. When conscience and charity do not oblige us to enter into
          disputes with them for their own good, it is best to let them alone,
          except when the object of strife is sufficient to compensate our loss
          of peace.

          The fool, who is so intractable, either storms against the wise man
          who contends with him, or laughs him to scorn, and treats him with
          contempt. If we enter into dispute, we ought to behave with a gentle
          temper. Fury and scorn are the fool's weapons of warfare — but a wise
          man scorns to make use of them. As he wishes to do all things with
          charity, so he can carry on a necessary dispute, either about
          religion, or property, or anything else that will justify a dispute,
          with that meekness of wisdom which befits saints. The enemies of our
          Lord were remarkable examples of the fool's method of managing
          disputes. Our Lord himself is the great example whom Christians are to
          imitate in this and in every other point.

          "If the world hates you," says our Lord to his disciples, "you know
          that it hated me before it hated you." If God's people are conformed
          unto Christ in suffering the hatred of men, they need not think it a
          strange thing, nor allow themselves to be dispirited on that account.
          There are some men whose hatred is better than their love, and such
          are the haters of the upright. They are bloodthirsty men, the
          successors of those who have been drunk with the blood of the saints,
          and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. Every man who hates his
          brother in his heart is a murderer, and those are murderers of the
          worst kind who hate men for that which is good. They are the true
          children of him who was a murderer from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The upright are of an opposite disposition. They seek his well-being,
          (or care for it, as the word is translated,) and it is a comfort to
          the upright to consider who they are that hate, and who they are that
          love them, and care for their welfare. "Hereby know we the children of
          God and the children of the devil. Whoever does not righteousness is
          not of God, neither he who loves not his brother." He who loves his
          brother will be zealous for his welfare, and will endeavor to screen
          him from the malice of the wicked. It is the duty of all men, and the
          disposition of the upright, to deliver those who are ready to be slain
          for their integrity.

          Great is the <i>accounting </i>which rulers must give. For they are
          accountable for thousands of actions which they never committed, and
          of which it is possible they never heard. Their <i>behavior </i>has
          such a mighty influence, that we find, in the history of the kings of
          Israel and Judah, the nation behaving well or ill according to the
          example and influence of their sovereign. If a ruler takes pleasure in
          flattery, the greater part of his servants will be so wicked as to
          poison him with their fulsome and ill-grounded praises. They will make
          him glad with their lies — but at the same time they make him more
          wicked, while they are polluting their own hearts, and debauching
          their consciences, by prostituting themselves to such base means of
          ingratiating themselves with their prince.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The servants of a ruler are still more wicked, if he hearkens to
          <i>slander </i>and <i>false accusations</i>. For some of them through
          fear, and others of them to gain his favor, will join in persecuting
          the innocent, and encouraging that pestilent vermin of a nation,
          called slanderers. The reigns of those princes who gave an easy belief
          to accusations, are stained with the most atrocious crimes. Tiberius
          Caesar put to death the greater number of his own privy counselors, by
          giving ear to lies, and encouraging his servants to be wicked. It is
          probable that the worst action that ever was committed since the fall
          of Adam, the murder of the Prince of life, was occasioned by Pilate's
          wicked and cowardly regard to the temper of that tyrant, and his fear

          The poor too often look with an envious eye upon the rich, specially
          those to whom they are in debt, and the oppressor looks with an eye of
          contempt upon his poor debtor. But what has the rich more than the
          poor — or why should the poor grudge at the riches of another man? The
          Lord is the maker of them both, and gives them equally the light of
          understanding. He bestows comfort upon the poor as well as the rich;
          and although they have not the pleasure of looking at splendid
          ceilings, and fine furniture in their dwellings — yet the cheerful
          light of day shines upon his eyelids, and he beholds those wonderful

        <p align="justify">
          If the rich man has acquired his fortune by deceit, he has no

          light of life, and reason, and comfort, is granted to the poor, at
          least as much as to himself. And the light of grace, which is enjoyed
          by the poor, is hidden from his eyes. He cannot think that the poor
          man is hated by God, because he is not worth so great a sum of money
          as himself; nor can he flatter himself, unless he is sunk in

          souls shut up in the place of utter darkness — when the poor of this

          man, because they are admitted to that world of light into which no
          deceitful man, without pardoning and converting grace, shall be

          cities, by providing powerful navies, and by supporting great armies?
          These things may be useful — but honest government is the best and
          surest way of establishing their thrones, for that will secure them
          the love of their subjects, and render their kingdoms prosperous. And
          what is of still greater consequence, the blessing of the Lord will
          attend that administration, which is managed according to his own
          directions.

          compassion to the poor and needy, and commands the princes and judges
          of the earth to be very merciful to them, and will not allow the
          justice and kindness that is showed them to pass unrewarded. The poor
          may expect good at the hands of all who regard the Word of God — but

          Some parents follow the dictates of their own passion in correcting

          indulgence so foolishly given them, and when they feel the torment

          transient — the pleasure is lasting. The rod and reproof give wisdom;
          and how delightful to a parent, is wisdom in a child! But what if a
          child still continues obstinate? This is not ordinarily the case.
          Correct like a kind parent and a friend — and your child will learn at
          length the duty of a child. Join <i> prayer </i>with your corrections,
          to that God who has appointed them. He never said to any of the seed
          of Jacob, seek me in vain — and he never appointed useless and
          unavailing means for any end. But God is sovereign; perhaps he will
          not be pleased to communicate wisdom by the rod to my child? Make the
          trial. If you should be unsuccessful, you shall be free of those
          tormenting stings of remorse which thousands of parents feel.

          Isaac was the beloved son of Abraham, and never did a parent taste

          hands, when God gave the order; and shall we refuse to administer a
          little beneficial correction to our children at his command? Abraham
          never found so much pleasure in his son, as when he showed that he
          feared and loved God above his son, in not withholding him from God.
          Just so, other parents may look for greater or lesser degrees of
          comfort in their children, as they observe or neglect the commandments

          never heard of the name of a Redeemer, and under the influence of
          corrupt traditions or false prophets, they are serving those gods that
          are no gods, with detestable ceremonies. They are born, like
          ourselves, in a sinful and wretched condition — but are left in utter
          ignorance of that great Savior in whose name our blessedness lies.
          They are left naked and exposed to the assaults of their spiritual
          enemies, who are still walking about seeking whom they may destroy.

          Where there is no Christian vision, the light of philosophy cannot
          supply its place. The Greeks were admirably enlightened by science —
          and yet Paul tells them, that before the gospel of their salvation was
          preached among them, they were strangers to the covenant of promise;
          without God, without Christ, and without hope in the world.

          Blessed be God who made light to arise in darkness to us. Britain was,
          in ancient days, one of the darkest places of the earth — but through
          the tender mercies of our God, the day-spring from on high visited us.
          By the cruelty of the Popish clergy, the <i>key of knowledge </i>was
          almost taken from us in later ages — but through the good hand of our
          God upon us, we have now great plenty of Bibles and sermons.

          Let it be our daily prayer, that all the nations of the world who are
          perishing through lack of knowledge, may be made to share in our
          privileges. But what will <i>unimproved privileges </i>avail? He is
          not the happy man who has a Bible — but the man is blessed who
          delights in it, and meditates upon it day and night; who believes the
          doctrines of it, trusts in the Savior whom it reveals, and respects
          all the precepts of it in his practice.

          then there must be a deeper perdition, and more intolerable torments
          for those who despise both law and gospel.

          >"A servant cannot be corrected by mere words; though he understands,
          he will not respond."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          We apply what is here said to a <i>stubborn </i>servant only; and it
          is plain, from fact, that Solomon meant this proverb only of such, for
          there are many hired servants every way equal to their masters in
          every generous quality, and the character of those servants that must
          be corrected by blows, does by no means belong to them. There have
          been even slaves who have showed a noble disposition, and have not
          only served their masters with fidelity — but performed acts of
          heroism that might have done honor to any station.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But it is very probable, that in Solomon's days, when servants were
          commonly bond-slaves, the greatest part of them were sunk and debased,
          so far as to be of the temper here represented. The<i>
            loss of liberty </i
          >is often the destruction of everything good and noble; and servants
          that were treated like cattle would need a strict hand to govern them;
          because words would not be much regarded by those who had neither
          attachment to their masters, nor any sense of honor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The proverb teaches us that masters ought to keep up their authority
          in their families. Without this everything must be in a state of
          confusion, and go to ruin. If they have servant that will not yield
          obedience, they must either be compelled to do it, or dismissed from
          the house.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But it teaches us likewise, that methods of severity are not to be
          used by heads of families, when milder means are sufficient to answer
          the end. It is only when servants, though they understand the wishes
          of their masters, will not answer by respectful words and due
          obedience, that masters are warranted to use harsh methods of dealing
          with them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let <i>servants </i>learn from this passage, how much God is
          displeased with them, when they are sullen and disobedient to their
          masters. God commands masters to give unto their servants that which
          is just and equal; at the same time he gives them commission to
          support their authority over stubborn servants, by such means as are
          sufficient to answer the end. If servants are reproved with sharpness
          for their faults, they must blame themselves and not their masters.
          The apostle Peter tells them, that they deserve no thanks, if they are
          patient, even when they are buffeted for their faults. If they deserve
          no thanks for their patience under just buffetings — they deserve very
          great blame when they are impatient of merited reproof.

        <p align="justify">
          "Do you see a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a
          fool than of him." But how shall we know the man who is wise in his
          own conceit when we see him? This text gives us a sure mark of such a
          person. When a man speaks everything that strikes his mind, rashly and
          inconsiderately — or when he is rash and headstrong in the management
          of his business, disdaining to take any advice from others, and so
          confident of his own wisdom and abilities, that he takes little time
          to consider the most important undertaking — but pushes on in the way
          that seems best to his own unadvised mind, hoping to command success
          by his own power — then it is evident that he is wise in his own
          conceit. And he who is wise in his own eyes, is the greatest and most
          hopeless of fools in Solomon's estimation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If rashness in the things of this life is a sign of great folly, then
          it is a great deal more dangerous to make too much haste in matters of
          religion. The Bereans are commended because they candidly examined
          Paul's doctrine by the Scriptures of the Old Testament. The apostle
          condemns those who are heady, and joins them with the high-minded; and
          it is certain, that people of that character have been the authors of
          those heresies and divisions which have plagued the church of God, and
          are still the <i>fire-brands </i>of Christian societies.

          There is another kind of rashness in religion forbidden by Solomon as
          a token of great irreverence to God; I mean rashness in vowing or in
          praying. God is in Heaven, and we are upon earth — and therefore our
          words before him ought to be few and well considered.

          The greatest part of masters cannot be blamed for too much indulgence
          to their servants — and yet some err on that side. Solomon, who wished
          us to stand perfect and complete in all wisdom, guards us against it.
          Men must condescend to them of low degree — but they ought at the same
          time to respect their own place and station, and not to debase it, by
          such <i>familiarities </i>towards their inferiors as may expose
          themselves to contempt, and tempt their inferiors to forget their
          distance.

          Joab, by the indulgence of David, became such a great man, that he
          killed the commander in chief of David's army, at the head of his
          troops. As an officer in the army would deserve to lose his place, if
          he did not oblige his soldiers to obey him — so the man shows himself
          unworthy of his station in the family, or church, or nation, who does
          not know the authority which God has given him, and uses no care to
          preserve it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Servants are taught by this proverb, to respect, as well as to obey
          their masters. The apostle Peter enjoins servants to obey their
          masters with all fear, whether their masters are wicked — or good and
          gentle. Whatever condescensions our superiors use in their behavior
          towards us, we must not forget our <i>distance</i> — but give fear to
          whom fear, and honor to whom honor is due. Job was a prince of
          extraordinary goodness to his servants and all his inferiors — yet he
          never, until the time of his severe trials, forfeited, or lost any
          part of that respect which was his due.

        <p align="justify">
          Solomon has told us already, that the angry man stirs up strife. His
          anger pushes him on to bitter contentions, and makes him the
          <i> incendiary </i>of the place where he lives. But strife is not the
          only evil produced by anger, for when it is roused to fury, it becomes
          a fruitful source of every iniquity. We read in the 24th chapter of
          Leviticus, that a man in his passion cursed the name of the God of
          Israel, and was stoned for it. David, although he was a meek man in
          the general course of his life, swore a very rash oath, by the name of
          the Lord, when he was incensed at Nabal.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Railing, and reviling, and backbiting, and evil speaking, and lies,
          and wars, and duels, and murders — are only a few of the
          transgressions to which men have been a thousand times tempted by
          their unbridled anger. He who indulges anger, gives place to the
          devil. He puts that malignant spirit in possession of the throne of
          his heart, and commits to him the direction of his heart, and tongue,
          and hands. The wrath of man never works the righteousness of God; it
          utterly disqualifies him for praying, or doing any other holy action —
          but it works the will of the devil with both hands earnestly.

          and forsake wrath, and let the meekness and gentleness of Christ be
          still before your eyes.

          shall bring him as low as Hell. All men are the enemies of the proud,
          and proud men themselves are the bitterest enemies to one another. For
          other vices unite men in confederacies and friendships — but
          <i>pride </i>has often set fathers and sons, husbands and wives, at
          variance.

          Pride itself is the enemy of the proud, and will bring them down from

          But those whose hearts are humble enjoy true and solid honors. The
          honors of the proud are feathers and wind. They soon fly away and
          never return — but honor shall uphold the man of a humble spirit. His
          crown consists, not of such corruptible things as silver and gold —
          but it is a crown of life and glory which never fades away. He is

          There are remainders of pride even in believers, which, if left
          unmortified, will do them great hurt. For any man's pride (were he as
          good as Hezekiah) will bring him low, until his spirit is effectually
          humbled.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Why does the wise man insist so much on this point? Not because he
          needed new matter for instructing us, for his wisdom covered the whole
          earth, and he filled the world with dark parables. But because
          humility is a lesson which we must learn — and yet are very backward
          to learn. Our Lord frequently repeats this proverb in other words. "He
          who exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall
          be exalted."

          Stealing is an abominable crime. It was to be severely punished by the
          law of God, and is still more severely punished by our own laws.
          Thieves, and all who are partners with thieves, are haters of their
          own souls, for they love money more than salvation. They are the
          enemies of all men — but they are worse enemies to themselves than to
          those whom they plunder. How poor a recompense do they obtain by their
          ill-gotten gains — for the harms which they bring upon themselves
          here, and in the eternal world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are some who would be afraid to steal — and yet they venture to
          partake with thieves in their crime, by receiving a part of what is
          stolen as the price of concealment, or by buying commodities which
          they have reason to suspect for stolen goods, because they can have
          them at a low price. The Scripture assures us, that men may bring such
          guilt upon themselves by partaking of other men's sins; and that he
          who is a partner with a thief, is a hater of his own life and soul, as
          well as the principal thief. The devil is not content with drawing men
          to single acts of sin — but he makes one evil thing the preface to
          another.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The devil makes one transgression a snare for leading the sinner into
          another; and he who joins with a thief, is prepared for lying and
          perjury. In court he is put under oath and dare not testify — and thus
          he adds to the guilt of stealing the greater guilt of falsehood and
          concealment, when he is upon his oath. Those who are under examination
          upon oath, should consider this text. If they swear that they will
          tell everything they know about the affair before the judge, or if
          they are required, by proper authority, to bear witness about a crime
          which ought to be punished — they are enemies to justice, and haters
          of their own souls, if they do not give a faithful and honest
          declaration of the truth. Men may partake of other men's sins, not
          only by <i>countenancing </i>them — but by refusing to concur in
          proper endeavors to have them punished, for a warning to others.

          When men are more afraid of offending their fellow men than of sinning
          against God, they are in great danger of being drawn or driven into
          some of the worst of sins! It was this fear which made David sometimes
          lie, although he hated lying. It was the fear of a woman who made
          Peter deny his gracious master; and the same passion afterwards
          induced him to behave in a very unedifying manner at Antioch, that he
          might not give offence to his bigoted brethren. If the fear of man has
          sometimes misled such men as David and Peter, (and we may add, the
          father of the faithful, and Aaron the priest of the Lord) — then how
          ensnaring must it be to those who are entirely destitute of faith in
          God. Many are kept by it from performing necessary duties, like those
          who believed Jesus to be the Christ — and yet dared not confess him,
          lest they should have been excommunicated. Many are driven to rebel in
          many things against the light of their judgments — to gratify masters,
          or parents, or princes, or friends, whom they wish not to displease.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It will be no sufficient excuse for sin, that the fear of men led us
          into the commission of it. Who are we that we should be afraid of men
          who shall die? Are men more worthy of fear, than the Almighty God? Was
          it right in our first parents to obey the devil, rather than God? Do
          we not imitate their conduct when we prefer the pleasing of men, to
          the pleasing of our Maker? If we rather choose to venture on the wrath
          of God than the wrath of men — can we complain if we have our choice?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The great antidote against the fear of man is confidence in the Lord.
          The true believer, acting like himself, goes on in the path of duty,
          without fearing the wrath of men or devils. "The Lord," says he, "is
          my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is my helper,
          what can mere man do unto me?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In our tormenting and ensnaring fears, our Lord teaches us to discern
          the weakness of our faith. He who trusts in the Lord shall be safe
          from the snares of sin. For his faith is a shield to quench all the
          fiery darts of temptation. He shall be safe from every danger in the
          way of duty, which timorous men fall into. He shall find that there is
          no lion, nor any ravenous beast in the way of holiness. Or if there
          are, that they are chained, and cannot do him any evil which shall not
          turn out to his advantage in the end.

        suffer the effects of their displeasure. Riches, and honors, and
        friendship, and hatred — are under the control of the Ruler of the
        world. Not a hair can fall from our heads, nor can the least addition to
        our comfort be made, without his pleasure.

          A sense of this truth would dispose us to acknowledge God in all our
          ways; to make our requests in all things known unto him with fervency
          of spirit; to thank <i>him </i>with greater cordiality for every happy
          event, than those who were the <i>instruments </i>of his kindness. It
          would be a strong antidote against the ensnaring fear of men, and
          every fleshly confidence. It would keep us from sinking under
          adversity, and from abusing prosperity into provision for the flesh,
          to fulfill the lusts thereof. A persuasion of this truth disposing us
          to cleave unto God, is the best means of ensuring success in all our
          undertakings.

        <i> <p align="justify">Esther</p></i>prayed more earnestly to God, than
        to Ahasuerus, for the safety of her nation, and her success is
        celebrated by the Jews unto this day. <i>Nehemiah </i>acted upon the
        same principle, when he petitioned his master for the place of his
        father's sepulchers — the Lord gave him great favor with the king of
        Persia, and his fame shall live forever. All who place that confidence
        in any creature, which is due to the Sovereign of Heaven and earth, are
        reproved by this precept. They are directed to expect everything they
        need from God as the first cause, although the warrantable means of
        obtaining our wishes, are not to be neglected.

          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Proverbs 29:27.</p></font
          >"An unjust man is an abomination to the just. He who is upright in
          the way, is an abomination to the wicked."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          That an unjust man abhors the just, we have already heard. But how can
          the just abhor the wicked? Christ commands us to love our enemies,
          although our enemies, in all appearance, must be the enemies of God
          also. We are required to love our neighbors as ourselves, although we
          know that great multitudes of them are unrighteous men. How then will
          the law of God permit us to hold the unrighteous in abhorrence? The
          just man wishes no evil to the wicked, for he would have them all to
          be saved. Paul could have wished that he was accursed from Christ for
          his brethren, his kinsmen according to the flesh — although they were
          the worst enemies of the gospel in the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the unjust man is detested by the just, as a rebel against God,
          although, as a man, he is the object of charity. The just man abhors
          the <i>sins </i>of the wicked, and shuns their <i>company </i>and
          testifies by every regular method against their iniquities, and joins
          his influence to bring them under the beneficial rod of discipline.
          His abhorrence of them is a part of his conformity to Christ, who
          exposed hypocrites, and spoke with a voice of thunder against the
          wickedness of men — and yet called all to repentance, and prayed for
          the wicked when they were crucifying him. Hatred to sin in ourselves
          and other men — is one necessary branch of the Christian temper. If we
          are the friends of Christ, we shall be determined enemies to that
          which brought him to a cross.
