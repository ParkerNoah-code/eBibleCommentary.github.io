            "A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Great fame is none of the most desirable objects — but a good
          character and the love of others are frequently represented by Solomon
          as valuable blessings. Riches are greatly esteemed in the world, and,
          under the management of wisdom, serve very valuable purposes — but
          they don't contribute so much to the quiet and happiness of life, as
          the esteem and love of our neighbors; nor do they qualify us so much
          to honor God and do good to men. Paul does not require it as a
          qualification in church rulers to be rich — but he requires that,
          along with knowledge and good behavior, they should have a good report
          among Christians, and even heathen. He was sensible that the most
          useful instructions from a suspected person would have no better
          relish than wholesome food presented in an unclean dish. Our Lord
          requires all Christians to do those good works that are esteemed by
          men, not indeed that they may receive praise from men — but that God
          may be glorified on their behalf. The like exhortations are frequently
          given us by the apostles of Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But we must still remember that a good name and the favor of men are
          not to be compared with the pleasures of a good conscience, and the
          favor of God. For if the friendship of men is so pleasant and useful —
          God is greater than men, and his favor is infinitely more valuable.
          And we have no reason to be vexed if we lose the esteem of men in our
          endeavors to please God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The esteem and good will of men are to be valued chiefly because they
          will enable us more effectually to serve the interests of God's
          kingdom, and to do good to the souls of men. When they are valued for
          their own sakes, they become a snare to us, as they were to some of
          the ancient Jews, who would not confess Christ, because they loved the
          praise of men more than the praise of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When our names are cast out as evil, for a godly cause, we have reason
          to rejoice and triumph, because we are made partakers of the
          sufferings of Christ, that when his glory shall be revealed we may be
          glad also with exceeding joy. If we seek chiefly to please men, we are
          not the servants of Christ — but if we are the servants of Christ, we
          must endeavor for his sake, to please men, for their good to
          edification, and for the honor of his gospel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We must value our character above money, and avoid everything that is
          base, although it might promote our outward estate. We must not only
          attend to the secret duties of religion — but those also that
          recommend it to the world, and take all care that our good be not evil
          spoken of, and that the gospel meets with no reproach by our
          misconduct. We should be thankful to God, if we enjoy the benefit of a
          good name, and employ our influence for the advancement of his glory —
          but we must abhor the thoughts of making any sinful compliances with
          the course of the world for the sake of our credit, remembering that
          instructive saying of God, "Those who honor me, I will honor — but
          those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed."

        <p align="justify">
          Such is the vanity which generally attends riches and power — that
          great men often treat people of lowly station, as if they were some
          lower rank of animals. The poor and rich are made of the same blood,
          and the same glorious power is displayed in the formation of their
          bodies, and the creation of their souls. They breath the same vital
          air, and enjoy the light of the same sun. They owe their support
          equally to the earth — and shall return to the same dust. Their souls
          are equally precious, and shall dwell in the same eternal habitations
          — unless there is a distinction between them of a very different kind
          from that which makes the rich too often to trample upon the poor, and
          the poor to return their contempt with the no less criminal passion of
          envy. They are alike <i>lost in Adam</i>, and have the same right to
          salvation, through Christ revealed in the gospel. They meet together
          in the same family, and church, and nation, and they are useful to
          each other, if they comply with the designs of providence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The rich man's wealth would be of little use to him without the labor
          of the poor; and the rich man ought to return protection and wages to
          the poor. Like members of the same body, they ought neither to despise
          nor to grudge at one another — but to contribute their joint endeavors
          to the good of the whole.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Lord is their common creator and father, and by his providence he
          has made this man rich and the other man poor — and can invert their
          conditions when he pleases, as the experience of every day declares.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Why should the rich man despise his poor fellow creature? Did not he
          who made you, make him? Did not one God fashion you both in the womb?
          Did God frame you of finer clay, or form you of better blood, than
          that of Adam? Or do your riches make you better, or wiser, or even
          happier than the poor man?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The horse is not so much worse than brutish, as to reckon itself a
          nobler animal than another of its own species, because it has got a
          finer saddle on its back. Let not the poor grudge at their poverty,
          and repine at him who has given a larger portion of land and money to
          their fellow men, for he is the Lord. He has given you more than you
          can claim by the rights of justice — and if he has given more to some
          others than to you, he has given them what was his own and not yours,
          and has commanded them to be kind and useful to such as you, in the
          spending of it.

          prudent man sees danger and takes refuge, but the simple keep going
          and suffer for it."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Common prudence will teach men to provide for their security against
          plain and evident dangers. Drunkards, and whoremongers are destitute
          of common sense as well as religion, otherwise they would not rush
          upon certain destruction for a momentary gratification.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This mark of prudence appears chiefly in those who partake of the
          wisdom that is from above. As Noah, when he foresaw the deluge,
          prepared an ark to the saving of his house — so the prospect of the
          <i>deluge of wrath </i>alarms them, and instigates their flight to
          that blessed refuge which God has provided for our souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When Moses foretold the tremendous storm that was to destroy the
          fields and cattle of Egypt, it was seen who of Pharaoh's servants were
          fools, and who were wise. The foolish left their cattle in the fields
          to perish, the wise among them put their cattle under a shelter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now God threatens punishment to sinners in his word — but he is
          pleased in his great mercy to show us where we may find refuge. Christ
          is a hiding place from the storm, and a covert from the tempest; and
          those who are made truly wise, will give no rest to their eyes, nor
          slumber to their eye-lids, until they are hidden under the covert of
          his righteousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Besides that terrible wrath which shall seize upon all sinners at
          last, God oftentimes gives commission to particular judgments, to
          avenge his quarrel upon a land or church. Now prudence will enable us
          in some measure, to discern the signs of the times, and to judge of
          effects from their causes. There are some men so stupid, that they
          will not see God's hand when it is lifted up — but the wise man, by
          the threatenings of the Word and the appearances of providence, can
          see God's hand when it is about to be lifted up, and enters into those
          chambers of safety which are provided for his safety in the evil day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is only sensual and earthly wisdom that teaches men to shelter
          themselves from danger, by venturing on sin, or neglecting duty. This
          is just as wise, as it would be for a man to run upon a drawn sword to
          avoid the scratch of a pin. But the simple walk in dark. They do not
          see the evil coming — or if they see it, they are so senseless that
          they pass on in their dangerous course, until they meet with deserved
          punishment. They are more stupid than many of the brute creation, who
          foresee the storms and run to their shelters.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many of the feathered tribes, before the cold sets in, fly away to
          warmer climates. How then do you say that we are wise, and the law of
          the Lord is with us, if you are more senseless than the beasts of the
          earth, and less wise than the birds of Heaven? Will you call
          yourselves reasonable creatures, when neither reason nor revelation
          can make you so prudent about your best interests, as instinct alone
          renders animals that cannot boast of these precious gifts.

          >"Humility and the fear of the Lord, bring wealth and honor and
          life."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          Many great things are said of <i>humility </i>in Scripture, and many
          precious promises are made to it. But the humility meant, is not that
          false humility that is often found among the proudest of men — nor
          that constitutional modesty — nor that condescension of temper and
          behavior, which is the mere effect of good sense, and is a very
          amiable quality — but not a Christian grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Christian humility is that which has the promises belonging to it, and
          it is always joined with the fear of the Lord. It arises from an
          apprehension of the glorious excellencies of God. For when our eyes
          are open to his awesome majesty — we cannot but perceive our own
          baseness. When we behold his spotless purity — we must be ashamed of
          our own loathsomeness. When we contemplate his solemn authority — we
          feel our obligations to deny our own perverse wills. When his
          sovereignty is felt — we cannot but yield the management of all our
          concerns into his hand. When we have the knowledge of his
          righteousness — we are obliged to renounce our own works, and submit
          to the righteousness of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus Job and Isaiah were humbled. They saw God with the seeing of the
          eye, and humbled themselves in the dust before him. Humility, arising
          from an impression of the glories of God, is attended with other
          Christian graces, and a holy life. The humble man will walk humbly
          with his God, and bend all his endeavors to please the Most High.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By this humility, come riches, and honor, and life. These things are
          greatly valued by men, especially when they attend one another. Riches
          are universally coveted — and yet many who possess them are
          discontented — because they covet the addition of titles and dignities
          to their wealth. And some who have riches and honors in abundance, are
          more unhappy than those who lack them — because they must die, and
          leave their beloved dignities and riches to others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But here Solomon instructs us, in few words, in a short and sure way
          of attaining those blessings, which men so ardently covet, and in
          securing them against every contingency, and even against death
          itself. But if we follow his direction, we must renounce the wisdom of
          the world, which teaches the opposite doctrine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is generally believed, that if men would obtain riches and
          greatness, they must push themselves forward, and make themselves men
          of importance, and that they must not too scrupulously adhere to their
          duty — but in some cases venture to displease God by to secure the
          favor of men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But we are here taught that humility and the fear of the Lord are the
          straight road to everything desirable; and if we believe that God is
          the fountain of life, and every blessing — then the doctrine of
          Solomon will be clear as the light. For to whom do kings give their
          favors? To their friends or enemies — to those whom they love, or to
          those whom they hate? We know that the Lord delights in the humble,
          and takes pleasure in those who fear him. And as he waters the humble
          valleys with the fructifying showers — so he refreshes with his
          abundant blessing, those who are low in their own eyes, and willing to
          render the glory of all that they receive to the Giver. If the humble
          lack anything that is good in this world, they shall possess unfailing
          treasures and a crown of life in Heaven.

        >
        <p align="justify">
          When the children of Israel spared the Canaanites, in opposition to
          the commandment of God — they found the consequences of their sin,
          though it might seem a little one, very troublesome — for the remnant
          of the accursed nations were thorns in their eyes, and snares and
          traps to them, and scourges in their sides. Such shall sin be to every
          wicked transgressor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is generally allowed that the <i>end </i>of transgressors is
          miserable — but we are assured by Solomon that also their
          <i>way </i>is hard, and that it is all covered over with thorns and
          snares!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The tyranny of lusts, <br />
          the cravings of inordinate desires, <br />
          the disappointment felt in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sin,
          which never answer expectation, <br />
          the stings of conscience, <br />
          the bitter fruits of many sins even in this world, <br />
          and the sore rebukes of providence — <br />
          are thorns and briers which pierce the souls of the wicked every day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And as Gideon taught the men of Succoth with thorns and briers — so
          men, if they were not brutish, would learn, from the pains that attend
          or follow the pleasures of sin — that it is an evil and a bitter thing
          to forsake the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The wicked cannot get free of these miseries, for snares are in their
          way, by which they are held fast, as a bird in the snare of the
          fowler. They are compassed by God with a net, and all their efforts
          will be insufficient to disentangle them. There are <i>snares </i>also
          in their way, by which the devil holds them fast in sin — so that they
          cannot get free from his tyranny. They resolve to repent at last, but
          they find that Satan keeps them fast in the cords of their sins. They
          are like galley slaves chained to their work — and nothing but
          almighty grace can work out deliverance for them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such is the malignant nature of sin, that it turns everything into a
          snare, and an occasion of sin. Adversity and prosperity, the comforts
          of the table, the ordinances of God, and Christ himself — are a snare
          to the wicked.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Who is the man who shall be preserved from these snares and thorns? He
          who guards his soul by watchfulness against sin and temptation, by
          prayer, and, above all, by committing it to the care of him who is the
          keeper of Israel. He shall be preserved from every evil thing, he
          shall be far from those thorns and snares which the wicked man is
          continually meeting in his path.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Are these things so? Did not Job keep his soul with all diligence, and
          even the souls of his children — and yet he met with snares, and nets,
          and darkness, in his paths! This cannot be denied — but Job was only
          tried for a moment, to improve his graces, to raise his name, and to
          brighten his crown.

          The people of God may expect manifold tribulations, but, amidst them

          world, compared to the peace that is in him! They shall be preserved
          by the power of God, through faith unto salvation, and while they sow
          in tears they can rejoice in the hope of reaping in joy.

          "Take this child," said Pharaoh's daughter to Jochebed, "nurse him for

          Lord, and he lays claim, in a special manner, to the children of

          recovery, and the way of holiness wherein they should walk. Convince
          them, by methods suited to their tender years and weak minds, that
          true religion is pleasant, and necessary for them.
          <i>Check the first appearances of vice</i>, by such means as will not
          give them a disgust at instruction. Accommodate yourselves in the
          methods of your instructions to their capacities and dispositions,
          that they may be drawn to religion with the cords of love, and with
          the bands of a man.

          Parents do not give the same food to all children — but attend to the

          Correction must likewise have its place in training up your children;

        <p align="justify">
          When children are thus trained up, they will be led into the paths of
          life and peace, and even when they are old they will not turn aside
          out of them. Timothy from a child was trained up in the knowledge of
          the holy Scriptures, and the faith which dwelt in his grandmother and
          mother, dwelt in him also, for the Scriptures made him wise unto
          salvation. It is a great pleasure to parents to see their children
          walking in the truth, and it is an unspeakable heightening of that
          pleasure, when their own instructions and admonitions have been
          blessed by God, as means of conducting them into that good path.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Parents love their children, because they were the instruments of
          their existence — but they will look upon the fruit of their bodies to
          be doubly their children, when they are <i>spiritual </i>fathers to
          them, as well as the fathers of their flesh. How painful must it be to
          the heart of a parent who neglected the training of his child, to see
          the that child walk in the paths of wickedness. Every wicked act in
          such a child, must be a wound in the heart of his cruel father, who by
          his cruel negligence, left his child to be a prey to the devil, and,
          carried captive by that cruel tyrant, to be employed in his hellish
          drudgery.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If the father lives to see him die in such a situation, what a hell
          must it be to his own soul. Even the agonies of a wounded conscience
          are unequal to the torment of reflecting that, in spite of all the
          obligations of nature — his poor child was allowed to be carried away
          by Satan to the lake of fire; where he is now justly cursing the
          parent who brought him into the world, because he never used the
          proper means for preventing that horrible misery, to which he is now
          reduced.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Will children always walk in that way wherein they are trained up? For
          the most part, this will be the case. God is a sovereign dispenser of
          grace, and he is not under any obligation to bestow it upon the
          children of his faithful people — but this proverb teaches us, that he
          often blesses the attempts of parents, to train up their children in
          the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If parents are disappointed in their expectations from their children,
          they will be free at least of those terrible remorses which sting the
          hearts of careless parents, when their children prove wicked. They
          have the pleasing consciousness of having done their duty. They can
          pray, with humble boldness, that God may yet bless his own appointment
          for their children's advantage. For the seed of early instruction may
          be many years buried under ground, and at last spring up. They may
          even form some pleasing hopes, that although they have not the
          pleasure of seeing their houses such as they could wish, they may see
          at the great day, some at the right hand of Christ, who gave them too
          much reason to fear the contrary. The instructions of Hezekiah had no
          influence upon Manasseh, until he had been long in his grave; and yet
          Hezekiah will be able, we hope, to say at the last, "Here am I, and
          the son whom God has given me."

          When Job's three friends endeavored to convince him that he was a
          great sinner, and could make no impression upon him, Eliphaz at last
          ventures roundly to tell him what his transgressions were — but as he
          had only conjecture to go upon, he could only judge what those sins
          were that he was most likely to fall into, and fixes upon those who
          were most natural to a man in his circumstances. Job was the greatest
          of all the men in the east, and therefore Eliphaz tells him that he
          tyrannized over the poor. For he knew that the pride of riches often
          displays itself in such conduct, and that those whose circumstances
          enable them to lend to others, are too often betrayed, by their
          circumstances, into insolence and oppression.

          It is not for nothing that Paul directs Timothy to charge those who
          are rich in the world, not to trust in uncertain riches, nor to be
          high-minded. Rich people ought narrowly to examine their own hearts
          and conduct, whether they are not puffed up with vanity, and disposed
          to behave imperiously towards their inferiors — especially those who
          are obliged to have some dependence upon them, and whose circumstances
          oblige them to be in their debt. Let them remember that they have
          received their riches from God, by whose providence things are so
          managed, that this man is poor — and the other man rich; this man must
          borrow — and another man is able to lend. Let them attend to their own
          absolute dependence in respect of God, before whom the rich and the
          poor are equal, and by whose justice, those who take their brethren by
          the throat, because they owe them a few pence, will have the many
          talents exacted, in which they stand indebted to God.

          This proverb is a warning to men to be industrious and frugal, that
          they may not lose their liberty. Men who labor diligently in their
          callings, need not cringe to the rich, nor live in any man's debt.
          Some people care not how much they borrow, never remembering that the
          day of payment is coming, and that a man has as many <i>masters </i>as
          he has <i> creditors</i>. Paul did not choose to be burdensome to any
          man, nor to be dependant upon the generosity even of those who were
          best affected to him — but he labored, working with his hands, and
          helped by his labors to supply the wants of his friends.

          He who lives in the practice of any sin, is sowing wickedness. For the
          thoughts of the mind, the words of the mouth, and the deeds of the
          hand — are seed which shall spring up and produce a corresponding
          harvest. Men expect pleasure and profit from sin — but it will yield
          them nothing but disappointment and harm. The wages of sin is death —
          and the truth of God stands engaged for the payment. This harvest of
          disappointment and misery is sometimes begun in this world, as Eliphaz
          assures us from his own observation. But the <i>first-fruits </i>of it
          only are reaped at present — the full harvest is at the end of the
          world! Then the wicked will be horribly amazed at the immense crop of
          misery, produced from that seed which they thought had been forever
          buried. In vain do the wicked think that their works are forgotten,
          because they are not presently recompensed. The gardener would be
          thought a fool, who mourned as if he had lost his seed, because he
          cannot reap in the beginning of summer — when all the world knows that
          there must be a long interval between seed time and harvest. The
          wicked shall reap in due time, if they do not repent of their evil
          sowing. Wicked men will not think of these things in time, but indulge
          their pride and folly, and many of them beat their fellow men with the
          rod of their anger, abusing their prosperity for the support of their
          insolence. But their rod shall not always abide in its strength, God
          will wrest it out of their hands, and break it in pieces, and punish
          them with the more dreadful rod of his own wrath. "Do not be deceived:

          "My eye affects my heart," says the mourning and merciful prophet,
          "because of all the daughters of my people." There is a correspondence
          between the <i>heart </i>and the <i>eye </i>in the merciful man. For
          the sight of misery produces compassion in his soul, and the
          tenderness of his heart beams forth in his eyes. The man whose eyes
          are the index of a bountiful heart, is a blessed man, for he enjoys
          the sweetest of earthly pleasures — that of kindness and beneficence,
          and pleasant reflections on his own conduct. He shall be blessed by
          all the wise and good, the blessings of widows and orphans shall come
          upon his head, the hands of the poor bless him, and he shall receive
          abundant blessings from God, who will not leave him unpitied in the
          day of his distress — but make all his bed in his sickness. He shall
          enjoy blessings in his body, and blessings in his outward estate, and
          blessings in his inner man. He shall be blessed in his person, and
          blessed in his family. He shall be blessed upon the earth, and blessed
          in the day of judgment, for his bountiful works performed from a
          principle of faith and charity, will be produced as the evidences of
          his interest in the Redeemer.

        <p align="justify">
          He shall surely be blessed, for he shares of his bread to the poor,

          way, be warmed and filled," while they give them nothing of what is
          necessary for the body. The generous man gives, and he does it with an
          air of kindness which cheers the heart of him whom he relieves. He
          does not give <i>all </i> his bread, for he does not think it his duty
          to rob himself and his family, that he may give to others — but he
          gives liberally out of what he possesses, and that which is left to
          himself is sanctified to him.

          No saint can say that he is perfectly pure from his sin — but every
          saint may safely say, that he is a lover of purity, and a hater of
          hypocrisy. The pharisees loved the <i>reputation </i>of purity — and
          they were very pure in their own eyes. They thought themselves as
          clean as those pots and vessels which they purified with such
          exactness — while they were in reality like cups and platters, whose
          outside was clean — but the inward part filled with every impurity!
          But real saints are more anxious to approve themselves unto God, than
          to enjoy reputation from men — and their outward holiness proceeds
          from a love of purity in the heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The pureness of heart, here meant, consists chiefly in sincerity and
          uprightness, and stands opposed to all deception and hypocrisy. A pure
          heart is necessary to grace in the lips, which must be directed by an
          honest heart, and admit no pollution of flattery and doubleness, which
          so much stains the communication of a great part of mankind. The lips
          may assume an appearance of purity and sincerity, when there is none
          in the heart — but this empty appearance cannot be long supported. A
          very small degree of sagacity will enable a man soon to discover it,
          and the discovery is attended with abhorrence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Grace in the lips is necessary to reveal pureness of heart. We ought
          always to speak the words of truth — but we ought to speak it in the
          most pleasing manner possible, that we may not render it unacceptable
          by our manner of representing it. Daniel showed his integrity and
          politeness at once, by the manner of his address to Nebuchadnezzar,
          when he was called to give him very disagreeable information.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Every man ought to be a friend to the man of integrity, and the king
          himself, if he is not an absolute fool, will be a friend to him who
          joins purity of heart with gracefulness of tongue. Daniel, the
          captive, on this account, found favor with two haughty kings of
          Babylon.

          It is the general opinion, that <i>flattery </i>is necessary in our
          conversation with great men, if we wish to recommend ourselves to
          their favor — but the surest way of gaining and securing the favor of
          any man, is to seek above all things the favor of Him who has the
          hearts of all men in his hands.

          The favor gained by flattery and fawning, soon decays.

          When knowledge in the mind is attended by pureness in the heart and
          grace in the lips — they form an amiable and worthy character, which
          draws to it the eyes and hearts of wise men. But that is not the
          principal recommendation of it, for the eyes of the
          <i>Lord himself </i> preserve knowledge, and watch for good over the
          man whose lips and conversation are regulated by it. The king should
          be his friend — but there are <i>Ahabs </i>among kings who have no
          sense — but love only those who speak pleasing things to them, whether
          true or false. But the King of kings will surely be his friend; his
          eyes are upon him for good, and every loss that he sustains for his

          But the words of the transgressor are overthrown by Him. He

          It is <i>mostly </i>safe to follow the counsels of a wise man, for

          <i>always </i>safe to follow the counsels of God, who can insure and
          command success, and will not allow any man to lose in the end, by
          obedience to his will. God did not indeed interpose in the same
          visible manner, for the support of John Baptist, as he had formerly
          done for the preservation of Shadrach and his companions. But John the
          Baptist had done his work, and was fit for a better world, and this
          world was not worthy of him. We cannot suppose him a loser, because
          his integrity procured him the crown of martyrdom, and he now praises
          God as cheerfully for the administrations of providence towards him on
          earth, as the three children who escaped the violence of fire, or he
          who came unhurt out of the lion's den.

          The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold, and he will not move
          out of his house lest a lion should meet him, and kill him in the
          streets. This is a very odd excuse for his <i>laziness</i>. Lions are
          seldom found in the fields in the day time, and it is a very
          extraordinary thing, if they are found in the streets. Does the
          sluggard himself believe there is any truth in it? If he does, why
          does he sleep in his house, since it is possible that it may be set on
          fire by some accident in the night? Why does he ever take a meal, for
          some have been choked by the bread which they put into their mouths?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When we are employed in the duties of our calling, we need not vex
          ourselves with the apprehension of lions. "I will give my angels
          charge over you," says God, "and they shall keep you in all your
          ways." You shall tread upon the lion and adder, the young lion and the
          cobra shall you trample under your feet.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But let the sluggard remember that there is a lion in that bed where
          he dozes away his time, and in that chamber where he sits folding his
          arms together. The <i>devil </i>goes about like a roaring lion seeking
          whom he may devour, and he rejoices greatly when he lights upon a
          sluggard, for he looks upon him to be a sure prey! Poverty, like an
          armed man, is fast marching up to the sluggard, and will soon prevail
          against him, like a king prepared to the battle.

          We are safe from the lions in the way of duty — and never safe when we
          avoid it. Lions, when they met David feeding his sheep, were torn in
          pieces by him. A lion unexpectedly came upon that young man of the
          sons of prophets, who declined his duty when he was commanded to smite
          his neighbor, and tore him in pieces.

          Those who fall into this ditch are cursed, for it is a proof of the
          Lord's abhorrence, when men are allowed to fall into it; and
          therefore, in order to be preserved from this danger, it is necessary

        <p align="justify">
          The heathen were given up to it, as Paul tells us in Romans one, for

          their abominable worship, and God in justice allowed them to dishonor
          their own bodies, and to make themselves brutes, as they had
          represented God himself by the images of brutes.

          Has God left us to fall into this sin? Our situation is very
          dangerous, for nothing less than divine power can raise us out of this
          ditch. And how can we expect miracles of divine power to be exerted in
          our behalf, when we have drawn upon ourselves the sore displeasure of
          the Lord? But our situation is not altogether desperate, for
          <i>miracles of mercy </i> have often been performed by the Lord. Let
          us acknowledge his justice, and humble ourselves under the tokens of
          his displeasure, and look to him with earnest expectation and ardent
          cries, until he raises us up out of the deep pit, and sets our feet
          upon a rock!

          Men generally treat children like play-things, and amuse themselves
          with their childish tricks and follies.

        <p align="justify">
          But there is another kind of foolishness in children, which is too
          serious and mournful to be the subject of sport. <i>Sin </i>is the
          very essence of folly, and sin dwells in young and old, and none of
          the children of Adam can ever deny that he was shaped in iniquity and
          born in sin. This <i>sinful foolishness </i>dwells in the hearts of
          children, and makes their way perverse and wicked — for their
          understanding is darkened, their will perverted, their affections
          sensualized, and their disposition is rendered averse by sin, to
          everything good — and it is turned to evil. Sinful foolishness is
          bound in the heart by cords that no man can loosen, and entwines to it
          like ivy to the walls of a house. It is not more natural for a man to
          breathe, than for a child of Adam to violate the law of the Lord, and
          to covet forbidden fruit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When parents rejoice with a fond heart over the fruit of their bodies,
          they should remember that they were the instruments of conveying a
          <i>corrupt nature </i>to their children, and be deeply concerned to
          have this mortal disease effectually cured.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But how can this be effected? Who can bring a clean thing out of an
          unclean; or who can say that he has made either his own heart or any
          other person clean? God alone can loose the bonds of sin, and drive
          foolishness away from the heart, and therefore his grace must be
          sought for this end. But while his favor is earnestly supplicated, the
          <i>methods </i> appointed by his wisdom are to be used with a
          dependence on his blessing. Parents ought to join <i>correction </i>to
          <i>instruction</i>, and to use it as an appointment of God, on which
          his blessing may be expected.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The rod of correction shall drive this foolishness far from the child,
          and he is a cruel parent that loves the ease of his son, more than his
          soul — and would rather see him grow up in folly, than endure those
          painful feelings which compassionate parents suffer, when they are
          scourging the son whom they love.

          gifts to the rich — both come to poverty."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          Sin pays its servants very bad wages, for it gives them the very
          reverse of what it promised. While the sin of oppression or injustice
          promises mountains of gold — it brings them poverty and ruin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is a flying scroll of curses which enters into the house of the
          thief and the oppressor, which consumes it with the timber and stones
          of it. Injuries done to the poor are sorely resented by the God of
          mercy, who is the poor man's friend, and will break in pieces his
          oppressor. The threatenings of God against the
          <i>robbers of the poor </i>are sometimes laughed at by the rich and
          great — but they will find them in due time to be solemn realities.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But if the oppression of the poor is an impoverishing sin — then will
          not liberality make a man rich? <i>True </i>liberality, exercised to
          <i>proper </i>objects, will. But not that which is exercised to the
          rich. Some give to the rich for the same reason as they oppress the
          poor. They propose to gain the favor of the great, and to receive
          tenfold for every present they make, and so they expect to be soon
          rich. But he who gives to the rich with these motives, shall surely
          come to poverty. If he would give to the poor he might have an
          hundred-fold, but he has only God's Word for that — so he rather
          chooses to trust the generosity of rich men. But when they see the
          trick, they are on their guard, and will pay with scorn, the man who
          designed to <i>impose </i>on them with deceitful professions of
          regard.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is plain from reason, as well as Scripture, that it is not always a
          sin to give to the rich — but it is very often a sin; and that, not
          only when men are in danger of hurting their families, or wronging
          their creditors by it — but likewise when they give that to the rich,
          which are due to the poor. We are not <i>proprietors </i>but
          <i>stewards </i>of the gifts of God's providence, and must distribute
          that which he has entrusted to our care according to his will. And it
          is his pleasure that we should make to ourselves friends, by the
          mammon of unrighteousness — not of the rich but the poor.

          especially the <i>precepts </i>of it, which we are too ready to look
          upon as a heavy burden, and a grievous yoke. Solomon was well
          acquainted with the heart of man, and knowing how many would read or
          hear his excellent precepts without bestowing proper attention on them
          — he rouses us by frequent calls for our most earnest heed to the
          things that are spoken. We must bow down our ears to hear him with
          attention, reverence, and humility. The words of the wise deserve this
          regard from us, for they are means of communicating their wisdom to
          us.

          Honey from the comb is sweet to the taste — but all the words of God

          they give refreshment to the inner man. Shall we value those things
          that are delightful to the organs of taste — and yet despise those
          pleasures that fill the soul with heart-felt satisfaction? Shall every
          joy be pursued with eagerness — and that only despised which arises
          from the Word of God?

          Do you say that you never received any pleasure from the Word of God,
          and that an entertaining history gives you more entertainment than
          anything that Solomon has said? The reason is too obvious. Solomon
          tells you that the words of instruction are pleasant to a man when
          they are kept within his heart. It was a severe reflection, which
          Christ made upon the Jews: My word has no place in you. The same may
          be made, with too much reason, upon those who taste not the sacred
          joys of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As the Word of God is pleasant to the relish of a saint, so its
          dwelling in the heart is attended with happy consequences, for it

          communicate that knowledge which he does not possess. But clear and
          distinct apprehensions of things, will always enable a man to speak of
          them with ease and plainness, to others. The application of the

          all self-confidence. And the whole strain of his proverbs, wherein he
          constantly insists on the advantages of righteousness, and the misery

          Their value lies not in a glittering appearance, like gold, and

          A <i>scriptural </i>knowledge will preserve us from being like
          children, tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine — of which we
          are in constant danger while we are unacquainted with the Scripture,
          although we had the knowledge of every truth in our religion, by
          instruction from men. But there is still another great advantage
          arising from a serious regard to this book. By establishing our minds
          in the truth, it will enable us to satisfy others that send to us for
          information about the principles of truth and duty. Men were not born
          for themselves only, we are members one of another, and ought to
          consult the good of the body, and of other members of it besides
          ourselves. As men, when they perform the duties of their callings, are
          useful members of civil society — so if we live as befits saints, and
          seek after the knowledge of the truth, we will be useful members of
          the church of Christ, ready to give an answer to everyone who asks us
          a reason of our faith and hope, to instruct the ignorant, to satisfy
          the doubts of the scrupulous, and to fix those who waver. Such are the
          pleasures and advantages to be found in the book of God, and in the
          Book of Proverbs in particular.

          He has gained every point, says an heathen poet, who has mingled the
          <i>pleasant </i>and the <i>useful </i>together. These attractives of
          the soul are nowhere joined together with such exquisite skill as in
          the Word of God; and if we read it with a superficial eye, and hear it
          with an inattentive mind — we despise not men, but God. We despise
          him, when he is employing all the methods of divine condescension and
          wisdom to recommend his truths to our hearts.

          needy in the gate."
        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>gate </i>was in ancient times, among the eastern nations, the
          place of judgment, and therefore this instruction is be understood to
          respect <i>judges</i>. They are forbidden to take advantage of the
          friendless and indigent circumstances of the poor and afflicted — to
          oppress them by perverting justice in favor to the rich. The Scripture
          forbids us to show <i>favoritism </i>to a poor man in his cause — but
          it is far worse, and more ordinary, and therefore more frequently
          forbidden, to <i> oppress </i>a poor man in judgement. This is a
          crying sin, which contains, together with injustice, the most
          unmerciful cruelty, and is a plain evidence of inhuman and cowardly
          disposition.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This was one of the sins for which Eliphaz guessed that Job's
          calamities had come upon him — but that godly man was a very opposite
          spirit. He did justice to all men — but to the poor he was merciful as
          well as just. Job says, "if I have raised my hand against the
          fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court — then let my arm
          fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Not to relieve the poor and afflicted, when we can do it without
          injury to ourselves, is wrong. To oppress them, and add to their
          affliction, is brutal and monstrous. It is to act not like men — but
          like the monsters of the desert, which prey upon the weaker animals.
          For magistrates to be guilty of this crime, is a perversion of an
          institution of God into an engine of abominable wickedness. If poor
          men had rich friends to plead their cause, or avenge their injuries —
          then others would not rob them because they are poor. Well, they have
          a friend who will plead their cause and break their oppressors in
          pieces. If a great man should take the cause of a poor man, he would
          reckon himself safe — but God is infinitely greater than any man, and
          here it is declared that he will be the advocate and avenger of the
          poor and oppressed.

          God pleads their cause with admirable eloquence in his word. "What do
          you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor? — 
          declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty." Who can answer such pleadings
          as these? However, wicked men look upon God's Words to be but
          <i> wind</i>.

        <p align="justify">
          But God will plead the cause of the poor, by furious rebukes of
          providence also. He will render unto their oppressors severe vengeance
          for their wickedness. Have they rifled the poor of their
          <i>little all? </i>God will rifle the oppressor, not only of his
          substance — but of his life and eternal soul!

          The robber of the poor, is a poor unhappy creature. It is terrible to
          have the justice of God engaged against a man — but this is the
          unhappy case of the robber. He may obtain a temporary success in his
          extortions — but when he makes an end of robbing, he must be robbed
          himself. He has the <i>mercy </i>of God against him, as well as his
          <i>justice</i>. Mercy is that pleasant attribute of the divine nature,
          on which all the hopes of the wicked must rest — but the mercy of God
          is engaged on the side of the poor and afflicted, <i>against </i>their
          persecutors.
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Mercy</p></i>and <i>justice </i>meet together in
        this text, and make it both a <i>promise </i>and a <i>threatening</i>.
        What a terrible case is it, to have grace itself turned into a terror;
        and to be under the wrath of God, because he is merciful! Yet such is
        the actual condition of those whose conduct is a contradiction at once
        to the rules of justice and mercy. "It shall come to pass," says God,
        "that when the oppressed cries unto me, I will hear, for I am gracious."
        <p align="justify">
          Let the mercy implied in this declaration, encourage the poor and
          afflicted to make God their refuge. Your tyrants may look upon these
          words as empty threatenings, which shall never have effect — but it
          would be a very ungrateful return in you for so much goodness, to
          consider them in the same light. The words of God whereby he
          encourages the needy, are pure words — they are like silver seven
          times purified. Have you such a glorious advocate? Then commit your
          cause to him, with meekness, in imitation of our great example. Make
          no deceitful compliances to avoid oppression, and take no
          unjustifiable steps to preserve yourselves — but trust to your great
          advocate, who stands at the right hand of the poor to deliver him.

          Friendship is the balm of life, when it is entered into with
          discretion — but it is a plague and a snare, when it is injudiciously
          contracted. Our divine teacher wishes us to be happy both in this
          world and the next, and extends his instructions to everything that is
          connected with our happiness. He forbids us to enter into friendship
          with any wicked man, and here he cautions us particularly against the
          friendship of angry people. We must of so much as keep company with
          angry men, nor take a walk with them, if we can possibly avoid it. But
          what will be the great evil of making friendship with a man of this

        </b>
        <p align="justify">
          We are either like our friends — or will be like them soon. Friendship
          has a mighty influence upon our conduct. "Bad company corrupts good
          character." When we see bad things practiced by those we love, the
          horror of them abates, and we are insensibly drawn to the practice of
          them. And if we make angry men our friends and companions, we are in
          great danger of becoming like to them, on another account. Although we
          should be good-natured — yet their unreasonable behavior will be apt,
          on many occasions, to set our temper on fire, and from occasional
          bursts of anger, we may be led by degrees to
          <i>contract obstinate habits </i>of getting angry on every trifling
          occasion. For habit is produced by frequent acts, and in time becomes
          a second nature.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus we are in danger of being ensnared into sins of fatal consequence
          to our souls, for although anger is not always a sin — yet to be under
          the government of imperious passions, is very sinful and very
          dangerous.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our lives may be exposed to danger if we walk with furious men. When
          Cain walked with Abel in the field, his furious passions subdued his
          reason and his natural affection, and he slew his brother. There have
          been many <i>Cains </i>in the world, who have wounded or slain their
          friends by the impulse of fury.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But if we should escape this danger — yet by contracting a habit of
          being angry, our tongues may in time become rebels to reason, and
          bring down harm on our heads.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Consider this proverb, you who give a loose to your passions. Perhaps
          you suppose that you have good qualities to atone for this bad one.
          But you are quite mistaken. The meaning of this instruction is plainly
          this, that no good qualities should induce us to enter into friendship
          with an angry man. It is taken for granted, that a passionate man may
          have some qualities that would engage esteem, if they were separated
          from this wretched temper — for otherwise no person would be in danger
          of contracting an intimacy with a furious man. But it is plainly
          asserted, that these qualities in conjunction with such a temper,
          forfeit their claim on our friendship.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Don't you see, then, that your miserable temper casts a shadow over
          everything that might otherwise adorn you, and that you are fit only
          for a desert, where you can disquiet none but yourselves. God himself
          is so much displeased with you, that he will allow none that will take
          his advice to be intimate with you, or so much as to keep your
          company. Fly then to his mercy for pardon, and implore the exertions
          of his power, to subdue your ungovernable passions. Let your souls be
          impressed with the example of our meek Redeemer, and watch over your
          hearts, that you may not again disturb the peace of society, and
          deserve to be sent forth to dwell among the beasts of the desert!

          Solomon has already said much against rash suretyship — but bad
          examples have a greater influence upon many people, than good
          precepts, and because many others make little scruple of putting their
          name to a bond for another man, we are in danger of being seduced into
          the same dangerous practice. But before we follow any man's example in
          anything, we should observe what the outcome of it is likely to be.

        <p align="justify">
          If other men do bad things, and smart for it, it will be no motive to
          a wise man to run into the same error. Let us at least consider one
          thing, in this case: Suppose the principal debtor should prove unable
          to pay the creditor, will we be cheerfully willing to take his place,
          or are we sure that we will be able, it called upon, to pay his debt?
          We are rich at present — but we know not whether we will be rich or
          poor at the day of payment. And,

          under you."</b
        >
        <p align="justify">
          You may say, it will never come to this. The law of Christ will not
          allow the creditor, to exercise such rigor, if I should be unable to
          pay. How do you know that? Are you sure that the creditor, and his
          heirs, and executors, will not depart, in any instance of conduct from
          the law of Christ, when their interest pushes them, and the laws of
          the land will bear them out.

          Religion, you see, allows and requires us to pay a proper attention to
          our own interest and comfort. It requires no instances of self-denial
          — but such as are more for our own interest, than self-gratification
          in those instances would be. It does not forbid us to love ourselves,
          when it requires us to love our neighbors as ourselves. Indeed, we
          cannot hurt ourselves, for the most part, without hurting some other
          men also. What can we do for the poor, for our families, for our
          friends — if our bed is taken away from beneath us?

          A philosopher, when he saw a generous young man spending his substance
          too liberally upon one who pretended great poverty, told him that
          "perhaps the man he was serving was an honest man — but he was certain
          that he himself was honest; and therefore," added he, "you are doing
          an unjust thing, for you are ruining an honest man, for one who is,

          Naboth would not sell the inheritance which his father had left him,
          when he was offered a very good price — but there are some who have so
          little respect for their fathers that they will remove, if possible,
          the landmark which their fathers have set — and so little regard for
          justice, at the same time, that they intend to give no price at all
          for what they add to their estate by such unjustifiable means.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It may be alleged by the covetous, that our fathers were under a
          mistake about the just bounds of their inheritance. Could that be
          proved to the satisfaction of the other party concerned, or to the
          conviction of the judge — it would be a good plea. But this can seldom
          be done. If ancient custom is not allowed as a good claim to property,
          nations might soon be convulse and broken in pieces.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Landmarks are means of preserving peace, as well as maintaining
          justice, and therefore the removing of them is a breach both of peace
          and honesty. It is so great a sin, that a solemn curse was pronounced
          against it from Mont Ebal. It is more than three thousand years since
          this curse was pronounced, and we learn from it that land marks were a
          very ancient means of distinguishing property. It is the will of God
          that men should know what is their own, and that every unrighteous
          invasion of another man's property, is an abomination to him.

          To be a busybody in other men's matters is a scandal — but it is a
          pleasant sight to behold a man diligent in his own business. Some
          people look upon the slothful, not to receive instruction, as Solomon
          did — but to take encouragement to themselves, in following his
          example or in being only a little better than he is. They would not
          choose to be the greatest sluggards in the world — but if they can
          name a man more slothful than themselves, they think that no man is
          entitled to censure them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Solomon directs us, on the contrary, to look upon the industrious man,
          that we may be excited by the advantages which he gains by his labor,
          to go and do likewise. Such a man shall stand before kings. This does
          not imply, that every man who deserves this character can expect the
          honor of being appointed to the high offices of state — but it points
          out to us that great activity is necessary in the servants of kings,
          and that great activity in private stations is the way of obtaining
          honor and advancement.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If the diligent man does not obtain the honor of standing before
          kings, his industry, with God's blessing, will, for the most part,
          preserve him from the disgrace of standing before obscure men. Some
          women, by their industry, joined with other virtues, have obtained the
          honor of an alliance with the noblest families, of which Rebecca and
          Ruth are famous instances. If we are diligent in our spiritual
          business, the advantage will be vastly greater. Let us watch, then,
          and pray always, that we may be accounted worthy to escape those
          miseries which shall come upon the wicked, and to stand before the Son
          of Man.
