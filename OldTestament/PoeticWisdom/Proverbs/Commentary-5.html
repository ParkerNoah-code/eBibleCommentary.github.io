          In this chapter we are cautioned by the wise man, against rash
          suretyship, idleness, mischievousness, and especially against
          impurity, together with a variety of other sins, exceedingly hateful
          to God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The first five verses contain a warning against suretyship.

        <b
          >"My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have
          struck hands in pledge for another, if you have been trapped by what
          you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth"</b
        >
        God graciously directs our temporal affairs by his providence, and
        condescends, in his word, to give us instructions concerning them. If we
        do not regard these instructions, we need not be surprised though his
        providence convinces us, by dear-bought experience, of our folly and
        sin.

        <p align="justify">
          God forbids us to become a surety, even for a friend, (except for some
          weighty reason,) and to strike hands with a stranger, in token of our
          becoming bound for our friend's debts. Men who think only of the
          present time, are generally too rash in undertaking; but they ought to
          remember, that the time to come is before them, and will be present
          time when the time now present is past. If the money were to be paid
          just now, they would hesitate and deliberate before acting, lest they
          should wrong their families; but Solomon tells them, that men may
          ensnare and entangle themselves with the <i>words </i>of their mouths,
          as well as with the <i> works </i>of their hands. This consideration
          may alarm those who have already implicated themselves by such
          engagements. This kind teacher, therefore, puts them on a plan to get
          free.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 3.</p></font>"then do
          this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your
          neighbor's hands: Go and humble yourself; press your plea with your
          neighbor!</b
        >
        By rash suretyship, you put yourself into the power, not only of the
        creditor — but of the debtor, for whom you are bound. You lie at his
        mercy. He has it in his power to make you hurt severely for your foolish
        kindness to him.
        <p align="justify">
          The world is full of complaints about ungrateful men, who have basely
          abused, to the hurt of their benefactors, the goodness they have
          experienced. Endeavor, therefore, by the humblest behavior toward your
          friend, to induce him to take the proper steps to bring you out of
          your present embarrassed situation; for if you peevishly reflect on
          him as the means of bringing you into it, he may be provoked to use
          his advantage to your loss. The wise man is very urgent with his
          scholars to take this step.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 4, 5.</p></font>"Give
          not sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eye-lids. Deliver yourself
          as a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand
          of the fowler." </b
        >A gazelle and a bird are creatures destitute of reason — yet when
        entrapped by the arts of the sportsman, they will try every method of
        escape, and make no delay in using every effort for regaining their
        freedom. May not equal prudence and attention to their own interests, be
        expected from reasonable creatures!
        <p align="justify">
          But what is the great importance of this precept, that Solomon will
          not allow his disciple to rest until he is free from these rash
          engagements? Has this precept any connection with our spiritual
          interest? It has! It is a part of the eighth commandment, and though
          men regard it rather as a loss than a sin to endanger their outward
          estate, it is both a sin and a temptation. Men who once seemed upright
          in their dealings, have brought reproach upon religion, by living and
          dying in other men's debt, and by having recourse to unjustifiable
          methods, suggested by distress, to relieve themselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The effect of suretyship, even with the most upright men, has often
          proved hurtful to their souls, embittering their days, and unfitting
          them for the cheerful services of religion. It has frequently rendered
          them unable to perform those services to God and to his church, for
          the sake of which a competency of the good things of life is to be
          valued. We are the servants of Christ, and must not disqualify
          ourselves for his service, by making ourselves needlessly the servants
          of men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The precept here given may remind us, how foolish it is for us to make
          ourselves debtors to <i>divine justice</i>, to please any friend in
          the world. When one tempts you to commit any sin, however small,
          consider whether it would be wise in you to make yourselves debtors
          even to man on his account. As we are all in debt to God, let us give
          no sleep to our eyes, until we implore his mercy.
          <i
            >How powerful must be that lethargy which closes in sleep, eyes that
            shall awake in Hell, if another day of life is not granted by the
            abused long-suffering of God!
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          We may be ashamed to humble ourselves to our friends, or our
          applications to them may be fruitless. But God is equally glorious in
          majesty and mercy. He delights in forgiving thousands of talents. The
          wise man next proceeds to warn us against
          <i>the vice of slothfulness</i>, to which he was a constant enemy.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 6.</p></font>"Go to
          the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise."</b
        >
        God has taught us more than the beasts of the earth, and made us wiser
        than the birds of Heaven. But the sluggard does not equal in wisdom the
        least of insects! He complains that he is not <i>able </i>to work — but
        has he less strength than an ant? "The ants, (says another wise man),
        are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the
        summer" — they therefore shall be his judges.
        <p align="justify">
          Why has God made such a multitude of creatures, that are of no use to
          man? Why has he made some that destroy his property? This is a vain
          question. We are sure that God has made them all in wisdom, and that
          he has made some of them <i>teachers </i>of wisdom to us. The ant
          devours some part of our sustenance — but it will pay us well for it,
          if we are wise enough to improve by its lessons. Every ant-hill is a
          school, and the wisest of men gives these little animals a
          testimonial, recommending their instructions to us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That man makes a god of his belly — who thinks no creature of any use
          to us but such as gives us its flesh to eat, or its labor to provide
          for our sustenance or comfort. The wisdom which some of them teach is
          far more valuable than the food with which they supply us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Other creatures are teachers to us as well as the ant. Look on the
          whole brute creation, O atheist, and confess their Maker! Go to the
          oxen and the donkeys, O unthankful man, and be wise to acknowledge
          your Benefactor! Consider the birds of the air, you who are of little
          faith, and trust the providence of God!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Why does the wise man single out the ant as a teacher of wisdom to the
          sluggard? Agur gives us one reason in the 30th chapter of this book —
          their weakness, which may render the sluggard ashamed of his silly
          excuses. Another reason we find assigned by Solomon in this place.
        </p>

          has no commander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions

        >
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>bees </i>are a very industrious people — but they have a
          <i>queen </i>to require their labor, and if she dies they will work no
          more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>ant </i>has no guide to set her example, no overseer to inspect
          her work, no ruler to exact her task — and yet she does not neglect a
          day in summer, when the sky clear; or in harvest, when the grain can
          be had in plenty. She improves every opportunity to store up
          provisions, that she may spend the days of cold and scarcity in
          comfort.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And what is the result of all her toil? In winter she enjoys plenty,
          when other creatures are pinched with poverty, or perish with cold and
          hunger.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have guides to set us a good example. We have overseers and rulers
          appointed us by the King of nations and the King of Zion. Yet how many
          sluggards are to be found among us, who spend their days in vanity!
          They are like butterflies, which fritter away the best days of their
          existence, when they ought to be like ants, allowing no summer day to
          pass unimproved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These little animals have knowledge of the times, and are wise to
          improve opportunities. They join with the stork, and the crane, and
          the swallow, in reproving those who know not the judgment of the Lord,
          and neglect the duty of the day in its day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are sluggards who bring misery upon themselves in this world.
          There are far more who bring eternal misery upon their souls, by
          neglecting the happy opportunities afforded them by the long-suffering
          of the Lord, of securing their everlasting interests.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They see many days of the Son of man, and enjoy the beams of the Sun
          of righteousness. They are called with a loud voice to arise and shine
          — but they are less concerned about an everlasting duration of
          happiness or misery — than the despised ant about the provisions of a
          few months! How will they mourn at the last, and say, "The summer is
          past, and the harvest is ended — and we are not saved!" The sluggard
          will not awake from his sleep to go and learn wisdom — but the wise
          man goes to him to break his slumbers.
        </p>
        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 9.</p></font> "How
          long will you sleep, O sluggard! When will you awake out of your
          sleep?" </b
        >It is a great waste of time, to spend more hours in sleep than are
        necessary. Yet from the practice of how many does it appear, that they
        have adopted the maxim of the Indians, that:<br />
        Rest is better than work, <br />
        and lying is better than sitting, <br />
        and sleeping is better than waking, <br />
        and death is better than life!
        <p align="justify">
          It is a shame for men to give up to sleep, more than a third part of
          their time — but it is not less so to spend our waking hours in doing
          nothing, or in doing what is frivolous or unprofitable. All the world
          would despise a man who would keep his bed from morning until night,
          though in the possession of perfect health. But in what respect is he
          better employed, who trifles away in idleness every hour of the day?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He is still worse — for lack of employment and weariness of life will
          lead him to seek relief in impertinent and mischievous talk, or in
          sensual indulgences, or in meddling with the matters of others. If a
          man of rank should come to the sleeper's bedside while he is dozing
          away the morning-hours, and should call him to rise, it might be
          expected that he would be covered with confusion, and instantly shake
          off the bands of slumber. But here the wise king comes and draws aside
          his curtains, and expostulates with him,<i>
            "How long will you sleep, O sluggard!" </i
          >The sluggard's ears are heavy with sleep, and cannot hear. Solomon
          cries again, <i>"When will you awake out of your sleep?" </i>Does the
          sluggard now hear? The voice is loud enough to pierce his ears — but
          he hears as if he heard not. He is <i>nailed </i>to his bed by sloth —
          and though conscious that he should arise and walk, he pleads hard for
          a little delay.

          little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
          sleep."</b
        >
        He forms some <i>faint resolutions </i>to awake, and it is only a short
        respite from that torment that he begs, "a little sleep." If that is too
        much, "a little slumber;" or if even that cannot be granted, "a little
        folding of the hands to sleep," is but a moderate request. The sluggard
        himself cannot vindicate his sloth, and is resolved to shake it off —
        only he will not do it <i>presently</i>. From time to time he defers the
        hated reformation, and what is the consequence?

        <b
          ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Verse 11.</p></font> "So
          shall poverty will come on you like a bandit, and scarcity like an
          armed man." </b
        >The house of the sluggard is the haunt of poverty, and it comes not
        like an invited guest, whose visit is expected — but like a bandit,
        whose approach is unforeseen. It comes like an armed man, and gains an
        easy victory over the slumbering sluggard. Had he been awake and busy,
        he might easily have defended himself against its assaults.
        <i>

        perdition!
        <p align="justify">
          The Spirit of God says, "Today, if you will hear his voice." The
          sluggard is not at leisure <i>today</i> — but he will hear it
          <i> tomorrow</i>. Tomorrow comes — but the cause of this delay still
          exists. A thousand tomorrows pass away, and the sluggard is never
          awakened to wisdom.

          At last the <i>king of terrors </i>seizes him with irresistible
          violence, and hurries him to that place of darkness where there is no
          work, nor device, nor counsel. The soul must then appear before the
          solemn all-knowing Judge; and what excuse can be made for these delays
          of complying with the voice of the great God?

        <p align="justify">
          If a king were to call us to come to him, in order to receive some
          great favor at his hands, we surely would not show so little respect
          to royalty, and so little regard to our own interest — as to defer
          compliance with the kind invitation from day to day. Is the majesty of
          earthly princes so much revered by us? Yet to the majesty of Heaven's
          great Lord, it bears only the same proportion that a spark does to the
          sun.

          providence? To God must our safety be all ascribed, since evil
          spirits, numerous and crafty, constantly traverse our earth, and men
          whose hearts are filled with all iniquity, abound on the face of it.

          Every sin is hateful to God. The sins enumerated in this passage are
          not mentioned, because there are not others as hateful to God — but
          because they are nearly allied to that vice which had been last
          reprobated by the wise man, and are generally found in the character
          of the mischievous person. They are all abhorred by him who is the
          guardian of his creatures, and the avenger of injuries done to his

        <b> <p align="justify">Pride</p></b>leads the van of this troop of
        iniquities. Its palace is the heart — but its throne is erected in the

        Heaven. The proud man is not only a rebel to God — but a usurper of his
        dignity. He would be a God to men — but the living and true God looks
        upon him with contempt and indignation, and spurns him into Hell.
        <p align="justify">
          A <b>lying tongue </b>is abhorred by men, because it tends to the

        from the King of nations. The wicked Emperors of Rome; and many
        persecuting and bloody kings, are instances of this truth. They shed the
        blood of men — and God gave them blood to drink.
        <b> <p align="justify">A heart that devises wicked schemes.</p></b>That

        The first motions of sin in the hearts of men, are offensive to God. How

        It is necessary to have a lamp, when one is in a dark place. The law of

        steps in safety.
        <p align="justify">
          But as it may be compared to a <i>lamp</i>, because it gives us light
          in the night — so also to the <i>sun</i>, because it is the light of
          the world. Christ, who is the Sun of righteousness, shines upon us by
          the word of his grace, enlightening our minds in the knowledge of
          every useful truth, and guiding us in safety to a better world.

          account. The threatenings of Hell guard the way to Heaven, and
          strongly urge us to keep the King's highway, the only way of safety.

          experience, that it is extremely dangerous to give sin indulgence in
          the <i>heart</i>, though we design not to <i>practice </i>it. He
          therefore warns us against lusting after the beauty of the immoral

        The beauty that sparkles in the eye of a virtuous woman is a lovely

        — yet to others it appears like a beautiful garment on a body covered
        with loathsome sores, or a jewel of gold in a swine's snout. The
        <i>lust of the heart is adultery in the sight of God</i>, and it were
        better to have our eyes plucked out, than to have our hearts inflamed
        with lust! But impure imaginations do not ordinarily rest in quiet. They
        push on the man that harbors them, to outward acts of sin. When lust has
        conceived, it brings forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, brings
        forth misery!

        Poverty is an object of horror to the greater part of men. The desire of
        removing or preventing it, is the grand spring which keeps the world
        constantly in motion. But the adulterer drives on furiously towards it,
        for though as much afraid of it as other men, he is hurried along in his
        wild career by <i> tyrannizing passions</i> that have blinded his eyes,
        and taken possession of his soul to such a degree, that he must have
        them gratified, though ruin is the inevitable consequence!

          Life is so precious, that a man will give all that he has for it. Yet

          escape vengeance; but the scripture assures us that such hopes are
          self-delusions, and that a man may as well expect to remain unhurt
          though he takes fire to burn himself; or walks on burning coals.

          anything similar to it has happened since." But God has set forth
          these cities as an <i>example</i>, making them to suffer the vengeance
          of eternal fire; and impenitent sinners will find at the last, that
          those who despised the words of Solomon, and of Christ himself — shall
          suffer more severely than the cities of the plain, whose iniquities
          were not so terribly aggravated by despised means of instruction and
          reformation. Stealing is a detested sin, and exposes men to severe
          punishment; but it is much less heinous than adultery, nor will the
          punishment of it be so great.

          him all the wealth of his house. But a man who commits adultery lacks
          judgment; whoever does so destroys himself. Blows and disgrace are his
          lot, and his shame will never be wiped away; for jealousy arouses a
          husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge. He

        <p align="justify">
          Theft is a sin deservedly abhorred, and those who are guilty of it
          expose themselves to contempt and indignation. Yet when
          <i> necessity </i>tempts a man to steal, he is the object of pity
          rather than of scorn. No necessity can excuse any sin — but
          <i>apparent necessity </i>may extenuate it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This plea, however, cannot be urged to palliate the crime of adultery,
          which is always the effect of a wicked disposition, and an impure
          imagination.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When a man steals, it is perhaps to appease the cravings of hunger,
          which is an appetite too fierce for human nature to oppose. But
          immoral actions are the gratifications of brutal lust, and tend not to
          the preservation — but to the destruction of the life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yet a thief must suffer, although he is pitied when hunger urges him
          on to steal. He shall restore manifold, according to the law; and if
          he cannot make the ample restitution required, he must give all the
          substance of his house.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How then does the adulterer hope to escape a much more grievous
          punishment, for a crime which can admit of no reparation? A thief may
          steal for lack of bread — but the adulterer sins because he immoral.
          He exposes himself to a deadly wound from a jealous husband, or an
          avenging magistrate. He contracts a blot upon his name which adheres
          to it indelibly, and spreads itself even to his children. He may give
          all the substance of his house to the man whom he has injured — but it
          will not be accepted as an atonement for his life; for a fire of
          jealousy is kindled, which can be quenched only in his blood.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This argument may be supposed to have little weight among us, who
          punish theft more severely than adultery. But when crimes that deserve
          death escape punishment from men — then God, the King of all nations,
          punishes them by his providence, and sometimes with greater severity,
          because his earthly ministers neglect to show his resentment of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Earthly magistrates often punish thieves and highwaymen more severely
          than adulterers — but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge! We
          may without presumption suppose, that even in this world he often
          brings them to a gibbet, by allowing them to imbrue their hands in

          The Bible assures us, that God often punishes one sin, by permitting
          the transgressor to fall into another; and particularly, that God has
          given up men to immorality, for the indignities they have done to his
          own name, and along with it, to other iniquities that bring vengeance
          in their train.

          If these sinners escape outward punishment, let them remember how
          terrible that destruction is, which God has designed for them, and how
          impossible it will be to escape from the Judge of all. They complain
          that they cannot extinguish their burning lusts — but it shall be more
          impossible to extinguish the fire that shall never be quenched!
