             <br />

            76. Let, I pray You, Your merciful kindness be for my comfort:
            according to Your word unto Your servant.</font
          ><br />

           <br />

          What! does the Psalmist then seek his comfort from the very hand that
          strikes him? This is genuine faith, "Though He slay me, yet will I
          trust in Him." The very arm that seems to be uplifted for my
          destruction, shall be to me the arm of salvation.<br />

           <br />

          Several of the preceding verses have spoken of affliction. The
          Psalmist now prays for alleviation under it. But of what kind? He does
          not "beseech the Lord, that it might depart from him." No. His
          repeated acknowledgments of the supports given under it, and the
          benefits he had derived from it, had reconciled him to commit its
          measure and continuance to the Lord. All that he needs, and all that
          he asks for, is, a sense of His merciful kindness upon his soul. Thus
          he submits to His justice in accumulated trials, and expects
          consolation under them, solely upon the ground of His free favor.
          Indeed, it is hard to hold on under protracted affliction without this
          precious support. Patience may restrain murmuring but a sense of love
          alone keeps from fainting. Holiness is our service—affliction is our
          exercise—comfort is our gracious reward. All the candles in the world,
          in the absence of the sun, can never make the day. The whole earth, in
          its brightest visions of fancy, destitute of the Lord's love, can
          never cheer nor revive the soul. Indeed, it matters little where we
          are, or what we have. In the fullness of refreshing ordinances, unless
          the Lord meets us, and blesses us with His merciful kindness for our
          comfort, it is "a thirsty land, where no water is." Absalom might as
          well have been at Geshur as at Jerusalem, so long as he "saw not the
          king's face." Nothing that the Lord "gives us richly to enjoy" will
          satisfy, if this source of refreshment be withheld. The worldling's
          inquiry is, "Who will show us any good?" The Christian forms his
          answer into a prayer, "Lord! lift up the light of Your countenance
          upon me." Let Your merciful kindness be for my comfort. This gives the
          enjoyment of every real good, and supplies the place of every fancied
          good. It is a blessing that never cloys, and will never end: and every
          fresh taste quenches the thirst for earthly pleasures. "Whoever drinks
          of this water"—says our Divine Savior, "shall thirst again. But
          whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst!"
          "Delight yourself in the Lord; and He shall give you the desires of
          your heart."<br />
          <br />

          But, Reader, do you wish to realize this comfort? Then seek to
          approach your God by the only way of access. Learn to contemplate Him
          in the only glass in which a God of love is seen, "in the face of
          Jesus Christ." Guard against looking for comfort from any other
          source. Beware especially of that satisfaction in creature-cisterns
          which draws you away from "the fountain of living waters." Learn also
          to prize this comfort supremely, and not to be content without some
          enjoyment, or even with a scanty measure of enjoyment; but rather let
          every day's refreshment be made a step for desiring and attaining
          renewed and sweeter refreshment for tomorrow. Some, however, appear to
          look at David's experience, as if at present they could hardly expect
          to reach its happiness: and so they go on in a low, depressed, and
          almost sullen state, refusing the privileges, which are as freely
          offered to them as to others. But such a state of mind is highly
          dishonorable to God. Let them earnestly plead their interest in the
          word of promise—According to Your word to Your servant. Let them lay
          their fingers upon one or all of the promises of their God. Let them
          spread before the Lord His own handwriting and seals; and their Savior
          has said, "According to your faith be it unto you." "The king is held
          in the galleries;" and, if He should "make as though He would go
          farther," He is willing that we should "constrain Him, saying, Abide
          with us." No veil now but the veil of unbelief need hinder us from
          seeing an unclouded everlasting smile of merciful kindness upon our
          heavenly Father's reconciled face. Only let us see to it, that He is
          the first, the habitual object of our contemplation, the satisfying
          well-spring of our delight—that He is the one desire, to which every
          other is subordinate, and in which every other is absorbed.<br />

           <br />

          Lord Jesus! I would seek for a renewed enjoyment in Your merciful
          kindness. I would not forget, that it was this that brought You down
          from heaven—that led You to endure the death of the cross—that has
          washed me in Your precious blood—that visits me with many endearing
          tokens of Your love. Oh, let all my days be spent in the sense of this
          merciful kindness for my comfort, and in rendering to You the unworthy
          returns of grateful, filial service.<br />

           <font color="#FF0000"
            ><br />

             <br />

            77. Let Your tender mercies come to me, that I may live; for Your
            law is my delight.</font
          ><br />

           <br />

          Sin is no light trouble to the man of God. Mercy, therefore, is to him
          no common blessing. Never can he have—never can he ask, enough. Hence
          his repeated cries. Mercy brought him out of sin and misery. Mercy
          keeps—holds him on—assures him to the end. Every blessing comes in the
          way of mercy. The most careful walker according to the gospel rule,
          needs mercy. The elect are "vessels of mercy"—filled up to the brim
          with mercy. The crown of glory at last is received at the hands of
          mercy.<br />

           <br />

          The distinguishing character of God is, that His mercies are tender
          mercies—a father's pitying—yearning mercies. When His returning
          prodigal expected probably upbraiding looks, if not a frown of
          banishment, how did these tender mercies bury, not only his sins, but
          also his very confessions in the depths of the sea, and welcome him
          without a cloud to his forsaken home! The same tender considerations
          put away from His children all anxiety respecting "what they shall
          eat, or what they shall drink, or wherewithal they shall be clothed.
          As a Father He also "chastens" them, "he suffers their manners"—He
          "spares them, as a man spares his own son that serves him;" and,
          finally, He determines respecting each of them by an act of sovereign
          power, "You shall call Me, My Father, and shall not depart from Me."
          In a yet more endearing character He speaks, "As one whom his mother
          comforts, so will I comfort you. They may forget; yet will I not
          forget You."<br />

           <br />

          Yet have we no just apprehension of these tender mercies, unless they
          come to us. In the midst of the wide distribution, let me claim my
          interest. Let them come to me. Praised be God! the way is open to me.
          The mere report is unfruitful. I cannot speak of them with glow and
          unction. The application of them is life—not the mere breathing of
          spiritual existence, but the life of my life—the living principle of
          devotedness and enjoyment—living to and for God in every form and
          sphere, in every hour and action of the day; my feebleness becoming
          strength in the Lord; "walking up and down in His name." This truly is
          "reigning in life;" rising to more of its honor and dignity, and
          reaching forth to more of its excellence and happiness.<br />

           <br />

          But let us not lose sight of the abundant overflowing spring, from
          which our life is maintained. "In Christ was life;" and He "came that
          we might have life, and that we might have it more abundantly." There
          can be, therefore, no exercises of life without a vital union to
          Christ—the source of life. Shall we then give up the hope of believing
          in Christ, until we feel the influence of this spiritual principle?
          This would be indeed like refusing to abide in the vine, until we
          could bring forth fruit; whereas the branch, while separated from the
          vine, must ever be fruitless and withered. We must receive life from
          Christ, not bring it to Him. Faith implants us in Him; and "Christ
          dwelling in the heart by faith" becomes the life of the soul,
          animating it in the ways of God.<br />

           <br />

          This life, therefore, will manifest itself in delight in God's law. We
          shall not be satisfied to live upon the mere surface of the gospel
          (which is barren and unproductive, as any other surface, in spiritual
          usefulness), but we shall search into its hidden treasures, and draw
          forth its real life and consolation. This "delight" will furnish a
          plea for our use at the throne of grace. 'If this is the fruit and
          acting of the life of Your own implanting, Lord! cherish it. Let me
          live by the influence of Your tender mercies. I venture to plead my
          delight in Your law, as an evidence of my adoption into Your family.
          And, therefore, I would renew my plea and my petition—Let Your tender
          mercies come to me, that my life may be not only existence, but
          enjoyment—the beginning, the earnest, of the everlasting life and
          bliss of heaven.'<br />

             <br />

            78. Let the proud be ashamed: for they dwelt perversely with me
            without a cause: but I will meditate in Your precepts.</font
          ><br />

           <br />

          The prophecy with which God Himself condescended to open the history
          of the church, has ever since been in the course of accomplishment.
          "Enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman,"
          has been the prevailing character and course of the world. "An unjust
          man is an abomination to the just; and he who is upright in the way is
          abomination to the wicked." David, however, prayed for the confusion
          of his enemies—not in a vindictive spirit, as if thirsting for their
          destruction; but as opening the way for his own more free service of
          God, and as a chastening, that might eventually turn to their
          salvation, "Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name,
          O Lord!" That his prayer was the expression of his tender compassion,
          rather than of resentful feeling, is sufficiently evident from his
          affectionate weeping concern for their immortal interests. Prayers of
          the same deprecating character dropped from the lips of the gentle and
          compassionate Savior: while the objects of His awful deprecations were
          interested in the most yearning sympathies of His heart. A regard also
          for the honor of God dictated this prayer. David knew that the malice
          of his enemies against him was only the working of their enmity
          against God; that it was not so much him that they hated and
          persecuted, as God in him. And therefore as a servant of God he could
          appeal, "Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate You? and am not I
          grieved at those that rise up against You? I hate them with perfect
          hatred; I count them my enemies." The followers of a despised Savior
          must indeed expect to be severely distressed with the perverseness of
          the proud. But when, like their Master, they can testify that it is
          without a cause, how cheering are their Master's words! "Blessed are
          you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all
          manner of evil against you falsely for My sake. Rejoice, and be
          exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven."<br />

           <br />

          And have you, reader, been exercised with trials from an ungodly
          world? Has the derision of the proud, or the slight or ill-treatment
          of the ungodly, never excited revengeful feelings within? Have you
          always been enabled to set your Savior's example before you, and "in
          patience possessing your soul," to refer your cause to your Almighty
          Friend? "O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me." Remember, He has
          engaged to take up your cause, "Shall not God avenge His own elect,
          which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them?—I
          tell you that He will avenge them speedily."<br />

           <br />

          But learn in the hour of trial where to go, and what to do. Go to the
          word of God for direction and support. Meditate in His precepts. There
          is often a hurry of mind in times of difficulty, which unhinges the
          soul from the simple exercise of faith. But habit brings practice, and
          steadiness, and simplicity, enabling us most sweetly to fix our hearts
          upon the word of God, and to apply its directions and encouragements
          to the present exigency. Our enemies fight against us with an arm of
          flesh. We resist them with the armor of the word of God. And how
          inestimably precious is the armor, refuge, strength, and consolation,
          here provided for us against every effort to disturb our peace, "or
          separate our hearts from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
          Lord!"<br />

           <font color="#FF0000"
            ><br />

             <br />

            79. Let those who fear You turn to me, and those that have known
            Your testimonies.</font
          ><br />

           <br />

          As the believer finds trouble from the world, he prays that he may
          find help from the Lord's people. The very sight of our Father's
          family is cheering. It brings not only fellowship but help. For the
          wise distribution of gifts in the body—each having his own gift—was
          ordained for the mutual help and sympathy of the several members. It
          is painful therefore to see Christians often walking aloof from each
          other, and suffering coldness, distance, differences and distrust to
          divide them from their brethren. Who then will not pray, that He, who
          has the hearts of all His people in His hand, would turn the hearts of
          those that fear Him and know His testimonies, unto their brethren? It
          was the honor of Mordecai, that he was "accepted of the multitude of
          his brethren." In the primitive church, "Demetrius had good report of
          all men, and of the truth itself;" and the members of the church
          generally "did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart;
          praising God, and having favor with all the people." 'Then,' as
          Chrysostom exultingly exclaims, 'the Church was a little heaven.' Then
          they could say to each other, "Behold, how good and pleasant it is for
          brethren to dwell together in unity!" and even their Heathen neighbors
          were awed and constrained into the confession, "See how these
          Christians love one another."<br />

            <br />

          Alas! that our Jerusalem should no longer exhibit the picture of a
          "city compact together"—that so many "walls of partition" should
          separate brother from brother, so that our Zion has very rarely been
          exhibited in her "perfection of beauty," when "the multitude of them
          that believed were of one heart and of one soul." Prejudice and
          misconception divided Job from his friends. Want of forbearance
          cankered the union of the members of the church of Rome, and even
          prevailed to separate chief friends—Paul and Barnabas. Diversity of
          sentiment injured the influence of brotherly love at Corinth. And thus
          it has been in every successive age of the church; so that the full
          answer to the Redeemer's prayer, and the grand display to the world of
          the Divine original of the gospel, is yet to be manifested. But as
          "the communion of saints" was the peculiar feature of primitive
          Christianity, and ever since has formed an article of her faith; in
          proportion as we return to the primitive standard, we shall hold
          closer fellowship with each other—as "members of one body"
          "considering one another, to provoke unto love and to good works"
          "bearing one another's burdens;"—and "receiving one another, as Christ
          also received us, to the glory of God."<br />

           <br />

          Lack of Christian self-denial presents the main hindrance to this
          "keeping the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace." But—admitting
          that some of the brethren are "weak in the faith" in comparison with
          ourselves—are we then to be 'rolling endlessly the returning stone,'
          obtruding always the same stumbling-offence upon them? We are "not to
          please ourselves" in compelling them to adopt our views; but rather to
          "receive them, and bear their infirmities." Accursed be that charity,
          that is preserved by "the shipwreck of faith!" But though scriptural
          truth must never be denied, there are times when it may be forborne.
          The Apostle "knew and was persuaded of the Lord Jesus, that there was
          nothing unclean of itself;" yet he would rather allow even the
          misconception of conscience, until clearer light should be given, than
          endanger the unity of the church. Liberty must give place to love; and
          for himself, he would rather restrain himself from lawful indulgence,
          than hazard the safety of a weaker brother, or turn from one that
          loved his Savior. Wherever, therefore, in the judgment of Christian
          charity, we discover those "that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
          sincerity," we must be ready to give them our very hearts, to view
          them as brethren, as one with ourselves, and to welcome them with
          brotherly love, as those whom, with all their infirmities, Jesus "is
          not ashamed to call His brethren." We must be ready to turn to them,
          as those that fear God, and have known His testimonies.<br />

            <br />

          And does not the believer's anxiety for the company and assistance of
          the Lord's people rebuke Christian professors, who are far too closely
          linked to the society of the world? Surely, if the lovely attraction
          of many of its most avowed votaries can compensate for the absence of
          their Savior's image, they can have but little relish for that
          heavenly enjoyment, which unites the children of God together in close
          and hallowed communion with God. And do we not see a proof of the
          deteriorating influence of this worldly spirit, in their readiness to
          feel disgust at the infirmities of the real brethren of the Lord, and
          to neglect the image of Christ in them, from the unsightliness of the
          garb, which may sometimes cover it?<br />

           <br />

          But let us mark the completeness of the Christian—combining the fear
          with the knowledge of God. Knowledge without fear would be
          self-confidence. Fear without knowledge would be bondage. But the
          knowledge of His testimonies, connected with an acquaintance with His
          ways, molds the character of men of God into the spirit of love; and
          qualifies them, "as fathers" in the gospel, to counsel the weak and
          inexperienced. Should we, however, be excluded from the privilege of
          their communion; or should they be prevented from turning to us; may
          it not be the appointed means of leading us to a more simple
          dependence on Divine teaching and grace, and to a more blessed
          anticipation of our Father's house in heaven, where all will be
          harmony, peace, and love? 'We shall carry truth and the knowledge of
          God to heaven with us; we shall carry purity there, devotedness of
          soul to God and our Redeemer, Divine love and joy, if we have these
          beginnings here, with whatever else of permanent excellence, that has
          a settled, fixed seat and, place in our souls now: and shall there
          have them in perfection. But do you think we shall carry strife to
          heaven? shall we carry anger to heaven? Envyings, heart-burnings,
          animosities; shall we carry these to heaven with us? Let us labor to
          divest ourselves, and strike off from our spirits everything that
          shall not go with us to heaven, or is equally unsuitable to our end
          and way, that there may be nothing to obstruct and hinder our
          "abundant entrance" at length into the everlasting kingdom.'<br />

            80. Let my heart be sound in Your statutes, that I be not

          The perverseness of the proud will be sure to put them to shame. As
          the preservative from this shame, David prays therefore for a sound
          heart—filled with solid principle—delivered into the mold of the
          word—like the sacrifices of the law—entire for God. Often had he
          prayed for Divine teaching—now he begs for soundness in the Lord's
          statutes. How many "have made shipwreck of faith and of a good
          conscience," from an unsound heart! Ignorant of the spirituality of
          God's requirements, and resting in an outward obedience, they falsely
          conceive themselves to be "alive without the law," and "touching the
          righteousness that is of the law, blameless." Others go a little
          beyond the surface; while the want of "simplicity and godly
          sincerity," of brokenness of heart, love to the Savior, and dependence
          upon His grace, sooner or later discovers to their eternal confusion,
          that "the root of the matter is" not "in them." "Their root shall be
          as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust. Their goodness
          is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away." An unsound
          professor, like beautiful fruit, may attract the careless eye; but a
          more narrow inspection will show a worm at the core, which has spoiled
          nearly to the surface. Such religion is only a shriveled mass of
          inactive formality—a dead image of a living thing.<br />

            <br />

          Alas! how common is it to profess to take Christ for a Savior, while
          the heart is evidently worshiping Mammon as its God!—constrained—not
          inclined—to the Lord's statutes! How possible is it to be
          "carnally-minded" in the daily routine of spiritual exercises! How
          important is the recollection, that no change of place, of company, or
          of circumstances, can of itself effect a change of heart! "Saul among
          the prophets" was Saul still; with "another heart" indeed, but not a
          new heart. Sin was restrained, but not crucified. He "went out,"
          therefore, as one of his progenitors, "from the presence of the Lord,"
          and perished, a miserable apostate from the statutes of his God. Will
          profession—knowledge—gifts— feelings—privileges—avail for a sound
          heart? Need we speak of Judas—a follower—no, even, an apostle of Jesus
          Christ—living in a familiar communion with his Lord—yet with all his
          privileges—all his profession, "gone to his own place"—the melancholy
          victim of his own self-deceitfulness? Need we allude to Balaam, "the
          man whose eyes were open—which heard the words of God—which saw the
          vision of the Almighty"—who could in the ken of his eye mark the
          goodness of the Lord's inheritance, and even in the distant horizon
          catch a glimpse of "Jacob's star and scepter," and yet "loved the
          wages of unrighteousness?" Need we bring to the mind's eye Ananias and
          Sapphira? Alexander—and others of like stamp—all of whom once shone as
          stars in the skies of the church—need we speak of the end of these
          men, to give energy to the prayer—Let my heart be sound in Your
          statutes?<br />

           <br />

          How fearful the thought of being "a branch in the true vine" only by
          profession! to be "taken away" at length, "cast forth as a
          branch—withered—gathered—cast into the fire—burned!" It is in the
          inner man that hypocrisy sets up its throne; whence it commands the
          outward acts into whatever shape or form may be best suited to effect
          its purpose. The upright Christian will therefore begin with calling
          in the help and light of God to ascertain the soundness of his heart.
          "Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts;
          and see if there be any wicked way in me." Can there be a true and
          solid work, where there is a professed change of heart, and no
          manifested change of temper and conduct? Can that heart, which is
          found upon inquiry to be earthly—unprofitable under the power of the
          word, "regarding" secret "iniquity"—seeking bye-ends of praise,
          reputation, or gain—and for the attainment of these ends shrinking
          from the appointed cross—can that heart be sound in the Lord's
          statutes? Impossible.<br />

           <br />

          But, on the other hand, do you find that your trust in God is sincere,
          your desire towards Him supreme, your obedience to Him entire? Prize
          those evidences of soundness of heart. Thank God for them. They are
          the workings of His mighty Spirit in your heart—perhaps the answer to
          the prayer which that same Spirit had indited, Let my heart be sound
          in Your statutes. Diligently improve all the means of grace for
          keeping your heart in a vigorous state. Be daily—yes,
          continually—abiding in the vine, and receiving life and health from
          its fullness. Be much conversant with the word of God—loving it for
          itself—its holiness—its practical influences. Be chiefly afraid of
          inward decays—of a barren, sapless notion of experimental truth;
          remembering, that except your profession be constantly watered at the
          root, "the things that remain in you will be ready to die." Specially
          "commune with your own heart." Watch it jealously, because of its
          proneness to live upon itself—its own graces or fancied goodness (a
          sure symptom of unsoundness)—instead of "living by the faith of the
          Son of God." Examine your settled judgment, your deliberate choice,
          your outgoing affections, your habitual, allowed practice; applying to
          every detection of unsoundness the blood of Christ, as the sovereign
          remedy for the diseases of a "deceitful and desperately wicked
          heart."<br />

           <br />

          But it may be said—will not these exercises of godly jealousy hinder
          our Christian assurance? Far from it. They will form an efficient
          preservative from carnal security. They will induce increasing
          tenderness, activity, and circumspection, in our daily walk; and thus,
          instead of retarding the enjoyment of our heavenly privilege, they
          will settle the foundation of a peaceful temperament. It is a light
          and careless frame, that is the real hindrance to confidence. An
          unsound professor knows nothing of the true spirit of adoption—nothing
          of that holy familiarity, with which a child of God unbosoms himself
          to his heavenly Father; and if he preserves an empty name in the
          church, he will be put to shame before the universe of God. But the
          sound heart is connected with "a hope that makes not ashamed"—the full
          blessing of scriptural confidence. For the heart is made sound by the
          "sprinkling of the blood of Christ;" and when thus "sprinkled from an
          evil conscience," we "have boldness" to "draw near"—yes, even to
          "enter into the holiest," "in full assurance of faith." Blessed
          privilege of access and communion with our reconciled God! Every
          moment endears the Savior to our souls, and enlivens the hope of his
          glorious coming, as the joyful consummation of all the prospects of
          faith, "Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in
          the day of judgment."<br />

          <br />

          The salvation of the Gospel was the constant object of faith and
          desire to the Lord's people under the old dispensation. Long had the
          church triumphed in the glowing anticipation, as if in the full
          possession of the promised blessing, "It shall be said in that day,
          Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and
          rejoice in His salvation. I will greatly rejoice in the Lord; my soul
          shall be joyful in my God; for He has clothed me with the garments of
          salvation; He has covered me with the robe of righteousness; as a
          bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself
          with her jewels." And as it was the joy of their living moments, so
          was it the support and consolation of their dying hours. "I have
          waited for Your salvation, O Lord!" was the expression of the dying
          patriarch's faith. And how cheering were the last words of this "sweet
          Psalmist of Israel," whose soul was now fainting for God's salvation,
          even in his dark and foreboding family prospect! "Although my house be
          not so with God, yet has He made with me an everlasting covenant,
          ordered in all things and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all
          my desire, although He make it not to grow." Good old Simeon, in the
          break of the gospel-day, was ready to "depart in peace, for his eyes
          had seen God's salvation." And shall not we, under this heavenly
          influence, naturally appropriate these feelings of ancient believers
          to ourselves? What interpreter but experience will be needed to
          explain them? The uneasiness felt by any interruption of our
          enjoyment, will show the soul to be fainting for this salvation.
          Nothing will satisfy but the Savior. The tempting offer of "all the
          kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them," will fail in
          attraction. Still the cry will be, "Say unto my soul, I am Your
          salvation. Let Your mercies come also unto me, O Lord; even Your
          salvation, according to Your word."<br />
          <br />

          As the lowest expectant of this salvation, am not I richer than the
          sole possessor of this world's portion? And therefore if the Lord
          hides His face, I would look to no other quarter; I would stay by Him,
          and "wait on Him," though days and months and years may pass away,
          "until He have mercy upon me." My soul faints for His salvation:
          and—pressing to my lips the fullest cup of earth's best joy—my heart
          would burst with despair of satisfaction, "but" that "I hope in His
          word." "By this hope I am saved." In "the patience of hope" I am
          resolved to wait until the last moment, lying at the footstool of my
          Savior. I am looking for the "assurance of this hope"—when, in the
          joyous anticipation of eternity, and with "the earnest of" the
          heavenly "inheritance" in my soul, I shall echo the voice of my coming
          Savior, "Even so come, Lord Jesus."<br />
          <br />

          Oh, how precious and important a part of our armor is Hope! As a
          "helmet," it has "covered our head in the day of battle" from many a
          "fiery dart of the wicked." In times of darkness—when the restless foe
          hides the prospect from the eye of faith, and the child of God can
          scarcely, if at all, mount up and sing—even then hope remains, and
          lights a candle in moments dark as the chamber of the grave, "Yet the
          Lord will command His loving-kindness in the daytime; and in the
          night-season His song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of
          my life." And when the afflicted, tempest-tossed soul is trembling at
          the prospect of impending danger—at this moment of infinite peril,
          Hope holds out the "anchor sure and steadfast;" so that in the awful
          crisis, when "deep calls unto deep, and all the waves and billows are
          going over us," most unexpectedly "an entrance is ministered unto us
          abundantly," in the Lord's best time, into our desired haven. And it
          is this hope alone that sustains us. Were we to conceive of God
          according to the notions of our own hearts, we should give way to most
          unbelieving patience. But the Divine character—as it shines forth in
          the word with such love and wisdom, such tenderness and
          grace—invigorates our hope. The strength of the strongest of God's
          people proves but small, when afflictions press heavily, and expected
          help is delayed. But though the soul faints, it cannot fail. We depend
          not on what we see or feel, but on what the word promises. If God has
          engaged, it must be fulfilled, be the difficulties—no,
          impossibilities—what they may. Fixed, therefore, upon this sure
          foundation, with our father Abraham, "against hope" from what we see,
          "we believe in hope" from what God has promised. Thus the word is
          faith's sure venture for eternity—stamped with such a marvelous,
          mysterious impression of Divine glory and faithfulness, and
          communicating such Divine power and refreshment, that the believer
          cannot but produce his experience of its efficacy for the support of
          his tempted brethren, "I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the
          goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait on the Lord: be
          of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart: wait, I say, on
          the Lord."<br />

            82. My eyes fail for Your word, saying, When will You comfort
            me?</font
          ><br />
          <br />

          Though the believer may be enabled, in the habitual working of faith,
          to sustain his hope in the word, yet "hope deferred makes the heart
          sick." Still, Christian, as you value the promise, trust the
          assurance. Do not be discouraged by present appearances. The sunshine
          is behind the cloud. "The vision is for an appointed time; though it
          tarry, wait for it." "The Lord is not slack concerning His promise,"
          but we are hasty in looking for it. The failing of our eyes is the
          impatience of the will, "limiting God" to our own time, ways, and
          means. Faith may be exercised in not seeing His reasons—not being able
          to harmonize His promises with His providences, or His outward
          dispensations with His Divine perfections. But let us leave this to
          Him, and be "still, and know that He is God." We shall find in the
          end, that perseverance in waiting has turned to double advantage; and
          that even when the present answer to prayer, and also sensible comfort
          and acceptance have been withheld; yet that important blessings have
          been accomplished, and the merciful purposes given in bringing the
          wayward will into more entire subjection to Himself. Yes—the blessing
          will be so much the sweeter, from being given in the Lord's best time.
          Waiting time—whatever weariness may attend it—is precious time, and
          not a moment of it will be lost. The Lord secretly upholds faith and
          patience, so that every step of feeble perseverance in the way brings
          with it unspeakable delight. Even while our eyes fail for the
          fulfillment of the word, peace is found in submission and joyful
          expectation; and instead of a time of hardness, indolence, or
          carelessness, the Lord's return is anticipated the more intensely, as
          His absence had been felt to be the most painful trial. For as well
          might the stars supply the place of the sun, as outward comforts, or
          even the external duties of religion, supply to the waiting soul the
          place of an absent God.<br />
          <br />

          Never, however, let us forget, that the real cause of separation
          between God and a sinner is removed. The way of access is opened by
          the blood of Jesus; and in this way we must be found waiting, until He
          look upon us. Here will our cry, "When will You comfort me?" be
          abundantly answered; and though the sovereignty of God be exhibited in
          the time and measure of His consolations, yet the general rule will
          be, "According to your faith, be it unto you."<br />
          <br />

          But if unbelief clouds our comfort, turn the eye more simply to the
          "word" as testifying of Jesus. Here alone is the ground of comfort;
          and the more confidently we expect, the more patiently we will look.
          Nor shall we ever look in vain. Sin will be rebuked. But restoration
          and acceptance are assured. We shall obtain—not the spurious comfort
          of delusion—but those wholesome comforts, founded upon the word of
          promise, and connected with contrition, peace, love, joy, and triumph.
          The gospel shows hell deserved, and heaven purchased thus combining
          conviction and faith. Indeed, conviction without faith, would be legal
          sorrow; as assurance without conviction would be gospel presumption.
          Paul's experience happily united both. Never was man at the same
          moment more exercised with conflict, and yet more established in
          assurance. Thus may we maintain our assurance as really in wrestling
          trouble as in exulting joy; honoring the Lord by an humble, patient
          spirit—in Bernard's resolution—'I will never come away from You
          without You'—in the true spirit of the wrestling patriarch, "I will
          not let You go, except You bless me."<br />
          <br />

          But we sometimes seem to go "mourning without the sun," "shut up, and
          we cannot come forth"—straitened in our desires and expectations—doing
          little for the Lord—with little enjoyment in our own souls, and little
          apparent usefulness to the Church. At such seasons it is our clear
          duty and privilege to "wait upon the Lord, that hides His face from
          the house of Jacob, and to look for Him." "He waits that He may be
          gracious. He is a God of Judgment; and blessed are all those who wait
          for Him." He waits—not because He is reluctant to give, but that we
          may be fitted to receive.<br />

          <br />

          What an affecting picture of misery! Not only were his patience and
          hope—but his very body, "dried up" by long-continued affliction. This
          is he, who in the prime of youth was "ruddy and of a beautiful
          countenance, and goodly to look to,"—now shriveled up like a bottle of
          skin, hung up in the smoke! Such is the mark that the rod of
          "chastening" leaves on the body of humiliation. The soul is
          strengthened—the body withers—under the stroke.<br />
          <br />

          What might naturally have been expected to have been the result of
          this lengthened exercise? Saul, under protracted trial, resorted to
          the devil for relief. An infidel nation took occasion from thence to
          throw off the yoke. Even a good man, under a few hours' trial, murmurs
          against God—no, even defends his murmuring. How did this man of God
          behave? When his soul was fainting, his hope in the word kept him from
          sinking. Under the further continuance of the trial, the same
          recollection gives him support—yet do I not forget Your statutes.<br />
          <br />

          Now—Christian—do not expect a new way to heaven to be made for you.
          Prepare for the cross. It may be—as with David—a heavy, long-continued
          burden, and, should it come—look on it as your appointed trial of
          faith, and your training discipline for more enduring conflicts. And
          remember that your determined resolution rather to pine away in
          affliction, than "make a way of escape" by sin—is the proof of the
          reality of His own grace in you, and of His faithful love towards you.
          Think how honorably He manifests your relation to Christ, by causing
          "His sufferings to abound in you," and making you "bear in your body
          the marks of the Lord Jesus." And do you not thus realize, as you
          could not otherwise do, the sympathy of our High Priest, who was
          Himself "a root out of a dry ground, having no form nor loveliness,
          and no beauty that He should be desired—despised and rejected of men"
          to the end? Oh, what a supporting cordial to His afflicted people is
          the sympathy of this suffering, tempted Savior!<br />
          <br />

          But to look at David, under his long-continued trials, preserving his
          recollection of the Lord's statutes—what a striking evidence of the
          presence of his God, and the sustaining power of his word! If we
          then—blessed with much larger Scriptures than he—fail in deriving from
          them the same support, it can only be, that we do not search them in a
          dependent, prayerful, and humble spirit—that we do not simply look for
          the revelation of Christ; to mark His glory, and to increase in the
          knowledge of Him. In this spirit we should have more to say of the
          comfort of remembering the Lord's statutes; and of their upholding
          influence, when all other stays were found as "the trust in the shadow
          of Egypt—shame and confusion."<br />
          <br />

          Job's history strikingly illustrates both the trial and its sanctified
          results. When "scraping himself with a potsherd, and sitting down
          among the ashes,"—the temporary victim of Satanic power—he might well
          have taken up the complaint, I am become like a bottle in the smoke.
          But when in this hour of temptation he was enabled to resist the
          tempter in the person of his own wife, and commit himself with
          implicit resignation into the hands of his faithful God, "What! shall
          we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive
          evil?"—was not this the confidence—Yet do I not forget Your
          statutes?<br />
          <br />

          This confidence is indeed an encouraging seal of the Lord's love to
          our souls. For we never should have remembered His statutes, had He
          not written His covenant promises upon our hearts. And how much more
          honorable to our God is it than the desponding complaint, "The Lord
          has forsaken me, and my God has forgotten me!" Let us watch then
          against a proud sullenness under every little trial—such as the
          coldness of friends, the unkindness of enemies, or our Father's
          providential dispensations. How sinful to allow hard thoughts of Him,
          whose name and character, "without variableness or shadow of turning,"
          is "Love!" A steady trust in the long and wearisome seasons of
          tribulation, is indeed "to glorify God in the fires." Nothing honors
          Him so much as this enduring, overcoming faith, persevering in despite
          of opposition, in destitution of all outward prospects of relief. It
          is when "against hope we believe in hope, not staggering at the
          promise of God through unbelief," that we are "strong in faith, giving
          glory to God."<br />

            85. The proud have dug pits for me, which are not after Your law.<br /> </font
          ><br />

          Though a steady confidence in severe and protracted exercise may
          enable us, not to forget the statutes; yet we shall hasten to carry
          our complaint before Him. How many are the days of Your servant?—my
          days of affliction under the "fury of the oppressor." To complain of
          God is dishonorable unbelief. To complain to God is the mark of His
          "elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He bears long with
          them." Christians! study this instructive pattern; and, when exposed
          to the lawless devices of the proud, do not forget your hiding-place.
          God in Christ is your stronghold, "whereunto you may continually
          resort. He has given commandment to save you." Your trial has done its
          appointed work, when it has brought you to Him; and inclined you,
          after your blessed Master's example, instead of taking the vengeance
          into your own hands, to commit yourself and your cause "to Him that
          judges righteously." 'And this,' as Archbishop Leighton excellently
          observes, 'is the true method of Christian patience—that which quiets
          the mind, and keeps it from the boiling tumultuous thoughts of
          revenge; to turn the whole matter into God's hands; to resign it over
          to Him, to prosecute when and as He thinks good. Not as the most, who
          had rather, if they had power, do for themselves, and be their own
          avengers: and, because they have not power, do offer up such bitter
          curses and prayers for revenge unto God, as are most hateful to Him,
          and differ wholly from this calm and holy way of committing matters to
          His judgments. The common way of referring things to God is indeed
          impious and dishonorable to Him, being really no other than calling
          Him to be a servant and executioner of our passion. We ordinarily
          mistake His justice, and judge of it according to our own precipitate
          and distempered minds. If wicked men be not crossed in their designs,
          and their wickedness evidently crushed, just when we would have it, we
          are ready to give up the matter as desperate; or at least to abate of
          those confident and reverent thoughts of Divine justice which we owe
          Him. However things go, this ought to be fixed in our hearts, that He
          who sits in heaven judges righteously, and executes that His righteous
          judgment in the fittest season.'<br />
          <br />

          Usually the Psalmist is expressing his love for the law. Here he is
          complaining against his enemies; yet still implying the same spirit,
          that the pits, which the proud dug for him, were not after God's law.
          The martyr's cry under the altar shows the acceptance of this
          complaint; "seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
          tribulation to them that trouble" His people, "and to them that are
          troubled rest." Some of us indeed have known but little of "cruel
          mockings" and bitter persecutions. Let such be thankful for the
          merciful exemption from this "hardness:" but let them gird on their
          armor for the conflict. Let none of us, in the determination to "live
          godly in Christ Jesus," expect to escape "persecution." Let us "count
          the cost" of suffering for Christ, whether we shall be able to abide
          it. For the mere spiritless notions, or for the unenlivened forms of
          religion, of which we have never felt the power, nor tasted the
          sweetness, it would be little worth our while to expose ourselves to
          inconvenience. But if we understand the grand substantials of the
          gospel—if we are clearly assured of their reality, practically
          acknowledge their influence, and experimentally realize their
          enjoyment, we shall dare the persecuting malice of the proud in
          defense of a treasure dearer to us than life itself. Should we,
          however, be too rich to part with all for Christ, or too high in the
          estimation of the world to confess His despised followers, it will be
          no marvel, or rather a marvel of mercy, if He should sweep away our
          riches, and suffer the proud to dig pits for us. To make this world "a
          wilderness or a land of darkness" to us, may be His wisely-ordained
          means to turn us back to Himself as our portion, to His word as our
          support, to His people as our choice companions, and to heaven as our
          eternal rest.<br />

            86. All Your commandments are faithful: they persecute me
            wrongfully; help me.</font
          ><br />
          <br />

          In the lengthened duration of trials, the eyes fail with looking
          upward, the voice of prayer grows faint, and in a moment of weakness,
          the faithfulness of God is almost questioned, as if we should go
          mourning to the very end of our days. It is at such a season that He
          who delights to "comfort them that are cast down," realizes to the
          view of faith the unchangeable faithfulness of His commandments with
          respect to His people. In this recollection we can "look up and lift
          up our heads," and "go on our way," if not "rejoicing," yet at least
          with humble acquiescence; assured, that in the perseverance of faith
          and hope, we shall ultimately be "more than conquerors through Him
          that loved us."<br />
          <br />

          Many Old Testament histories beautifully illustrate the reward of this
          simplicity of faith in temporal emergencies. When Asa's "hands were
          made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob," "his bow abode
          in strength." When at a subsequent period he "trusted in man, and made
          flesh his arm, and his heart departed from the Lord," he became, like
          Samson, "weak, and as another man." So true is it, that no past
          communications of Divine strength can stand in the stead of the daily
          habit of dependence upon the Lord, without which we are utterly
          helpless, and are overthrown in every conflict. Our best prosperity,
          therefore, is to leave our cause in His hands, looking upward in the
          simplicity of wretchedness for His help: 'All Your commandments are
          faithful; they persecute me wrongfully; help me. Wretched and forlorn
          I am; but Your truth is my shield.'<br />
          <br />

          Believer! This is your only posture of resistance. Should you enter
          the field of conflict without this "shield of faith," some crevice
          will be found in your panoply, through which a "fiery dart" will
          inflict a poisonous wound." But how can faith be exercised without a
          distinct acquaintance with the object of faith? We cannot repose trust
          in, or expect help from, an unknown God—an offended God, whom every
          day's transgression has made our enemy. There must, then, be
          reconciliation, before there can be help. Those, therefore, who are
          unreconciled by the death of Christ, cry for help to a God, who does
          not hear, accept, or answer, them. But when Christ is known as "the
          peace," and the way of access to God, what instance can there be of
          trial or difficulty, when our reliance upon the Lord will fail? Not
          indeed that we shall always return from the throne of grace with the
          wished-for relief. For too often we bring our burden before the Lord,
          and yet through distrust neglect to leave it with Him. Oh! let us
          remember, when we go to Jesus, that we go to a tried, long-proved, and
          faithful friend. Dependence upon Him is victory. "The good fight" is
          the fight "of faith." We are best able to resist our enemy upon our
          knees; and even such a short prayer as this—Help me—will bring down
          the strength of Omnipotence on our side. But we might as well expect
          to crush a giant with a straw, as to enter the spiritual conflict with
          weapons of carnal warfare. Every trial realizes experimentally the
          help of a faithful Savior. He does indeed deliver gloriously; and
          leaves us nothing to do, but to "stand still," wonder, and praise.
          "Fear not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which He
          will show to you today; for the Egyptians, whom you have seen today,
          you shall see them again no more forever."<br />

            87. They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not Your
            precepts.</font
          ><br />
          <br />

          And why did they not quite consume him? Because "the eyes of the Lord
          run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong in
          behalf of them, whose heart is perfect toward Him." "Surely the wrath
          of man shall praise You; the remainder of wrath shall You restrain."
          And why have not our spiritual enemies consumed us upon earth? "Satan
          has desired to have us, that he may sift us as wheat." But—says the
          Savior, "I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not." "My sheep
          shall never perish; neither shall any pluck them out of My hand."
          Steadfastness of profession is the evidence of the life of faith:
          grounded upon this security, the more we are shaken, the more we shall
          hold fast. Neither long-continued distress, nor determined opposition,
          will turn us from the ways of God. We would rather forsake all that
          our heart held dear upon earth, than the precepts of our God. With
          whatever intensity of affection we love father and mother (and the
          influence of the Gospel has increased the sensibilities of relative
          affection), we remember who has said, "He who loves father and mother
          more than Me, is not worthy of Me." Unlike the deluded professor, we
          have counted the cost of the "tribulation and persecution" of the
          Gospel; and the result has only served to confirm our love and
          adherence to our heavenly Master. Shall not we find in heaven—no, do
          not we find in the gospel—a far better portion than we lose?<br />
          <br />

          When, therefore, we are tempted to neglect the precepts, or when we
          fail to live in them, and to delight in them, let us each bring our
          hearts to this test: 'What would I take in exchange for them? Will the
          good-will and approbation of the world compensate for the loss of the
          favor of God? Could I be content to forego my greatest comforts, to
          "suffer the loss of all things," yes, of life itself, rather than
          forsake one of the ways of God? When I meet with such precepts as link
          me to the daily cross, can I throw myself with simple dependence upon
          that Savior, who has engaged to supply strength for what He has
          commanded?' How often in times of spiritual temptation, if not of
          temporal danger, they had almost consumed us upon earth! but "in the
          mount" of difficulty "the Lord has been seen." Oh! let each of us mark
          our road to Zion with multiplied Ebenezers, inscribed Jehovah-jireh,
          Jehovah-nissi. "By this I know You favor me, because my enemy does not
          triumph over me. And as for me, You uphold me in my integrity, and set
          me before Your face forever."<br />
          <br />
          <br />

          What a fine testimony of the upholding grace of God! How could a
          helpless believer stand against such an appalling array? Yet it is a
          great, but a true word, suitable for a babe in Christ, as well as for
          an Apostle, "I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me."
          Yes, I can "wrestle even against principalities and powers" of
          darkness, if I be "strong in the Lord, and in the power of His
          might."<br />

            testimony of Your mouth.</font
          ><br />
          <br />

          We need continual quickening to maintain our steadfastness in the
          precepts. "God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love with which He
          loved us, even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us, together
          with Christ." But without daily quickening after the same
          loving-kindness, "the things which remain will be ready to die." For
          every breath of prayer, Divine influence must flow, "Quicken us, and
          we shall call upon Your name." For the work of praise, without the
          same influence we are dumb., "Let my soul live, and it shall praise
          You." For the exercise of every spiritual grace, there must be the
          commanding voice of our Divine Head, "Awake, O north wind; and come,
          you south: blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out."
          Thus is the creature laid in the dust, and all the glory is given to
          God. "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of
          ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God."<br />
          <br />

          Why is it, then, that at one time we spring to duty as the joy of our
          life; while at other times the soul is so chained down under the power
          of corruption, that it scarcely can put forth the feeblest exercise of
          life? The source of our life is the same;, "Hid with Christ in God."
          But the power of the flesh hinders its every motion. Such a spiritual
          sloth has benumbed us—such backwardness to prayer, and disrelish for
          heavenly things! These are sins deeply humbling in themselves, and
          aggravated by the neglect of the plentiful provision laid up in
          Christ, not only for the life, but for the peace, joy, and strength of
          the soul. Nothing but indolence or unbelief straitens our supplies.
          Oh! stir up the prayer for quickening influence, and we shall be rich
          and fruitful. Sometimes also self-confidence paralyzes our spiritual
          energy. We expect our recovery from a lifeless state by more
          determined resolutions, or increased improvement of the various means
          of grace. Let these means indeed be used with all diligence, but with
          the fullest conviction that all means, all instruments, all helps of
          every kind, without the influence of the Spirit of grace, are dead.
          "It is the Spirit that quickens; the flesh profits nothing."<br />
          <br />

          These records of David's prayers strikingly mark the intensity of his
          desire to live to God. Every decay of strength and activity was, as it
          were, death to him, and awakened his reiterated cries. Do we desire to
          keep the testimony of His mouth? Do we mourn over our shortcomings in
          service? Oh! then, for our own sake, for the Lord's sake, and for the
          church's and the world's sake, let our petitions be incessant each one
          for himself—'Quicken me—Quicken this slothful heart of mine. Enkindle
          afresh the sacred spark within, and let me be all alive for You.' Let
          faith be kept alive and active at the throne of grace, and all will be
          alive; our obligation will be deeply felt, and practically
          acknowledged.<br />
          <br />

          The title here given to the directory of our duty—the testimony of
          God's mouth—adds strength to our obligations. Thus let every word we
          read or hear be regarded as coming directly from the mouth of God.
          What reverence, what implicit submission does it demand! May it ever
          find us in the posture of attention, humility, and faith, each one of
          us ready to say, "Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears!"<br />

          The Christian extends his survey far beyond the limits of his
          individual sphere. His view of the operations of God in creation
          enlarges his apprehensions of the Divine attributes, and especially
          that of unchanging faithfulness. Indeed, the very fact of a creation
          in ruins—a world in rebellion against its Maker, failing of the grand
          end of existence, and yet still continued in existence—manifests His
          faithfulness unto all generations. How different is the contemplation
          of the Christian from that of the philosopher! His is not a mere cold,
          speculative admiration, but the establishment of his faith upon a
          clear discovery of the faithfulness of God. Thus he stays his soul
          upon the assured unchangeableness of the Divine word, "Concerning Your
          testimonies, I have known of old, that You have founded them forever.
          Your word is true from the beginning: and everyone of Your righteous
          judgments endures forever." How striking is the contrast between the
          transient glory of man's goodness, and the solid foundation of all the
          promises, hopes, and prospects of the children of God!, "The grass
          withers, and the flower fades; but the word of our God shall stand
          forever." "Unbelief" is the character of our "evil hearts." Man
          chooses his own measure and objects of faith; he believes no more than
          he pleases. But it is a fearful prospect, that the threatenings of God
          rest upon the same solid foundation with His promises. "Heaven and
          earth shall pass away but My word shall not pass away."<br />
          <br />

          Need we any further proof of His faithfulness? Look at the earth
          established by His word of power. See how "he hangs it upon nothing,"
          as if it might fall at any moment;—and yet it is immovably fixed—it
          abides—and with all its furniture, continues according to His
          ordinances. This—though the scoff of the infidel—is the encouragement
          to Christian faith. It is at once a token of His covenant with nature,
          that "while the earth remains, seed-time and harvest, and cold and
          heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease;" and
          an emblem of His covenant with the seed of David, that He "will not
          cast them off for all that they have done." Thus every view of the
          heavens—yes—every time we set our foot on the earth—shows the
          unchangeableness of His everlasting covenant, and the security of the
          salvation of His own people.<br />
          <br />

          In this vast universe, all are His servants. "The stars in their
          courses" "fire and hail, snow and vapors, stormy wind—fulfill His
          word. He sends forth His commandment upon earth: His word runs very
          swiftly." Man—the child of his Maker, "created in His image"—destined
          for His glory—is the only rebel and revolter. Most affecting is the
          appeal, that his own Father and God is constrained to make concerning
          him, "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord has spoken.
          I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled
          against Me!"<br />
          <br />

          Is not then the universe of nature a parable of grace—setting out on
          every side—in every view—a cheering display of the faithfulness of
          God? If His providence fails not, will the promise of His covenant
          disappoint us? Why should He change? Does He see or know anything now,
          that He has not foreseen and foreknown from eternity? What more sure
          ground of salvation than the unchangeableness of God? If I can prove a
          word to have been spoken by God, I must no more question it than his
          own Being. It may seem to fail on earth; but it is forever settled in
          heaven. The decrees of the kings of the earth, "settled" on earth, are
          exposed to all the variations and weakness of a changing world. They
          may be revoked by themselves or their successors, or they may die
          away. The empty sound of the "law of the Medes and Persians that
          alters not," has long since been swept away into oblivion. But while
          "the word settled" on earth has "waxed old like a garment," and
          perished; the word settled in heaven—is raised above all the
          revolutions of the universe, and remains as the throne of God—unshaken
          and eternal; exhibiting the foundation of the believer's hope and of
          the unbeliever's terror to be alike unalterably fixed.<br />
          <br />

          But we also remark the foreknowledge as well as the faithfulness of
          God. From the eternity that is past, as well for the eternity that is
          to come, Your word is settled in heaven. Before this fair creation was
          marred, yes, before it was called into existence, its ruin was
          foreseen, and a remedy provided. "The Lamb was slain from the
          foundation of the world," and fore-ordained before that era.
          Concurrent with this period, a people "were chosen in Him," and
          forever the word was settled in heaven., "All that the Father gives Me
          shall come to Me." For the establishment of the Redeemer's kingdom
          upon earth "the decree is declared;" however earth and hell may
          combine against it, "Yet have I set My king upon My holy hill of
          Zion." And what a blessed encouragement in the grand work of bringing
          back "the lost sheep of the house of Israel," and those "other sheep"
          with them, "which are not of this fold" is it, that we do not depend
          upon the earnestness of our prayers, the wisdom of our plans, or the
          diligence of our endeavors; but upon "the word" forever settled in
          heaven!, "The Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn
          from transgression in Jacob, says the Lord. As for Me, this is My
          covenant with them, says the Lord—My Spirit that is upon You, and My
          words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your
          mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your
          seed's seed, says the Lord, from henceforth, and forever." "I have
          sworn by Myself, the word is gone out of My mouth in righteousness,
          and shall not return—That unto Me every knee shall bow, every tongue
          shall swear."<br />

            92. Unless Your law had been my delights, I should then have
            perished in my affliction.</font
          ><br />
          <br />

          The support of the word is as sure as its basis—and that in the time
          when other supports sink—in affliction. David—like his great
          prototype—was a man of affliction—sometimes ready to perish—always
          kept up by the law of his God. How many a false professor has been
          tried and cast by this hour of affliction! But he who has been sifted
          by temptation—who has "endured the hardness" of persecution, as a
          "good soldier of Jesus Christ,"—and who is ready rather to be
          "consumed upon earth," than to shrink from his profession—this is he
          whom his Master "will lift up, and not make his foes to rejoice over
          him." It is the established rule of the kingdom, "Them that honor Me I
          will honor." "Because you have kept the word of My patience, I also
          will keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all
          the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."<br />
          <br />

          The law of God opens to us a clear interest in every perfection of His
          Godhead—every engagement of His covenant. What wonder then, that it
          brings delights, which the world can never conceive, when bowed down
          with accumulated affliction? However the believer's real character may
          be hidden from the world, the hour of trial abundantly proves, both
          what the law can do for him, and what a lost creature he would have
          been without it. In affliction, friends mean well; but of themselves
          they can do nothing. They can only look on, feel, and pray. They
          cannot "speak to the heart." This is God's prerogative: and His law is
          His voice.<br />
          <br />

          But for this support, Jonah probably would have perished in his
          affliction. In the belly of the fish, as "in the belly of hell," he
          appears to have recollected the experience of David under deep and
          awful desertion; and in taking his language out of his mouth, as
          descriptive of his own dark and terrific condition, a ray of light and
          hope darted upon his dungeon-walls. Indeed it is a mystery, how a
          sinner, destitute of the support and comfort of the word of God, can
          ever uphold himself in his trials. We marvel not, that often "his soul
          should choose strangling, and death, rather than his life."<br />

          But in order to derive support from the law, it must be our
          delights—yes—that it may be our delights it must be the matter of our
          faith. For what solid delight, can we have in what we do not believe?
          Must it not also be our joy in prosperity, if we would realize its
          support in affliction? For this, how ineffectual is the mere formal
          service! Who ever tasted its tried consolations in the bare
          performance of the outward duty? It must be read in reality; it will
          then be taken as a cordial. Let it be simply received, diligently
          searched, and earnestly prayed over; and it will guide the heavy-laden
          to Him, who is their present and eternal rest. The tempest-tossed soul
          will cast anchor upon it., "Remember the word unto Your servant, upon
          which You have caused me to hope." One promise applied by the Spirit
          of God is worth ten thousand worlds. And each promise is a staff—if we
          have but faith to lean upon it—able to bear our whole weight of sin,
          care, and trial.<br />
          <br />

          Is then affliction our appointed lot? If "man is born"—and the child
          of God twice born, "to trouble, as the sparks fly upward,"—how
          important is it to lay in a store of supply from this inexhaustible
          treasury, against the time when all human support will fail! Supplied
          hence with heavenly strength, we shall be borne up above the weakness
          and weariness of the flesh. And as the riches of this storehouse are
          "the riches of Christ," let those parts be most familiar to us, which
          mark His person, His character, offices, life, sufferings, and death,
          resurrection and glory, together with the promises, encouragements,
          and prospects directly flowing from this blessed subject—and oh! what
          a treasure-house shall we find, richly furnished with every source of
          delight, and every ground of support!<br />

            93. I will never forget Your precepts; for with them You have
            quickened me.<br /> </font
          ><br />

          An admirable resolution! the blessed fruit of the quickening power of
          the word in his deep affliction. He had before acknowledged this
          supernatural efficacy, "Your word has quickened me." Now he more
          distinctly mentions it, as the instrumental only—not the
          efficient—cause—With them You have quickened me. Had the power been in
          the word, the same effect would have immediately and invariably
          followed. Nor should we have been constrained to lament the limited
          extent of its influence. How many, Christian, shared with you in the
          outward privileges; but perhaps unto none was the life-giving blessing
          given, save unto yourself—the most unlikely—the most unworthy of all!
          Thus does "God work in us both to will and to do"—not according to any
          prescribed law, but "of His good pleasure." The grace therefore is not
          from, but through, the means. Almighty God is the source of the life.
          The word is the instrument—yet so "quick," so melting, so attractive,
          that we might ask, out of what rock was that heart hewn, that is proof
          against its power? Yet while the precepts work nothing without the
          agents they are the ordinary course, by which the Lord quickens whom
          He will.<br />
          <br />

          And do not we find them still lively channels of refreshment? Surely,
          then, we will hold to our purpose of not forgetting the precepts. The
          leaves of the word of God are the leaves of the tree of life, as well
          as of the tree of knowledge. They not only enlighten the path, but
          they supply life for daily work and progress. "The words that I speak
          unto you"—said Jesus, "they are spirit, and they are life:" so that
          the times when we have been most diligent in our meditation and
          obedience to the precepts, have been uniformly the seasons of our most
          holy consolation.<br />
          <br />

          Men of the world, however, with accurate recollections of all matters,
          connected with their temporal advantage, are remarkably slow in
          retaining the truths of God. They plead their short memories, although
          conscious that this infirmity does not extend to their important
          secular engagements. But what wonder that they forget the precepts,
          when they have never been quickened with them—never received any
          benefit from them? The word of God is not precious to them: they
          acknowledge no obligation to it: they have no acquaintance with it. It
          has no place in their affections, and therefore but little abode in
          their remembrance.<br />
          <br />

          But this resolution is the language of sincerity, not of perfection.
          The child of God is humbled in the conscious forgetfulness of the
          Lord's precepts. And this consciousness keeps his eye fixed upon Jesus
          for pardon and acceptance: while every fresh sense of acceptance
          strengthens his more habitual remembrance. Then, as for his natural
          inability to preserve an accurate recollection of Divine things—let
          him not estimate the benefit of the word by the results in the memory,
          so much as by the impression upon the heart. The word may have darted
          through the mind, as a flash of lightning, that strikes and is gone;
          and yet the heart may have been melted, and the passing flash may have
          shed a heavenly ray upon a dubious path. If the heart retains the
          quickening power, the precepts are not forgotten, even though the
          memory should have failed to preserve them.<br />
          <br />

          But whatever word of conviction, direction, or encouragement, may have
          come to us, affix this seal to it—I will never forget Your precepts.
          It may be of signal use in some hour of temptation. The same Spirit
          that breathed before upon it may breathe again; if not with the same
          present sensible power, yet with a seasonable and refreshing
          recollection of past support.<br />

            94. I am Yours; save me; for I have sought Your precepts.<br /> </font
          ><br />

          What a high and honorable character is stamped upon the lowest
          believer! He is the Savior's unalienable property, his portion, the
          "workmanship" of His hand, the purchase of His blood, the triumph of
          His conquering love. He is given to Him by His Father, "preserved in
          Him, and called." The evidence of his character is found in seeking
          the Lord's precepts. "Whom we serve" will prove "whose we are." "His
          servants you are, to whom you obey." "Know that the Lord has set apart
          him that is godly for Himself." "The carnal mind is not subject to the
          law of God, neither indeed can be. So then those who are in the flesh"
          cannot seek the Lord's precepts. A new and spiritual bias, therefore,
          is the visible stamp and seal of the Lord's interest in us.<br />
          <br />

          True it is, that our Divine Savior can never be robbed of His
          property—that His people are saved in Him, beyond the reach of earth
          and hell to touch them. Yet are they dependent still—always
          sinners—every day's provocation making them more sinners than before;
          needing, therefore, from day to day, fresh power, fresh keeping, and,
          above all, fresh cleansing and acceptance. But what a powerful plea
          for mercy may we draw from the Lord's interest in us! Will not a man
          be careful of his children, his treasure, his jewels? 'Such am I. Your
          sovereign love has bought me—made me Yours—I am Yours; save me. You
          have saved me; "You have delivered my soul from death; will You not
          deliver my feet from falling?" Save me from the love of sin, from the
          daily guilt and power of sin; from the treachery of my own foolish
          heart from all this, and all besides, which You see ensnaring to my
          soul. If I am not Yours, whence this desire, this endeavor to seek
          Your precepts? What mean my privileged moments of communion with You?
          What mean the yet unsatisfied desires after a conformity to Your
          image? Lord, I would humbly plead Your own act, Your free and
          sovereign act, that made me Yours. Save me, because You have brought
          Your salvation near to me, and sealed me Yours. I need mercy to begin
          with me; mercy to accompany me; mercy to abide with me forever. I am
          Yours; save me.'<br />
          <br />

          And what irresistible energy does it give to our pleading, that this
          was the sole purpose, that brought down the Son of God from Heaven! "I
          came down"—said he, "from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will
          of Him that sent Me. And this is the Father's will which has sent Me,
          that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing." Of this
          purpose He was enabled to testify at the conclusion of His work,
          "Those that You gave Me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the
          son of perdition."<br />
          <br />

          But some cry for salvation, who neglect duty, and thus make void their
          plea. Can we make our interest good, by seeking His precepts? Is it
          the way in which we love to walk? Then let us not desist from our plea
          before God, until our heart listens to the voice of love, centering
          every blessing of creation, redemption, and heavenly calling, in the
          privilege of adoption, "Thus says the Lord, that created you, O Jacob,
          and He who formed you, O Israel Fear not, for I have redeemed you: I
          have called you by your name; you are Mine. You are My servant; O
          Israel, you shall not be forgotten of Me. I have blotted out, as a
          thick cloud, your transgressions; and as a cloud your sins." I have
          regarded this your plea. I have heard this your prayer—I am Yours,
          save me.<br />

            95. The wicked have waited for me to destroy me; but I will consider
            Your testimonies.</font
          ><br />
          <br />

          Am I, as a believer, safe as the Lord's property, and in the Lord's
          keeping? Yet must I expect that the wicked, the ungodly, as the
          instruments of Satan, will not cease to distress me. The Psalmist had
          before alluded to this trial, as driving him to his refuge. And,
          indeed, this is the constant character of the believer's walk—enduring
          the enmity of the ungodly, and seeking his refuge in the word of
          God—in that hiding-place of safety to which the word directs him. How
          striking is the proof of the irreconcilable variance between God and
          the world—the world encouraging all that is contrary to God, and
          persecuting His image in His people! Yet the word opens to us a sure
          defense. If our "soul is among lions," cannot we testify to the
          astonishment of the world, "My God has sent His angel, and has shut
          the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me?" We hear indeed the
          roaring of the winds and waves; but we hear also the voice hushing the
          storm to rest, "Peace, be still."<br />
          <br />

          The experience of this trial and support beautifully illustrates the
          promise, "He who believes shall not make haste." He whose hope is
          firmly fixed on that "tried corner-stone," which God Himself has "laid
          in Zion as a sure foundation" "shall not be greatly moved;" no—he
          "shall not be moved" at all, by the wicked waiting for him to destroy
          him. In the hour of difficulty, instead of perplexing himself with
          successive expedients for his safety (sought more from human
          contrivance, than from asking counsel at the mouth of God) he
          "possesses his soul in patience," and calmly commits all events to the
          Lord. Such a man "shall not be afraid of evil tidings! his heart is
          fixed, trusting in the Lord." 'This trust is grounded on the word of
          God, revealing His power and all-sufficiency, and withal His goodness,
          His offer of Himself to be the stay of the soul, commanding us to rest
          upon Him. People wait on I know not what persuasions and assurances;
          but I know no other to build faith on but the word of promise. The
          truth and faithfulness of God opened up His wisdom, and power, and
          goodness, as the stay of all those that, renouncing all other props,
          will venture on it, and lay all upon Him. "He who believes, sets to
          his seal that God is true:" and so he is sealed for God; his portion
          and interest secured. "If you will not believe, surely you shall not
          be established."'<br />
          <br />

          But it is the considering of the Lord's testimonies that draws out
          their staying support. The soul must be fixed upon them, as "tried
          words, purified seven times in the fire." And in this frame, I will,
          under all distresses, all circumstances of trial, or even of dismay,
          consider Your testimonies. I will consider the faithfulness of those
          blessed declarations, "There shall not an hair of your head perish.
          Touch not My anointed." "He who touches you, touches the apple of My
          eye." With this armor of defense, I shall not be afraid, even should I
          hear the "evil tidings," that the wicked have waited for me, to
          destroy me. Or even should I be destroyed, I know that Your
          testimonies cannot fail—that my rock is perfect, "that there is no
          unrighteousness in Him;" and therefore, "though a host should encamp
          against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against
          me, in this will I be confident." Whether, then, I am delivered from
          the wicked, and live, "I live unto the Lord;" or whether I fall into
          their snare, and "die—I die unto the Lord;" for I will consider Your
          testimonies, assured that all Your purposes shall be accomplished
          concerning me, as You have said, "I will never leave you, nor forsake
          you." "You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
          You, because he trusts in You."<br />
          <br />

            96. I have seen an end of all perfection; but Your commandment is
            exceeding broad.</font
          ><br />
          <br />

          A deeper insight into the Lord's testimonies is the sure result of
          considering them. Weigh them in the balances against this world's
          excellency; the world and the word—each with all its fullness. Of the
          one perfection we see an end—of the other—none. This world is a matter
          of experience and observation. We have seen an end—not of some—but of
          all its perfection. It wants sufficiency. It stands us in no stead in
          the great emergencies of affliction—death—judgment—eternity. It wants
          solidity in its best substance. "In its wisdom is grief!" All its
          delicacies and indulgences—after having, like the King of Jerusalem,
          "not withheld the heart from any joy"—all end in the verdict of
          disappointment, "Behold! all was vanity and vexation of spirit!" Its
          continuance is but for a moment. The soul is born for eternity.
          Therefore it must have a portion to last as long as itself. But the
          world, with its lusts and fashions, passes away. All that it can offer
          is a bubble—a shadow. In its best riches, honors, and pleasures—in the
          utmost that its perfection can yield—in its height and prime of
          enjoyment—what is it in itself—what is it able to do for us? "All is
          vanity." And yet such is the alienation of the heart from God, that it
          is first tried to the very uttermost, before any desire to return
          homeward is felt or expressed. And even then, nothing but the Almighty
          power of God can bring the sinner back. He would rather perish in his
          misery, than "return to his rest."<br />
          <br />

          Now contrast with the emptiness of the world the fullness of the
          commandment of God. Our whole duty to our God, our neighbor, and
          ourselves, is here laid open before us—commanding without abatement,
          and forbidding without allowance—making no excuse for
          ignorance—frailty or forgetfulness—reaching not only to every species
          of crime, but to everything tending to it. This is perfection, of
          which we never see an end. Every fresh view opens—not the extent—but
          the immensity of the field; and compels us at length to shut up our
          inquiries with the adoring acknowledgment—Your commandment is
          exceeding broad. Its various parts form one seamless piece; so that no
          particle can be separated without injury to the whole. As all the
          curtains of the tabernacle connected by taches and loops, made but one
          covering for the ark, and the loosening or disjunction of the smallest
          point disannulled the fitness of the whole; so it belongs to the
          perfection of the commandment, that "whoever shall keep the whole law,
          and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." The spirituality of
          its requirements equally illustrates its Divine perfection. An angry
          look is murder; an unchaste desire is adultery; the "stumbling-block
          of iniquity" "covetousness"—in the heart is idolatry; the thought as
          well as the act—the first conception of sin, as well as the
          after-commission—brings in the verdict—Guilty—Death.<br />
          <br />

          Can we, then, endure the sight of its exceeding breadth? Yes—for the
          commandment of the gospel is equally broad, and covers all. We know
          who has stood in our place—who has satisfied Sinai's unalterable
          requirements, and borne its awful curse. Broad as it may be, the love
          which has fulfilled it is immeasurable. As a covenant, therefore, it
          has now lost its terrors. As a rule, we love it for its extent, and
          for its purity; for the comprehensiveness of its obligations, and for
          the narrowness of its liberty for indulgence; nor would we wish to be
          subject to a less severe scrutiny, or a more lenient
          administration.<br />
          <br />

          Reader! if you have learned the exceeding breadth and spirituality of
          the law (the first lesson that is taught and learned in the school of
          Christ), your views of yourself and your state before God will be
          totally changed. Before, you were "thanking God" in your heart, "that
          you were not as other men are." Now you will be "smiting upon your
          bosom, saying—God be merciful to me a sinner!" Before, perhaps, you
          might have thought yourself, "touching the righteousness which is of
          the law, blameless." Now you will glory in your new and more
          enlightened choice, "What things were gain to me, those I counted loss
          for Christ." Once you considered yourself "alive," when you were
          really dead. Now that "the commandment is come" in its heart-searching
          spirituality and conviction to your soul, you "die" that you may live.
          Blessed change from the law to the gospel, "from death to life!" "I
          through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God."<br />
          <br />

          Such is the effect of the transition from a legal to an evangelical
          ground. Before, we were reckless of sin, and therefore reckless of the
          gospel. As the one fell lightly upon our conscience, the other held a
          light estimation in our judgment. While we had no disturbance from the
          law, we had no delight in the gospel. But now that we see in the true
          mirror, we are at once alarmed and enlightened. Praised be God! we now
          take the true estimate—we degrade to the uttermost righteousness by
          works—we exalt to the uttermost righteousness by faith. In the one we
          see pollution—in the other perfection.<br />

            PART 13.<br />
            <br />

            97. O how love I Your law! it is my meditation all the day.</font
          ><br />

           <br />

          Mark the man of God giving utterance to his feelings of heavenly
          delight—expressing most, by intimating that he cannot adequately
          express what he desires. He seems unable to restrain his
          acknowledgments of Divine influence springing up in his heart—O how
          love I Your law! This experience is most distinctive of a spiritual
          character. The professor may read, and understand, and even externally
          obey the law; but the believer only loves it; and he lives in it, as
          if he could not live without it. To the professor it is a task imposed
          to satisfy conscience; "the veil upon the heart" darkens all his
          spiritual apprehension, and consequently excludes spiritual delight.
          To the child of God, it is food and medicine, light and comfort—yes,
          "life from the dead." The law of precept in the word is a "law of
          liberty"—a law of love—in his heart. His former obedience was the
          bondage of fear. But how different is the effect of constraining love!
          He now delights to view it in every lineament. He dwells upon every
          feature with intense enjoyment. Before, it was his confinement—his
          chain. Now, it is his liberty—his ornament. He is not what he was,
          "Old things are passed away: behold, all things are become new."<br />

           <br />

          Think what good reason there is to love the law. It is the epistle of
          our most beloved friend—not to be slighted, but to be placed in our
          bosom, nearest our hearts. It sets out that relief, without which the
          conscience would have been tortured by the never-dying worm. There is
          more of glory—more of God—in this, than in any other manifestation of
          His name. It has ever been the mirror, that has reflected Christ to
          His church. The spiritual eye discerns Him in every part.
          Now—Reader—do you search for Him in His law? Do you love His law,
          because it "testifies of Him?" Do you pray for His Spirit, that His
          law may guide you to Him? This is the evidence that you have "turned
          unto the Lord, when the veil is taken away," and you "with unveiled
          face behold in this glass the glory of the Lord." Then if you do love
          His law, you will love the whole of it—its obligations as well as its
          privileges. You will love it at all times, even when it is thwarting
          your own will and way. The whole law is light and love—wisdom and
          faithfulness.<br />

            <br />

          But love of the law fastens the soul to the beloved object, It is my
          meditation all the day. When you cannot have it in your hand, it will
          be found, if indeed your soul is in a prosperous state, "hid in your
          heart." There it is kept as your most precious treasure; while you
          live upon it with unwearied appetite as your daily bread, and exercise
          yourself in it as your daily rule. Oh, how worthy is it of all the
          love of the warmest heart! The deepest students are most humbled for
          their want of suitable enlargement.<br />

           <br />

          But this heavenly spirit can only be grounded upon a sense of
          reconciliation. Can an unreconciled sinner be interested in the law,
          in every page of which he reads his own condemnation? This explains
          the enmity of the ungodly. But the cultivation of this spirit upon the
          ground of the gospel is a most important principle of the Christian
          steadfastness, the want of which has been the source of fearful
          delusion; and in the exercise of which we shall realize a deeper
          insight and more spiritual discernment of Scriptural truth. Warm
          affections will be far more influential than talent, or mere external
          knowledge.<br />

           <br />

          This habit of love and holy meditation will spread its influence over
          our whole character. It will fill our hearts with heavenly matter for
          prayer, diffuse a sweet savor over our earthly employments, sanctify
          the common bounties of Providence, realize the presence of God
          throughout the day, command prosperity upon our lawful undertakings,
          and enlarge our usefulness in the church. Thus the man of God is
          formed in his completeness, symmetry, and attraction—such as the world
          is often constrained secretly to admire, even where the heart is
          unready to follow.<br />

           <br />

          Lord! implant in my heart a supreme love to Your law. Write it upon my
          heart—even that new law, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
          Jesus." May I love it so, that I may be always meditating upon it, and
          by continual meditation yet more enlarging my love and delight in it!
          So let it prove an ever-springing source of heavenly enjoyment and
          holy conversation!<br />

           <br />

           <font color="#FF0000"
            ><br />

            98. You through Your commandments have made me wiser than my
            enemies; for they are ever with me. 99. I have more understanding
            than all my teachers: for Your testimonies are my meditation. 100. I
            understand more than the ancients, because I keep Your
            precepts.</font
          ><br />

           <br />

          What a fruitful harvest did David reap from his glowing love, and
          "daily meditation on the law of God!" He became wiser than his enemies
          in "subtlety"—than all his teachers in doctrine—than the ancients in
          experience. Yet he is not speaking of his extraordinary gifts as a
          prophet, but of his knowledge gained by ordinary means. Nor is he here
          boasting of his own attainments: but commending the grace of God in
          and towards him—You through Your commandments have made me wiser. How
          much more wisdom does the persecuted believer draw from the word of
          God, than his persecutors have ever acquired from the learning of this
          world! Those, however, who have been effectually taught of God, need
          to be daily taught of Him. While they rest upon their God, and seek
          counsel in His word, they are wise indeed; yet when they trust to
          their own wisdom, and turn to their own counsel, they become a
          bye-word and occasion of offence by their own folly. Was David wiser
          than his enemies or his teachers, when he dissembled himself before
          Achish—or when he yielded to the indulgence of lust—or when in the
          pride of his heart he numbered the people? Alas! how often do even
          God's children befool themselves in the ways of sin!<br />

           <br />

          But how did David attain this Divine wisdom? Not by habits of
          extensive reading—not by natural intelligence—but by a diligent
          meditation in the testimonies. In order to avail ourselves, however,
          of this means—a simple reception of the Divine testimony is of
          absolute importance. We can never obtain that assurance of the
          certainty of our faith, which is indispensable to our peace, or resist
          the influence of unenlightened teachers, or the long-established
          worldly maxims of the ancients, except by entire submission to the
          supreme authority of Scripture. Many sincere Christians—especially at
          the outset of their course—are much hindered—either by the skepticism
          of others, or of their own minds; or from their previous habit of
          studying the Bible in the light of carnal wisdom, or in dependence
          upon human teaching. Such need special prayer for humility of mind and
          simplicity of faith. Under this gracious influence they will discern
          that path to glory, which in infinite condescension is made so plain,
          that "the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein," and the
          unlearned believer, who has the word before his eyes, in his heart,
          and in his life, shall become "perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all
          good works."<br />

           <br />

          In our Christian progress, David's habit of scriptural meditation will
          prove of essential service. For while those who "confer with flesh and
          blood" cannot have their counselors always at hand; we, seeking our
          wisdom from the word of God, have the best Counselor ever with us,
          teaching us what to do, and what to expect. Obedience also, as well as
          meditation, directs our way. David found understanding, because he
          kept the precepts. And David's Lord has pointed out the same path of
          light: "If any man will do God's will, he shall know of the doctrine."
          "You meet him who rejoices, and works righteousness—those that
          remember You in Your ways." Your ways truly are ways of light, joy,
          and love!<br />
          <br />

          Now let us turn in, and inquire—What is our daily use of the word of
          God? Are we satisfied with a slight looking, or do we seek an intimate
          acquaintance with it! Is its influence ever present—ever practical? Do
          we prize it as a welcome guest? Is it our delightful companion and
          guide? Oh! meditate in this blessed book. "Eat the word," when you
          "have found it; and it will be unto you the joy and rejoicing of your
          heart." The name of Jesus—its great subject—will be more precious—your
          love will be inflamed—your perseverance established—and your heart
          enlivened in the spirit of praise. Thus bringing your mind into close
          and continual contact with the testimonies of God, and pressing out
          the sweetness from the precious volume, it will drop as from the
          honeycomb, daily comfort and refreshment upon your heart.
