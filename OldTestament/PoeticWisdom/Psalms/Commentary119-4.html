        <h2>119:76-100</h2>
        <p>
          76. Let, I pray You, Your merciful kindness be for my comfort:
          according to Your word unto Your servant.
        </p>
        <p>
          What! does the Psalmist then seek his comfort from the very hand that
          strikes him? This is genuine faith, &quot;Though He slay me, yet will
          I trust in Him.&quot; The very arm that seems to be uplifted for my
          destruction, shall be to me the arm of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several of the preceding verses have spoken of affliction. The
          Psalmist now prays for alleviation under it. But of what kind? He does
          not &quot;beseech the Lord, that it might depart from him.&quot; No.
          His repeated acknowledgments of the supports given under it, and the
          benefits he had derived from it, had reconciled him to commit its
          measure and continuance to the Lord. All that he needs, and all that
          he asks for, is, a sense of His merciful kindness upon his soul. Thus
          he submits to His justice in accumulated trials, and expects
          consolation under them, solely upon the ground of His free favor.
          Indeed, it is hard to hold on under protracted affliction without this
          precious support. Patience may restrain murmuring but a sense of love
          alone keeps from fainting. Holiness is our service—affliction is our
          exercise—comfort is our gracious reward. All the candles in the world,
          in the absence of the sun, can never make the day. The whole earth, in
          its brightest visions of fancy, destitute of the Lord&#x27;s love, can
          never cheer nor revive the soul. Indeed, it matters little where we
          are, or what we have. In the fullness of refreshing ordinances, unless
          the Lord meets us, and blesses us with His merciful kindness for our
          comfort, it is &quot;a thirsty land, where no water is.&quot; Absalom
          might as well have been at Geshur as at Jerusalem, so long as he
          &quot;saw not the king&#x27;s face.&quot; Nothing that the Lord
          &quot;gives us richly to enjoy&quot; will satisfy, if this source of
          refreshment be withheld. The worldling&#x27;s inquiry is, &quot;Who
          will show us any good?&quot; The Christian forms his answer into a
          prayer, &quot;Lord! lift up the light of Your countenance upon
          me.&quot; Let Your merciful kindness be for my comfort. This gives the
          enjoyment of every real good, and supplies the place of every fancied
          good. It is a blessing that never cloys, and will never end: and every
          fresh taste quenches the thirst for earthly pleasures. &quot;Whoever
          drinks of this water&quot;—says our Divine Savior, &quot;shall thirst
          again. But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall
          never thirst!&quot; &quot;Delight yourself in the Lord; and He shall
          give you the desires of your heart.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But, Reader, do you wish to realize this comfort? Then seek to
          approach your God by the only way of access. Learn to contemplate Him
          in the only glass in which a God of love is seen, &quot;in the face of
          Jesus Christ.&quot; Guard against looking for comfort from any other
          source. Beware especially of that satisfaction in creature-cisterns
          which draws you away from &quot;the fountain of living waters.&quot;
          Learn also to prize this comfort supremely, and not to be content
          without some enjoyment, or even with a scanty measure of enjoyment;
          but rather let every day&#x27;s refreshment be made a step for
          desiring and attaining renewed and sweeter refreshment for tomorrow.
          Some, however, appear to look at David&#x27;s experience, as if at
          present they could hardly expect to reach its happiness: and so they
          go on in a low, depressed, and almost sullen state, refusing the
          privileges, which are as freely offered to them as to others. But such
          a state of mind is highly dishonorable to God. Let them earnestly
          plead their interest in the word of promise—According to Your word to
          Your servant. Let them lay their fingers upon one or all of the
          promises of their God. Let them spread before the Lord His own
          handwriting and seals; and their Savior has said, &quot;According to
          your faith be it unto you.&quot; &quot;The king is held in the
          galleries;&quot; and, if He should &quot;make as though He would go
          farther,&quot; He is willing that we should &quot;constrain Him,
          saying, Abide with us.&quot; No veil now but the veil of unbelief need
          hinder us from seeing an unclouded everlasting smile of merciful
          kindness upon our heavenly Father&#x27;s reconciled face. Only let us
          see to it, that He is the first, the habitual object of our
          contemplation, the satisfying well-spring of our delight—that He is
          the one desire, to which every other is subordinate, and in which
          every other is absorbed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord Jesus! I would seek for a renewed enjoyment in Your merciful
          kindness. I would not forget, that it was this that brought You down
          from heaven—that led You to endure the death of the cross—that has
          washed me in Your precious blood—that visits me with many endearing
          tokens of Your love. Oh, let all my days be spent in the sense of this
          merciful kindness for my comfort, and in rendering to You the unworthy
          returns of grateful, filial service.
        </p>
        <p>
          77. Let Your tender mercies come to me, that I may live; for Your law
          is my delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sin is no light trouble to the man of God. Mercy, therefore, is to him
          no common blessing. Never can he have—never can he ask, enough. Hence
          his repeated cries. Mercy brought him out of sin and misery. Mercy
          keeps—holds him on—assures him to the end. Every blessing comes in the
          way of mercy. The most careful walker according to the gospel rule,
          needs mercy. The elect are &quot;vessels of mercy&quot;—filled up to
          the brim with mercy. The crown of glory at last is received at the
          hands of mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The distinguishing character of God is, that His mercies are tender
          mercies—a father&#x27;s pitying—yearning mercies. When His returning
          prodigal expected probably upbraiding looks, if not a frown of
          banishment, how did these tender mercies bury, not only his sins, but
          also his very confessions in the depths of the sea, and welcome him
          without a cloud to his forsaken home! The same tender considerations
          put away from His children all anxiety respecting &quot;what they
          shall eat, or what they shall drink, or wherewithal they shall be
          clothed. As a Father He also &quot;chastens&quot; them, &quot;he
          suffers their manners&quot;—He &quot;spares them, as a man spares his
          own son that serves him;&quot; and, finally, He determines respecting
          each of them by an act of sovereign power, &quot;You shall call Me, My
          Father, and shall not depart from Me.&quot; In a yet more endearing
          character He speaks, &quot;As one whom his mother comforts, so will I
          comfort you. They may forget; yet will I not forget You.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet have we no just apprehension of these tender mercies, unless they
          come to us. In the midst of the wide distribution, let me claim my
          interest. Let them come to me. Praised be God! the way is open to me.
          The mere report is unfruitful. I cannot speak of them with glow and
          unction. The application of them is life—not the mere breathing of
          spiritual existence, but the life of my life—the living principle of
          devotedness and enjoyment—living to and for God in every form and
          sphere, in every hour and action of the day; my feebleness becoming
          strength in the Lord; &quot;walking up and down in His name.&quot;
          This truly is &quot;reigning in life;&quot; rising to more of its
          honor and dignity, and reaching forth to more of its excellence and
          happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us not lose sight of the abundant overflowing spring, from
          which our life is maintained. &quot;In Christ was life;&quot; and He
          &quot;came that we might have life, and that we might have it more
          abundantly.&quot; There can be, therefore, no exercises of life
          without a vital union to Christ—the source of life. Shall we then give
          up the hope of believing in Christ, until we feel the influence of
          this spiritual principle? This would be indeed like refusing to abide
          in the vine, until we could bring forth fruit; whereas the branch,
          while separated from the vine, must ever be fruitless and withered. We
          must receive life from Christ, not bring it to Him. Faith implants us
          in Him; and &quot;Christ dwelling in the heart by faith&quot; becomes
          the life of the soul, animating it in the ways of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This life, therefore, will manifest itself in delight in God&#x27;s
          law. We shall not be satisfied to live upon the mere surface of the
          gospel (which is barren and unproductive, as any other surface, in
          spiritual usefulness), but we shall search into its hidden treasures,
          and draw forth its real life and consolation. This &quot;delight&quot;
          will furnish a plea for our use at the throne of grace. &#x27;If this
          is the fruit and acting of the life of Your own implanting, Lord!
          cherish it. Let me live by the influence of Your tender mercies. I
          venture to plead my delight in Your law, as an evidence of my adoption
          into Your family. And, therefore, I would renew my plea and my
          petition—Let Your tender mercies come to me, that my life may be not
          only existence, but enjoyment—the beginning, the earnest, of the
          everlasting life and bliss of heaven.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          78. Let the proud be ashamed: for they dwelt perversely with me
          without a cause: but I will meditate in Your precepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prophecy with which God Himself condescended to open the history
          of the church, has ever since been in the course of accomplishment.
          &quot;Enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the
          woman,&quot; has been the prevailing character and course of the
          world. &quot;An unjust man is an abomination to the just; and he who
          is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.&quot; David,
          however, prayed for the confusion of his enemies—not in a vindictive
          spirit, as if thirsting for their destruction; but as opening the way
          for his own more free service of God, and as a chastening, that might
          eventually turn to their salvation, &quot;Fill their faces with shame,
          that they may seek Your name, O Lord!&quot; That his prayer was the
          expression of his tender compassion, rather than of resentful feeling,
          is sufficiently evident from his affectionate weeping concern for
          their immortal interests. Prayers of the same deprecating character
          dropped from the lips of the gentle and compassionate Savior: while
          the objects of His awful deprecations were interested in the most
          yearning sympathies of His heart. A regard also for the honor of God
          dictated this prayer. David knew that the malice of his enemies
          against him was only the working of their enmity against God; that it
          was not so much him that they hated and persecuted, as God in him. And
          therefore as a servant of God he could appeal, &quot;Do not I hate
          them, O Lord, that hate You? and am not I grieved at those that rise
          up against You? I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them my
          enemies.&quot; The followers of a despised Savior must indeed expect
          to be severely distressed with the perverseness of the proud. But
          when, like their Master, they can testify that it is without a cause,
          how cheering are their Master&#x27;s words! &quot;Blessed are you,
          when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner
          of evil against you falsely for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding
          glad; for great is your reward in heaven.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And have you, reader, been exercised with trials from an ungodly
          world? Has the derision of the proud, or the slight or ill-treatment
          of the ungodly, never excited revengeful feelings within? Have you
          always been enabled to set your Savior&#x27;s example before you, and
          &quot;in patience possessing your soul,&quot; to refer your cause to
          your Almighty Friend? &quot;O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for
          me.&quot; Remember, He has engaged to take up your cause, &quot;Shall
          not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though
          He bear long with them?—I tell you that He will avenge them
          speedily.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But learn in the hour of trial where to go, and what to do. Go to the
          word of God for direction and support. Meditate in His precepts. There
          is often a hurry of mind in times of difficulty, which unhinges the
          soul from the simple exercise of faith. But habit brings practice, and
          steadiness, and simplicity, enabling us most sweetly to fix our hearts
          upon the word of God, and to apply its directions and encouragements
          to the present exigency. Our enemies fight against us with an arm of
          flesh. We resist them with the armor of the word of God. And how
          inestimably precious is the armor, refuge, strength, and consolation,
          here provided for us against every effort to disturb our peace,
          &quot;or separate our hearts from the love of God, which is in Christ
          Jesus our Lord!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          79. Let those who fear You turn to me, and those that have known Your
          testimonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the believer finds trouble from the world, he prays that he may
          find help from the Lord&#x27;s people. The very sight of our
          Father&#x27;s family is cheering. It brings not only fellowship but
          help. For the wise distribution of gifts in the body—each having his
          own gift—was ordained for the mutual help and sympathy of the several
          members. It is painful therefore to see Christians often walking aloof
          from each other, and suffering coldness, distance, differences and
          distrust to divide them from their brethren. Who then will not pray,
          that He, who has the hearts of all His people in His hand, would turn
          the hearts of those that fear Him and know His testimonies, unto their
          brethren? It was the honor of Mordecai, that he was &quot;accepted of
          the multitude of his brethren.&quot; In the primitive church,
          &quot;Demetrius had good report of all men, and of the truth
          itself;&quot; and the members of the church generally &quot;did eat
          their meat with gladness and singleness of heart; praising God, and
          having favor with all the people.&quot; &#x27;Then,&#x27; as
          Chrysostom exultingly exclaims, &#x27;the Church was a little
          heaven.&#x27; Then they could say to each other, &quot;Behold, how
          good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!&quot;
          and even their Heathen neighbors were awed and constrained into the
          confession, &quot;See how these Christians love one another.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas! that our Jerusalem should no longer exhibit the picture of a
          &quot;city compact together&quot;—that so many &quot;walls of
          partition&quot; should separate brother from brother, so that our Zion
          has very rarely been exhibited in her &quot;perfection of
          beauty,&quot; when &quot;the multitude of them that believed were of
          one heart and of one soul.&quot; Prejudice and misconception divided
          Job from his friends. Want of forbearance cankered the union of the
          members of the church of Rome, and even prevailed to separate chief
          friends—Paul and Barnabas. Diversity of sentiment injured the
          influence of brotherly love at Corinth. And thus it has been in every
          successive age of the church; so that the full answer to the
          Redeemer&#x27;s prayer, and the grand display to the world of the
          Divine original of the gospel, is yet to be manifested. But as
          &quot;the communion of saints&quot; was the peculiar feature of
          primitive Christianity, and ever since has formed an article of her
          faith; in proportion as we return to the primitive standard, we shall
          hold closer fellowship with each other—as &quot;members of one
          body&quot; &quot;considering one another, to provoke unto love and to
          good works&quot; &quot;bearing one another&#x27;s burdens;&quot;—and
          &quot;receiving one another, as Christ also received us, to the glory
          of God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Lack of Christian self-denial presents the main hindrance to this
          &quot;keeping the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.&quot;
          But—admitting that some of the brethren are &quot;weak in the
          faith&quot; in comparison with ourselves—are we then to be
          &#x27;rolling endlessly the returning stone,&#x27; obtruding always
          the same stumbling-offence upon them? We are &quot;not to please
          ourselves&quot; in compelling them to adopt our views; but rather to
          &quot;receive them, and bear their infirmities.&quot; Accursed be that
          charity, that is preserved by &quot;the shipwreck of faith!&quot; But
          though scriptural truth must never be denied, there are times when it
          may be forborne. The Apostle &quot;knew and was persuaded of the Lord
          Jesus, that there was nothing unclean of itself;&quot; yet he would
          rather allow even the misconception of conscience, until clearer light
          should be given, than endanger the unity of the church. Liberty must
          give place to love; and for himself, he would rather restrain himself
          from lawful indulgence, than hazard the safety of a weaker brother, or
          turn from one that loved his Savior. Wherever, therefore, in the
          judgment of Christian charity, we discover those &quot;that love our
          Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,&quot; we must be ready to give them
          our very hearts, to view them as brethren, as one with ourselves, and
          to welcome them with brotherly love, as those whom, with all their
          infirmities, Jesus &quot;is not ashamed to call His brethren.&quot; We
          must be ready to turn to them, as those that fear God, and have known
          His testimonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          And does not the believer&#x27;s anxiety for the company and
          assistance of the Lord&#x27;s people rebuke Christian professors, who
          are far too closely linked to the society of the world? Surely, if the
          lovely attraction of many of its most avowed votaries can compensate
          for the absence of their Savior&#x27;s image, they can have but little
          relish for that heavenly enjoyment, which unites the children of God
          together in close and hallowed communion with God. And do we not see a
          proof of the deteriorating influence of this worldly spirit, in their
          readiness to feel disgust at the infirmities of the real brethren of
          the Lord, and to neglect the image of Christ in them, from the
          unsightliness of the garb, which may sometimes cover it?
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us mark the completeness of the Christian—combining the fear
          with the knowledge of God. Knowledge without fear would be
          self-confidence. Fear without knowledge would be bondage. But the
          knowledge of His testimonies, connected with an acquaintance with His
          ways, molds the character of men of God into the spirit of love; and
          qualifies them, &quot;as fathers&quot; in the gospel, to counsel the
          weak and inexperienced. Should we, however, be excluded from the
          privilege of their communion; or should they be prevented from turning
          to us; may it not be the appointed means of leading us to a more
          simple dependence on Divine teaching and grace, and to a more blessed
          anticipation of our Father&#x27;s house in heaven, where all will be
          harmony, peace, and love? &#x27;We shall carry truth and the knowledge
          of God to heaven with us; we shall carry purity there, devotedness of
          soul to God and our Redeemer, Divine love and joy, if we have these
          beginnings here, with whatever else of permanent excellence, that has
          a settled, fixed seat and, place in our souls now: and shall there
          have them in perfection. But do you think we shall carry strife to
          heaven? shall we carry anger to heaven? Envyings, heart-burnings,
          animosities; shall we carry these to heaven with us? Let us labor to
          divest ourselves, and strike off from our spirits everything that
          shall not go with us to heaven, or is equally unsuitable to our end
          and way, that there may be nothing to obstruct and hinder our
          &quot;abundant entrance&quot; at length into the everlasting
          kingdom.&#x27;

          80. Let my heart be sound in Your statutes, that I be not ashamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The perverseness of the proud will be sure to put them to shame. As
          the preservative from this shame, David prays therefore for a sound
          heart—filled with solid principle—delivered into the mold of the
          word—like the sacrifices of the law—entire for God. Often had he
          prayed for Divine teaching—now he begs for soundness in the
          Lord&#x27;s statutes. How many &quot;have made shipwreck of faith and
          of a good conscience,&quot; from an unsound heart! Ignorant of the
          spirituality of God&#x27;s requirements, and resting in an outward
          obedience, they falsely conceive themselves to be &quot;alive without
          the law,&quot; and &quot;touching the righteousness that is of the
          law, blameless.&quot; Others go a little beyond the surface; while the
          want of &quot;simplicity and godly sincerity,&quot; of brokenness of
          heart, love to the Savior, and dependence upon His grace, sooner or
          later discovers to their eternal confusion, that &quot;the root of the
          matter is&quot; not &quot;in them.&quot; &quot;Their root shall be as
          rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust. Their goodness is
          as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.&quot; An
          unsound professor, like beautiful fruit, may attract the careless eye;
          but a more narrow inspection will show a worm at the core, which has
          spoiled nearly to the surface. Such religion is only a shriveled mass
          of inactive formality—a dead image of a living thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas! how common is it to profess to take Christ for a Savior, while
          the heart is evidently worshiping Mammon as its God!—constrained—not
          inclined—to the Lord&#x27;s statutes! How possible is it to be
          &quot;carnally-minded&quot; in the daily routine of spiritual
          exercises! How important is the recollection, that no change of place,
          of company, or of circumstances, can of itself effect a change of
          heart! &quot;Saul among the prophets&quot; was Saul still; with
          &quot;another heart&quot; indeed, but not a new heart. Sin was
          restrained, but not crucified. He &quot;went out,&quot; therefore, as
          one of his progenitors, &quot;from the presence of the Lord,&quot; and
          perished, a miserable apostate from the statutes of his God. Will
          profession—knowledge—gifts— feelings—privileges—avail for a sound
          heart? Need we speak of Judas—a follower—no, even, an apostle of Jesus
          Christ—living in a familiar communion with his Lord—yet with all his
          privileges—all his profession, &quot;gone to his own place&quot;—the
          melancholy victim of his own self-deceitfulness? Need we allude to
          Balaam, &quot;the man whose eyes were open—which heard the words of
          God—which saw the vision of the Almighty&quot;—who could in the ken of
          his eye mark the goodness of the Lord&#x27;s inheritance, and even in
          the distant horizon catch a glimpse of &quot;Jacob&#x27;s star and
          scepter,&quot; and yet &quot;loved the wages of unrighteousness?&quot;
          Need we bring to the mind&#x27;s eye Ananias and Sapphira?
          Alexander—and others of like stamp—all of whom once shone as stars in
          the skies of the church—need we speak of the end of these men, to give
          energy to the prayer—Let my heart be sound in Your statutes?
        </p>
        <p>
          How fearful the thought of being &quot;a branch in the true vine&quot;
          only by profession! to be &quot;taken away&quot; at length, &quot;cast
          forth as a branch—withered—gathered—cast into the fire—burned!&quot;
          It is in the inner man that hypocrisy sets up its throne; whence it
          commands the outward acts into whatever shape or form may be best
          suited to effect its purpose. The upright Christian will therefore
          begin with calling in the help and light of God to ascertain the
          soundness of his heart. &quot;Search me, O God, and know my heart; try
          me, and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in
          me.&quot; Can there be a true and solid work, where there is a
          professed change of heart, and no manifested change of temper and
          conduct? Can that heart, which is found upon inquiry to be
          earthly—unprofitable under the power of the word,
          &quot;regarding&quot; secret &quot;iniquity&quot;—seeking bye-ends of
          praise, reputation, or gain—and for the attainment of these ends
          shrinking from the appointed cross—can that heart be sound in the
          Lord&#x27;s statutes? Impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, on the other hand, do you find that your trust in God is sincere,
          your desire towards Him supreme, your obedience to Him entire? Prize
          those evidences of soundness of heart. Thank God for them. They are
          the workings of His mighty Spirit in your heart—perhaps the answer to
          the prayer which that same Spirit had indited, Let my heart be sound
          in Your statutes. Diligently improve all the means of grace for
          keeping your heart in a vigorous state. Be daily—yes,
          continually—abiding in the vine, and receiving life and health from
          its fullness. Be much conversant with the word of God—loving it for
          itself—its holiness—its practical influences. Be chiefly afraid of
          inward decays—of a barren, sapless notion of experimental truth;
          remembering, that except your profession be constantly watered at the
          root, &quot;the things that remain in you will be ready to die.&quot;
          Specially &quot;commune with your own heart.&quot; Watch it jealously,
          because of its proneness to live upon itself—its own graces or fancied
          goodness (a sure symptom of unsoundness)—instead of &quot;living by
          the faith of the Son of God.&quot; Examine your settled judgment, your
          deliberate choice, your outgoing affections, your habitual, allowed
          practice; applying to every detection of unsoundness the blood of
          Christ, as the sovereign remedy for the diseases of a &quot;deceitful
          and desperately wicked heart.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But it may be said—will not these exercises of godly jealousy hinder
          our Christian assurance? Far from it. They will form an efficient
          preservative from carnal security. They will induce increasing
          tenderness, activity, and circumspection, in our daily walk; and thus,
          instead of retarding the enjoyment of our heavenly privilege, they
          will settle the foundation of a peaceful temperament. It is a light
          and careless frame, that is the real hindrance to confidence. An
          unsound professor knows nothing of the true spirit of adoption—nothing
          of that holy familiarity, with which a child of God unbosoms himself
          to his heavenly Father; and if he preserves an empty name in the
          church, he will be put to shame before the universe of God. But the
          sound heart is connected with &quot;a hope that makes not
          ashamed&quot;—the full blessing of scriptural confidence. For the
          heart is made sound by the &quot;sprinkling of the blood of
          Christ;&quot; and when thus &quot;sprinkled from an evil
          conscience,&quot; we &quot;have boldness&quot; to &quot;draw
          near&quot;—yes, even to &quot;enter into the holiest,&quot; &quot;in
          full assurance of faith.&quot; Blessed privilege of access and
          communion with our reconciled God! Every moment endears the Savior to
          our souls, and enlivens the hope of his glorious coming, as the joyful
          consummation of all the prospects of faith, &quot;Herein is our love
          made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>81. My soul faints for Your salvation; but I hope in Your word.</p>
        <p>
          The salvation of the Gospel was the constant object of faith and
          desire to the Lord&#x27;s people under the old dispensation. Long had
          the church triumphed in the glowing anticipation, as if in the full
          possession of the promised blessing, &quot;It shall be said in that
          day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and
          rejoice in His salvation. I will greatly rejoice in the Lord; my soul
          shall be joyful in my God; for He has clothed me with the garments of
          salvation; He has covered me with the robe of righteousness; as a
          bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself
          with her jewels.&quot; And as it was the joy of their living moments,
          so was it the support and consolation of their dying hours. &quot;I
          have waited for Your salvation, O Lord!&quot; was the expression of
          the dying patriarch&#x27;s faith. And how cheering were the last words
          of this &quot;sweet Psalmist of Israel,&quot; whose soul was now
          fainting for God&#x27;s salvation, even in his dark and foreboding
          family prospect! &quot;Although my house be not so with God, yet has
          He made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and
          sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although He
          make it not to grow.&quot; Good old Simeon, in the break of the
          gospel-day, was ready to &quot;depart in peace, for his eyes had seen
          God&#x27;s salvation.&quot; And shall not we, under this heavenly
          influence, naturally appropriate these feelings of ancient believers
          to ourselves? What interpreter but experience will be needed to
          explain them? The uneasiness felt by any interruption of our
          enjoyment, will show the soul to be fainting for this salvation.
          Nothing will satisfy but the Savior. The tempting offer of &quot;all
          the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,&quot; will fail in
          attraction. Still the cry will be, &quot;Say unto my soul, I am Your
          salvation. Let Your mercies come also unto me, O Lord; even Your
          salvation, according to Your word.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          As the lowest expectant of this salvation, am not I richer than the
          sole possessor of this world&#x27;s portion? And therefore if the Lord
          hides His face, I would look to no other quarter; I would stay by Him,
          and &quot;wait on Him,&quot; though days and months and years may pass
          away, &quot;until He have mercy upon me.&quot; My soul faints for His
          salvation: and—pressing to my lips the fullest cup of earth&#x27;s
          best joy—my heart would burst with despair of satisfaction,
          &quot;but&quot; that &quot;I hope in His word.&quot; &quot;By this
          hope I am saved.&quot; In &quot;the patience of hope&quot; I am
          resolved to wait until the last moment, lying at the footstool of my
          Savior. I am looking for the &quot;assurance of this hope&quot;—when,
          in the joyous anticipation of eternity, and with &quot;the earnest
          of&quot; the heavenly &quot;inheritance&quot; in my soul, I shall echo
          the voice of my coming Savior, &quot;Even so come, Lord Jesus.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, how precious and important a part of our armor is Hope! As a
          &quot;helmet,&quot; it has &quot;covered our head in the day of
          battle&quot; from many a &quot;fiery dart of the wicked.&quot; In
          times of darkness—when the restless foe hides the prospect from the
          eye of faith, and the child of God can scarcely, if at all, mount up
          and sing—even then hope remains, and lights a candle in moments dark
          as the chamber of the grave, &quot;Yet the Lord will command His
          loving-kindness in the daytime; and in the night-season His song shall
          be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.&quot; And when the
          afflicted, tempest-tossed soul is trembling at the prospect of
          impending danger—at this moment of infinite peril, Hope holds out the
          &quot;anchor sure and steadfast;&quot; so that in the awful crisis,
          when &quot;deep calls unto deep, and all the waves and billows are
          going over us,&quot; most unexpectedly &quot;an entrance is ministered
          unto us abundantly,&quot; in the Lord&#x27;s best time, into our
          desired haven. And it is this hope alone that sustains us. Were we to
          conceive of God according to the notions of our own hearts, we should
          give way to most unbelieving patience. But the Divine character—as it
          shines forth in the word with such love and wisdom, such tenderness
          and grace—invigorates our hope. The strength of the strongest of
          God&#x27;s people proves but small, when afflictions press heavily,
          and expected help is delayed. But though the soul faints, it cannot
          fail. We depend not on what we see or feel, but on what the word
          promises. If God has engaged, it must be fulfilled, be the
          difficulties—no, impossibilities—what they may. Fixed, therefore, upon
          this sure foundation, with our father Abraham, &quot;against
          hope&quot; from what we see, &quot;we believe in hope&quot; from what
          God has promised. Thus the word is faith&#x27;s sure venture for
          eternity—stamped with such a marvelous, mysterious impression of
          Divine glory and faithfulness, and communicating such Divine power and
          refreshment, that the believer cannot but produce his experience of
          its efficacy for the support of his tempted brethren, &quot;I had
          fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the
          land of the living. Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and He shall
          strengthen your heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>82. My eyes fail for Your word, saying, When will You comfort me?</p>
        <p>
          Though the believer may be enabled, in the habitual working of faith,
          to sustain his hope in the word, yet &quot;hope deferred makes the
          heart sick.&quot; Still, Christian, as you value the promise, trust
          the assurance. Do not be discouraged by present appearances. The
          sunshine is behind the cloud. &quot;The vision is for an appointed
          time; though it tarry, wait for it.&quot; &quot;The Lord is not slack
          concerning His promise,&quot; but we are hasty in looking for it. The
          failing of our eyes is the impatience of the will, &quot;limiting
          God&quot; to our own time, ways, and means. Faith may be exercised in
          not seeing His reasons—not being able to harmonize His promises with
          His providences, or His outward dispensations with His Divine
          perfections. But let us leave this to Him, and be &quot;still, and
          know that He is God.&quot; We shall find in the end, that perseverance
          in waiting has turned to double advantage; and that even when the
          present answer to prayer, and also sensible comfort and acceptance
          have been withheld; yet that important blessings have been
          accomplished, and the merciful purposes given in bringing the wayward
          will into more entire subjection to Himself. Yes—the blessing will be
          so much the sweeter, from being given in the Lord&#x27;s best time.
          Waiting time—whatever weariness may attend it—is precious time, and
          not a moment of it will be lost. The Lord secretly upholds faith and
          patience, so that every step of feeble perseverance in the way brings
          with it unspeakable delight. Even while our eyes fail for the
          fulfillment of the word, peace is found in submission and joyful
          expectation; and instead of a time of hardness, indolence, or
          carelessness, the Lord&#x27;s return is anticipated the more
          intensely, as His absence had been felt to be the most painful trial.
          For as well might the stars supply the place of the sun, as outward
          comforts, or even the external duties of religion, supply to the
          waiting soul the place of an absent God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never, however, let us forget, that the real cause of separation
          between God and a sinner is removed. The way of access is opened by
          the blood of Jesus; and in this way we must be found waiting, until He
          look upon us. Here will our cry, &quot;When will You comfort me?&quot;
          be abundantly answered; and though the sovereignty of God be exhibited
          in the time and measure of His consolations, yet the general rule will
          be, &quot;According to your faith, be it unto you.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But if unbelief clouds our comfort, turn the eye more simply to the
          &quot;word&quot; as testifying of Jesus. Here alone is the ground of
          comfort; and the more confidently we expect, the more patiently we
          will look. Nor shall we ever look in vain. Sin will be rebuked. But
          restoration and acceptance are assured. We shall obtain—not the
          spurious comfort of delusion—but those wholesome comforts, founded
          upon the word of promise, and connected with contrition, peace, love,
          joy, and triumph. The gospel shows hell deserved, and heaven purchased
          thus combining conviction and faith. Indeed, conviction without faith,
          would be legal sorrow; as assurance without conviction would be gospel
          presumption. Paul&#x27;s experience happily united both. Never was man
          at the same moment more exercised with conflict, and yet more
          established in assurance. Thus may we maintain our assurance as really
          in wrestling trouble as in exulting joy; honoring the Lord by an
          humble, patient spirit—in Bernard&#x27;s resolution—&#x27;I will never
          come away from You without You&#x27;—in the true spirit of the
          wrestling patriarch, &quot;I will not let You go, except You bless
          me.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we sometimes seem to go &quot;mourning without the sun,&quot;
          &quot;shut up, and we cannot come forth&quot;—straitened in our
          desires and expectations—doing little for the Lord—with little
          enjoyment in our own souls, and little apparent usefulness to the
          Church. At such seasons it is our clear duty and privilege to
          &quot;wait upon the Lord, that hides His face from the house of Jacob,
          and to look for Him.&quot; &quot;He waits that He may be gracious. He
          is a God of Judgment; and blessed are all those who wait for
          Him.&quot; He waits—not because He is reluctant to give, but that we
          may be fitted to receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          83. For I am become like a bottle in the smoke, yet do I not forget
          Your statutes.

          What an affecting picture of misery! Not only were his patience and
          hope—but his very body, &quot;dried up&quot; by long-continued
          affliction. This is he, who in the prime of youth was &quot;ruddy and
          of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to,&quot;—now shriveled
          up like a bottle of skin, hung up in the smoke! Such is the mark that
          the rod of &quot;chastening&quot; leaves on the body of humiliation.
          The soul is strengthened—the body withers—under the stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
          What might naturally have been expected to have been the result of
          this lengthened exercise? Saul, under protracted trial, resorted to
          the devil for relief. An infidel nation took occasion from thence to
          throw off the yoke. Even a good man, under a few hours&#x27; trial,
          murmurs against God—no, even defends his murmuring. How did this man
          of God behave? When his soul was fainting, his hope in the word kept
          him from sinking. Under the further continuance of the trial, the same
          recollection gives him support—yet do I not forget Your statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now—Christian—do not expect a new way to heaven to be made for you.
          Prepare for the cross. It may be—as with David—a heavy, long-continued
          burden, and, should it come—look on it as your appointed trial of
          faith, and your training discipline for more enduring conflicts. And
          remember that your determined resolution rather to pine away in
          affliction, than &quot;make a way of escape&quot; by sin—is the proof
          of the reality of His own grace in you, and of His faithful love
          towards you. Think how honorably He manifests your relation to Christ,
          by causing &quot;His sufferings to abound in you,&quot; and making you
          &quot;bear in your body the marks of the Lord Jesus.&quot; And do you
          not thus realize, as you could not otherwise do, the sympathy of our
          High Priest, who was Himself &quot;a root out of a dry ground, having
          no form nor loveliness, and no beauty that He should be
          desired—despised and rejected of men&quot; to the end? Oh, what a
          supporting cordial to His afflicted people is the sympathy of this
          suffering, tempted Savior!
        </p>
        <p>
          But to look at David, under his long-continued trials, preserving his
          recollection of the Lord&#x27;s statutes—what a striking evidence of
          the presence of his God, and the sustaining power of his word! If we
          then—blessed with much larger Scriptures than he—fail in deriving from
          them the same support, it can only be, that we do not search them in a
          dependent, prayerful, and humble spirit—that we do not simply look for
          the revelation of Christ; to mark His glory, and to increase in the
          knowledge of Him. In this spirit we should have more to say of the
          comfort of remembering the Lord&#x27;s statutes; and of their
          upholding influence, when all other stays were found as &quot;the
          trust in the shadow of Egypt—shame and confusion.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Job&#x27;s history strikingly illustrates both the trial and its
          sanctified results. When &quot;scraping himself with a potsherd, and
          sitting down among the ashes,&quot;—the temporary victim of Satanic
          power—he might well have taken up the complaint, I am become like a
          bottle in the smoke. But when in this hour of temptation he was
          enabled to resist the tempter in the person of his own wife, and
          commit himself with implicit resignation into the hands of his
          faithful God, &quot;What! shall we receive good at the hand of God,
          and shall we not receive evil?&quot;—was not this the confidence—Yet
          do I not forget Your statutes?
        </p>
        <p>
          This confidence is indeed an encouraging seal of the Lord&#x27;s love
          to our souls. For we never should have remembered His statutes, had He
          not written His covenant promises upon our hearts. And how much more
          honorable to our God is it than the desponding complaint, &quot;The
          Lord has forsaken me, and my God has forgotten me!&quot; Let us watch
          then against a proud sullenness under every little trial—such as the
          coldness of friends, the unkindness of enemies, or our Father&#x27;s
          providential dispensations. How sinful to allow hard thoughts of Him,
          whose name and character, &quot;without variableness or shadow of
          turning,&quot; is &quot;Love!&quot; A steady trust in the long and
          wearisome seasons of tribulation, is indeed &quot;to glorify God in
          the fires.&quot; Nothing honors Him so much as this enduring,
          overcoming faith, persevering in despite of opposition, in destitution
          of all outward prospects of relief. It is when &quot;against hope we
          believe in hope, not staggering at the promise of God through
          unbelief,&quot; that we are &quot;strong in faith, giving glory to
          God.&quot;
        </p>

          84. How many are the days of Your servant? When will You execute
          judgment on them that persecute me?—
        </p>
        <p>85. The proud have dug pits for me, which are not after Your law.</p>
        <p>
          Though a steady confidence in severe and protracted exercise may
          enable us, not to forget the statutes; yet we shall hasten to carry
          our complaint before Him. How many are the days of Your servant?—my
          days of affliction under the &quot;fury of the oppressor.&quot; To
          complain of God is dishonorable unbelief. To complain to God is the
          mark of His &quot;elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He
          bears long with them.&quot; Christians! study this instructive
          pattern; and, when exposed to the lawless devices of the proud, do not
          forget your hiding-place. God in Christ is your stronghold,
          &quot;whereunto you may continually resort. He has given commandment
          to save you.&quot; Your trial has done its appointed work, when it has
          brought you to Him; and inclined you, after your blessed Master&#x27;s
          example, instead of taking the vengeance into your own hands, to
          commit yourself and your cause &quot;to Him that judges
          righteously.&quot; &#x27;And this,&#x27; as Archbishop Leighton
          excellently observes, &#x27;is the true method of Christian
          patience—that which quiets the mind, and keeps it from the boiling
          tumultuous thoughts of revenge; to turn the whole matter into
          God&#x27;s hands; to resign it over to Him, to prosecute when and as
          He thinks good. Not as the most, who had rather, if they had power, do
          for themselves, and be their own avengers: and, because they have not
          power, do offer up such bitter curses and prayers for revenge unto
          God, as are most hateful to Him, and differ wholly from this calm and
          holy way of committing matters to His judgments. The common way of
          referring things to God is indeed impious and dishonorable to Him,
          being really no other than calling Him to be a servant and executioner
          of our passion. We ordinarily mistake His justice, and judge of it
          according to our own precipitate and distempered minds. If wicked men
          be not crossed in their designs, and their wickedness evidently
          crushed, just when we would have it, we are ready to give up the
          matter as desperate; or at least to abate of those confident and
          reverent thoughts of Divine justice which we owe Him. However things
          go, this ought to be fixed in our hearts, that He who sits in heaven
          judges righteously, and executes that His righteous judgment in the
          fittest season.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually the Psalmist is expressing his love for the law. Here he is
          complaining against his enemies; yet still implying the same spirit,
          that the pits, which the proud dug for him, were not after God&#x27;s
          law. The martyr&#x27;s cry under the altar shows the acceptance of
          this complaint; &quot;seeing it is a righteous thing with God to
          recompense tribulation to them that trouble&quot; His people,
          &quot;and to them that are troubled rest.&quot; Some of us indeed have
          known but little of &quot;cruel mockings&quot; and bitter
          persecutions. Let such be thankful for the merciful exemption from
          this &quot;hardness:&quot; but let them gird on their armor for the
          conflict. Let none of us, in the determination to &quot;live godly in
          Christ Jesus,&quot; expect to escape &quot;persecution.&quot; Let us
          &quot;count the cost&quot; of suffering for Christ, whether we shall
          be able to abide it. For the mere spiritless notions, or for the
          unenlivened forms of religion, of which we have never felt the power,
          nor tasted the sweetness, it would be little worth our while to expose
          ourselves to inconvenience. But if we understand the grand
          substantials of the gospel—if we are clearly assured of their reality,
          practically acknowledge their influence, and experimentally realize
          their enjoyment, we shall dare the persecuting malice of the proud in
          defense of a treasure dearer to us than life itself. Should we,
          however, be too rich to part with all for Christ, or too high in the
          estimation of the world to confess His despised followers, it will be
          no marvel, or rather a marvel of mercy, if He should sweep away our
          riches, and suffer the proud to dig pits for us. To make this world
          &quot;a wilderness or a land of darkness&quot; to us, may be His
          wisely-ordained means to turn us back to Himself as our portion, to
          His word as our support, to His people as our choice companions, and
          to heaven as our eternal rest.
        </p>

          86. All Your commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully;
          help me.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the lengthened duration of trials, the eyes fail with looking
          upward, the voice of prayer grows faint, and in a moment of weakness,
          the faithfulness of God is almost questioned, as if we should go
          mourning to the very end of our days. It is at such a season that He
          who delights to &quot;comfort them that are cast down,&quot; realizes
          to the view of faith the unchangeable faithfulness of His commandments
          with respect to His people. In this recollection we can &quot;look up
          and lift up our heads,&quot; and &quot;go on our way,&quot; if not
          &quot;rejoicing,&quot; yet at least with humble acquiescence; assured,
          that in the perseverance of faith and hope, we shall ultimately be
          &quot;more than conquerors through Him that loved us.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Many Old Testament histories beautifully illustrate the reward of this
          simplicity of faith in temporal emergencies. When Asa&#x27;s
          &quot;hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of
          Jacob,&quot; &quot;his bow abode in strength.&quot; When at a
          subsequent period he &quot;trusted in man, and made flesh his arm, and
          his heart departed from the Lord,&quot; he became, like Samson,
          &quot;weak, and as another man.&quot; So true is it, that no past
          communications of Divine strength can stand in the stead of the daily
          habit of dependence upon the Lord, without which we are utterly
          helpless, and are overthrown in every conflict. Our best prosperity,
          therefore, is to leave our cause in His hands, looking upward in the
          simplicity of wretchedness for His help: &#x27;All Your commandments
          are faithful; they persecute me wrongfully; help me. Wretched and
          forlorn I am; but Your truth is my shield.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          Believer! This is your only posture of resistance. Should you enter
          the field of conflict without this &quot;shield of faith,&quot; some
          crevice will be found in your panoply, through which a &quot;fiery
          dart&quot; will inflict a poisonous wound.&quot; But how can faith be
          exercised without a distinct acquaintance with the object of faith? We
          cannot repose trust in, or expect help from, an unknown God—an
          offended God, whom every day&#x27;s transgression has made our enemy.
          There must, then, be reconciliation, before there can be help. Those,
          therefore, who are unreconciled by the death of Christ, cry for help
          to a God, who does not hear, accept, or answer, them. But when Christ
          is known as &quot;the peace,&quot; and the way of access to God, what
          instance can there be of trial or difficulty, when our reliance upon
          the Lord will fail? Not indeed that we shall always return from the
          throne of grace with the wished-for relief. For too often we bring our
          burden before the Lord, and yet through distrust neglect to leave it
          with Him. Oh! let us remember, when we go to Jesus, that we go to a
          tried, long-proved, and faithful friend. Dependence upon Him is
          victory. &quot;The good fight&quot; is the fight &quot;of faith.&quot;
          We are best able to resist our enemy upon our knees; and even such a
          short prayer as this—Help me—will bring down the strength of
          Omnipotence on our side. But we might as well expect to crush a giant
          with a straw, as to enter the spiritual conflict with weapons of
          carnal warfare. Every trial realizes experimentally the help of a
          faithful Savior. He does indeed deliver gloriously; and leaves us
          nothing to do, but to &quot;stand still,&quot; wonder, and praise.
          &quot;Fear not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which
          He will show to you today; for the Egyptians, whom you have seen
          today, you shall see them again no more forever.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          87. They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not Your
          precepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          And why did they not quite consume him? Because &quot;the eyes of the
          Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong
          in behalf of them, whose heart is perfect toward Him.&quot;
          &quot;Surely the wrath of man shall praise You; the remainder of wrath
          shall You restrain.&quot; And why have not our spiritual enemies
          consumed us upon earth? &quot;Satan has desired to have us, that he
          may sift us as wheat.&quot; But—says the Savior, &quot;I have prayed
          for you, that your faith fail not.&quot; &quot;My sheep shall never
          perish; neither shall any pluck them out of My hand.&quot;
          Steadfastness of profession is the evidence of the life of faith:
          grounded upon this security, the more we are shaken, the more we shall
          hold fast. Neither long-continued distress, nor determined opposition,
          will turn us from the ways of God. We would rather forsake all that
          our heart held dear upon earth, than the precepts of our God. With
          whatever intensity of affection we love father and mother (and the
          influence of the Gospel has increased the sensibilities of relative
          affection), we remember who has said, &quot;He who loves father and
          mother more than Me, is not worthy of Me.&quot; Unlike the deluded
          professor, we have counted the cost of the &quot;tribulation and
          persecution&quot; of the Gospel; and the result has only served to
          confirm our love and adherence to our heavenly Master. Shall not we
          find in heaven—no, do not we find in the gospel—a far better portion
          than we lose?
        </p>
        <p>
          When, therefore, we are tempted to neglect the precepts, or when we
          fail to live in them, and to delight in them, let us each bring our
          hearts to this test: &#x27;What would I take in exchange for them?
          Will the good-will and approbation of the world compensate for the
          loss of the favor of God? Could I be content to forego my greatest
          comforts, to &quot;suffer the loss of all things,&quot; yes, of life
          itself, rather than forsake one of the ways of God? When I meet with
          such precepts as link me to the daily cross, can I throw myself with
          simple dependence upon that Savior, who has engaged to supply strength
          for what He has commanded?&#x27; How often in times of spiritual
          temptation, if not of temporal danger, they had almost consumed us
          upon earth! but &quot;in the mount&quot; of difficulty &quot;the Lord
          has been seen.&quot; Oh! let each of us mark our road to Zion with
          multiplied Ebenezers, inscribed Jehovah-jireh, Jehovah-nissi. &quot;By
          this I know You favor me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.
          And as for me, You uphold me in my integrity, and set me before Your
          face forever.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          What a fine testimony of the upholding grace of God! How could a
          helpless believer stand against such an appalling array? Yet it is a
          great, but a true word, suitable for a babe in Christ, as well as for
          an Apostle, &quot;I can do all things through Christ that strengthens
          me.&quot; Yes, I can &quot;wrestle even against principalities and
          powers&quot; of darkness, if I be &quot;strong in the Lord, and in the
          power of His might.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          88. Quicken me after Your loving-kindness: so shall I keep the
          testimony of Your mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need continual quickening to maintain our steadfastness in the
          precepts. &quot;God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love with
          which He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us,
          together with Christ.&quot; But without daily quickening after the
          same loving-kindness, &quot;the things which remain will be ready to
          die.&quot; For every breath of prayer, Divine influence must flow,
          &quot;Quicken us, and we shall call upon Your name.&quot; For the work
          of praise, without the same influence we are dumb., &quot;Let my soul
          live, and it shall praise You.&quot; For the exercise of every
          spiritual grace, there must be the commanding voice of our Divine
          Head, &quot;Awake, O north wind; and come, you south: blow upon my
          garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.&quot; Thus is the
          creature laid in the dust, and all the glory is given to God.
          &quot;Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of
          ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is it, then, that at one time we spring to duty as the joy of our
          life; while at other times the soul is so chained down under the power
          of corruption, that it scarcely can put forth the feeblest exercise of
          life? The source of our life is the same;, &quot;Hid with Christ in
          God.&quot; But the power of the flesh hinders its every motion. Such a
          spiritual sloth has benumbed us—such backwardness to prayer, and
          disrelish for heavenly things! These are sins deeply humbling in
          themselves, and aggravated by the neglect of the plentiful provision
          laid up in Christ, not only for the life, but for the peace, joy, and
          strength of the soul. Nothing but indolence or unbelief straitens our
          supplies. Oh! stir up the prayer for quickening influence, and we
          shall be rich and fruitful. Sometimes also self-confidence paralyzes
          our spiritual energy. We expect our recovery from a lifeless state by
          more determined resolutions, or increased improvement of the various
          means of grace. Let these means indeed be used with all diligence, but
          with the fullest conviction that all means, all instruments, all helps
          of every kind, without the influence of the Spirit of grace, are dead.
          &quot;It is the Spirit that quickens; the flesh profits nothing.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          These records of David&#x27;s prayers strikingly mark the intensity of
          his desire to live to God. Every decay of strength and activity was,
          as it were, death to him, and awakened his reiterated cries. Do we
          desire to keep the testimony of His mouth? Do we mourn over our
          shortcomings in service? Oh! then, for our own sake, for the
          Lord&#x27;s sake, and for the church&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s sake,
          let our petitions be incessant each one for himself—&#x27;Quicken
          me—Quicken this slothful heart of mine. Enkindle afresh the sacred
          spark within, and let me be all alive for You.&#x27; Let faith be kept
          alive and active at the throne of grace, and all will be alive; our
          obligation will be deeply felt, and practically acknowledged.
        </p>
        <p>
          The title here given to the directory of our duty—the testimony of
          God&#x27;s mouth—adds strength to our obligations. Thus let every word
          we read or hear be regarded as coming directly from the mouth of God.
          What reverence, what implicit submission does it demand! May it ever
          find us in the posture of attention, humility, and faith, each one of
          us ready to say, &quot;Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          89. Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven. 90. Your
          faithfulness is unto all generations; You have established the earth,
          and it abides. 91. They continue this day according to Your
          ordinances, for all are Your servants.

          The Christian extends his survey far beyond the limits of his
          individual sphere. His view of the operations of God in creation
          enlarges his apprehensions of the Divine attributes, and especially
          that of unchanging faithfulness. Indeed, the very fact of a creation
          in ruins—a world in rebellion against its Maker, failing of the grand
          end of existence, and yet still continued in existence—manifests His
          faithfulness unto all generations. How different is the contemplation
          of the Christian from that of the philosopher! His is not a mere cold,
          speculative admiration, but the establishment of his faith upon a
          clear discovery of the faithfulness of God. Thus he stays his soul
          upon the assured unchangeableness of the Divine word, &quot;Concerning
          Your testimonies, I have known of old, that You have founded them
          forever. Your word is true from the beginning: and everyone of Your
          righteous judgments endures forever.&quot; How striking is the
          contrast between the transient glory of man&#x27;s goodness, and the
          solid foundation of all the promises, hopes, and prospects of the
          children of God!, &quot;The grass withers, and the flower fades; but
          the word of our God shall stand forever.&quot; &quot;Unbelief&quot; is
          the character of our &quot;evil hearts.&quot; Man chooses his own
          measure and objects of faith; he believes no more than he pleases. But
          it is a fearful prospect, that the threatenings of God rest upon the
          same solid foundation with His promises. &quot;Heaven and earth shall
          pass away but My word shall not pass away.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Need we any further proof of His faithfulness? Look at the earth
          established by His word of power. See how &quot;he hangs it upon
          nothing,&quot; as if it might fall at any moment;—and yet it is
          immovably fixed—it abides—and with all its furniture, continues
          according to His ordinances. This—though the scoff of the infidel—is
          the encouragement to Christian faith. It is at once a token of His
          covenant with nature, that &quot;while the earth remains, seed-time
          and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and
          night, shall not cease;&quot; and an emblem of His covenant with the
          seed of David, that He &quot;will not cast them off for all that they
          have done.&quot; Thus every view of the heavens—yes—every time we set
          our foot on the earth—shows the unchangeableness of His everlasting
          covenant, and the security of the salvation of His own people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this vast universe, all are His servants. &quot;The stars in their
          courses&quot; &quot;fire and hail, snow and vapors, stormy
          wind—fulfill His word. He sends forth His commandment upon earth: His
          word runs very swiftly.&quot; Man—the child of his Maker,
          &quot;created in His image&quot;—destined for His glory—is the only
          rebel and revolter. Most affecting is the appeal, that his own Father
          and God is constrained to make concerning him, &quot;Hear, O heavens,
          and give ear, O earth; for the Lord has spoken. I have nourished and
          brought up children, and they have rebelled against Me!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Is not then the universe of nature a parable of grace—setting out on
          every side—in every view—a cheering display of the faithfulness of
          God? If His providence fails not, will the promise of His covenant
          disappoint us? Why should He change? Does He see or know anything now,
          that He has not foreseen and foreknown from eternity? What more sure
          ground of salvation than the unchangeableness of God? If I can prove a
          word to have been spoken by God, I must no more question it than his
          own Being. It may seem to fail on earth; but it is forever settled in
          heaven. The decrees of the kings of the earth, &quot;settled&quot; on
          earth, are exposed to all the variations and weakness of a changing
          world. They may be revoked by themselves or their successors, or they
          may die away. The empty sound of the &quot;law of the Medes and
          Persians that alters not,&quot; has long since been swept away into
          oblivion. But while &quot;the word settled&quot; on earth has
          &quot;waxed old like a garment,&quot; and perished; the word settled
          in heaven—is raised above all the revolutions of the universe, and
          remains as the throne of God—unshaken and eternal; exhibiting the
          foundation of the believer&#x27;s hope and of the unbeliever&#x27;s
          terror to be alike unalterably fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we also remark the foreknowledge as well as the faithfulness of
          God. From the eternity that is past, as well for the eternity that is
          to come, Your word is settled in heaven. Before this fair creation was
          marred, yes, before it was called into existence, its ruin was
          foreseen, and a remedy provided. &quot;The Lamb was slain from the
          foundation of the world,&quot; and fore-ordained before that era.
          Concurrent with this period, a people &quot;were chosen in Him,&quot;
          and forever the word was settled in heaven., &quot;All that the Father
          gives Me shall come to Me.&quot; For the establishment of the
          Redeemer&#x27;s kingdom upon earth &quot;the decree is declared;&quot;
          however earth and hell may combine against it, &quot;Yet have I set My
          king upon My holy hill of Zion.&quot; And what a blessed encouragement
          in the grand work of bringing back &quot;the lost sheep of the house
          of Israel,&quot; and those &quot;other sheep&quot; with them,
          &quot;which are not of this fold&quot; is it, that we do not depend
          upon the earnestness of our prayers, the wisdom of our plans, or the
          diligence of our endeavors; but upon &quot;the word&quot; forever
          settled in heaven!, &quot;The Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto
          them that turn from transgression in Jacob, says the Lord. As for Me,
          this is My covenant with them, says the Lord—My Spirit that is upon
          You, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out
          of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth
          of your seed&#x27;s seed, says the Lord, from henceforth, and
          forever.&quot; &quot;I have sworn by Myself, the word is gone out of
          My mouth in righteousness, and shall not return—That unto Me every
          knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          92. Unless Your law had been my delights, I should then have perished
          in my affliction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The support of the word is as sure as its basis—and that in the time
          when other supports sink—in affliction. David—like his great
          prototype—was a man of affliction—sometimes ready to perish—always
          kept up by the law of his God. How many a false professor has been
          tried and cast by this hour of affliction! But he who has been sifted
          by temptation—who has &quot;endured the hardness&quot; of persecution,
          as a &quot;good soldier of Jesus Christ,&quot;—and who is ready rather
          to be &quot;consumed upon earth,&quot; than to shrink from his
          profession—this is he whom his Master &quot;will lift up, and not make
          his foes to rejoice over him.&quot; It is the established rule of the
          kingdom, &quot;Them that honor Me I will honor.&quot; &quot;Because
          you have kept the word of My patience, I also will keep you from the
          hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them
          that dwell upon the earth.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The law of God opens to us a clear interest in every perfection of His
          Godhead—every engagement of His covenant. What wonder then, that it
          brings delights, which the world can never conceive, when bowed down
          with accumulated affliction? However the believer&#x27;s real
          character may be hidden from the world, the hour of trial abundantly
          proves, both what the law can do for him, and what a lost creature he
          would have been without it. In affliction, friends mean well; but of
          themselves they can do nothing. They can only look on, feel, and pray.
          They cannot &quot;speak to the heart.&quot; This is God&#x27;s
          prerogative: and His law is His voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for this support, Jonah probably would have perished in his
          affliction. In the belly of the fish, as &quot;in the belly of
          hell,&quot; he appears to have recollected the experience of David
          under deep and awful desertion; and in taking his language out of his
          mouth, as descriptive of his own dark and terrific condition, a ray of
          light and hope darted upon his dungeon-walls. Indeed it is a mystery,
          how a sinner, destitute of the support and comfort of the word of God,
          can ever uphold himself in his trials. We marvel not, that often
          &quot;his soul should choose strangling, and death, rather than his
          life.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But in order to derive support from the law, it must be our
          delights—yes—that it may be our delights it must be the matter of our
          faith. For what solid delight, can we have in what we do not believe?
          Must it not also be our joy in prosperity, if we would realize its
          support in affliction? For this, how ineffectual is the mere formal
          service! Who ever tasted its tried consolations in the bare
          performance of the outward duty? It must be read in reality; it will
          then be taken as a cordial. Let it be simply received, diligently
          searched, and earnestly prayed over; and it will guide the heavy-laden
          to Him, who is their present and eternal rest. The tempest-tossed soul
          will cast anchor upon it., &quot;Remember the word unto Your servant,
          upon which You have caused me to hope.&quot; One promise applied by
          the Spirit of God is worth ten thousand worlds. And each promise is a
          staff—if we have but faith to lean upon it—able to bear our whole
          weight of sin, care, and trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is then affliction our appointed lot? If &quot;man is born&quot;—and
          the child of God twice born, &quot;to trouble, as the sparks fly
          upward,&quot;—how important is it to lay in a store of supply from
          this inexhaustible treasury, against the time when all human support
          will fail! Supplied hence with heavenly strength, we shall be borne up
          above the weakness and weariness of the flesh. And as the riches of
          this storehouse are &quot;the riches of Christ,&quot; let those parts
          be most familiar to us, which mark His person, His character, offices,
          life, sufferings, and death, resurrection and glory, together with the
          promises, encouragements, and prospects directly flowing from this
          blessed subject—and oh! what a treasure-house shall we find, richly
          furnished with every source of delight, and every ground of support!
        </p>
        <p>
          93. I will never forget Your precepts; for with them You have
          quickened me.
        </p>
        <p>
          An admirable resolution! the blessed fruit of the quickening power of
          the word in his deep affliction. He had before acknowledged this
          supernatural efficacy, &quot;Your word has quickened me.&quot; Now he
          more distinctly mentions it, as the instrumental only—not the
          efficient—cause—With them You have quickened me. Had the power been in
          the word, the same effect would have immediately and invariably
          followed. Nor should we have been constrained to lament the limited
          extent of its influence. How many, Christian, shared with you in the
          outward privileges; but perhaps unto none was the life-giving blessing
          given, save unto yourself—the most unlikely—the most unworthy of all!
          Thus does &quot;God work in us both to will and to do&quot;—not
          according to any prescribed law, but &quot;of His good pleasure.&quot;
          The grace therefore is not from, but through, the means. Almighty God
          is the source of the life. The word is the instrument—yet so
          &quot;quick,&quot; so melting, so attractive, that we might ask, out
          of what rock was that heart hewn, that is proof against its power? Yet
          while the precepts work nothing without the agents they are the
          ordinary course, by which the Lord quickens whom He will.
        </p>
        <p>
          And do not we find them still lively channels of refreshment? Surely,
          then, we will hold to our purpose of not forgetting the precepts. The
          leaves of the word of God are the leaves of the tree of life, as well
          as of the tree of knowledge. They not only enlighten the path, but
          they supply life for daily work and progress. &quot;The words that I
          speak unto you&quot;—said Jesus, &quot;they are spirit, and they are
          life:&quot; so that the times when we have been most diligent in our
          meditation and obedience to the precepts, have been uniformly the
          seasons of our most holy consolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men of the world, however, with accurate recollections of all matters,
          connected with their temporal advantage, are remarkably slow in
          retaining the truths of God. They plead their short memories, although
          conscious that this infirmity does not extend to their important
          secular engagements. But what wonder that they forget the precepts,
          when they have never been quickened with them—never received any
          benefit from them? The word of God is not precious to them: they
          acknowledge no obligation to it: they have no acquaintance with it. It
          has no place in their affections, and therefore but little abode in
          their remembrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this resolution is the language of sincerity, not of perfection.
          The child of God is humbled in the conscious forgetfulness of the
          Lord&#x27;s precepts. And this consciousness keeps his eye fixed upon
          Jesus for pardon and acceptance: while every fresh sense of acceptance
          strengthens his more habitual remembrance. Then, as for his natural
          inability to preserve an accurate recollection of Divine things—let
          him not estimate the benefit of the word by the results in the memory,
          so much as by the impression upon the heart. The word may have darted
          through the mind, as a flash of lightning, that strikes and is gone;
          and yet the heart may have been melted, and the passing flash may have
          shed a heavenly ray upon a dubious path. If the heart retains the
          quickening power, the precepts are not forgotten, even though the
          memory should have failed to preserve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But whatever word of conviction, direction, or encouragement, may have
          come to us, affix this seal to it—I will never forget Your precepts.
          It may be of signal use in some hour of temptation. The same Spirit
          that breathed before upon it may breathe again; if not with the same
          present sensible power, yet with a seasonable and refreshing
          recollection of past support.
        </p>
        <p>94. I am Yours; save me; for I have sought Your precepts.</p>
        <p>
          What a high and honorable character is stamped upon the lowest
          believer! He is the Savior&#x27;s unalienable property, his portion,
          the &quot;workmanship&quot; of His hand, the purchase of His blood,
          the triumph of His conquering love. He is given to Him by His Father,
          &quot;preserved in Him, and called.&quot; The evidence of his
          character is found in seeking the Lord&#x27;s precepts. &quot;Whom we
          serve&quot; will prove &quot;whose we are.&quot; &quot;His servants
          you are, to whom you obey.&quot; &quot;Know that the Lord has set
          apart him that is godly for Himself.&quot; &quot;The carnal mind is
          not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then those
          who are in the flesh&quot; cannot seek the Lord&#x27;s precepts. A new
          and spiritual bias, therefore, is the visible stamp and seal of the
          Lord&#x27;s interest in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          True it is, that our Divine Savior can never be robbed of His
          property—that His people are saved in Him, beyond the reach of earth
          and hell to touch them. Yet are they dependent still—always
          sinners—every day&#x27;s provocation making them more sinners than
          before; needing, therefore, from day to day, fresh power, fresh
          keeping, and, above all, fresh cleansing and acceptance. But what a
          powerful plea for mercy may we draw from the Lord&#x27;s interest in
          us! Will not a man be careful of his children, his treasure, his
          jewels? &#x27;Such am I. Your sovereign love has bought me—made me
          Yours—I am Yours; save me. You have saved me; &quot;You have delivered
          my soul from death; will You not deliver my feet from falling?&quot;
          Save me from the love of sin, from the daily guilt and power of sin;
          from the treachery of my own foolish heart from all this, and all
          besides, which You see ensnaring to my soul. If I am not Yours, whence
          this desire, this endeavor to seek Your precepts? What mean my
          privileged moments of communion with You? What mean the yet
          unsatisfied desires after a conformity to Your image? Lord, I would
          humbly plead Your own act, Your free and sovereign act, that made me
          Yours. Save me, because You have brought Your salvation near to me,
          and sealed me Yours. I need mercy to begin with me; mercy to accompany
          me; mercy to abide with me forever. I am Yours; save me.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          And what irresistible energy does it give to our pleading, that this
          was the sole purpose, that brought down the Son of God from Heaven!
          &quot;I came down&quot;—said he, &quot;from heaven, not to do My own
          will, but the will of Him that sent Me. And this is the Father&#x27;s
          will which has sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should
          lose nothing.&quot; Of this purpose He was enabled to testify at the
          conclusion of His work, &quot;Those that You gave Me I have kept, and
          none of them is lost, but the son of perdition.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But some cry for salvation, who neglect duty, and thus make void their
          plea. Can we make our interest good, by seeking His precepts? Is it
          the way in which we love to walk? Then let us not desist from our plea
          before God, until our heart listens to the voice of love, centering
          every blessing of creation, redemption, and heavenly calling, in the
          privilege of adoption, &quot;Thus says the Lord, that created you, O
          Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel Fear not, for I have redeemed
          you: I have called you by your name; you are Mine. You are My servant;
          O Israel, you shall not be forgotten of Me. I have blotted out, as a
          thick cloud, your transgressions; and as a cloud your sins.&quot; I
          have regarded this your plea. I have heard this your prayer—I am
          Yours, save me.
        </p>
        <p>
          95. The wicked have waited for me to destroy me; but I will consider
          Your testimonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Am I, as a believer, safe as the Lord&#x27;s property, and in the
          Lord&#x27;s keeping? Yet must I expect that the wicked, the ungodly,
          as the instruments of Satan, will not cease to distress me. The
          Psalmist had before alluded to this trial, as driving him to his
          refuge. And, indeed, this is the constant character of the
          believer&#x27;s walk—enduring the enmity of the ungodly, and seeking
          his refuge in the word of God—in that hiding-place of safety to which
          the word directs him. How striking is the proof of the irreconcilable
          variance between God and the world—the world encouraging all that is
          contrary to God, and persecuting His image in His people! Yet the word
          opens to us a sure defense. If our &quot;soul is among lions,&quot;
          cannot we testify to the astonishment of the world, &quot;My God has
          sent His angel, and has shut the lions&#x27; mouths, that they have
          not hurt me?&quot; We hear indeed the roaring of the winds and waves;
          but we hear also the voice hushing the storm to rest, &quot;Peace, be
          still.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The experience of this trial and support beautifully illustrates the
          promise, &quot;He who believes shall not make haste.&quot; He whose
          hope is firmly fixed on that &quot;tried corner-stone,&quot; which God
          Himself has &quot;laid in Zion as a sure foundation&quot; &quot;shall
          not be greatly moved;&quot; no—he &quot;shall not be moved&quot; at
          all, by the wicked waiting for him to destroy him. In the hour of
          difficulty, instead of perplexing himself with successive expedients
          for his safety (sought more from human contrivance, than from asking
          counsel at the mouth of God) he &quot;possesses his soul in
          patience,&quot; and calmly commits all events to the Lord. Such a man
          &quot;shall not be afraid of evil tidings! his heart is fixed,
          trusting in the Lord.&quot; &#x27;This trust is grounded on the word
          of God, revealing His power and all-sufficiency, and withal His
          goodness, His offer of Himself to be the stay of the soul, commanding
          us to rest upon Him. People wait on I know not what persuasions and
          assurances; but I know no other to build faith on but the word of
          promise. The truth and faithfulness of God opened up His wisdom, and
          power, and goodness, as the stay of all those that, renouncing all
          other props, will venture on it, and lay all upon Him. &quot;He who
          believes, sets to his seal that God is true:&quot; and so he is sealed
          for God; his portion and interest secured. &quot;If you will not
          believe, surely you shall not be established.&quot;&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is the considering of the Lord&#x27;s testimonies that draws
          out their staying support. The soul must be fixed upon them, as
          &quot;tried words, purified seven times in the fire.&quot; And in this
          frame, I will, under all distresses, all circumstances of trial, or
          even of dismay, consider Your testimonies. I will consider the
          faithfulness of those blessed declarations, &quot;There shall not an
          hair of your head perish. Touch not My anointed.&quot; &quot;He who
          touches you, touches the apple of My eye.&quot; With this armor of
          defense, I shall not be afraid, even should I hear the &quot;evil
          tidings,&quot; that the wicked have waited for me, to destroy me. Or
          even should I be destroyed, I know that Your testimonies cannot
          fail—that my rock is perfect, &quot;that there is no unrighteousness
          in Him;&quot; and therefore, &quot;though a host should encamp against
          me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in
          this will I be confident.&quot; Whether, then, I am delivered from the
          wicked, and live, &quot;I live unto the Lord;&quot; or whether I fall
          into their snare, and &quot;die—I die unto the Lord;&quot; for I will
          consider Your testimonies, assured that all Your purposes shall be
          accomplished concerning me, as You have said, &quot;I will never leave
          you, nor forsake you.&quot; &quot;You will keep him in perfect peace,
          whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          96. I have seen an end of all perfection; but Your commandment is
          exceeding broad.
        </p>
        <p>
          A deeper insight into the Lord&#x27;s testimonies is the sure result
          of considering them. Weigh them in the balances against this
          world&#x27;s excellency; the world and the word—each with all its
          fullness. Of the one perfection we see an end—of the other—none. This
          world is a matter of experience and observation. We have seen an
          end—not of some—but of all its perfection. It wants sufficiency. It
          stands us in no stead in the great emergencies of
          affliction—death—judgment—eternity. It wants solidity in its best
          substance. &quot;In its wisdom is grief!&quot; All its delicacies and
          indulgences—after having, like the King of Jerusalem, &quot;not
          withheld the heart from any joy&quot;—all end in the verdict of
          disappointment, &quot;Behold! all was vanity and vexation of
          spirit!&quot; Its continuance is but for a moment. The soul is born
          for eternity. Therefore it must have a portion to last as long as
          itself. But the world, with its lusts and fashions, passes away. All
          that it can offer is a bubble—a shadow. In its best riches, honors,
          and pleasures—in the utmost that its perfection can yield—in its
          height and prime of enjoyment—what is it in itself—what is it able to
          do for us? &quot;All is vanity.&quot; And yet such is the alienation
          of the heart from God, that it is first tried to the very uttermost,
          before any desire to return homeward is felt or expressed. And even
          then, nothing but the Almighty power of God can bring the sinner back.
          He would rather perish in his misery, than &quot;return to his
          rest.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now contrast with the emptiness of the world the fullness of the
          commandment of God. Our whole duty to our God, our neighbor, and
          ourselves, is here laid open before us—commanding without abatement,
          and forbidding without allowance—making no excuse for
          ignorance—frailty or forgetfulness—reaching not only to every species
          of crime, but to everything tending to it. This is perfection, of
          which we never see an end. Every fresh view opens—not the extent—but
          the immensity of the field; and compels us at length to shut up our
          inquiries with the adoring acknowledgment—Your commandment is
          exceeding broad. Its various parts form one seamless piece; so that no
          particle can be separated without injury to the whole. As all the
          curtains of the tabernacle connected by taches and loops, made but one
          covering for the ark, and the loosening or disjunction of the smallest
          point disannulled the fitness of the whole; so it belongs to the
          perfection of the commandment, that &quot;whoever shall keep the whole
          law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.&quot; The
          spirituality of its requirements equally illustrates its Divine
          perfection. An angry look is murder; an unchaste desire is adultery;
          the &quot;stumbling-block of iniquity&quot;
          &quot;covetousness&quot;—in the heart is idolatry; the thought as well
          as the act—the first conception of sin, as well as the
          after-commission—brings in the verdict—Guilty—Death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can we, then, endure the sight of its exceeding breadth? Yes—for the
          commandment of the gospel is equally broad, and covers all. We know
          who has stood in our place—who has satisfied Sinai&#x27;s unalterable
          requirements, and borne its awful curse. Broad as it may be, the love
          which has fulfilled it is immeasurable. As a covenant, therefore, it
          has now lost its terrors. As a rule, we love it for its extent, and
          for its purity; for the comprehensiveness of its obligations, and for
          the narrowness of its liberty for indulgence; nor would we wish to be
          subject to a less severe scrutiny, or a more lenient administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reader! if you have learned the exceeding breadth and spirituality of
          the law (the first lesson that is taught and learned in the school of
          Christ), your views of yourself and your state before God will be
          totally changed. Before, you were &quot;thanking God&quot; in your
          heart, &quot;that you were not as other men are.&quot; Now you will be
          &quot;smiting upon your bosom, saying—God be merciful to me a
          sinner!&quot; Before, perhaps, you might have thought yourself,
          &quot;touching the righteousness which is of the law, blameless.&quot;
          Now you will glory in your new and more enlightened choice, &quot;What
          things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.&quot; Once
          you considered yourself &quot;alive,&quot; when you were really dead.
          Now that &quot;the commandment is come&quot; in its heart-searching
          spirituality and conviction to your soul, you &quot;die&quot; that you
          may live. Blessed change from the law to the gospel, &quot;from death
          to life!&quot; &quot;I through the law am dead to the law, that I
          might live unto God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Such is the effect of the transition from a legal to an evangelical
          ground. Before, we were reckless of sin, and therefore reckless of the
          gospel. As the one fell lightly upon our conscience, the other held a
          light estimation in our judgment. While we had no disturbance from the
          law, we had no delight in the gospel. But now that we see in the true
          mirror, we are at once alarmed and enlightened. Praised be God! we now
          take the true estimate—we degrade to the uttermost righteousness by
          works—we exalt to the uttermost righteousness by faith. In the one we
          see pollution—in the other perfection.
        </p>
        <p>PART 13.</p>
        <p>97. O how love I Your law! it is my meditation all the day.</p>
        <p>
          Mark the man of God giving utterance to his feelings of heavenly
          delight—expressing most, by intimating that he cannot adequately
          express what he desires. He seems unable to restrain his
          acknowledgments of Divine influence springing up in his heart—O how
          love I Your law! This experience is most distinctive of a spiritual
          character. The professor may read, and understand, and even externally
          obey the law; but the believer only loves it; and he lives in it, as
          if he could not live without it. To the professor it is a task imposed
          to satisfy conscience; &quot;the veil upon the heart&quot; darkens all
          his spiritual apprehension, and consequently excludes spiritual
          delight. To the child of God, it is food and medicine, light and
          comfort—yes, &quot;life from the dead.&quot; The law of precept in the
          word is a &quot;law of liberty&quot;—a law of love—in his heart. His
          former obedience was the bondage of fear. But how different is the
          effect of constraining love! He now delights to view it in every
          lineament. He dwells upon every feature with intense enjoyment.
          Before, it was his confinement—his chain. Now, it is his liberty—his
          ornament. He is not what he was, &quot;Old things are passed away:
          behold, all things are become new.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Think what good reason there is to love the law. It is the epistle of
          our most beloved friend—not to be slighted, but to be placed in our
          bosom, nearest our hearts. It sets out that relief, without which the
          conscience would have been tortured by the never-dying worm. There is
          more of glory—more of God—in this, than in any other manifestation of
          His name. It has ever been the mirror, that has reflected Christ to
          His church. The spiritual eye discerns Him in every part.
          Now—Reader—do you search for Him in His law? Do you love His law,
          because it &quot;testifies of Him?&quot; Do you pray for His Spirit,
          that His law may guide you to Him? This is the evidence that you have
          &quot;turned unto the Lord, when the veil is taken away,&quot; and you
          &quot;with unveiled face behold in this glass the glory of the
          Lord.&quot; Then if you do love His law, you will love the whole of
          it—its obligations as well as its privileges. You will love it at all
          times, even when it is thwarting your own will and way. The whole law
          is light and love—wisdom and faithfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But love of the law fastens the soul to the beloved object, It is my
          meditation all the day. When you cannot have it in your hand, it will
          be found, if indeed your soul is in a prosperous state, &quot;hid in
          your heart.&quot; There it is kept as your most precious treasure;
          while you live upon it with unwearied appetite as your daily bread,
          and exercise yourself in it as your daily rule. Oh, how worthy is it
          of all the love of the warmest heart! The deepest students are most
          humbled for their want of suitable enlargement.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this heavenly spirit can only be grounded upon a sense of
          reconciliation. Can an unreconciled sinner be interested in the law,
          in every page of which he reads his own condemnation? This explains
          the enmity of the ungodly. But the cultivation of this spirit upon the
          ground of the gospel is a most important principle of the Christian
          steadfastness, the want of which has been the source of fearful
          delusion; and in the exercise of which we shall realize a deeper
          insight and more spiritual discernment of Scriptural truth. Warm
          affections will be far more influential than talent, or mere external
          knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          This habit of love and holy meditation will spread its influence over
          our whole character. It will fill our hearts with heavenly matter for
          prayer, diffuse a sweet savor over our earthly employments, sanctify
          the common bounties of Providence, realize the presence of God
          throughout the day, command prosperity upon our lawful undertakings,
          and enlarge our usefulness in the church. Thus the man of God is
          formed in his completeness, symmetry, and attraction—such as the world
          is often constrained secretly to admire, even where the heart is
          unready to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord! implant in my heart a supreme love to Your law. Write it upon my
          heart—even that new law, &quot;the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
          Jesus.&quot; May I love it so, that I may be always meditating upon
          it, and by continual meditation yet more enlarging my love and delight
          in it! So let it prove an ever-springing source of heavenly enjoyment
          and holy conversation!
        </p>
        <p>
          98. You through Your commandments have made me wiser than my enemies;
          for they are ever with me. 99. I have more understanding than all my
          teachers: for Your testimonies are my meditation. 100. I understand
          more than the ancients, because I keep Your precepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a fruitful harvest did David reap from his glowing love, and
          &quot;daily meditation on the law of God!&quot; He became wiser than
          his enemies in &quot;subtlety&quot;—than all his teachers in
          doctrine—than the ancients in experience. Yet he is not speaking of
          his extraordinary gifts as a prophet, but of his knowledge gained by
          ordinary means. Nor is he here boasting of his own attainments: but
          commending the grace of God in and towards him—You through Your
          commandments have made me wiser. How much more wisdom does the
          persecuted believer draw from the word of God, than his persecutors
          have ever acquired from the learning of this world! Those, however,
          who have been effectually taught of God, need to be daily taught of
          Him. While they rest upon their God, and seek counsel in His word,
          they are wise indeed; yet when they trust to their own wisdom, and
          turn to their own counsel, they become a bye-word and occasion of
          offence by their own folly. Was David wiser than his enemies or his
          teachers, when he dissembled himself before Achish—or when he yielded
          to the indulgence of lust—or when in the pride of his heart he
          numbered the people? Alas! how often do even God&#x27;s children
          befool themselves in the ways of sin!
        </p>
        <p>
          But how did David attain this Divine wisdom? Not by habits of
          extensive reading—not by natural intelligence—but by a diligent
          meditation in the testimonies. In order to avail ourselves, however,
          of this means—a simple reception of the Divine testimony is of
          absolute importance. We can never obtain that assurance of the
          certainty of our faith, which is indispensable to our peace, or resist
          the influence of unenlightened teachers, or the long-established
          worldly maxims of the ancients, except by entire submission to the
          supreme authority of Scripture. Many sincere Christians—especially at
          the outset of their course—are much hindered—either by the skepticism
          of others, or of their own minds; or from their previous habit of
          studying the Bible in the light of carnal wisdom, or in dependence
          upon human teaching. Such need special prayer for humility of mind and
          simplicity of faith. Under this gracious influence they will discern
          that path to glory, which in infinite condescension is made so plain,
          that &quot;the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err
          therein,&quot; and the unlearned believer, who has the word before his
          eyes, in his heart, and in his life, shall become &quot;perfect,
          thoroughly furnished unto all good works.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In our Christian progress, David&#x27;s habit of scriptural meditation
          will prove of essential service. For while those who &quot;confer with
          flesh and blood&quot; cannot have their counselors always at hand; we,
          seeking our wisdom from the word of God, have the best Counselor ever
          with us, teaching us what to do, and what to expect. Obedience also,
          as well as meditation, directs our way. David found understanding,
          because he kept the precepts. And David&#x27;s Lord has pointed out
          the same path of light: &quot;If any man will do God&#x27;s will, he
          shall know of the doctrine.&quot; &quot;You meet him who rejoices, and
          works righteousness—those that remember You in Your ways.&quot; Your
          ways truly are ways of light, joy, and love!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let us turn in, and inquire—What is our daily use of the word of
          God? Are we satisfied with a slight looking, or do we seek an intimate
          acquaintance with it! Is its influence ever present—ever practical? Do
          we prize it as a welcome guest? Is it our delightful companion and
          guide? Oh! meditate in this blessed book. &quot;Eat the word,&quot;
          when you &quot;have found it; and it will be unto you the joy and
          rejoicing of your heart.&quot; The name of Jesus—its great
          subject—will be more precious—your love will be inflamed—your
          perseverance established—and your heart enlivened in the spirit of
          praise. Thus bringing your mind into close and continual contact with
          the testimonies of God, and pressing out the sweetness from the
          precious volume, it will drop as from the honeycomb, daily comfort and
          refreshment upon your heart.
