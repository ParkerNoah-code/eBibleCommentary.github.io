          This whole Psalm offers itself to be drawn into these two opposite
          propositions: a godly man is blessed, a wicked man is miserable; which
          seem to stand as two challenges, made by the prophet: one, that he
          will maintain a godly man against all comers; the other, that albeit
          the ungodly make a show in the world of being happy, yet they of all
          men are most miserable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 1.
            <em
              >Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the
              wicked,<br />
              nor stand on the path of sinners,<br />
              nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          See how this Book of Psalms opens with a benediction, even as did the
          famous Sermon of our Lord upon the Mount! The word translated
          "blessed" is a very expressive one. The original word is plural, and
          it is a controverted matter whether it is an adjective or a
          substantive. Hence we may learn the multiplicity of the blessings
          which shall rest upon the man whom God hath justified, and the
          perfection and greatness of the blessedness he shall enjoy. We might
          read it, "Oh, the blessednesses!" and we may well regard it as a
          joyful acclamation of the gracious man's felicity. May the like
          benediction rest on us!
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the gracious man is described both negatively (verse 1) and
          positively (verse 2). He is a man who does not walk in the counsel of
          the ungodly. He takes wiser counsel, and walks in the commandments of
          the Lord his God. To him the ways of piety are paths of peace and
          pleasantness. His footsteps are ordered by the Word of God, and not by
          the cunning and wicked devices of carnal men. It is a rich sign of
          inward grace when the outward walk is changed, and when ungodliness is
          put far from our actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note next, he standeth not in the way of sinners. His company is of a
          choicer sort than it was. Although a sinner himself, he is now a
          blood-washed sinner, quickened by the Holy Spirit, and renewed in
          heart. Standing by the rich grace of God in the congregation of the
          righteous, he dares not herd with the multitude that do evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again it is said, "nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful." He finds
          no rest in the atheist's scoffings. Let others make a mock of sin, of
          eternity, of hell and heaven, and of the Eternal God; this man has
          learned better philosophy than that of the infidel, and has too much
          sense of God's presence to endure to hear His name blasphemed. The
          seat of the scorner may be very lofty, but it is very near to the gate
          of hell; let us flee from it, for it shall soon be empty, and
          destruction shall swallow up the man who sits therein. Mark the
          gradation in the first verse:
        </p>
        <p>
          He walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,<br />
          Nor standeth in the way of sinners,<br />
          Nor SITTETH in the SEAT of SCORNFUL.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 2.
            <em
              >but his delight is in Yahweh’s law.<br />
              On his law he meditates day and night.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          When men are living in sin they go from bad to worse. At first they
          merely walk in the counsel of the careless and ungodly, who forget
          God—the evil is rather practical than habitual—but after that, they
          become habituated to evil, and they stand in the way of open sinners
          who wilfully violate God's commandments; and if let alone, they go one
          step further, and become themselves pestilent teachers and tempters of
          others, and thus they sit in the seat of the scornful. They have taken
          their degree in vice, and as true Doctors of Damnation they are
          installed, and are looked up to by others as Masters in Belial. But
          the blessed man, the man to whom all the blessings of God belong, can
          hold no communion with such characters as these. He keeps himself pure
          from these lepers; he puts away evil things from him as garments
          spotted by the flesh; he comes out from among the wicked, and goes
          without the camp, bearing the reproach of Christ. O for grace to be
          thus separate from sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now mark his positive character. "His delight is in the law of the
          Lord." He is not under the law as a curse and condemnation, but he is
          in it, and he delights to be in it as his rule of life; he delights,
          moreover, to meditate in it, to read it by day, and think upon it by
          night. He takes a text and carries it with him all day long; and in
          the night-watches, when sleep forsakes his eyelids, he museth upon the
          Word of God. In the day of his prosperity he sings psalms out of the
          Word of God, and in the night of his affliction he comforts himself
          with promises out of the same book. "The law of the Lord" is the daily
          bread of the true believer. And yet, in David's day, how small was the
          volume of inspiration, for they had scarcely anything save the first
          five books of Moses! How much more, then, should we prize the whole
          written Word which it is our privilege to have in all our houses! But,
          alas, what ill-treatment is given to this angel from heaven! We are
          not all Berean searchers of the Scriptures. How few among us can lay
          claim to the benediction of the text! Perhaps some of you can claim a
          sort of negative purity, because you do not walk in the way of the
          ungodly; but let me ask you—Is your delight in the law of God? Do you
          study God's Word? Do you make it the man of your right hand—your best
          companion and hourly guide? If not, this blessing belongeth not to
          you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 3.
            <em
              >He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,<br />
              that produces its fruit in its season,<br />
              whose leaf also does not wither.<br />
              Whatever he does shall prosper.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "And he shall be like a tree planted"—not a wild tree, but "a tree
          planted," chosen, considered as property, cultivated and secured from
          the last terrible uprooting, for "every plant which my heavenly Father
          hath not planted, shall be rooted up:" Matthew 15:13. "By the rivers
          of water;" so that even if one river should fail, he hath another. The
          rivers of pardon and the rivers of grace, the rivers of the promise
          and the rivers of communion with Christ, are never-failing sources of
          supply. He is "like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
          bringeth forth his fruit in his season;" not unseasonable graces, like
          untimely figs, which are never full-flavored. But the man who delights
          in God's Word, being taught by it, bringeth forth patience in the time
          of suffering, faith in the day of trial, and holy joy in the hour of
          prosperity. Fruitfulness is an essential quality of a gracious man,
          and that fruitfulness should be seasonable. "His leaf also shall not
          wither;" his faintest word shall be everlasting; his little deeds of
          love shall be had in remembrance. Not simply shall his fruit be
          preserved, but his leaf also. He shall neither lose his beauty nor his
          fruitfulness. "And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed is the man who hath such a promise as this. But we must not
          always estimate the fulfillment of a promise by our own eye-sight. How
          often, my brethren, if we judge by feeble sense, may we come to the
          mournful conclusion of Jacob, "All these things are against me!" For
          though we know our interest in the promise, yet we are so tried and
          troubled, that sight sees the very reverse of what that promise
          foretells. But to the eye of faith this word is sure, and by it we
          perceive that our works are prospered, even when everything seems to
          go against us. It is not outward prosperity which the Christian most
          desires and values; it is soul prosperity which he longs for. We
          often, like Jehoshaphat, make ships to go to Tarshish for gold, but
          they are broken at Ezion-geber; but even here there is a true
          prospering, for it is often for the soul's health that we would be
          poor, bereaved, and persecuted. Our worst things are often our best
          things. As there is a curse wrapped up in the wicked man's mercies, so
          there is a blessing concealed in the righteous man's crosses, losses,
          and sorrows. The trials of the saint are a divine husbandry, by which
          he grows and brings forth abundant fruit.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 4.
            <em
              >The wicked are not so,<br />
              but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We have now come to the second head of the Psalm. In this verse the
          contrast of the ill estate of the wicked is employed to heighten the
          coloring of that fair and pleasant picture which precedes it. The more
          forcible translation of the Vulgate and of the Septuagint version is—
          "Not so the ungodly, not so." And we are hereby to understand that
          whatever good thing is said of the righteous is not true in the case
          of the ungodly. Oh! how terrible is it to have a double negative put
          upon the promises! and yet this is just the condition of the ungodly.
          Mark the use of the term "ungodly," for, as we have seen in the
          opening of the Psalm, these are the beginners in evil, and are the
          least offensive of sinners. Oh! if such is the sad state of those who
          quietly continue in their morality, and neglect their God, what must
          be the condition of open sinners and shameless infidels? The first
          sentence is a negative description of the ungodly, and the second is
          the positive picture. Here is their character — "they are like chaff,"
          intrinsically worthless, dead, unserviceable, without substance, and
          easily carried away. Here, also, mark their doom, — "the wind driveth
          away;" death shall hurry them with its terrible blast into the fire in
          which they shall be utterly consumed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 5.
            <em
              >Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,<br />
              nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          They shall stand there to be judged, but not to be acquitted. Fear
          shall lay hold upon them there; they shall not stand their ground;
          they shall flee away; they shall not stand in their own defence; for
          they shall blush and be covered with eternal contempt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well may the saints long for heaven, for no evil men shall dwell
          there, "nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous." All our
          congregations upon earth are mixed. Every Church hath one devil in it.
          The tares grow in the same furrows as the wheat. There is no floor
          which is as yet thoroughly purged from chaff. Sinners mix with saints,
          as dross mingles with gold. God's precious diamonds still lie in the
          same field with pebbles. Righteous Lots are this side heaven
          continually vexed by the men of Sodom. Let us rejoice then, that in
          "the general assembly and church of the firstborn" above, there shall
          by no means be admitted a single unrenewed soul. Sinners cannot live
          in heaven. They would be out of their element. Sooner could a fish
          live upon a tree than the wicked in Paradise. Heaven would be an
          intolerable hell to an impenitent man, even if he could be allowed to
          enter; but such a privilege shall never be granted to the man who
          perseveres in his iniquities. May God grant that we may have a name
          and a place in his courts above!
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 6.
            <em
              >For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,<br />
              but the way of the wicked shall perish.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, as the Hebrew hath it yet more fully, "The Lord is knowing the way
          of the righteous." He is constantly looking on their way, and though
          it may be often in mist and darkness, yet the Lord knoweth it. If it
          be in the clouds and tempest of affliction, he understandeth it. He
          numbereth the hairs of our head; he will not suffer any evil to befall
          us. "He knoweth the way that I take: when He hath tried me, I shall
          come forth as gold." (Job 23:10.) "But the way of the ungodly shall
          perish." Not only shall they perish themselves, but their way shall
          perish too. The righteous carves his name upon the rock, but the
          wicked writes his remembrance in the sand. The righteous man ploughs
          the furrows of earth, and sows a harvest here, which shall never be
          fully reaped till he enters the enjoyments of eternity; but as for the
          wicked, he ploughs the sea, and though there may seem to be a shining
          trail behind his keel, yet the waves shall pass over it, and the place
          that knew him shall know him no more for ever. The very "way" of the
          ungodly shall perish. If it exist in remembrance, it shall be in the
          remembrance of the bad; for the Lord will cause the name of the wicked
          to rot, to become a stench in the nostrils of the good, and to be only
          known to the wicked themselves by its putridity.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the Lord cleanse our hearts and our ways, that we may escape the
          doom of the ungodly, and enjoy the blessedness of the righteous!
