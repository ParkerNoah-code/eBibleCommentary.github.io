        <h2>119:126-149</h2>
        <p>
          126. It is time for You, Lord, to work; for they have made void Your
          law.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I desire a more spiritual understanding of the revelation of God,
          how can I but mourn to witness its awful neglect and contempt? It
          seems as if the ungodly not only sin against it, but that they would
          drive it out of the world. They make it void—denying its power to
          rule, to annul its power to punish. Oh! let us cherish that
          distinguishing feature of the Lord&#x27;s people, &quot;sighing and
          crying for all the abominations of the land;&quot; so that we cannot
          hear or see the name of God dishonored, without feeling as for our
          Father&#x27;s wounded reputation. Can we suffer the men of the world
          quietly to go on their course? Must we not throw in our weight of
          influence, whatever it may be, to stem the flowing torrent: and when
          (as, alas! is too often the case) all efforts are unavailing, carry
          the cause to the Lord, &quot;It is time for You, Lord, to work?&quot;
          This pleading does not contradict the law of love, which requires us
          to love, pray for, and to bless our enemies; for the Lord&#x27;s
          people are not angry for their own cause, but for His. David had no
          regard to his own honor, but to God&#x27;s law. He had not injured his
          enemies. &quot;He had labored to overcome their evil with good.&quot;
          He had often wept for their sins, and prayed for their conversion. But
          all was in vain. &#x27;Now, Lord, take the rod in Your own hand.
          &quot;It is time for You, Lord, to work.&quot;&#x27; This was true
          zeal—zeal of the Spirit, not of the flesh. How gracious is our God in
          permitting His servants thus to plead with Him, and, as it were, to
          give Him no rest, until &quot;he shall arise, and work,&quot; and sit
          upon the throne of the kingdoms of the earth!
        </p>
        <p>
          But why does He not break out with some overpowering manifestation of
          His power? They are &quot;his sword and rod&quot; for the chastening
          of His people, to discipline their watchfulness into constant
          exercise. They are the trial of their faith—believing the Lord&#x27;s
          justice against apparent inconsistency; and of their patience,
          &quot;waiting the set time of deliverance.&quot; Thus they become a
          profitable ministry for the church—and this valuable end accomplished,
          God works His work upon them, and &quot;will avenge His own elect
          speedily.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile—waiting for this &quot;little while,&quot; let us &quot;live
          by faith.&quot; Let us be found on the Lord&#x27;s side—laboring for
          sinners—pleading with their hardness and rebellion in our
          Master&#x27;s name, and for our Master&#x27;s sake. Let all the weight
          of personal exertion and influence, consistent example, and wrestling
          supplication, be concentrated in &quot;coming to the help of the Lord
          against the mighty.&quot; Let us see to it, that if we cannot do what
          we would, we do what we can. And if at last we be overborne by the
          torrent of ungodliness, we shall find our refuge and rest in pleading
          with our Lord for the honor of His name—Remember this, that the enemy
          has reproached, O Lord, and that the foolish people have blasphemed
          Your name. &quot;His Spirit shall not always strive with man.&quot;
          Often, when He has seen it time for Him to work, have His judgments
          made the earth to tremble. &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; have
          &quot;known the power of His anger,&quot; and are &quot;set forth for
          an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.&quot; And when
          His time to work is fully come, what is all the resistance of earth
          and hell, but as &quot;setting the briars and thorns against Him in
          battle?&quot; &quot;I would&quot;—says he, &quot;go through them. I
          would burn them together.&quot; A word—a frown—a look—is destruction.
          &quot;He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength. Who has hardened
          himself against Him, and has prospered?&quot; Or &quot;who has
          resisted His will?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But what shall we say of that stupendous work of His hand, by
          which—when men had made void His law—when no restrictions could bind,
          no forbearance win them—when He &quot;saw that there was no man, and
          wondered that there was no intercessor, therefore His arm brought
          salvation unto him, and His righteousness, it sustained him.&quot;
          Surely, if we could conceive the hosts of heaven to have taken up this
          expression of ardent concern for the glory of God, It is time for You,
          Lord, to work—they could little have thought of such a work as
          this—they could never have conceived to themselves such an
          unlooked-for, combined display of power, justice, and mercy. To set at
          nothing then this work—is it not to refuse all hope—all remedy? To
          persist in making void the law after so magnificent an exhibition of
          Almighty working—must it not expose the transgressors to reap the
          fruit of their own obstinacy, and to prepare to meet Him as their
          Judge, whom they refuse to receive as their Savior? Nor must they
          wonder, if the Lord&#x27;s people, with a holy indignation against
          sin, and a fervent zeal for His glory, should appeal to His
          faithfulness for the fulfillment of His judgments—It is time for You,
          Lord, to work: for they have made void Your law.
        </p>
        <p>
          127. Therefore I love Your commandments above gold; yes, above fine
          gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore I love Your commandments. Yes—shall they not have double
          valuation in my eyes, for the scorn and reproach which the world cast
          upon them? They count them dross—I love them above gold—yes, above
          fine gold. This hope, confidence, and idol of the worldling, the love
          of which has been the ruin of thousands—is not the commandment of God
          more to be desired than it? &quot;The merchandise of it is better than
          the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. It is
          more precious than rubies and all the things you can desire are not to
          be compared unto it.&quot; Here has the Lord unlocked to us His golden
          treasure, and enriched our souls with &quot;the unsearchable riches of
          Christ.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This image brings the miser before us. His heart and treasure are in
          his gold. With what delight he counts it! with what watchfulness he
          keeps it! hiding it in safe custody, lest he should be despoiled of
          that which is dearer to him than life. Such should Christians be:
          spiritual misers: counting their treasure, which is above fine gold;
          and &quot;hiding it in their heart,&quot; in safe keeping, where the
          great despoiler shall not be able to reach it. Oh, Christians! how
          much more is your portion to you than the miser&#x27;s treasure! Hide
          it; watch it; retain it. You need not be afraid of covetousness in
          spiritual things: rather &quot;covet earnestly&quot; to increase your
          store; and by living upon it, and living in it, it will grow richer in
          extent, and more precious in value.
        </p>
        <p>
          But have I through Divine grace been enabled to withdraw my love from
          the unworthy objects which once possessed it: and to fix it on that
          which alone offers satisfaction? Let me attempt to give a reason to
          myself of the high estimation in which I hold it, as infinitely
          transcending those things, which the world venture their all—even
          their temporal happiness—to obtain. Therefore I love the commandments
          of God above gold: yes, above fine gold—because, while the world and
          my own heart have only combined to flatter me, they have discovered to
          me my real state, as a self-deceived, guilty, defiled sinner before
          God: because they have been as a &quot;schoolmaster to bring me to
          Christ&quot;—the only remedy for sin, the only rest for my soul. I
          love them; because they have often supplied wholesome reproofs in my
          wanderings, and plain directions in my perplexity. I love them;
          because they restrict me from that which would prove my certain ruin;
          and because in the way of obedience to them the Lord has
          &quot;accepted me with my sweet savor.&quot; Should I not love them?
          Can gold, yes, fine gold, offer to me blessings such as these? Can it
          heal my broken heart? Can it give relief to my wounded spirit? Has it
          any peace or prospect of comfort for me on my death-bed? And what
          cannot—what has not—what will not—the precious word of God do at that
          awful season of trial? O my God, I would be deeply ashamed, that I
          love Your commandments so coldly—that they are so little influential
          upon my conduct—that they so often give place to objects of
          comparative nothingness in Your sight. O that my heart might be wholly
          and habitually exercised in them, that I may find the &quot;work of
          righteousness to be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness,
          and assurance forever!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          128. Therefore I esteem all Your precepts concerning all things to be
          right: and I hate every false way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The general contempt of religion acts upon the Christian&#x27;s
          judgment no less than upon his affections. Is wickedness breaking
          loose to make void the law? Therefore he esteems it to be right. His
          judgment—instead of being shaken—is more determined. How beautiful is
          it to see the leaven of grace pervading the whole man! In the fervor
          of his heart he loves the commandments even above fine gold; but yet
          his &quot;love will abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all
          judgment.&quot; His is an intelligent and universal regard to
          them—esteeming all the precepts concerning all things to be right.
          This constitutes his separate and exclusive character. He is readily
          known from the thoughtless worldling. But his difference from the
          professor, though really as marked in the sight of God, is far less
          perceptible to general observation. Consisting more in the state of
          heart, than in any external mark of distinction, it is often only
          within the ken of that eye, whose sovereign prerogative it is to
          &quot;search the heart,&quot; and to &quot;weigh the spirits.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Many profess to esteem the precepts to be right, so far as they
          inculcate the practice of those moral virtues, of which they may
          present some faint exhibition, and demand the abandonment of those
          sins, from the external influence of which they may have been
          delivered. But when they begin to observe the &quot;exceeding breadth
          of the commandment&quot;—how it takes cognizance of the heart, and
          enforces the renunciation of the world, the crucifixion of sin, and
          the entire surrender of the heart unto God; this searching touchstone
          separates them from the church, and exposes to open day the brand of
          hypocrisy upon their foreheads. &quot;Herod did many things.&quot; And
          so the enemy still will allow a partial subjection to the precepts.
          But—as he well knows—one sin holds us his captive as well as a
          thousand. The willful contempt of one precept is the virtual rejection
          of all. All, therefore—not many—is the Christian&#x27;s word. He fails
          in some—yes, in all—but all are the objects of his supreme
          regard—every duty, and every circumstance and obligation of duty—the
          evangelical as well as the moral precepts—teaching him to renounce
          himself in every part (his sins as a source of pleasure, and his
          duties as a ground of dependence): and to believe in the Son of God as
          the only ground of hope. He never complains of the strictness of the
          precepts!—but he is continually humbled in the recollection of his
          nonconformity to them. Every way, however pleasing to the flesh, that
          is opposed to the revealed will of God, is hated, as false in itself,
          and false to his God. This &quot;godly sincerity&quot; will apply to
          every part of the Christian Directory. So that any plea for the
          indulgence of sin (as if it admitted of palliation, or was compensated
          by some surplus duty, or allowed only for some temporary purpose) or
          any willful shrinking from the universality of obedience—blots out all
          pretensions to uprightness of heart. If holiness be really loved, it
          will be loved for its own sake; and equally loved and followed in
          every part. By this entire &quot;approval of things that are
          excellent,&quot; we shall &quot;be sincere and without offence unto
          the day of Christ.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          O my soul, can you abide this close test? Have you as much regard to
          the precepts, as to the privileges, of the Gospel? Is no precept
          evaded, from repugnance to the cross that is entailed to it? Is no
          secret lust retained? Are you content to let all go? If my hatred of
          sin is sincere, I shall hate it more in my own house than abroad; I
          shall hate it most of all in my own heart. Here lies the grand seat of
          hypocrisy. And therefore may the great Searcher of hearts enable me to
          search into its depths! May I take the lamp of the Lord to penetrate
          into its dark interior hiding-places of evil! May I often put the
          question to my conscience, &#x27;What does the Omniscient Judge know
          of my heart?&#x27; Perhaps at the time that the Church holds my name
          in esteem, the voice of conscience, as the voice of God, may whisper
          to me &quot;That which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination
          in the sight of God.&quot; Some false way, yet undetected within, may
          keep me lifeless and unfruitful in the midst of the quickening means
          of grace. Let me look into my house—my calling—my family—my soul; and
          in the course of this search how much matter will be found for prayer,
          contrition, renewed determination of heart, and dependence upon my
          God! &quot;O that my ways were directed to keep Your statutes! I will
          keep Your statutes; O forsake me not utterly.&quot; And oh! let my
          spirit be wounded by every fresh discovery of sin. Let my soul bleed
          under it. But specially and instantly let me apply to the
          &quot;fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness.&quot; Here let me
          wash my soul from the guilt of sin, and regain my peace with God. And
          to Him, who opened this fountain, let me also repair for a large
          supply of spiritual strength. May His power and grace sharpen my
          weapons for the spiritual conflict, until every secret iniquity is
          overcome, and forever dispossessed from my heart!
        </p>
        <p>
          And just as sin, besides its guilt, brings its own misery; so does
          this whole-hearted purity carry with it its own happiness. Can I
          forget the time, when, under Divine grace and teaching, I made a full
          presentment of myself, when I began to estimate myself as an hallowed,
          devoted thing—sacred—set apart for God? Was not this the first
          sunshine of my happiness? Nor was this offering made with momentary
          excitement, notional intelligence, forced acquiescence, or heartless
          assent. My judgment accorded with the choice of my heart. All was
          right in His precepts. All that was contrary to them was abominable.
          And will not this form the essence of the happiness of heaven, where
          every aspiration—every motion—every pulse of the glorified soul—in the
          eternity of life—will bear testimony to the holiness of the service of
          God?
        </p>
        <p>
          129. Your testimonies are wonderful: therefore does my soul keep them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can the mere professor make this acknowledgment? He knows only the
          letter—the shell, which excites no interest. Yet hidden from his eye
          is an unsearchable depth, which will make the believer a learner to
          the end of his life. Even he, who &quot;was caught up into paradise,
          and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to
          utter,&quot; was brought to this adoring contemplation, &quot;O the
          depths of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!&quot;
          Every way indeed is this revelation worthy of Him, the first letter of
          whose name is &quot;Wonderful.&quot; It lays open to the heaven-taught
          soul what &quot;eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has entered
          into the heart of man.&quot; Think of the Creator of the world
          becoming a creature—yes, &quot;a curse for man.&quot; Think of
          man—guilty and condemned—made just with God by a righteousness not his
          own. Think of God bringing out of the ruinous fall more glory to
          Himself, and more happiness to man, than from his former innocence—in
          the display of His mercy—the glory of His justice, and the investment
          of sinners—not, as before; with a creature&#x27;s righteousness,
          security, and reward, but with His own righteousness, guardianship,
          and glory. Think how &quot;the way into the holiest of all&quot; is
          thus &quot;made manifest.&quot; Think how abounding grace is the death
          as well as the pardon of sin—the present as well as the everlasting
          life of the soul. These are among the stupendous discoveries of the
          sacred book, that bow the humble and reflecting mind to the
          confession—Your testimonies are wonderful! Let us therefore join with
          the Apostle, in &quot;bowing our knees to the God and Father of our
          Lord Jesus Christ&quot;—that we &quot;might be able to comprehend with
          all saints&quot; (for, blessed be God! the privilege is common to all
          His people) &quot;what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and
          height: and to know the&quot; unsearchable &quot;love of Christ,&quot;
          &quot;in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And how delightful is the recollection of these testimonies being our
          &quot;heritage forever!&quot; For they are not less wonderful in their
          practical fullness, than in their deep unfathomable mysteries of love.
          Such is the infinite enlargement of this &quot;heritage,&quot; that He
          who foreknew every thought that would find an entrance into the minds
          of His people, has here secretly laid up seasonable direction and
          encouragement for every, even the most minute occasion and
          circumstance of need. Here, again, is wrapped up, in words fitted by
          wisdom to receive the revelation, all that communion between God and
          man, throughout all ages of the Church, which is treasured up in the
          vast unsearchable depository of the Divine mind and purpose. Can we
          then forbear repeating the exclamation—Your testimonies are wonderful!
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not enough to &#x27;adore the fullness of Scripture:&#x27;
          we must seek to imbibe and exhibit its practical influence. Holy
          admiration of the testimonies will kindle spiritual devotedness to
          them—Therefore does my soul keep them. The stamp of Divine authority
          upon them, while it deepens our reverence, commands our steady and
          cheerful obedience. To keep them is our privilege, no less than our
          obligation; and in this path we shall delight to persevere to the end.

          But how affecting is the thought of the mass, who look at these
          wonders with a careless or unmeaning eye, unconscious of their
          interesting import! They pass by the door of the treasury, hardly
          condescending to look aside into it: or only taking a transient
          glance, which comprehends nothing of its inexhaustible stores. &quot;I
          have written to them&quot;—says the Lord, &quot;the great things of My
          law: but they are counted as a strange thing.&quot; But far more
          wonderful is it, that we, enlightened, in answer to prayer (See verse
          18), with &quot;the Spirit of wisdom and revelation&quot;—should often
          be so indifferent to the mysteries of redeeming love here unfolded
          before us, and should experience so little of their practical
          influence! Oh! let the recollection of our indolence, and want of
          conformity to them, never cease to humble us. Let us not enter into
          the testimonies, as a dry task, or an ordinary study; but let us
          concentrate our minds, our faith, humility, and prayer, in a more
          devoted contemplation of them. Every such exercise will extend our
          view of those parts, with which we had conceived ourselves to be
          competently acquainted: opening a new field of wonders on every side,
          far beyond our present contracted apprehensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          And can any joy be imagined so sublime as the adoring contemplation of
          this revelation? It reflects even to angels a new and glorious
          manifestation of their God. It engages their every faculty with
          intense admiration and delight. And while they behold and worship with
          self-abasement, their obedience is lively. &quot;With twain he&quot;
          (the seraph before the throne) &quot;covered his face, and with twain
          he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.&quot; Thus may we
          study the same lessons, and with the same spirit. May our
          contemplation humble us in the dust, and animate us in the service of
          our God! Your testimonies are wonderful: therefore does my soul keep
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          130. The entrance of Your words gives light: it gives understanding to
          the simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#x27;So &quot;wonderful are Your testimonies,&quot; gracious
          God,&#x27; that even by touching as it were only their threshold, the
          entrance of Your words gives light and understanding unto my heart.
          The study commenced in simplicity and prayer, opens an entrance to the
          first dawning light of the word into the soul; often only sufficient
          to make darkness visible, but still &quot;shining more and more unto
          the perfect day.&quot; Indeed all the spiritual light known in this
          dark world has flowed from the word, forcing its entrance, like the
          beams of the sun, upon the opening eyes of &quot;a man that was born
          blind.&quot; It is a most striking instance of Divine condescension,
          that this word—so wonderful in its high and heavenly mysteries—should
          yet open a path so plain, that the most unlearned may find and walk in
          it. Indeed the entrance of the word into unintellectual and
          uncultivated minds, often gives an enlargement and elevation of
          thought, which is the earnest of the restoration of man to his
          original glory, when doubtless every mental as well as spiritual
          faculty was &quot;filled with all the fullness of God.&quot; So
          astonishing is the power of this heavenly light, that from any one
          page of this holy book, a child, or even an idiot, under heavenly
          teaching, may draw more instruction than the most acute philosopher
          could ever attain from any other fountain of light! No—he may acquire
          a more intelligent perception of its contents, than the student,
          untaught by the Spirit of God, who may have devoted to its study the
          persevering industry of many successive years. For very possible is it
          to be possessed of all the treasures of literature, and yet to remain
          in total ignorance of everything that is most important for a sinner
          to know. The Apostle&#x27;s paradox unfolds the secret, &quot;If any
          man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool,
          that he may be wise.&quot; We do not mean to disparage human wisdom;
          but it is the pride of wisdom, so opposed to the simplicity of the
          gospel, which prevents us from &quot;sitting at the feet of Jesus, and
          hearing His word.&quot; It makes the teacher instruct in &quot;the
          words of man&#x27;s wisdom,&quot; rather than in the knowledge of
          &quot;Christ and Him crucified,&quot; and hinders the learner from
          receiving Christ in the light and love of the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is painful to remember how much light may be shining around us on
          every side, without finding an entrance into the heart. &quot;The
          light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.&quot;
          Not only the pride of human reason, but the love of sin, shuts out the
          light: &quot;Men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds
          are evil.&quot; And thus because &quot;the eye is evil, the whole body
          is full of darkness:&quot; and &quot;if the light that is in them is
          darkness, how great is that darkness!&quot; Most awful is the view
          given us of the conflict between the contending powers of light and
          darkness, &quot;The God of this world blinding the eyes of them that
          believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
          the image of God, should shine unto them,&quot;—the Almighty God
          resisting his hateful influence, and &quot;shining into the
          hearts&quot; of His people, &quot;to give the light of the knowledge
          of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&quot; How necessary
          is it to watch vigilantly against the pride that &quot;rebels against
          the light,&quot; and the indifference that neglects to cherish it! How
          much more entrance would have been given to the word, and consequently
          how much clearer would have been the diffusion of light in the soul,
          were we as earnest and diligent in secret prayer for heavenly
          teaching, as we are accustomed to be in the public hearing of the
          word!
        </p>
        <p>
          But the enthusiast is not satisfied with the light of the word. The
          delusion of his own heart dreams of a light within—an immediate
          revelation of the Spirit, independent of the word. It cannot however
          be safe to separate the light of the Spirit from the light of the
          word. The word indeed moves in subserviency to the Spirit; but the
          light of the Spirit is nowhere promised separate from the word. If it
          does not always guide directly by the word; yet it is only manifested
          in the direction of the word. The word is in the matter, if not in the
          mode; and though the Spirit may by immediate light direct us to any
          path of duty, yet it is invariably to that path, which had been
          previously marked by the light of the word. Thus the Spirit and the
          word conjointly become our guide—the Spirit enlightening and
          quickening the word—and the word evidencing the light of the Spirit.
          Nor will their combined influence ever leave the church of God, until
          she has joyfully and completely entered into Immanuel&#x27;s land,
          where she shall need no other light, than that of the glory of God,
          and of the Lamb, which shall shine in her forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But—Reader—rest not satisfied with whatever measure of light may have
          been hitherto given. Seek that the word may have &quot;an entrance
          ministered unto you abundantly.&quot; The most advanced believer is
          most ready to acknowledge, how much of the word yet remains unexplored
          before him. Cultivate the disposition of simplicity—the spirit of a
          &quot;little child&quot;—willing to receive, embrace, submit to,
          whatever the revelation of God may produce before you. There will be
          many things that we do not understand: but there is nothing that we
          shall not believe. &quot;Thus says the Lord&quot;—is sufficient to
          satisfy reverential faith. To this spirit the promise of heavenly
          light is exclusively made. &quot;The testimony of the Lord is sure,
          making wise the simple. The meek will He guide in judgment; the meek
          will He teach His way.&quot; It is beautiful to see a man like
          Solomon, endued with enlarged powers of mind—acknowledging himself to
          be a little child, afraid of trusting in his own light; and seeking
          instruction from above. But never will an unhumbled mind know the
          benefit of this Divine instruction. To such a student, the Bible must
          ever be a dark book; since its very design is to destroy that
          disposition which he brings to the inquiry. That knowledge, therefore,
          which is unable to direct our way to heaven—no, which by closing the
          avenues of spiritual light, obstructs our entrance there, is far more
          a curse than a blessing. Far more glorious is the simplicity of the
          word than the wisdom of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;In that hour, Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank You, O
          Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hid these things
          from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto babes: even so,
          Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          131. I opened my mouth, and panted; for I longed for Your
          commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the &quot;wonderful&quot; character of God&#x27;s
          &quot;testimonies&quot; is apprehended; and when their entrance has
          given light to the soul; something far beyond ordinary affection and
          desire is excited. A thirsty man—burning with inward heat on a sultry
          day, opening his mouth, and panting for some alleviation of his
          thirst—is a fine image of the child of God intensely longing for the
          attainment of his object. Or, if we suppose before us the man nearly
          exhausted by the heat of his race, and opening his mouth, and panting
          to take in fresh breath to renew his course; so would the believer
          &quot;rejoice,&quot; like the sun, to &quot;run his&quot; heavenward
          &quot;race.&quot; He cannot satisfy himself in his desires. The
          motions of his soul to his God are his life and his joy. It is a
          spring of perpetual motion beating within—perpetual, because
          natural—not a rapture, but a habit—a principle, having indeed its
          faintings, and its sickness, but still returning to its original
          spring of life and vigor. It seems as if the soul could never draw in
          enough of the influences of the spiritual life. Its longings are
          insatiable—as if the heart would &quot;break with&quot; the
          overpowering strength of its own desires; until at length, wearied
          with the conflict, the believer opens his mouth, and pants to fetch in
          a fresh supply of invigorating grace. He enjoys &quot;a little
          reviving&quot; in his Lord&#x27;s commandments; enjoying the Lord
          Himself as his well-spring of refreshment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hear the man of God elsewhere giving, or rather attempting to give,
          expression to his pantings, &quot;As the deer pants after the
          water-brooks, so pants my soul after You, O God. My soul thirsts for
          You; my flesh longs for You in a dry and thirsty land where no water
          is. I stretch forth my hands unto You; my soul thirsts after You as a
          thirsty land.&quot; Thus did Job open his mouth, and pant. &quot;O
          that I knew where I might find Him! that I might come even to His
          seat!&quot; And the church—pouring out her heart before the Lord,
          &quot;With my soul have I desired You in the night; yes, with my
          spirit within me will I seek You early.&quot; St. Paul also describes
          the same intenseness of his own desire, &quot;Not as though I had
          already attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, if
          that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ
          Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended; but this one
          thing I do; forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
          forth unto those things which are before, I press towards the mark for
          the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.&quot; But amid
          all these examples, and infinitely beyond them all—behold the ardor of
          our blessed Master in his work. Such was the panting of His heavenly
          desire, that, when &quot;wearied with his journey,&quot; and
          &quot;sitting at Jacob&#x27;s well,&quot; He forgot even His natural
          want for His thirsty frame, in the joy of the conversion of a lost
          sinner to Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus must our affections be fully engaged. The soul must be kept
          open to heavenly influence; so that, when the Lord touches us with
          conviction, inclines our hearts to Himself, and constrains us to His
          service, we may be ready to &quot;exercise ourselves unto
          godliness,&quot; in receiving, cherishing, and improving the heavenly
          longing after His commandments; and may open our mouths, and pant for
          more advanced progress in them. We look not so much to the quantity,
          as to the activity of faith; always at work, stirring up a holy fire
          within, for the utmost stretch of human attainment: like men of large
          projects and high determinations, still aspiring to know more of God,
          both in the enjoyment of His love, and in conformity to His will. And
          shall we be ashamed of these feelings? Shall we not rather be deeply
          humbled, that we know so little of them—encouraged, if we have any
          springing of them—alarmed, if we be utterly destitute of their
          influence? Shall we not be opening our mouth, and panting, when any
          new path of service is opened before us? For if we are content to be
          strangers to this longing after God—this readiness for duty; what else
          can be expected, but &quot;sliding back from the Lord by a perpetual
          backsliding?&quot; Growing in sin, declining in love, and gradually
          relinquishing the habit of prayer, we shall shortly find little
          attaching to us but the empty name—Christianity without Christ. The
          world will despise these exercises as enthusiasm, the distemper of a
          misguided imagination. But is it—can it be—otherwise than a
          &quot;reasonable service&quot; as well as a bounden obligation, to
          give up our whole desires to Him, who is alone worthy of them? There
          can be no evidence of their sincerity, unless they are supreme.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let union with Christ, and the life flowing from Him, be the
          constant spring of this holy ardor. Thus shall I enjoy a more habitual
          influence of His love—that all-constraining principle, which overcomes
          all my complaints of coldness and deadness of heart, and fills me with
          pantings and longing in His service. But am I ready to shrink from
          this elevated standard? If my heart is drawing back, let me force it
          on. Let me lay my command, or rather God&#x27;s command, upon it. Let
          conscience do its office, until my heart is brought into actual and
          close contact with this touchstone of my spiritual prosperity. What
          then—let me ask myself—is the pulse of my desires after spiritual
          things? What exercises of grace do I find in them? What improvement of
          grace do I derive from them? Do I pant, thirst, long, after the
          enjoyment of heavenly pleasure? Do I mourn over, and conflict with,
          that indolence and indifference, which so often hinders my race? Oh!
          let me be found a frequent suppliant at the throne of grace; bewailing
          my dullness, yet &quot;stirring up&quot; my faith &quot;to lay hold
          on&quot; my God; seeking for larger views of the Gospel, a warmer
          experience of its promises, a more intense appetite for its
          enjoyments, and a more devoted attachment to its service. Surely such
          desires will issue in the confidence of faith. &quot;My soul shall be
          satisfied as with marrow and fatness.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          132. Look upon me, and be merciful unto me, as You do unto those that
          love Your name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The highest ardency of holy desire is no ground of satisfaction before
          God. Nor does the believer in his most elevated moments forget his
          proper character—always a sinner—needing mercy every moment—in every
          duty. His prayer for mercy therefore suitably follows his exalted
          expression of love—Look upon me, and be merciful unto me. Mercy is
          indeed secured to him beyond the power of earth and hell to despoil
          him of it; but the comfortable sense of this mercy is given only
          according to the earnestness of his desires, and the simplicity of his
          faith. And this is indeed a blessing, with which no earthly source of
          satisfaction can compare. What are all the riches of the world without
          it, but splendid poverty, as little able to supply the place of Jesus
          in the soul, as the magnificent array of the starry skies is to
          compensate for the absence of the sun? It is night with the child of
          God—Egyptian night, &quot;darkness which may be felt,&quot; until his
          Sun appear to chase away his gloom—until his Lord hear his cry—Look
          upon me, and be merciful unto me!
        </p>
        <p>
          To have this portion of those that love the name of God, is, then, the
          grand object. To have our offering, as Abel&#x27;s was, accepted with
          God—to walk as Enoch walked, with God—to commune with Him as Abraham
          and Moses were privileged to do—to be conformed with the holy Apostle
          to the death of Christ—in a word, to be interested in all the purchase
          of a Savior&#x27;s blood, &quot;this is the heritage of the
          Lord&#x27;s servants&quot;—this is the &quot;one thing that we have
          desired of the Lord, and are seeking after,&quot; &quot;this,&quot;
          with the dying Psalmist, &quot;is all our salvation, and all our
          desire.&quot; &quot;Remember me then, O Lord, with the favor that You
          bear to Your people; O visit me with Your salvation; that I may see
          the good of Your chosen: that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your
          nation; that I may glory with Your inheritance.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, alas! how often has the power and deceitfulness of sin cast
          us into so lifeless a state, that we are not only living without the
          enjoyment of this portion, but at rest without it; scarcely knowing or
          caring whether the Lord look on us or not? Can we wonder, that our
          holy, jealous God, should &quot;hide Himself,&quot; and &quot;go and
          return to His place?&quot; His next manifestations will probably be in
          the way of sharp conviction, making us to feel our distance, our
          coldness, our barrenness: awakening us to search into the cause; and,
          in the contrast of our sad condition with those who are walking in His
          favor, again bringing forth the cry—Look upon me, and be merciful unto
          me, as You do unto those that love Your name. The prayer of humility,
          earnestness, and perseverance, though it may be tried awhile, will
          surely never be forgotten. If therefore we cannot yet &quot;sing in
          the ways of the Lord,&quot; yet let us not cease to mourn after Him,
          until He look upon us, and &quot;satisfy us with His mercy.&quot; And
          oh! let us remember that there is but one way through which one
          gracious look, or one expression of tender mercy, can visit our souls.
          Let our eyes and heart then be ever fixed on Jesus. It is only in this
          His &quot;beloved&quot; Son that the Lord can look upon us, so as not
          to &quot;behold iniquity in us.&quot; But we &quot;are complete in
          Him.&quot; Here then let us wait; and when this our prayer has
          received its answer in the Lord&#x27;s best time—whether it be in
          &quot;the goings of our God in the sanctuary,&quot; or in the more
          secret manifestation of His love—Christians, &quot;arise, and
          shine.&quot; Let it be known, that you have been on the mount with
          God, by the luster of your face, the adorning of your profession,
          before the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord! since our looks to You are often so slight, so cold, so distant,
          that no impression is made upon our hearts; do condescend continually
          to look upon us with mercy and with power. Give us such a look, as may
          touch us with tenderness and contrition, in the remembrance of that
          sin, unbelief, and disobedience, which pierced the hands, the feet,
          the heart of our dearest Lord and Savior. Oh! for that contrite
          spirit, in which we shall enjoy the look of Your special favor! Oh!
          for a glimpse of Your love, that will put our spiritual enemies to
          shame! Oh! for that sunshine of Your countenance, which brings present
          salvation to our souls!
        </p>
        <p>
          133. Order my steps in Your word; and let not any iniquity have
          dominion over me.
        </p>
        <p>
          To expect the favor of the Lord without an habitual desire of
          conformity to His image, is one among the many delusions of a
          self-deceiving heart. It is the peculiar character of the Christian,
          that his desires are as earnest for deliverance from the power as from
          the guilt of sin. Having therefore prayed for acceptance, he now cries
          for holiness. For even could we conceive the Lord to look upon him
          with a sense of His favor, he would still feel himself a miserable
          creature, until he has received an answer to his prayer—Let not any
          iniquity have dominion over me.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is often difficult to distinguish the power of temptation from
          the prevalence of sin, and thus precisely to ascertain, when iniquity
          may be said to have dominion over us. Is it not however the influence
          of temptation—not acting upon the mind, but admitted with consent into
          the heart? It is this actual consent of the will, obtained by the
          deceitfulness and solicitations of sin, that marks its real dominion.
          Light, knowledge, and conscience, may open the path of holiness; but
          while the will—the sovereign power in the soul—dissents, the reigning
          power of sin continues undisputed. Much care, however, much
          singleness, and a most jealous scrutiny of the springs of action, are
          required, accurately to determine the bias of the will, and
          consequently the dominion of iniquity. The perplexed, conflicting soul
          may mistake the rebellion for the dominion of iniquity—its continued
          impression upon the heart for its ruling sway. On the other hand, a
          constrained opposition of conviction may present some hopeful symptoms
          of deliverance, while the dominant principle is still unshaken. The
          present resolution to any particular act of sin may be weakened, while
          the love and habit of it remained unaffected. Sin is not always hated,
          when it is condemned, or even forsaken; nor are duties always loved in
          the act of their performance. The opposition to sin, which the
          awakened superficial professor considers as his evidence of
          uprightness of heart, is often only the unavailing resistance of a
          natural enlightened conscience to the ruling principle of the heart.
          The light and power of conscience may do much in condemning every
          known sin, and in restraining from many; in illustrating every known
          duty, and insisting upon the external performance of many; while yet
          the full dominion of iniquity is undisturbed. Were not Ahab and Judas
          as completely under his dominion after their repentance as they were
          before? Did not Balaam, with all his knowledge—and the young ruler,
          with all his natural loveliness and semblance of sincerity, &quot;lack
          that one thing&quot;—a heart delivered from the dominion of its own
          iniquity? Yet it is not occasional surprisals, resisted workings,
          abhorred lust, nor immediate injections of evil and blasphemous
          thoughts; but only the ascendancy of sin in the affections, that
          proves its reigning power. The throne can admit but of one ruler; and
          therefore, though grace and iniquity may and do co-exist within, they
          cannot be co-partners in one sovereignty. Yet do not forget that every
          sinful indulgence is for the moment putting the scepter into the hands
          of our worst enemies. The setting up of an usurper is the virtual
          dethronement of the rightful sovereign. The subjection to sin is
          therefore the rejection of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          How inestimably precious is the thought, that deliverance from this
          cursed dominion is inseparably connected with a state of acceptance
          with God! The man who enjoys the unspeakable blessing of pardoned
          iniquity, is he &quot;in whose spirit there is no deceit.&quot; He has
          a work done within him, as well as for him. His Savior is a whole
          Christ, &quot;made of God unto him Sanctification&quot; and complete
          &quot;Redemption&quot; as well as &quot;Righteousness.&quot; He comes
          to the cleansing fountain, as the double cure of his iniquity—equally
          effectual to wash from its power, as from its guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us duly estimate the value of David&#x27;s preservation. He
          had been used to &quot;hide the word in his heart,&quot; as his
          safeguard against sin, and from his own experience of its power he had
          recommended it to the especial attention of the young. Yet the
          recollection of his continual forgetfulness and conscious weakness,
          leads him to turn his rule into a matter of prayer—Order my steps in
          Your word;—implying, that if his steps were not ordered, from want of
          their keeping, iniquity would regain its dominion. And who of us have
          not daily need of this ruling discipline? Without it, all is disorder.
          Our scattered affections need to be &quot;united&quot; in one central
          principle, under the direction of the word. The universal influence of
          this rule also is so important. The word not only cheers our path, but
          orders our steps. Every act—every duty—are as steps in the heavenward
          path—guarding us from the devious paths on either side, beset with
          imperceptible danger, and spread with the fowler&#x27;s snare. And
          what a blessed path would this be for us, if we had singleness and
          simplicity always to &quot;look right on, and straight before
          us!&quot; But alas! we are often only half-roused from our security.
          The word is forgotten; or there is an unreadiness to receive its
          Divine impressions. Our own wisdom is consulted: and, &quot;or ever we
          are aware,&quot; iniquity regains a temporary dominion over us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I would ask myself—What do I know of this godly, careful walk? Am
          I frequently during the day looking upward to my heavenly guide; and
          then looking into His word as my direction in the way; and lastly
          considering my heart and conduct, whether it is ordered in the word?
          The man, who has &quot;the law of God in his heart,&quot; alone
          possesses the security, &quot;that none of his steps shall
          slide.&quot; When I take therefore a step into the world, let me
          ask—Is it ordered in God&#x27;s word, which exhibits Christ as my
          perfect example; so that, walking after Him, and following in His
          steps, I may be able to frame my temper and habits according to this
          unsullied pattern?
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us mark, how fully is this prayer warranted by the special
          promise of the Gospel, &quot;Sin shall not have dominion over you; for
          you are not under the law, but under grace.&quot; The law stirred up
          sin, and gave it increased power; while it left us to our unassisted
          exertions to subdue it. We watch, pray, and strive against it; yet,
          alas! it mocks our efforts—rages, yes, tyrannizes more than ever. But
          it is the cross of Calvary, that gave the child of God his first view
          of sin, that first made him loathe it, that first enabled him to
          contemplate a holy God without fear, and even with confidence.
          This—this alone—subdues his pride, rebellion, enmity, selfishness. In
          Him that hung there we trust as an Almighty conqueror; and we are made
          ourselves &quot;more than conquerors through Him that loved us.&quot;
          His very name of Jesus marks His office, His crown, His glory. Here
          therefore—not in doubts and fears—not in indolent mourning for
          sin—here lies the appointed means of present relief—the only hope of
          final victory. Iniquity, even when subdued, will struggle to the last
          for dominion: but looking to and living on Jesus, we have the victory
          still. The more clear our view of Jesus, the more complete is our
          victory. Supplies of continual strength will ever be given to restrain
          the dominion of iniquity, and even to &quot;keep under&quot; its daily
          risings; except as they may be needful for the exercise of our graces,
          and be eventually overruled for the glory and praise of our faithful
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          134. Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep Your
          precepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Many are the afflictions of the righteous,&quot; from external
          as well as from internal enemies—not only from their own iniquity, but
          from the oppression of man. Yet &quot;man is only the Lord&#x27;s hand
          and sword,&quot; and he can only move under the overruling guidance of
          our Father&#x27;s wisdom and love. Not indeed that the believer would
          (except in submission to the will of God) desire his deliverance from
          this trouble on account of personal pain and distress: but he
          sometimes finds peculiar circumstances of trial an unavoidable
          hindrance in the service of his God. And his conviction sends him to
          the throne of grace: and there he never makes interest in vain.
          &quot;He cries unto the Lord because of the oppressors: and He sends a
          Savior, and a great one: and He delivers him.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The power of faith is indeed Omnipotent. Mountains are removed from
          their place, or they become &quot;plains before&quot; it; or the
          &quot;worm&quot; is enabled to &quot;thresh them, and beat them small,
          and make them as chaff.&quot; Often is the Christian strengthened to
          overcome the most formidable opposition, and to &quot;profess a good
          profession before many witnesses,&quot; who are &quot;watching for his
          halting.&quot; The grace of Christ will make the hardest duty easy;
          and the love of Christ will make the sharpest trials sweet: yet, where
          in the continued exercise of faith the obstacles to conscientious
          service remain unmoved (as, for instance, a child of God restrained in
          the fetters of a worldly family from a free and avowed obedience), we
          may lawfully pray that the providence of God would deliver from the
          oppression of man, that we might keep His precepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          A time of deliverance, as well as a time of persecution, has proved a
          season of extraordinary prosperity in the church of God. When
          &quot;the Churches had rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and
          Samaria,&quot; they &quot;were edified; and walking in the fear of the
          Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied.&quot;
          And thus in individual experience, whatever be the benefit of
          persecution, yet the weariness of a long-protracted conflict is often
          more than flesh and blood can bear; and which He who &quot;knows our
          frame,&quot; will not refuse to look upon, and remove, in answer to
          the prayers of His afflicted people. At the same time, our proneness,
          self-indulgence, and our natural inclination to shrink from
          discipline—as needful as our food—require this prayer to be presented
          with exceeding caution and self-jealousy. There is a great danger,
          lest, in our eagerness to escape from the difficulties of our path, we
          should lose the most important benefit intended by them. We must
          therefore accompany the petition for deliverance with a sincere
          purpose to keep God&#x27;s precepts. For how many have exposed the
          unsoundness of their own hearts, when the supplication has been heard,
          the deliverance granted, and the promise of obedience been forgotten!
        </p>
        <p>
          Fellow-Christian! have your circumstances of trial ever dictated this
          prayer? How then have you improved your liberty, when the answer has
          been given? Has the &quot;way of escape made&quot; for you been kept
          in grateful remembrance? Has the effect of your deliverance been
          visible in an increasing love and devotedness to the Lord&#x27;s
          service? Oh! let a special Ebenezer be set up to mark this special
          achievement of prayer. Let the mercy be connected with the sympathy of
          our &quot;faithful and merciful High-Priest, who being Himself touched
          with the feeling of your infirmities,&quot; has pleaded for your
          support and release. And be encouraged henceforth to tread the ways of
          God with more firmness and sensible stay, &quot;having your feet shod
          with the preparation of the Gospel of peace.&quot; But remember—the
          blessing of the cross is lost, if it does not issue in a song of
          praise—if we have not taken it up as a token of fatherly love. At all
          times the safest and shortest way to peace, is to let God use His own
          methods with us; to live the present moment to Him in the situation He
          has placed us; not dreaming of other circumstances more favorable to
          our spiritual prosperity; but leaving ourselves, our difficulties, our
          discouragements, in His hands, who makes no mistakes in any of His
          dispensations—but who orders them all, that they &quot;may turn to our
          salvation, through our prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus
          Christ.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          135. Make Your face to shine upon Your servant; and teach me Your
          statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Lord deliver us from the oppression of man, and &quot;make even
          our enemies to be at peace with us;&quot; still, if we are in
          spiritual health, we shall be restless and uneasy, until He make His
          face to shine upon us. And in the Scripture revelation of God,
          &quot;dwelling between the cherubim,&quot; and therefore on the
          mercy-seat—with the &quot;rainbow,&quot; the emblem of &quot;the
          covenant of peace&quot; &quot;round about the throne,&quot; as if to
          invite the access of sinners from every quarter—have we not full
          warrant to plead, &quot;You who dwell between the cherubim, shine
          forth; stir up Your strength, and come and save us? Turn us again, O
          God; and cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved.&quot; Others
          we see eagerly asking, &quot;Who will show us any good?&quot; Alas!
          they will discover in the end, that they have &quot;spent their money
          for that which is not bread, and their labor for that which satisfies
          not.&quot; The believer&#x27;s incessant cry is—Let me see &quot;the
          King&#x27;s face.&quot; This is a blessing worth praying for. It is
          his heart&#x27;s desire, his present privilege, and what is infinitely
          better—his sure and everlasting joy, &quot;They shall see His
          face.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is both important and interesting to mark the repetitions—always
          new—in this beautiful Psalm. David had just before prayed, &quot;Look
          upon me, and be merciful unto me.&quot; Perhaps another passing cloud
          had darkened his sky. Again he darts up the same prayer, Make Your
          face to shine upon Your servant. Such cries in the mouth of this holy
          servant of God, must have been most hopeless petitions—no, the
          expression of the most daring presumption—had he not been acquainted
          with the only true way of access to God, joyfully led to renounce
          every other way, and enabled diligently to improve this acceptable
          approach to his God. Indeed whatever obscurity may hang over the
          question relating to the faith of the Old Testament believers, their
          confidence at the throne of grace shows them to have attained a far
          more distinct perception of Christian privilege, through the shadowy
          representations of their law, than is commonly imagined. Else how
          could they have been so wrestling and persevering in their petitions;
          overcoming the spirit of bondage, and breathing out the spirit of
          adoption in the expression of their wants and desires before the Lord?
          The prayers of the Old Testament church are not more distinguished for
          their simplicity, spirituality, and earnestness, than for their
          unfettered, evangelical confidence. When they approached the footstool
          of the Divine Majesty, with the supplications—Make Your face to shine
          upon Your servant—You who dwell between the cherubim, shine forth—it
          was as if they had pleaded—&#x27;Reconciled Father—You who sit upon a
          throne of grace, look upon us—Abba, Father, be gracious to us!&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          Many, however, seem to despise this child-like confidence. They go on
          in heartless complaining and uncertain apprehensions of their state;
          as if doubting was their life, and as if they might rest upon the
          presumption, that the shining of God&#x27;s face upon them is not
          indispensable to their salvation. But will they then be content to
          &quot;be saved, yet so as by fire,&quot; instead of having an
          &quot;entrance ministered unto them abundantly into the everlasting
          kingdom of our Lord and Savior?&quot; Is it enough for them to be just
          alive, when &quot;the things that remain,&quot; from want of being
          duly cherished, &quot;are ready to die?&quot; If they can be safe
          without a conscious interest in the favor of God, can they be so
          without the desire for it? Is not this assurance attainable? Is it not
          commanded? Is it not most desirable? This cold contentment clouds the
          integrity of their profession. For God&#x27;s real people are living
          habitually either in spiritual enjoyment, or in restless
          dissatisfaction. Their dark seasons are times of wrestling
          supplication—seasons of deep humiliation, tenderness of spirit, and
          constant waiting upon God, until He makes His face to shine upon His
          servants. They can dispense with ordinary comforts. But it is death to
          be without Him. &quot;All their springs are in Him.&quot; They
          estimate their happiness by the shining—and their misery by the
          clouding—of His face. This is the true principle of assurance, even if
          this most important blessing be not sensibly enjoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          How then stands the case between us and God? From ourselves originates
          the mist, which darkens the shining. His sovereign free grace blots
          the cloud away. We raise the mountains of separation. The Almighty
          power of our great Zerubbabel removes them. To ourselves then be all
          the shame. To Him be all the praise!
        </p>
        <p>
          But how may we realize more constant sunshine?—Apart from the
          hindrances just alluded to, others are mainly to be found in mistaken
          or contracted views of the Gospel. Hence, therefore, the value of
          enlarged apprehensions of the Gospel of the grace of God—of its
          fullness, satisfying every claim, and supplying every want—of its
          freeness, unencumbered with conditions, and holding forth
          encouragement to the most unworthy—of its holiness, restraining the
          sinful hindrances to enjoyment—and of its security, affording
          permanent rest in the foundations of the covenant of grace. The life
          of faith will thus be maintained in more full contemplation of Jesus,
          and renewed reliance upon Him; and walking in closer communion with
          Him, our hope will be enlivened with the constant sense of
          reconciliation and love.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need not wonder at the Psalmist&#x27;s persevering determination to
          seek the shining of the Lord&#x27;s face. This high privilege is
          connected no less with the Christian&#x27;s public usefulness than
          with his personal enjoyment. For who is most likely to win others to
          the love of the Savior, and to the service of God—to enliven the
          drooping soul, or to recover the backslider? Is not he, who lives most
          in the sunshine of the Gospel, and who therefore has most to tell of
          its heavenly joy? But you say, &#x27;My heart, alas! is so cold and
          barren, my affections so languid, my desires so faint, my sky so often
          clouded. I do not forget that I am a child; but a child in disgrace is
          too often my dishonorable character and wretched condition.&#x27; Then
          exercise your faith in going where David was accustomed to go. As a
          penitent child, &quot;Arise and go to your Father&quot; &quot;only
          acknowledge your iniquity&quot;—tell your complaint before Him—resort
          much and often to Him; be importunate; be patient; plead the name and
          merits of Jesus; and you will not, you cannot plead in vain; you will
          once more walk happily, holily, as well as confidently, in the light
          of your Father&#x27;s countenance. And in marking more carefully His
          gracious dealings with your soul, you will be kept from formality,
          hardness, and despondency.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we cannot expect this shining, save in the paths of God; and he
          who looks for comfort, while careless of duty, is only the victim of
          his own delusions. Well, therefore, does the child of God—longing for
          higher enjoyment, and learning more of his own ignorance, add this
          petition—Teach me Your statutes. And He who taught us this petition,
          will Himself, according to His promise, be our teacher in the way of
          holiness. And if, under His teaching, in the pathway to glory—our God
          makes His face to shine upon us, what more want we to beguile the toil
          and weariness of the way? And if one beam of His countenance, though
          but dimly seen through this sinful medium, exceeds the glories of ten
          thousand worlds—what will it be to live under the perpetual cloudless
          shining of His face!
        </p>
        <p>
          Believer! does not this prospect invigorate every step of your
          journey? Your Lord is at hand. Soon will He appear to gladden with His
          inexpressible smile every soul that is in readiness for Him. Oh! seek
          to realize His approach, and with holy aspirations and joyful
          expectancy respond to His welcome voice. &quot;He which testifies
          these things says, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Even so, come, Lord
          Jesus!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          136. Rivers of waters run down my eyes, because they keep not Your
          law. (Comp. Jer. 9:1; 14:17; Lam. 2:18)
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Lord teaches us the privileges of His statutes, He will teach
          us compassion for those who keep them not. This was the mind of Jesus.
          His life exhibited one, whose &quot;heart was made of
          tenderness.&quot; But there were some occasions, when the display of
          His compassion was peculiarly striking. Near the close of His life, it
          is recorded, that, &quot;when He was come near, and beheld the
          city&quot; &quot;beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole
          earth&quot;—but now given up to its own ways, and &quot;wrath coming
          upon it to the uttermost,&quot; He &quot;wept over it.&quot; It was
          then a moment of triumph. The air was rent with hosannahs. The road
          was strewed with branches from the trees, and all was joy and praise.
          Amid all this exultation, the Savior alone, seemed to have no voice
          for the triumph—no heart for joy. His omniscient mind embraced all the
          spiritual desolation of this sad case; and He could only weep in the
          midst of a solemn triumph. Rivers of waters run down my eyes, because
          they keep not Your law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now a Christian, in this as in every other feature, will be conformed
          to the image of his Lord. His heart will therefore be touched with a
          tender concern for the honor of his God, and pitying concern for those
          wretched sinners, that keep not His law, and are perishing in their
          own transgressions. Thus was &quot;just Lot&quot; in Sodom &quot;vexed
          with the filthy conversation of the wicked.&quot; Thus did Moses
          &quot;fall down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty
          nights; he did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all their
          sins which they had sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord
          to provoke Him to anger.&quot; Thus also Samuel, in the anticipation
          of the Lord&#x27;s judgments upon Saul, &quot;grieved himself, and
          cried unto the Lord all night.&quot; Ezra, on a similar occasion, in
          the deepest prostration of sorrow, &quot;rent his garment and his
          mantle, and plucked off the hair of his head and of his beard, and sat
          down astonished until the evening sacrifice.&quot; And if David was
          now suffering from the oppression of man, yet his own injuries never
          drew from him such expressions of overwhelming sorrow, as did the
          sight of the despised law of his God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Need we advert to this tender spirit, as a special characteristic of
          &quot;the ministers of the Lord?&quot; Can they fail in this day of
          abounding wickedness—even within the bounds of their own sphere—to
          hear the call to &quot;weep between the porch and the altar?&quot; How
          instructive is the posture of the ancient prophet—first pleading
          openly with the rebellion of the people—then &quot;his soul weeping in
          secret places for their pride!&quot; Not less instructive is the great
          apostle—his &quot;conscience bearing witness in the Holy Spirit to his
          great heaviness and continued sorrow in his heart for his brethren,
          his kinsmen according to the flesh.&quot; In reproving transgressors,
          he could only write to them, &quot;Out of much affliction and anguish
          of heart with many tears,&quot; and in speaking of them to others,
          with the same tenderness of spirit, he adds, &quot;Of whom I tell you
          even weeping.&quot; Tears were these of Christian eloquence no less
          than of Christian compassion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus uniformly is the character of God&#x27;s people represented—not
          merely as those that are free from, but as &quot;those that sigh and
          that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst of the
          land.&quot; They—they alone—are marked out for mercy in the midst of
          impending, universal ruin. The want of this spirit is ever a feature
          of hardness and pride—a painful blot upon the profession of the
          gospel. How wide the sphere presenting itself on every side for the
          unrestrained exercise of this yearning compassion! The appalling
          spectacle of a world apostatized from God, of multitudes sporting with
          everlasting destruction—as if the God of heaven were &quot;a man that
          He should lie,&quot; is surely enough to force rivers of waters from
          the hearts of those who are concerned for His honor. What a mass of
          sin ascends as a cloud before the Lord, from a single heart! Add the
          aggregate of a village—a town—a country—a world! every day—every
          hour—every moment—well might the rivers of waters rise to an
          overflowing tide, ready to burst its barriers. We speak not of outward
          sensibility (in which some may be constitutionally deficient, and the
          exuberance of which may be no sign of real spiritual affection), but
          we ask—Do we lay to heart the perishing condition of our
          fellow-sinners? Could we witness a house on fire, without speedy and
          practical evidence of our compassion for the inhabitants? And yet,
          alas! how often do we witness souls on the brink of
          destruction—unconscious of danger, or bidding defiance to it—with
          comparative indifference! How are we Christians, if we believe not the
          Scripture warnings of their danger? or if, believing them, we do not
          bestir ourselves to their help? What hypocrisy is it to pray for their
          conversion, while we are making no effort to promote it! Oh! let it be
          our daily supplication, that this indifference concerning their
          everlasting state may give place to a spirit of weeping tenderness;
          that He may not be living as if this world were really, what it
          appears to be, a world without souls; that we may never see the
          sabbaths of God profaned, His laws trampled under foot, the ungodly
          &quot;breaking their bands asunder, and casting away their cords from
          them,&quot; without a more determined resolution ourselves to keep
          these laws of our God, and to plead for their honor with these
          obstinate transgressors. Have we no near and dear relatives, yet
          &quot;lying in wickedness—dead in trespasses and sins?&quot; To what
          blessed family, reader, do you belong, where there are no such objects
          of pity? Be it so—it is well. Yet are you silent? Have you no ungodly,
          ignorant neighbors around you? And are they unwarned, as well as
          unconverted? Do we visit them in the way of courtesy or kindness, yet
          give them no word of affectionate entreaty on the concerns of
          eternity? Let our families indeed possess, as they ought to possess,
          the first claim to our compassionate regard. Then let our parishes,
          our neighborhood, our country, the world, find a place in our
          affectionate, prayerful, and earnest consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor let it be supposed, that the doctrine of sovereign and effectual
          grace has any tendency to paralyze exertion. So far from it, the most
          powerful supports to perseverance are derived from this source. Left
          to himself—with only the invitations of the Gospel—not a sinner could
          ever have been saved. Added to these—there must be the Almighty energy
          of God—the seal of His secret purpose—working upon the sinner&#x27;s
          will, and winning the heart to God. Not that this sovereign work
          prevents any from being saved. But it prevents the salvation from
          being in vain to all, by securing its application to some. The
          invitations manifest the pardoning love of God; but they change not
          the rebel heart of man. They show his enmity; yet they slay it not.
          They leave him without excuse; yet at the same time—they may be
          applied without salvation. The moment of life in the history of the
          saved sinner is, when he is &quot;made willing in the day of the
          Lord&#x27;s power&quot;—when he comes—he looks—he lives. It is this
          dispensation alone that gives the Christian laborer the spring of
          energy and hope. The palpable and awful proofs on every side, of the
          &quot;enmity of the carnal mind against God,&quot; rejecting alike
          both His law and His Gospel, threaten to sink him in despondency. And
          nothing sustains his tender and compassionate interest, but the
          assurance of the power of God to remove the resisting medium, and of
          His purpose to accomplish the subjugation of natural corruption in a
          countless multitude of His redeemed people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same yearning sympathy forms the life, the pulse, and the strength
          of Missionary exertion, and has ever distinguished those honored
          servants of God who have devoted their time, their health, their
          talent, their all, to the blessed work of &quot;saving souls from
          death, and covering a multitude of sins.&quot; Can we conceive a
          Missionary living in the spirit of his work—surrounded with thousands
          of mad idolaters, hearing their shouts, and witnessing their
          abominations, without a weeping spirit? Indignant grief for the
          dishonor done to God—amazement at the affecting spectacle of human
          blindness—detestation of human impiety—compassionate yearnings over
          human wretchedness and ruin—all combine to force tears of the deepest
          sorrow from a heart enlightened and constrained by the influence of a
          Savior&#x27;s love. This, as we have seen, was our Master&#x27;s
          spirit. And let none presume themselves to be Christians, if they are
          destitute of &quot;this mind that was in Christ Jesus;&quot; if they
          know nothing of His melting compassion for a lost world, or of His
          burning zeal for His heavenly Father&#x27;s glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, for that deep realizing sense of the preciousness of immortal
          souls, that would make us look at every sinner we meet as a soul to be
          &quot;pulled out of the fire,&quot; and to be drawn to Christ;—which
          would render us willing to endure suffering, reproach, and the loss of
          all, so that we might win one soul to God, and raise one monument to
          His everlasting praise! Happy mourner in Zion! whose tears over the
          guilt and wretchedness of a perishing world are the outward
          indications of your secret pleadings with God, and the effusion of a
          heart solemnly dedicated to the salvation of your fellow-sinners!
        </p>
        <p>&#x27;But feeble my compassion proves,</p>
        <p>And can but weep, where most it loves;</p>
        <p>Your own all-saving arm employ,</p>
        <p>And turn these drops of grief to joy.&#x27;</p>
        <p>
          137. Righteous are You, O Lord, and upright are Your judgments. 138.
          Your testimonies that You have commanded, are righteous, and very
          faithful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advancing Christian learns to adore the awful perfections of his
          God, and to acknowledge His righteous character and government, even
          when &quot;his ways are in the sea, and His paths in the great
          waters.&quot; &quot;Clouds and darkness are round about Him;
          righteousness and judgment are the habitation of His throne.&quot; We
          have already brought out the unvarying testimony of His people to the
          righteous character of His afflictive dispensations. Even from haughty
          Pharaoh was a similar acknowledgment extorted. Adonibezek also, under
          the blow of His hand, cried out, &quot;As I have done, so God has
          requited me.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet in this path, &quot;we walk by faith, not by sight.&quot; Often in
          Providence &quot;his footsteps are not known.&quot; We cannot trace
          the reasons of the Divine mind. We must wait and see the &quot;end of
          the Lord,&quot; when the disjointed pieces shall be compacted into one
          complete texture and frame-work. &quot;At evening time there shall be
          light.&quot; Much more in the dispensation of grace do we hear the
          voice, &quot;Be still, and know that I am God.&quot; Doubtless He
          could give His grace to all as well as to some. Yet none have a claim
          upon Him. &quot;Is it not His to do what He will with His own?&quot;
          &quot;No, but, O man, who are you that replies against God?&quot;
          &quot;Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&quot; Thus much
          is plain—enough to silence cavil, and justify God—grace is freely
          offered to all. Man&#x27;s own will rejects it, and leaves him without
          excuse. Effectual grace is withheld from none, but those who deserve
          that it should be so. None are forced to sin. None are condemned
          without guilt. Therefore when we stand upon the ocean&#x27;s brink,
          and cry, &quot;Oh, the depth!&quot; are we not constrained to the
          adoring acknowledgment—Righteous are You, O Lord, and upright are Your
          judgments? And if this be our praise, even while &quot;we see but as
          through a glass darkly, and know but in part,&quot; how much more, in
          the world of uncloudy day, when we shall see &quot;face to face, and
          know even as we are known&quot;—shall we sing with reverential joy
          &quot;the song of the Lamb—Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord
          God Almighty! just and true are Your ways, You King of saints!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The young Christian, however, less able to grasp these deeper
          apprehensions, exercises himself chiefly in his more engaging
          perfections of long-suffering, goodness, and love. It is therefore a
          satisfactory evidence of growth in grace, when our habitual
          contemplation of God fixes upon our minds the more full and awful
          displays of His character; and we gather from thence an increase of
          light, peace, humility, and consolation. But the cross of Calvary
          harmonizes to our view at once the most appalling and the most
          encouraging attributes. Though His own declaration—that &quot;he will
          by no means clear the guilty&quot;—seemed to present an insurmountable
          barrier to the purpose of mercy; yet, rather than the glory of a God
          of love should be obscured, or His righteous law should be mitigated,
          &quot;He spared not His own Son;&quot; He &quot;made Him, who knew no
          sin, to be sin for us.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And do not we naturally argue from His nature to His testimonies? If
          He be righteous, nothing unrighteous can come from Him. His
          testimonies, therefore, are His lively image—like Himself—righteous
          and very faithful—requiring nothing impossible—nothing
          unsuitable—perfect love to God and man, &quot;our reasonable
          service,&quot; no less our privilege than our duty to render. None
          that are blessed with a spiritual apprehension of their nature, and
          are conformed and framed to them, will hesitate in setting their seal
          to the inscription, &quot;The judgments of the Lord are true and
          righteous altogether.&quot; &quot;The law is holy, and the commandment
          holy, and just, and good.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us take care to exhibit the practical influence of our
          contemplations of the character and government of God. The
          unconverted—far from understanding or subscribing to our
          acknowledgment—complain, &quot;The ways of the Lord are not
          equal.&quot; &quot;My punishment is greater than I can bear.&quot; And
          so opposed are the righteous judgments of God to the perverseness of
          corrupt nature, that even with the child of God there is much
          murmuring within, that needs to be stilled—much repining to be
          hushed—much impatience to be repressed—many hard thoughts to be
          lamented, resisted, and banished. Did we believe more simply, how much
          more joy would there be in our faith, and readiness in our submission!
          How clearly would our experience &quot;show, that the Lord is upright;
          He is our rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him!&quot; &quot;In
          returning&quot; then &quot;and rest shall we be saved; in quietness
          and confidence shall be our strength.&quot; In the submissive
          acknowledgment of the Lord&#x27;s dispensations, &quot;our peace&quot;
          will &quot;flow as a river;&quot; more deep and extensive as it
          approaches the ocean, and fertilizing our souls with abundant
          spiritual peace and enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p>
          139. My zeal has consumed me; because my enemies have forgotten Your
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such was David&#x27;s high estimation of the testimonies of his God,
          that his spirits were consumed with vehement grief in witnessing their
          neglect. He could bear that his enemies should forget him; but his
          zeal could not endure, that they should forget the words of his God.
          Zeal is a passion, whose real character must be determined by the
          objects on which it is employed, and the principle by which it is
          directed. There is a true and a false zeal, differing as widely from
          each other, as an heavenly flame from the infernal fire. The one is
          fervent, unselfish affection, expanding the heart, and delighting to
          unite with the whole empire of God in the pursuit of a good, which all
          may enjoy without envious rivalry. The other is a selfish, interested
          principle, contracting the heart, and ready to sacrifice the good of
          mankind, and even the glory of God, to its own individual advantage.
          Were its power proportioned to its native tendency, or were it to
          operate extensively in an associated body, it would end in detaching
          its several members each from their proper center; in disuniting them
          from each other; and, as far as its influence could reach, crumbling
          the moral system into discordant atoms. Too often does this baneful
          principle exemplify itself in the Church—either in an obstinate
          opposition to the truth of the gospel, or in a self-willed contention
          for its own party.&quot;This wisdom descends not from above: but it is
          earthly, sensual, devilish.&quot; How much also of that misguided
          heat, that spends itself upon the externals of religion, or would
          &quot;call fire down from heaven&quot; in defense of fundamental
          truths, may be found among us, exposing its blind devotees to our
          Master&#x27;s tender rebuke, &quot;You know not what manner of spirit
          you are of!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Often also do we see a distempered, counterfeit zeal, disproportioned
          in its exercise, wasting its strength upon the subordinate parts of
          the system, and comparatively feeble in its maintenance of the vital
          doctrines of Christ. Thus it disunites the Church by adherence to
          points of difference, instead of compacting the Church together by
          strengthening the more important points of agreement. Often again, by
          the same process in practical religion, are the &quot;mint, anise, and
          cummin,&quot; vehemently contended for; &quot;while the weightier
          matters o£ the law&quot; are little regarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Widely different from this fervor of selfishness is that genuine zeal,
          which marks the true disciple of our Lord. Enlightened by the word of
          God, and quickened into operation by the love of Christ, it both
          shines and warms at the same moment. It is indeed the kindled fire of
          heavenly love, exciting the most heavenly desires and constant efforts
          for the best interests of every child of man, so far as its sphere can
          reach; and bounded only by a consistent regard to the general welfare
          of the whole. Thus earnest and compassionate in its influence,
          awakened to a sense of the preciousness of immortal souls, and the
          overwhelming importance of eternity, it is never at a loss to discover
          an extended sphere for its most vehement and constraining exercises.
          While it hates the sins that pass on every side before its view, it is
          all gentleness to the sinner; and would gladly weep tears of blood
          over those who are deaf to the voice of persuasion, could such tears
          avail to turn them from their iniquity. But, knowing all human
          unassisted efforts to be insufficient, it gives to the world its
          protest against the abominations, which it is too feeble to prevent;
          and then hastens to the secret chamber to pour out its wrestling
          desires in the tenderness of our Master&#x27;s intercession,
          &quot;Father, forgive them! for they know not what they do.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Such was the zeal of the ancient Lawgiver, whose spirit, though, as it
          regarded his own cause, &quot;meek above all the men which were upon
          the face of the earth,&quot; &quot;waxed hot&quot; on witnessing the
          grievous dishonor done to his God during his absence on the mount. At
          the same time (as if most clearly to distinguish the holy burning from
          the heat of his own spirit) how fervently did he plead his
          people&#x27;s cause in secret before his God, as he had manifested his
          concern for the honor of his God before the congregation! Surely he
          could have taken up this language—My zeal has consumed me; because my
          enemies have forgotten Your words. Burning with the same holy flame,
          the great Old-Testament Reformer bore his testimony against the
          universal prevalence of idolatry; making use of the arm of temporal
          power, and of the yet greater power of secret complaint, to stem the
          torrent of iniquity. The same impulse in later times marked the
          conduct of the Apostles: when, &quot;rending their clothes, and
          running in among&quot; a frantic multitude of idolaters, by all the
          power of their entreaties &quot;they were scarcely able to restrain
          the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.&quot; On
          another occasion the great Apostle, forgetting &quot;the goodly stones
          and buildings&quot; that met his eye at Athens—found &quot;his spirit
          stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.&quot;
          In another city &quot;was he pressed in spirit&quot; by the intensity
          of his interest for the souls of his fellow-sinners and his
          Master&#x27;s work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet this is not a heat that wastes itself without a proportionate
          object. The truth of God is the grand object. Not one atom of its dust
          shall be lost. For its fundamentals all consequences must be
          hazarded—yes, life itself—if need be—sacrificed. Nor does this fervor
          expend itself in strong impulses that wear out without fruit. It is a
          constant affection in &quot;a good thing.&quot; Nor is it an
          undisciplined burst of warm feeling, but a sober controlled exercise
          of Christian judgment. The Apostle—with his inexpressible abhorrence
          of idolatry—yet remained in the midst of it for two, perhaps three,
          years, faithfully employed in his Master&#x27;s work; yet waiting for
          the fittest time of open protest against Diana&#x27;s worship. So
          admirably was &quot;the spirit of power and love&quot; disciplined by
          &quot;the spirit of a sound mind.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But, &quot;compassed about, as we are, with so great a cloud of
          witnesses,&quot; let us yet turn aside to look unto One greater than
          them all—to One, whose example in every temper of Christian conduct
          affords equal direction and encouragement. Jesus could testify to His
          Father, &quot;The zeal of Your house has eaten Me up.&quot; He was
          ever ready to put aside even lawful engagements and obligations, when
          they interfered with this paramount demand. Yet was His zeal tempered
          with a careful restraint from needless offence. Rather would He work a
          miracle, and retreat from publicity, than seem to give occasion to
          those that might desire it. And if we bear the stamp of His disciples,
          without rushing into offence in the waywardness of our own spirits,
          and while rejoicing to have our own &quot;names cast out as
          evil,&quot; we shall at the same time be tender of any reflection on
          the name of our God, as on our dearest friend and benefactor. We shall
          feel any slight of His honor as sensitively as a wound to our own
          reputation; nor shall we hesitate to thrust ourselves between, to
          receive on ourselves any strokes that may be aimed at His cause. This
          combined spirit of self-denial and self-devotedness kindles the flame,
          which &quot;many waters cannot quench, neither can the floods
          drown.&quot; &#x27;I could bear&#x27;—said holy Brainerd—&#x27;any
          desertion or spiritual conflict, if I could but have my heart burning
          all the while within me with love to God, and desire for His
          glory.&#x27; It is indeed a delightful exercise to &quot;spend and be
          spent&quot; in the service of Him, who for our sakes was even consumed
          by the fire of His own zeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the surest evidence of Christian zeal is, when it begins at
          home, in a narrow scrutiny, and &quot;vehement revenge&quot; against
          the sins of our own hearts. Do we mourn over our own forgetfulness of
          God&#x27;s words? Are we zealous to redeem the loss to our
          Savior&#x27;s cause from this sinful neglect? And do we plainly show,
          that our opposition to sin in the ungodly is the opposition of love?
          And is this love manifested to the persons and souls of those, whose
          doctrines and practice we are constrained to resist, and in a careful
          restraint from the use of unhallowed &quot;carnal weapons&quot; in
          this spiritual &quot;warfare?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the weak, timid child of God may be saying, &#x27;I can do
          nothing for my God. I allow His words to be forgotten, with little or
          no success in my efforts to prevent it.&#x27; Are you then making an
          effort? Every work done in faith bears fruit to God and to His church.
          You may not see it. But let your secret chamber witness to your zeal:
          and the Lord &quot;will not be unrighteous to forget your work and
          labor of love.&quot; He will even strengthen you for your dreaded
          conflict in the open confession of His cause, &quot;For He has chosen
          the weak things of the world to confound the things that are
          mighty.&quot; Or, should peculiar trials restrain the boldness of your
          profession, you may be found in the end to have made as effectual a
          resistance to the progress of sin by your intercession before God, as
          those who have shown a more open front in the face of the world.
        </p>
        <p>140. Your word is very pure: therefore Your servant loves it.</p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist&#x27;s love for the law of his God may account for the
          zeal he felt on account of its general neglect. All other systems of
          religion (or rather of &quot;philosophy falsely so called&quot;)
          allure their disciples by the indulgence of carnal lust or
          self-complacent pride. The word of God outweighs them all in its chief
          excellence—peculiar to itself—its purity. &quot;Every word is very
          pure—tried to the uttermost&quot; in the furnace, and found to be
          absolutely without dross. Its promises are without a shadow of change
          or unfaithfulness. Its precepts reflect the holy image of their Divine
          Author. In a word, it contains &#x27;truth without any mixture of
          error for its matter&#x27;—Therefore Your servant loves it.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#x27;No one but a true servant of God can therefore love it, because
          it is pure; since he who loves it must desire to be like it, to feel
          its efficacy, to be reformed by it.&#x27; The unlettered believer
          cannot well discern its sublimity; but he loves it for its holiness.
          The mere scholar, on the other hand, admires its sublimity—but the
          secrets which it reveals (such as the pride of the natural heart
          struggles to conceal) forbid him to love it. Its purity, which is the
          matter of love to the one, excites enmity in the other. From &quot;the
          glass&quot; which shows him &quot;his natural face&quot;—his neglected
          obligations—his fearfully self-deluded state—and his appalling
          prospects—he turns away in disgust. The indulgence of sin effectually
          precludes the benefit of the most industrious search into the word of
          God. The heart must undergo an entire renewal—it must be sanctified
          and cleansed, yes, be &quot;baptized with the Holy Spirit,&quot;
          before it can discern, or—when it has discerned—can love, the purity
          of the word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Witness the breathings of Brainerd&#x27;s soul in this holy
          atmosphere—&#x27;Oh, that my soul were holy, as He is holy! Oh, that
          it were pure, even as Christ is pure; and perfect, as my Father in
          heaven is perfect! These I feel are the sweetest commands in
          God&#x27;s book, comprising all others.&#x27; &#x27;Oh, how
          refreshing&#x27;—exclaims the beloved Martyn—&#x27;and supporting to
          my soul was the holiness of the word of God! Sweeter than the sweetest
          promise at this time, was the constant and manifest tendency of the
          word, to lead men to holiness and the deepest seriousness.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          The valuable end for which we &quot;desire this word&quot; is,
          &quot;that we may grow thereby&quot;—grow in purity of heart and
          conduct; learning to shrink from the touch of sin; &quot;cleansing
          ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and perfecting
          holiness in the fear of God.&quot; Our &quot;esteem&quot; for it,
          &quot;more than our necessary food&quot;—will be in proportion to our
          growth in grace, an evidence of this growth, and a constant spring of
          holy enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p>
          An additional excitement to love its purity is the exhibition of that
          purity embodied in our perfect pattern, in Him, who was &quot;holy,
          harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.&quot; For the habit of
          &quot;beholding the Savior&quot; with the eye of faith &quot;in the
          glass of the word,&quot; conforms us to His image. But be it ever
          remembered, that its holiness can have no fellowship, and communicate
          no life, except in its own atmosphere. Oh, for a larger influence of
          the Spirit of God upon our souls, that we may enjoy the purifying
          delights of the word of God; that we may live in it, live by it to the
          glory of our dear Redeemer, and to the edification of His Church!
        </p>
        <p>141. I am small and despised; yet do not I forget Your precepts.</p>
        <p>
          Evidently David did not love the word for selfish gain. Small and
          despised was his condition, when the Lord first looked on him. It was
          also the reproach, which in the height of his glory he endured for the
          name of his God. Yet—stripped and destitute as he might be—did he not
          forget His precepts. The remembrance of his God was a cheering
          encouragement to his faith in his lowly condition; and no less his
          support in the far greater trials of his prosperity. Thus habitually
          did he realize the unspeakable privilege of an ever-present God!
        </p>
        <p>
          The objects of the Lord&#x27;s sovereign choice, whom He has stamped
          as a &quot;peculiar treasure unto Him above all people,&quot; and whom
          at the day of His appearing He will bring forth as the
          &quot;jewels&quot; of His crown—are most frequently in their worldly
          condition—always in the eyes of the world, and in their own
          estimation—small and despised. And yet pride and hypocrisy in the
          natural heart will sometimes assume this character for selfish ends.
          This language of humility is not infrequently in the mouth of the
          professor, to enable him to maintain &quot;a name to live&quot; in the
          church of God. But are those who call themselves small and despised
          willing to be taken at their word? Are they content to be despised by
          those, whose esteem this &quot;voluntary&quot; spurious
          &quot;humility&quot; was meant to secure? Do they really believe
          themselves to be what they profess—false, vile, mean, deceitful
          creatures? Have they any experimental knowledge of the depth of inner
          wickedness, that God could open door after door in &quot;the chamber
          of imagery&quot; to confound them with the sight of greater, and yet
          &quot;greater abominations!&quot; When, therefore, they &quot;take the
          lowest place,&quot; do they feel it to be their own place? Or does not
          the language of self-abasement mean in the eyes of God—&#x27;Come, see
          how humble I am?&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian! do not think these self-inquiries unnecessary for the
          cautious scrutiny of Your own heart. A self-annihilating spirit before
          men, as well as before God;—to feel small and despised, when we have a
          reputable name in the Church—is a rare attainment—a glorious triumph
          of victorious grace—usually the fruit of sharp affliction. This was
          the spirit of Brainerd—that meek and lowly disciple of his Master, who
          would express his astonishment that any one above the rank of
          &quot;the beasts that perish&quot; could condescend to notice him. But
          if we are small and despised, in the estimation of men, let us think
          of &quot;Him, whom man despises—Him whom the nation abhors.&quot;
          Never was such an instance of magnanimity displayed, as when Pilate
          brought out the blessed Jesus, arrayed in the mockery of royalty, and
          with the blood streaming from His temples: and said, &quot;Behold the
          man!&quot; Then was there a human being, sustaining himself in the
          simple exclusive consciousness of the favor of God, against the
          universal scorn of every face. This was independence—this was
          greatness indeed. With such a pattern before our eyes, and such a
          motive touching our hearts, we may well account it &quot;a very small
          thing, that we should be judged of man&#x27;s judgment.&quot; What
          upheld &quot;the man Christ Jesus,&quot; will uphold His servants
          also. &quot;He committed himself to Him that judges righteously.&quot;
          Must we not desire to &quot;know the fellowship of His
          sufferings&quot;—yes, to rejoice in the participation of them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian! do you love to be low, and still desire to be lower than
          ever? Small and despised as you are in your own eyes, and in the eyes
          of the world, &quot;you are precious in the eyes of Him,&quot; who
          gave a price &quot;for your ransom&quot;—infinitely more precious than
          &quot;Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba,&quot; and who will suffer &quot;none
          to pluck you out of His hands.&quot; Many may rebuke you; many may
          scorn you; even your brethren may treat you with contempt; yet your
          God, your Redeemer, will not depart from you, will not permit you to
          depart from Him; but will put His Spirit within you, and bring forth
          His precepts to your remembrance, that you may keep them, and many a
          sweet supporting promise for your consolation. Therefore &quot;fear
          not, you worm Jacob; I will help you, says the Lord, and your
          Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          142. Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and Your law
          is the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist in the midst of his trials could not forget the precepts,
          while he maintained so just a perception of their exalted character.
          His mind at this time seems to have been filled with the contemplation
          of the righteous government of God. He therefore repeats his
          adoration, not as applied to any particular instance, but as
          distinguishing the general character of His administration from
          everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          But on whom is this government appointed to rest? Think of our
          Immanuel—the human brow encircled with Divine glory—the crucified
          hands wielding the scepter of the universe—Him, whom they mocked as
          the King of the Jews, seated on His own exalted throne, &quot;King of
          Kings and Lord of lords!&quot; &quot;The government is upon His
          shoulder: and of the increase of His government and peace there shall
          be no end.&quot; How delightful to join Jehovah Himself in the
          ascription of praise, &quot;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a
          scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom!&quot; How
          glorious also to praise that everlasting righteousness—the ground on
          which the administration of His church is framed—which Jesus
          &quot;brought in,&quot; and &quot;which is unto all them that
          believe;&quot; which, when once clothed with it, is our infinite glory
          and reward!
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Every ordinance of man&quot; is connected only with time. The
          Divine government has a constant reference to eternity, past and to
          come. &quot;And I heard&quot;—said the enraptured disciple, &quot;the
          angel of the waters say; You are righteous, which are, and was, and
          shall be; because You have judged thus.&quot; Every instance,
          therefore, of His righteous administration, is that display of the
          Divine character which constrains the adoration of heaven. &quot;One
          cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts:
          the whole earth is full of His glory.&quot; His law, &quot;the
          manifestation of His righteousness&quot;—is the truth. &quot;Your word
          is true from the beginning! and everyone of Your righteous judgments
          endures forever.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This truth is the law of righteousness, which Jesus bound Himself to
          &quot;fulfill&quot;—to which He &quot;came to bear witness,&quot; and
          for which He commended His people to His Father as the means of their
          sanctification; for what else is holiness, but the influence of truth,
          digested and practically embodied in the life and conduct? There may
          be fragments of truth elsewhere found—the scattered remnants of the
          fall. There may be systems imbued with large portions of truth deduced
          from this law. But here alone is it found perfect—unsullied. How
          carefully, therefore, should we test, by this standard, every
          doctrine—every revelation; receiving with implicit subjection all that
          is conformed to it; rejecting with uncompromising decision whatever
          will not abide the fiery trial. Most careful also should we be to
          preserve its unadulterated simplicity. Even the most seemingly
          trifling infusion of fundamental error is the grain of poison cast
          into the food, and making it &quot;a savor of death unto death.&quot;
          Such was the error of the Galatian Church, &quot;another gospel, yet
          not another&quot;—not deserving the name—not putting ordinances in the
          stead of Christ (an error too gross to beguile a Christian
          profession), but what is far more subtle, and equally destructive,
          mixing them with Christ; thus impairing the integrity of the
          foundation, paralyzing the springs, poisoning the sources of life,
          yes, converting life itself into death. Let this church stand out as a
          beacon to our own—as a much-needed warning to each of her members.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in a more general view, let us adore the Divine revelation, as
          bearing so full an impress of a &quot;God that cannot lie&quot;—of a
          &quot;covenant ordered in all things&quot; beyond human contrivance,
          &quot;and sure&quot; beyond the possibility of a change. How many
          dying testimonies have sealed the truth of the precious promises!
          Joshua, Simeon, and a &quot;cloud of witnesses with which we are
          compassed about,&quot; have &quot;set to their seals that God is
          true&quot;—that &quot;all the promises of God are in Christ Jesus yes
          and amen&quot;—that &quot;all are come to pass unto them, and not one
          thing has failed thereof.&quot; Equally manifest is the truth of His
          threatenings. Hell is truth seen too late. Those on the right hand and
          those on the left, at the great day of God, will combine their
          testimony to the declaration of the &quot;Faithful and True
          Witness&quot; &quot;Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words
          shall not pass away.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          143. Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet Your commandments
          are my delights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian! expect not unmixed sorrow or uninterrupted joy as your
          present portion. Heaven will be joy without sorrow. Hell will be
          sorrow without joy. Earth presents to you every joy mingled with
          grief—every grief tempered with joy. To be accounted small and
          despised does not comprise the whole of your trials. Like the great
          apostle, you must expect not only trouble without, but anguish within.
          Others may not have it. But your Savior engages, &quot;You
          shall.&quot; To all His people He has not meted out the same measure.
          Some have rebuke. Some have a scourge. But all have the cross, and
          this a daily cross—not a single or an occasional trial—but a life of
          trial—constant contradiction to the will—constant mortification of the
          flesh. And this takes hold of us. We cannot escape from it. Should we
          wish to escape it? This discipline, as Luther observes in his own way
          (and who was a better calculator in this school?), &#x27;is more
          necessary for us, than all the riches and dignities of the whole
          world.&#x27; And the exercise of faith and patience in the endurance
          will bring more honor to God and profit to ourselves than a life of
          ease and indulgence. The instruction of the rod delivers us from its
          curse, and brings a substantial and enriching blessing.

          But how precious is the sympathy of Jesus, &quot;in all things made
          like unto His brethren&quot;—enduring trouble and anguish
          inconceivable to human apprehension, &quot;that He might be a merciful
          and faithful High Priest to support His tempted people!&quot; How does
          it lift up our head amid the billows, when in communion with our Lord
          we can call to mind, that His sorrow was for the sake of His dear
          purchased people; that they might drink their lighter cup bereft of
          its bitter ingredients!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist did not find that the Lord afflicted him to leave him in
          misery, but rather to increase his happiness. The precepts which he
          had not forgotten, were now his delights. The scriptural records of
          the trials of the Lord&#x27;s people bear similar abundant testimony
          to the inexhaustible resources of support in the Book of God: and they
          are written for our learning, &quot;that we through patience and
          comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.&quot; The child of God,
          whose thoughts are habitually occupied in the word, will always find
          it to be his food and light, his joy and strength; witnessing within,
          the presence and power of God, even where its sensible comfort may not
          be enjoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But specially is affliction the time, that unfolds the delights of the
          word, such as more than counterbalances the painful trouble and
          anguish of the flesh. Such cheering prospects of hope and deliverance
          does it set forth! Such mighty supports in the endurance of trial does
          it realize! Truly the experimental power of the word in keeping the
          soul alive—much more than this—cheerful—sustained—established—is there
          any blessing like this—the fruit of the cross? Can we mourn over that
          cross, that brings so gainful a harvest? The bitterness of the cross
          then best realizes the delights of the commandments. But never does
          the believer more &quot;rejoice in tribulation,&quot; than when the
          trouble and anguish which take hold of him, is for the love he bears
          to the name of his dear Lord. Persecution for His sake, far from
          appalling him, only endears His service to his heart. It is in his
          eyes, &quot;not a penalty endured, but a privilege conferred,&quot;
          &quot;to suffer for His name&#x27;s sake.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But contrast the condition of the child of God and the follower of the
          world, in the hour of affliction. The one in the midst of his troubles
          drinks of the fountain of all-sufficiency; and such is his peace and
          security, that, &quot;in the floods of great waters they shall not
          come near unto him.&quot; The other, &quot;in the fullness of his
          sufficiency, is in straits.&quot; David could look upward, and find
          the way of escape in the midst of his trouble: but for Saul, when
          trouble and anguish took hold of him, no source of comfort opened to
          his view. &quot;God was departed from him, and was become his
          enemy.&quot; It was therefore trouble without support, anguish without
          relief—trouble and anguish; such as will at length take hold of them
          that forget God, when nothing will be left, but the unavailing
          &quot;cry to the mountains and the hills to fall upon them, and cover
          them.&quot; Thanks be to God for deliverance from this fearful
          prospect! Thanks for the hope of unfading delights, when earthly
          pleasures shall have passed away! The first sheaf of the heavenly
          harvest will blot out the painful remembrance of the weeping seed-time
          which preceded it. The first moment of heaven will compensate for all
          the troubles and anguish of earth; and these moments will last
          throughout eternity. &quot;Say to the righteous, it shall be well with
          him&quot;—eternally well.
        </p>
        <p>
          144. The righteousness of Your testimonies is everlasting: give me
          understanding, and I shall live. (Comp. verses 137, 138.)
        </p>
        <p>
          What deep—weighty—impressive thoughts were exercising the
          Psalmist&#x27;s mind! He had just marked the happy influence of the
          testimonies upon the believer&#x27;s heart. Now he again recurs to
          their righteousness—as the Divine administration—not subject to the
          incessant variations of the human standard—but everlasting—of
          unalterable obligation—binding us unchangeably to God, and God to us.
          His creatures can virtually &quot;make them void&quot; by their
          rebellion; but they cannot change their character, or shake their
          foundation. No—themselves shall be the instruments of their
          fulfillment. Every word shall be established either by them as His
          obedient servants, or in and upon them as rebel transgressors. What
          solemn weight therefore is due to this Divine standard! It seems now
          to be trampled under foot; but its righteousness, inflexible in its
          demands, and unalterable in its obligations—will before long assert
          its sovereignty over the world, when every other standard shall have
          passed away. It will be the rule of the Divine procedure at the great
          day of decision. When the &quot;great white throne&quot; is set
          up—when &quot;the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the
          books are opened, and another book is opened, which is the book of
          life;&quot; and the dead are judged out of those things which were
          written in the books, &quot;according to their works&quot;—the
          acknowledgment will be made throughout the universe of God—The
          righteousness of Your testimonies is everlasting. How glorious is the
          confidence of being dealt with in that great day upon an everlasting
          foundation of righteousness!
        </p>
        <p>
          But this view of the Divine righteousness and everlasting obligation
          of the testimonies, naturally suggests the prayer for a more
          spiritual, enlightened, and experimental acquaintance with them. Often
          before had the petition been sent up. But who can cry too often or too
          earnestly? One ray of this understanding is of far higher value than
          all the intellectual or speculative knowledge in the world. If its
          first dawn exhibits the infinite difference between light and
          darkness—if prayer for it implies a measure already received,
          still—Give me understanding—will be the cry—not of the &quot;little
          child&quot; whose spiritual perception is just opening—but of the
          &quot;father who has known Him that is from the beginning.&quot; Let
          me know the holiness of Your testimonies—their extent—their
          perfection—their intimate connection with every part of my daily
          walk—with the restraint of my inclination, the regulation of my
          temper, the direction of every step of my path. And indeed the more
          devoutly we study them, the more shall we feel our need of
          supplication for Divine teaching, to give us more adoring and thankful
          views of the government of God, and to subjugate our caviling
          disposition to the humbling influence of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          The principle of spiritual and eternal life flows from the enlightened
          perception of the testimonies of God. Give me understanding, and I
          shall live. For &quot;this is life eternal, that we might know You,
          the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.&quot; His
          testimonies are the revelation of Himself. If then we &quot;have an
          unction from the Holy One, and know all things,&quot; our knowledge of
          them will become more spiritual in its character, more experimental in
          its comforts, and more practical in its fruits. And thus, &#x27;the
          life of God in the soul&#x27; will invigorate us for higher
          attainments in evangelical knowledge, and more steady advancement in
          Christian holiness. But how infinitely do we live below the full
          privilege of knowing God in His testimonies! Christians of a
          Scriptural standard are &quot;forgetting those things which are
          behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before. Let us
          therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And then—what will it be at the great consummation; when our God of
          love will have put His last hand to His glorious work; when the mark
          of all our aims—the term of all our hopes and desires—all that we have
          so long labored for—so earnestly panted after—so restlessly
          pursued—when all shall be attained? Then indeed we shall live a life
          worthy of the name—not as now under the shadowed glimmerings—but under
          the immediate full-eyed glory of His light and love; having escaped
          forever the deadliest of all dangers—sin—the very deadliness of death
          itself.
        </p>

          145. I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord, I will keep Your
          statutes. 146. I cried unto You; save me and I shall keep Your
          testimonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is indeed the &quot;pouring out of the soul before the
          Lord,&quot; a beautiful and encouraging picture of a soul wrestling
          with God, in a few short sentences, with as much power and success as
          in the most continued length of supplication. Brief as are the
          petitions, the whole compass of language could not make them more
          comprehensive. Hear me. The whole heart is engaged in the cry. Save
          me—includes a sinner&#x27;s whole need—pardon, acceptance, access,
          holiness, strength, comfort, heaven, all in one word—Christ. Save
          me—from myself, from Satan, from the world, from the curse of sin,
          from the wrath of God. This is the need of every moment to the end. I
          cried unto You.—What a mercy to know where to go! The way of access
          must have been implied, though not mentioned, in these short
          ejaculations. Hear me—must have been in the name of the all-prevailing
          Advocate. Save me—through Him, whose name is, Jesus the Savior. A
          moment&#x27;s interruption of our view of Jesus casts for the time an
          impenetrable cloud over our way to God, and paralyzes the spirit of
          prayer. Prayer is not only the sense of guilt, and the cry of mercy,
          but the exercise of faith. When I come to God, I would always bring
          with me the blood of Christ—my price—my plea in my hand. He cannot
          cast it out. Thus am I &quot;a prince, that has power with God, and
          prevail.&quot; Here is the warrant to believe, that my God does, and
          will hear me. Here is my encouragement to &quot;look up&quot;—to be
          &quot;watching at His gate&quot;—like the cripple at the
          &quot;beautiful gate of the temple, expecting to receive somewhat of
          Him.&quot; Not a word of such prayer is lost. It is as seed—not cast
          into the earth, exposed to hazard and loss—but cast into the bosom of
          God—and here—as in the natural harvest, &quot;he which sows
          bountifully, shall reap also bountifully.&quot; The most frequent
          comers are the largest receivers—always wanting—always asking—living
          upon what they have, but still hungering for more.
        </p>
        <p>
          With many, however, the ceremony of prayer is everything, without any
          thought, desire, anxiety, or waiting for an answer. These slight
          dealings prove low thoughts of God, and deep and guilty
          insensibility;—that the sense of pressing need is not sharp enough to
          put an edge upon the affections. But are none of God&#x27;s dear
          children, too, who in days past never missed the presence of God, but
          they &quot;sought it carefully with tears&quot;—now too easily
          satisfied with the act of prayer, without this &quot;great object of
          it—the enjoyment of God?&quot; Perhaps you lament your deficiencies,
          your weakness in the hour of temptation, your indulgence of ease, your
          unfaithfulness of heart. But is your cry continually ascending with
          your whole heart? Your soul would not be so empty of comfort, if your
          mouth were not so empty of prayer. The Lord never charges presumption
          upon the frequency or extent of your supplications; but He is often
          ready to &quot;upbraid you with your unbelief,&quot; that you are so
          reluctant in your approach, and so straitened in your desires—that you
          are so unready to receive what He is so ready to give—that your
          vessels are too narrow to take in His full blessing—that you are
          content with drops, when He has promised &quot;floods,&quot;—yes
          &quot;rivers of living water,&quot;—and above all, that you are so
          negligent in praising Him for what you have already received.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must not lightly give up our suit. We must not be content with
          keeping up the duty, without keeping up &quot;continued instancy in
          prayer&quot; in our duty. This alone preserves in temptation. Satan
          strikes at all of God in the soul. Unbelief readily yields to his
          suggestions. This is the element in which we live—the warfare of every
          moment. Will then the customary devotion of morning and evening (even
          supposing it to be sincere) suffice for such an emergency? No. The
          Christian must &quot;put on the whole armor of God;&quot; and buckle
          on His panoply with unceasing &quot;prayer and watchfulness in the
          Spirit.&quot; If his heart be dead and cold, let him rather cry and
          wait as Luther was used to do, until it be warm and enlivened. The
          hypocrite, indeed, would be satisfied with the barren performance of
          the duty. But the child of God, while he mourns in the dust,
          &quot;Behold I am vile!&quot;—still holds on, though sometimes with a
          cry, that probably finds no utterance with his lips, that vents itself
          only with tears, or &quot;groanings that cannot be uttered.&quot; And
          shall such a cry fail to enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth?
          The Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. Lord, all my desire is
          before You; and my groaning is not hid from You.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why is the believer so earnest for an audience?—why so restless in
          his cries for salvation? Is it not, that he loves the statutes of his
          God; that he is grieved on account of his inability to keep them; and
          that he longs for mercy, as the spring of his obedience? Hear me; I
          will keep Your statutes. Save me: and I shall keep Your testimonies—a
          most satisfactory evidence of an upright heart. Sin can have no
          fellowship with the statutes. As saved sinners, they are our delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord! You know how our hearts draw back from the spiritual work of
          prayer: and how we nourish our unbelief by our distance from You. Oh,
          &quot;pour upon us this Spirit of grace and supplication.&quot;
          &quot;Teach us to pray&quot;—even our hearts—our whole hearts—to cry
          unto You. Give us the privilege of real communion with You—the only
          satisfying joy of earth or heaven. Then shall we &quot;run the way of
          Your commandments, when You shall enlarge our hearts.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          147. I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
          Your word. 148. My eyes prevent the night-watches, that I might
          meditate in Your word.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist here brings before us not only the fervency, but the
          seasons, of his supplication. Like Daniel, he had set times of prayer,
          &quot;three times a-day.&quot; Yet did not this frequent exercise
          satisfy him, without an habitual &quot;waiting all the day upon his
          God.&quot; Prayer was indeed his meat, and drink, and breath. &quot;I
          give myself unto prayer.&quot; His sketch of the &quot;blessed man
          delighting in the law of his God, and&quot;—as an evidence of this
          delight, &quot;meditating therein day and night&quot;—unconsciously
          furnished an accurate picture of himself. For early and late was he
          found in the work of God; preventing the dawning of the morning for
          prayer, and again the night-watches, that he might meditate in the
          word. But to look above the example of David to David&#x27;s
          Lord—surely &quot;it was written&quot; most peculiarly &quot;for our
          learning,&quot; that Jesus—after a laborious Sabbath—every moment of
          which appears to have been spent for the benefit of sinners; and when
          His body, subject to the same infirmities, and therefore needing the
          same refreshment with our own, seemed to require repose, &quot;in the
          morning, rising up a great while before day, went out and departed
          into a solitary place, and there prayed.&quot; On another occasion,
          when intensely engaged in the service of His church, and about to lay
          her foundation in the choice of her first ministers, did His eyes
          prevent the night-watches. &quot;He continued all night in prayer to
          God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          So long as the duty only of prayer is known, we shall be content with
          our set seasons. But when the privilege is felt, we shall be early at
          work, following it closely morning and night. While, however, family
          and social exercises are refreshing—while &quot;the tabernacles of the
          Lord are amiable&quot; in our view, and we delight to &quot;wait at
          the posts of His doors;&quot; yet it is the lonely, confidential
          communion with our God, &quot;the door shut&quot;—the Church as well
          as the world excluded—that makes our closest walk with God. Secret
          prayer is most likely to be true prayer. At least there is no true
          prayer without it. It was the &quot;garden&quot; prayer—separate even
          from His own disciples—that brought special support to the fainting
          humanity of Jesus. And if He needed this perfect retirement, whose
          affections were always fixed upon their center, what must be our own
          need, whose desires are so unstable and languishing! And how cheering
          is His succoring sympathy, knowing as He does experimentally the heart
          of a secret, earnest pleader! Such, doubtless, were David&#x27;s
          cries—penetrating no ear, but His Father&#x27;s—yet delightful incense
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to see the King of Israel, with all His urgent responsibilities,
          &quot;sanctifying&quot; such frequent daily seasons &quot;with the
          word of God and prayer&quot;—how does it expose the insincerity of the
          worldling&#x27;s excuse, that the pressing avocations of the day
          afford no time for the service of God! It is not, that such men are
          busy, and have no time for prayer; but that they are worldly, and have
          no heart to pray. The consecrated heart will always find time for
          secret duties, and will rather, as David, redeem it from sleep, than
          lose it from prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          And does not the uniform experience of the Lord&#x27;s people warrant
          the remark—how much our vital spirituality depends upon the daily
          consecration of the first-fruits of our time to the Lord? How often
          are opportunities for heavenly communion during the day unavoidably
          straitened! But the night watches and the dawning of the morning
          afford seasons free from interruption, when our God expects to hear
          from us, and when &quot;the joy&quot; of &quot;fellowship with
          Him&quot; will be &quot;our strength&quot; for active service, and our
          preservation from many a worldly snare. What a standard of enjoyment
          would it be, with our last thoughts in the night watches, to leave as
          it were our hearts with Him, and to find them with Him in the morning,
          awaking as with our hearts in heaven! Surely the refreshments of our
          visits to Him, and His abidance with us, will often constrain us to
          acknowledge, &quot;Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with
          His Son Jesus Christ.&quot; The thoughts of God were clearly the first
          visitors to David&#x27;s waking mind; and to this may be ascribed his
          habitual success in realizing His presence throughout the day. The
          lukewarmness and our want of spiritual enjoyment may often be traced
          to that morning indolence, which not only throws the business of the
          day into confusion, but also consumes the time in self-indulgence or
          trifling, which should have been given to sacred communion. For—not to
          speak of the seasonableness of the early hours for devotion—the very
          exertion made to overcome &quot;this lust of the flesh,&quot; and to
          steal a march upon the demands of the world, is an exercise of
          self-denial, honorable to God, &quot;that shall in no wise lose its
          reward.&quot; No remembrance of the past will be so refreshing at a
          dying hour, as the time redeemed for communion with God.

          And, even should there be no actual enjoyment, at least let us honor
          God by expectancy. I hoped in Your word. There can be no exercise of
          faith in the neglect of prayer; but the ground of faith, and that
          which gives to it life, hope, and joy, is the view of God in His word
          as a promising God. Therefore when His Providence opens no present
          encouragement, let us seek it in His covenant. To hope in His word is
          to build up ourselves upon &quot;our most holy faith&quot; and to lay
          all our desires, all our cares, all our weights, and burdens, upon a
          solid, unsinking foundation.

          Well, therefore, were David&#x27;s night-watches employed in
          meditation in the word. For, in order to stay ourselves upon it in
          time of need, it must occupy our whole study, thought, and desire.
          Instability of faith arises from a want of fixed recollection of the
          promises of God. This superficial habit may suffice for times of
          quietness; but amid the billows of temptation we can only cast
          &quot;anchor sure and steadfast&quot; in an habitual and intelligent
          confidence upon the full, free, firm promise of the word. Let it
          therefore be the food of our meditation, and the ground of our
          support, when our suit seems to hang at the throne of grace without
          any tokens of present acceptance. Often will it lift up our fainting
          hands, and supply strength for fresh conflict, and the earnest of
          blessed victory. The ground is always sure for faith. May the Lord
          ever furnish us with faith enough for our daily work, conflict,
          consolation, and establishment!

          149. Hear my voice according to Your loving-kindness: O Lord, quicken
          me according to Your judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the eyes of the world, David appeared &quot;in all his glory,&quot;
          when seated on his throne, and surrounded with the magnificence of his
          kingdom. But never did he appear so glorious in the sight of God, as
          when presenting himself as a suppliant before the mercy-seat, seeking
          an audience of the King of Kings only to send up reiterated cries for
          quickening grace. And do I not need the same grace every moment, in
          every duty? Does not &quot;the gift of God within me&quot; need to be
          daily &quot;stirred up?&quot; Are not the &quot;things that
          remain&quot; often &quot;ready to die?&quot; Then hear my voice, O
          Lord; quicken me.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to urge my suit successfully, I must &quot;order my cause before
          God;&quot; I must &quot;fill my mouth with arguments.&quot; And if I
          can draw a favorable plea from the character of my Judge—if I can
          prove that promises have been made in my behalf, these will be most
          encouraging pledges of a successful issue. Now David had been so used
          to plead in cases of extremity, that arguments suited to his present
          distress were always ready at hand. He now pleads with God for
          quickening grace, on the ground of His own loving-kindness and
          judgment. Can He &quot;deny Himself?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And with what &quot;full assurance of faith,&quot; may I ask to be
          heard on account of that transcendent proof of loving-kindness
          manifested in the gift of God&#x27;s dear Son—not only as His chief
          mercy, but as the pledge of every other mercy—and manifested too at
          the fittest time—according to His judgment—after the inefficiency of
          the power of reason, and the sanctions of the law, to influence the
          heart, had been most clearly displayed! And what a plea is it to ask
          for quickening influences, that this is the very end for which this
          gift of loving-kindness was given, and that the gift itself is the
          channel, through which the quickening life of the Godhead is imparted!
          Could I ask for this grace on any other ground than loving-kindness?
          All ground of fitness or merit is swept away. On the footing of mercy
          alone, can I stand before Him. And how is my faith enlivened in
          retracing the records of my soul from the beginning—how He
          &quot;betrothed&quot;—how He &quot;drew—me with loving-kindness!&quot;
          May I not then cry, &quot;Oh! continue Your loving-kindness?&quot; And
          not less full is my conviction of His judgment, in dealing wisely and
          tenderly with me, according to His infallible perception of my need.
          Left to my own judgment—often should I have prayed myself into evil,
          and asked what it would have been my curse to have received. But I
          have learned, that the child must not be guided by his own will, but
          by his father&#x27;s better mind—not the patient by his own humor, but
          by the physician&#x27;s skill. Truly, even the Lord&#x27;s corrections
          have been in judgment! And in the thankful remembrance of them my
          confidence for the time to come is established! Gladly will I
          &quot;set to my seal,&quot; that &quot;the Lord is a God of
          judgment;&quot; and that &quot;blessed are all those who wait for
          Him.&quot; He knows not only what grace is needed, but at what time.
          Not a moment sooner will it come; not a moment later will it be
          delayed. &quot;As You will, what You will, when You will&quot; (Thomas
          a Kempis)—is the expression of faith and resignation, with which all
          must be committed to the Lord, waiting for the end in humility,
          desire, expectation. And if in pleading my suit for a hearing
          according to His loving-kindness, my poor, polluted, lifeless
          petitions should find no liberty of approach; may I be but enabled to
          direct one believing look to &quot;the Lamb that is in the midst of
          the throne!&quot; and I will not doubt that my feeblest offering shall
          come up as a memorial before God.
