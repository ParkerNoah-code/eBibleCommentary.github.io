        <h2>Psalm 1</h2>
        <p>
          As the book of the Canticles is called the Song of Songs by a
          Hebraism, it being the most excellent, so this Psalm may not unfitly
          be entitled, the Psalm of Psalms, for it contains in it the very pith
          and quintessence of Christianity. What Jerome saith on St. Paul's
          epistles, the same may I say of this Psalm; it is short as to the
          composure, but full of length and strength as to the matter. This
          Psalm carries blessedness in the frontpiece; it begins where we all
          hope to end: it may well be called a Christian's Guide, for it
          discovers the quicksands where the wicked sink down in perdition, and
          the firm ground on which the saints tread to glory.—Thomas Watson's
          Saints Spiritual Delight, 1660
        </p>
        <p>
          This whole Psalm offers itself to be drawn into these two opposite
          propositions: a godly man is blessed, a wicked man is miserable; which
          seem to stand as two challenges, made by the prophet: one, that he
          will maintain a godly man against all comers, to be the only Jason for
          winning the golden fleece of blessedness; the other, that albeit the
          ungodly make a show in the world of being happy, yet they of all men
          are most miserable.—Sir Richard Baker, 1640
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been induced to embrace the opinion of some among the ancient
          interpreters (Augustine, Jerome, etc.), who conceive that the first
          Psalm is intended to be descriptive of the character and reward of the
          JUST ONE, i.e. the Lord Jesus.—John Fry, B.A., 1842
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 1.
            <em
              >Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the
              wicked,<br />
              nor stand on the path of sinners,<br />
              nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The psalmist saith more to the point about true happiness in this
          short Psalm than any one of the philosophers, or all of them put
          together; they did but beat the bush, God hath here put the bird into
          our hand.—John Trapp, 1660
        </p>
        <p>
          Where the word blessed is hung out as a sign, we may be sure that we
          shall find a godly man within.—Sir Richard Baker.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seat of the drunkard is the seat of the scornful.—Matthew Henry,
          1662-1714
        </p>
        <p>
          "Walketh NOT....NOR standeth....NOR sitteth," etc. Negative precepts
          are in some cases more absolute and peremptory than affirmatives; for
          to say, "that hath walketh in the counsel of the godly," might not be
          sufficient; for, he might walk in the counsel of the godly, and yet
          walk in the counsel of the ungodly too; not both indeed at once, but
          both at several times; where now, this negative clears him at all
          times.—Sir Richard Baker.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word (Heb) haish is emphatic, that man; that one among a thousand
          who lives for the accomplishment of the end for which God created
          him.—Adam Clarke, 1844
        </p>
        <p>
          "That walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly." Mark certain
          circumstances of their differing characters and conduct. I. The
          ungodly man has his counsel. II. The sinner has his way; and III. The
          scorner has his seat. The ungodly man is unconcerned about religion;
          he is neither zealous for his own salvation nor for that of others;
          and he counsels and advises those with whom he converses to adopt his
          plan, and not trouble themselves about praying, reading, repentance,
          etc., etc.; "there is no need for such things; live an honest life,
          make no fuss about religion, and you will fare well enough at last."
          Now "blessed is the man who walks not in this man's counsel," who does
          not come into his measures, nor act according to his plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sinner has his particular way of transgressing; one is a drunkard,
          another dishonest, another unclean. Few are given to every species of
          vice. There are many covetous men who abhor drunkenness, many
          drunkards who abhor covetousness; and so of others. Each has his
          easily besetting sin; therefore, says the prophet, "Let the wicked
          forsake HIS WAY." (Isaiah 55:7) Now, blessed is he who stands not is
          such a man's WAY.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scorner has brought, in reference to himself, all religion and
          moral feeling to an end. He has sat down—is utterly confirmed in
          impiety, and makes a mock at sin. His conscience is seared, and he is
          a believer in all unbelief. Now, blessed is the man who sits not down
          in his SEAT.—Adam Clarke.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Hebrew, the word "blessed" is a plural noun, ashrey
          (blessednesses), that is, all blessednesses are the portion of that
          man who has not gone away, etc.; as though it were said, "All things
          are well with that man who," etc. Why do you hold any dispute? Why
          draw vain conclusions? If a man has found that pearl of great price,
          to love the law of God and to be separate from the ungodly, all
          blessednesses belong to that man; but, if he does not find this jewel,
          he will seek for all blessednesses but will never find one! For as all
          things are pure unto the pure, so all things are lovely unto the
          loving, all things good unto the good; and, universally, such as thou
          art thyself, such is God himself unto thee, though he is not a
          creature. He is perverse unto the perverse, and holy unto the holy.
          Hence nothing can be good or saving unto him who is evil: nothing
          sweet unto him unto whom the law of God is not sweet. The word
          "counsel" is without doubt here to be received as signifying decrees
          and doctrines, seeing that no society of men exists without being
          formed and preserved by decrees and laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          David, however, by this term strikes at the pride and reprobate
          temerity of the ungodly. First, because they will not humble
          themselves so far as to walk in the law of the Lord, but rule
          themselves by their own counsel. And then he calls it their "counsel,"
          because it is their prudence, and the way that seems to them to be
          without error. For this is the destruction of the ungodly—their being
          prudent in their own eyes and in their own esteem, and clothing their
          errors in the garb of prudence and of the right way. For if they came
          to men in the open garb of error, it would not be so distinguishing a
          mark of blessedness not to walk with them. But David does not here
          say, "in the folly of the ungodly," or "in the error of the ungodly;"
          and therefore he admonishes us to guard with all diligence against the
          appearance of what is right, that the devil transformed into an angel
          of light do not seduce us by his craftiness. And he contrasts the
          counsel of the wicked with the law of the Lord, that we may learn to
          beware of wolves in sheep's clothing, who are always ready to give
          counsel to all, to teach all, and to offer assistance unto all, when
          they are of all men least qualified to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term "stood" descriptively represents their obstinacy, and
          stiff-neckedness, wherein they harden themselves and make their
          excuses in words of malice, having become incorrigible in their
          ungodliness. For "to stand," in the figurative manner of Scripture
          expression, signifies to be firm and fixed: as in Romans 14:4, "To his
          own master he standeth or falleth: yea, he shall be holden up, for God
          is able to make him stand." Hence the word "column" is by the Hebrew
          derived from their verb "to stand," as is the word statue among the
          Latins. For this is the very self-excuse and self-hardening of the
          ungodly—their appearing to themselves to live rightly, and to shine in
          the eternal show of works above all others. With respect to the term
          "seat," to sit in the seat, is to teach, to act the instructor and
          teacher; as in Matthew 23:2, "The scribes sit in Moses' chair." They
          sit in the seat of pestilence, who fill the church with the opinions
          of philosophers, with the traditions of men, and with the counsels of
          their own brain, and oppress miserable consciences, setting aside, all
          the while, the word of God, by which alone the soul is fed, lives, and
          is preserved.—Martin Luther, 1536-1546.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The scornful." Peccator cum in profundum venerit contemnet—when a
          wicked man comes to the depth and worst of sin, he despiseth. Then the
          Hebrew will despise Moses (Exodus 2:14), "Who made thee a prince and a
          judge over us?" Then Ahab will quarrel with Micaiah (1 Kings 22:18),
          because he doth not prophecy good unto him. Every child in Bethel will
          mock Elisha (2 Kings 2:23), and be bold to call him "bald pate." Here
          is an original drop of venom swollen to a main ocean of poison: as one
          drop of some serpents' poison, lighting on the hand, gets into the
          veins, and so spreads itself over all the body till it hath stifled
          the vital spirits. God shall "laugh you to scorn," (Psalm 2:4), for
          laughing Him to scorn; and at last despise you that have despised him
          in us. That which a man spits against heaven, shall fall back on his
          own face. Your indignities done to your spiritual physicians shall
          sleep in the dust with your ashes, but stand up against your souls in
          judgment.—Thomas Adams, 1614.

        <p>
          "But his will is in the law of the Lord." The "will," which is here
          signified, is that delight of heart, and that certain pleasure, in the
          law, which does not look at what the law promises, nor at what it
          threatens, but at this only; that "the law is holy, and just, and
          good." Hence it is not only a love of the law, but that loving delight
          in the law which no prosperity, nor adversity, nor the world, nor the
          prince of it, can either take away or destroy; for it victoriously
          bursts its way through poverty, evil report, the cross, death, and
          hell, and in the midst of adversities, shines the brightest.—Martin
          Luther.
        </p>
        <p>
          "His delight is in the law of the Lord."—This delight which the
          prophet here speaks of is the only delight that neither blushes nor
          looks pale; the only delight that gives a repast without an after
          reckoning; the only delight that stands in construction with all
          tenses; and like AEneas Anchyses, carries his parents upon his
          back.—Sir Richard Baker.
        </p>
        <p>
          "In His law doth he meditate." In the plainest text there is a world
          of holiness and spirituality; and if we in prayer and dependence upon
          God did sit down and study it, we should behold much more than appears
          to us. It may be, at once reading or looking, we see little or
          nothing; as Elijah's servant went once, and saw nothing; therefore he
          was commanded to look seven times. What now? says the prophet, "I see
          a cloud rising, like a man's hand;" and by-and-by, the whole surface
          of the heavens was covered with clouds. So you may look lightly upon a
          Scripture and see nothing; meditate often upon it, and there you shall
          see a light, like the light of the sun.—Joseph Caryl, 1647.
        </p>
        <p>
          "In His law doth he meditate day and night."—The good man doth
          meditate on the law of God day and night. The pontificians beat off
          the common people from this common treasury, by objecting this
          supposed difficulty. Oh, the Scriptures are hard to be understood, do
          not you trouble your heads about them; we will tell you the meaning of
          them. They might as well say, heaven is a blessed place, but it is a
          hard way to it; do not trouble yourselves, we will go thither for you.
          Thus in the great day of trial, when they should be saved by their
          book, alas! they have no book to save them. Instead of the Scriptures
          they can present images; these are the layman's books; as if they were
          to be tried by a jury of carvers and painters, and not by the twelve
          apostles. Be not you so cheated; but study the gospel as you look for
          comfort by the gospel. He that hopes for the inheritance, will make
          much of the conveyance.—Thomas Adams.
        </p>
        <p>
          To "meditate," as it is generally understood, signifies to discuss, to
          dispute; and its meaning is always confined to a being employed in
          words, as in Psalm 32:30, "The mouth of the righteous shall meditate
          wisdom." Hence Augustine has, in his translation, "chatter;" and a
          beautiful metaphor it is—as chattering is the employment of birds, so
          a continual conversing in the law of the Lord (for talking is peculiar
          to man), ought to be the employment of man. But I cannot worthily and
          fully set forth the gracious meaning and force of this word; for this
          "meditating" consists first in an intent observing of the words of the
          law, and then in a comparing of the different Scriptures; which is a
          certain delightful hunting, nay, rather a playing with stags in a
          forest, where the Lord furnishes us with the stags, and opens to us
          their secret coverts. And from this kind of employment, there comes
          forth at length a man well instructed in the law of the Lord to speak
          unto the people.—Martin Luther.
        </p>
        <p>
          "In his law doth he meditate day and night." The godly man will read
          the Word by day, that men, seeing his good works, may glorify his
          Father who is in heaven; he will do it in the night, that he may not
          be seen of men: by day, to show that he is not one of those who dread
          the light; by night, to show that he is one who can shine in the
          shade: by day, for that is the time for working—work whilst it is day;
          by night, lest his Master should come as a thief, and find him
          idle.—Sir Richard Baker.

          I have no rest, but in a nook, with the book.—Thomas a Kempis,

        <p>
          "Meditate." Meditation doth discriminate and characterise a man; by
          this he may take a measure of his heart, whether it be good or bad;
          let me allude to that; "For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he."
          Proverbs 23:7. As the meditation is, such is the man. Meditation is
          the touchstone of a Christian; it shows what metal he is made of. It
          is a spiritual index; the index shows what is in the book, so
          meditation shows what is in the heart.—Thomas Watson's Saints'
          Spiritual Delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meditation chews the cud, and gets the sweetness and nutritive virtue
          of the Word into the heart and life: this is the way the godly bring
          forth much fruit.—Bartholomew Ashwood's Heavenly Trade, 1688.
        </p>
        <p>
          The naturalists observe that to uphold and accommodate bodily life,
          there are diverse sorts of faculties communicated, and these among the
          rest:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. An attractive faculty, to assume and draw in the food;<br />
          2. A retentive faculty, to retain it when taken in;<br />
          3. As assimilating faculty to concoct the nourishment;<br />
          4. An augmenting faculty, for drawing to perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meditation is all these. It helps judgment, wisdom, and faith to
          ponder, discern, and credit the things which reading and hearing
          supply and furnish. It assists the memory to lock up the jewels of
          divine truth in her sure treasury. It has a digesting power, and turns
          special truth into spiritual nourishment; and lastly, it helps the
          renewed heart to grow upward and increase its power to know the things
          which are freely given to us of God.—Condensed from Nathaniel Ranew,
          1670.

          "A tree."—There is one tree, only to be found in the valley of the
          Jordan, but too beautiful to be entirely passed over; the oleander,
          with its bright blossoms and dark green leaves, giving the aspect of a
          rich garden to any spot where it grows. It is rarely if ever alluded
          to in the Scriptures. But it may be the tree planted by the streams of
          water which bringeth forth his fruit in due season, and "whose leaf
          shall not wither."—A. P. Stanley, D.D., in "Sinai and Palestine."
        </p>
        <p>
          "A tree planted by the rivers of water."—This is an allusion to the
          Eastern method of cultivation, by which rivulets of water are made to
          flow between the rows of trees, and thus, by artificial means, the
          trees receive a constant supply of moisture.
        </p>
        <p>
          "His fruit in his season."—In such a case expectation is never
          disappointed. Fruit is expected, fruit is borne, and it comes also in
          the time in which it should come. A godly education, under the
          influences of the divine Spirit, which can never be withheld where
          they are earnestly sought, is sure to produce the fruits of
          righteousness; and he who reads, prays, and meditates, will ever see
          the work which God has given him to do; the power by which he is to
          perform it; and the times, places, and opportunities for doing those
          things by which God can obtain most glory, his own soul most good, and
          his neighbour most edification.—Adam Clarke.
        </p>
        <p>
          "In his season." The Lord reckons the times which pass over us, and
          puts them to our account: let us, therefore, improve them, and with
          the impotent persons at the pool of Bethesda, step in when the angel
          stirs the water. Now the church is afflicted, it is a season of prayer
          and learning; now the church is enlarged, it is a season of praise; I
          am now at a sermon, I will hear what God will say; now in the company
          of a learned and wise man, I will draw some knowledge and counsel from
          him; I am under a temptation, now is a fit time to lean on the name of
          the Lord; I am in a place of dignity and power, let me consider what
          it is that God requireth of me in such a time as this. And thus as the
          tree of life bringeth fruit every month, so a wise Christian, as a
          wise husbandman, hath his distinct employments for every month,
          bringing forth his fruit in his season.—John Spencer's Things New and
          Old, 1658.

        <p>
          "In his season." Oh, golden and admirable word! by which is asserted
          the liberty of Christian righteousness. The ungodly have their stated
          days, stated times, certain works, and certain places; to which they
          stick so closely, that if their neighbours were perishing with hunger,
          they could not be torn from them. But this blessed man, being free at
          all times, in all places, for every work, and to every person, will
          serve you whenever an opportunity is offered him; whatsoever comes
          into his hands to do, he does it. He is neither a Jew, nor a Gentile,
          nor a Greek, nor a barbarian, nor of any other particular person. He
          gives his fruit in his season, so often as either God or man requires
          his work. Therefore his fruits have no name, and his times have no
          name.—Martin Luther.

          "His leaf also shall not wither." He describes the fruit before he
          does the leaf. The Holy Spirit himself always teaches every faithful
          preacher in the church to know that the kingdom of God does not stand
          in word but in power. 1 Corinthians 4:20. Again, "Jesus began both to
          do and to teach." Acts 1:1. And again, "Which was a prophet mighty in
          deed and word." Luke 24:19. And thus, let him who professes the word
          of doctrine, first put forth the fruits of life, if he would not have
          his fruit to wither, for Christ cursed the fig tree which bore no
          fruit. And, as Gregory saith, that man whose life is despised is
          condemned by his doctrine, for he preaches to others, and is himself
          reprobated.—Martin Luther.

          "His leaf also shall not wither." The Lord's trees are all evergreens.
          No winter's cold can destroy their verdure; and yet, unlike evergreens
          in our country, they are all fruit bearers.—C. H. S.

        <p>
          "And whatsoever he doeth, [or, maketh or taketh in hand] shall
          prosper." And with regard to this "prospering," take heed that thou
          understandest not a carnal prosperity. This prosperity is hidden
          prosperity, and lies entirely secret in spirit; and therefore if thou
          hast not this prosperity that is by faith, thou shouldest rather judge
          thy prosperity to be the greatest adversity. For as the devil bitterly
          hates this leaf and the word of God, so does he also those who teach
          and hear it, and he persecutes such, aided by all the powers of the
          world. Therefore thou hearest of a miracle the greatest of all
          miracles, when thou hearest that all things prosper which a blessed
          man doeth.—Martin Luther.
        </p>
        <p>
          A critical journal has shown that instead of "Whatsoever it doeth
          shall prosper," the rendering might be, "Whatsoever it produceth shall
          come to maturity." This makes the figure entire, and is sanctioned by
          some MSS. and ancient versions.

          Outward prosperity, if it follow close walking with God, is very
          sweet; as the cipher, when it follows a figure, adds to the number,
          though it be nothing in itself.—John Trapp.

          "Chaff." Here, by the way, we may let the wicked know they have a
          thanks to give they little think of; that they may thank the godly for
          all the good days they live upon the earth, seeing it is for their
          sakes and not for their own that they enjoy them. For as the chaff
          while it is united and keeps close to the wheat, enjoys some
          privileges for the wheat's sake, and is laid up carefully in the barn;
          but as soon as it is divided, and parted from the wheat, it is cast
          out and scattered by the wind; so the wicked, whilst the godly are in
          company and live amongst them, partake for their sake of some
          blessedness promised to the godly; but if the godly forsake them or be
          taken from them, then either a deluge of water comes suddenly upon
          them, as it did upon the old world when Noah left it; or a deluge of
          fire, as it did upon Sodom, when Lot left it, and went out of the
          city.—Sir Richard Baker.

          "Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment," etc. And may
          not a reason also be conceived thus, why the ungodly can never come to
          be of the congregation of the righteous: the righteous go a way that
          God knows, and the wicked go a way that God destroys; and seeing that
          these ways can never meet, how should the men meet that go these ways?
          And to make sure work that they shall never meet indeed, the prophet
          expresseth the way of the righteous by the first link of the chain of
          God's goodness, which is his knowledge; but expresseth the way of the
          wicked by the last link of God's justice, which is his destroying; and
          though God's justice and his mercy do often meet, and are contiguous
          one to another, yet the first link of his mercy and the last link of
          his justice can never meet, for it never comes to destroying till God
          be heard to say Nescio vos, "I know you not," and nescio vos in God,
          and God's knowledge, can certainly never possibly meet together.—Sir
          Richard Baker.

          "For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the
          ungodly shall perish." Behold how David here terrifies us away from
          all prosperous appearances, and commends to us various temptations and
          adversities. For this "way" of the righteous all men utterly
          reprobate; thinking also, that God knoweth nothing about any such way.
          But this is the wisdom of the cross. Therefore, it is God alone that
          knoweth the way of the righteous, so hidden is it to the righteous
          themselves. For his right hand leads them on in a wonderful manner,
          seeing that it is a way, not of sense, nor of reason, but of faith
          only; even of that faith that sees in darkness, and beholds things
          that are invisible.—Martin Luther.
