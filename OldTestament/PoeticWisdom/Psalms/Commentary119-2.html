            A beautiful description of the "simplicity and godly sincerity" of
            the believer's "walk with God!" He spreads his whole case before his
            God, <i>"declaring his ways"</i> of sinfulness, of difficulty, and
            of conduct. And, indeed, it is our privilege to acquaint our Father
            with all our care and need, that we may be pitied by His love, and
            guided by His counsel, and confirmed by His strength. Who would not
            find relief by unbosoming himself to his Father? This showing of
            ourselves to God—<i>declaring our ways</i> of sin before Him without
            deceit—is the short and sure way of rest.
          </p>
          <i> <p align="justify">"You heard me." "When I kept silence,</p></i>
          my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long." While the
          voice of ingenuous confession was suppressed, cries and lamentations
          were disregarded. It was not the voice of the penitent child; and,
          therefore, "where was the sounding of his father's affections, and of
          his mercies towards him?" But now, on the first utterance of
          confession from his lips, or rather on the first purpose of contrition
          formed in his heart; "while he is yet speaking," the full and free
          pardon, which had been signed in heaven, comes down with royal
          parental love to his soul, "I said, I will confess my transgression to
          the Lord; and You forgave the iniquity of my sin."
          <p align="justify">
            Oh! what cannot he testify of the more than parental tenderness,
            with which "his transgression is forgiven, and his sin covered!" And
            yet, how necessary to the free <i>declaration of our ways</i> is an
            acquaintance with the way of forgiveness! Had not our great "High
            Priest passed into the heavens," how awful would have been the
            thought, that all things were "naked and opened unto the eyes of Him
            with whom we have to do!" We could only then have "covered our
            transgressions as Adam, by hiding our iniquity in our bosom." But
            now, even though <i>"our ways"</i> are so defiled, so crooked that
            we cannot but "abhor ourselves," on account of them, we are yet
            encouraged "boldly" to <i>"declare"</i> them all before God, with
            the assurance of finding present acceptance, and seasonable grace.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And now, having found the happy fruit of this sincere and child-like
            spirit, then follows the obligation of walking worthy of this mercy.
            Hence our need of the prayer for continual <i>teaching.</i> The same
            heavenly guidance, that brought us into the way of return, we need
            for every successive step to the end, "Teach me Your way, O Lord: I
            will walk in Your truth." <i>"I have declared my"</i> ignorance, my
            sinfulness, and my whole experience before You, looking for Your
            pardoning mercy, Your teaching Spirit, and assisting grace,
            <i>"And You have heard me."</i> O continue to me what You have been,
            and <i>teach me</i> more of Yourself!
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The hypocrite may pray after this manner. But he never thus opens
            his heart, and <i>"declares his ways"</i> beneath his God. And are
            we sincere in our dealings with Him? How often do we treat our
            Almighty Friend as if we were weary of dealing with Him! And even
            when we do <i> "declare our ways"</i> before Him, are we not often
            content to leave the result as a matter of uncertainty? We do not
            watch for the answer to our prayer. It will come in the diligent
            exercise of faith, but not perhaps in our way. We may have asked for
            temporal blessings, and we receive spiritual. We may have "besought"
            deliverance from trial, and we receive "grace sufficient" to bear
            it. But this is the Lord's wise and gracious answer—<i
              >You heard me.</i
            >
            And how sweet are those mercies, which come to us manifestly marked
            with this inscription, "Received by prayer!" They are such
            encouragement to pray again. It is not our inevitable weakness, nor
            our lamented dullness, nor our abhorred wanderings, nor our opposed
            distractions, nor our mistaken unbelief; it is not any—no, nor all
            these—that can shut out prayer. If "iniquity" is not "regarded in
            our heart," we may always hear our Savior's voice, "Verily, verily,
            I say unto you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in My name, He
            will give it you. Hitherto have you asked nothing in My name. Ask,
            and you shall receive, that your joy may be full."

            Notice the reiterated cries of the man of God for heavenly light,
            <i
              >Teach me Your statutes—make me to understand the way of Your
              precepts.</i
            >
            The need and the encouragement for these cries is equally manifest.
            Who has ever been known to <i>understand the way</i> of himself? And
            to whom—walking in a well-ordered conversation—has the Lord ever
            failed to show it? A man, untaught by the Spirit of God, may be able
            to criticize, and even clearly to expound, much of the word of God.
            But such a prayer as this has never ascended from the heart; the
            necessity of it has never been felt. And, doubtless, from this
            neglect of prayer have arisen those floating fancies and false and
            unscriptural doctrines, which crude, unexercised minds have too
            hastily embraced. Instead of humbly and simply asking<i
              >, "Make me to understand"</i
            >—men too often "lean to their own understanding," and are "vainly
            puffed up" by their fleshly mind, <i>"not holding the Head."</i>

            Such men may obtain loose fragments of spiritual knowledge; but they
            will not be in the faith, "grounded and settled." They never know
            when they are upon safe ground; and being "unlearned and unstable,
            they wrest the Scriptures"—except the sovereign grace of God
            interpose, "unto their own destruction."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Never must we forget, that teaching from above is indispensable to a
            right knowledge of the most simple truths. Ignorance and prejudice
            pervert the understanding. "Spiritual things can only be spiritually
            discerned." Divine doctrines can only be apprehended by Divine
            light. But under heavenly teaching, the deeper and more mysterious
            truths (so far as they are needful to be understood) are manifested
            with the same clearness, as the more elementary doctrines: "Eye has
            not seen nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, the
            things which God has prepared for them that love Him. But God has
            revealed them to us by His Spirit. Now we have received—not the
            spirit of the world,
            <i
              >but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things
              that are freely given to us of God."</i
            >
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Wondrous, indeed, is the spiritual revelation in the knowledge of
            Himself; including "the hope of His calling;—the riches of the glory
            of His inheritance in His saints;—the exceeding greatness of His
            power" manifested to, and wrought in, His people;—no other or less
            than that "which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the
            dead." In the understanding of the way, we would be progressing
            until the new man "grows up into the measure of the stature of the
            fullness of Christ." The smallest attainment in this knowledge is
            (as the great day will fully declare) of infinitely greater value
            than the highest intelligence in the field of earthly science.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But how important is it to grow in this knowledge! Theoretical
            attainment is at a stand. Spiritual and practical knowledge is
            always advancing. Little, indeed, comparatively, is necessary for
            salvation. But much for comfort and steadfastness—much also for the
            clear discernment of that narrow way <i>of the precepts</i> so
            difficult to trace, and when traced so difficult to maintain. Not
            less important is it to keep the object in constant view. Why do I
            desire to <i>understand that way?</i> That I may commend it to
            others—that I may <i>talk of Your wondrous works.</i> Abhorred be
            the thought of indulging in a self-complacent view of my
            attainments! But oh! let my God be more admired by me, and glorified
            in me. And may I advance both myself and others in His obedience and
            praise!
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Often do we complain of restraint in religious conversation. But the
            prayer—<i>Make me to understand while I talk</i>—will bring "a live
            coal to our lips" from the altar of God, "Our mouths will then speak
            out of the abundance of the heart," and "minister grace to the
            hearers." Humility, teachableness, simplicity, will bring light into
            the understanding, influence the heart, "open the lips," and unite
            every member that we have in the service and praise of God.

            Is this David, "whose heart is as the heart of a lion, here utterly
            <i>melting?" </i>But the sorrows, as the joys of the spiritual
            man—dealing immediately with the Infinite and Eternal God—are beyond
            conception. Ordinary courage may support under the trials of this
            life; but when "the arrows of the Almighty are within us, the poison
            thereof drinks up our spirit." How, then, can the Christian's lot be
            so enviable, when their

            <i>souls</i> thus <i>melt for heaviness?</i> But this, be it
            remembered, is only "for a season." There is a "needs-be" for it,
            while it remains: and in the end it "will be found unto praise, and
            honor, and glory." Never, perhaps, are their graces more lively, or
            the ground of their assurance more clear, than in these seasons of
            sorrow. They complain, indeed, of the diversified power of
            indwelling sin. But their very complaints are the evidence of the
            mighty working of indwelling grace. For what is it but the principle
            of faith, that makes unbelief their burden? What but hope, that
            struggles with their tears? What but love, that makes their coldness
            a grief? What but humility, that causes them to loathe their pride?
            What but the secret spring of thankfulness, that shows them their
            unthankfulness, and shames them for it? And, therefore, the very
            depth of "that <i>heaviness</i>

            which <i>melts their souls"</i> away, is the exhibition of the
            strength of God's work within, upholding them in perseverance of
            conflict to the end. Would not the believer then, when eyeing in his
            heaviest moments the most prosperous condition of the ungodly, say,
            "Let me not eat of their dainties?" Far better, and, we may add, far
            happier, is godly sorrow than worldly joy. In the midst of his
            misery, the Christian would not exchange his hope in the
            gospel—though often obscured by unbelief, and clouded by fear—for
            all "the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them." "If the
            heart knows his own bitterness, a stranger does not intermeddle with
            his joy." Yet the bitterness is keenly felt. Sin displeases a tender
            and gracious Father. It has "pierced" the heart that loves him; and
            shed the blood that saves him. It grieves the indwelling Comforter
            of his soul. God expects to see him a mourner; and he feels he has
            reason enough to mourn<i>, "My soul melts for heaviness."</i>  
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But this cry of distress is sometimes that of the child under his
            Father's needful chastisement. The world is dethroned, but not
            extirpated, in the heart. Much dross is yet to be removed. The
            sources of the too attractive earthly joy must be embittered: and
            now it is that the discipline of the cross forces the cry<i
              >, "My soul melts for heaviness." </i
            >Yet in the midst of heaviness, the child of God cannot forget that
            he is loved—that he is saved; and the recollection of this sovereign
            mercy makes his tears of godly sorrow, tears of joy.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But this <i>melting heaviness</i> has not wrought its work, until it
            has bowed us before the throne of grace with the pleading cry of
            faith—<i>Strengthen me! </i>For do we stand by the strength of our
            own resolutions or habits of grace? Unless the Lord renew His supply
            from moment to moment, all is frail and withering. But what burden
            or difficulty is too great for Almighty strength? "Fear not, you
            worm Jacob; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small."
            And especially is our success assured, when the plea is drawn, as it
            is repeatedly in this Psalm—<i>according to Your word.</i> For what
            does that word assure us?, "As Your days, so shall Your strength
            be." "Will He plead against me"—said Job, "with His great power? No!
            but He will put strength in me." Thus David found it in his own
            case: "In the day when I cried, You answered me, and strengthened me
            with strength in my soul." Thus also to the Apostle was the promise
            given and fulfilled: "My grace is sufficient for you; for My
            strength is made perfect in weakness." And is not "the God of
            Israel" still "he who gives strength and power to His people?" still
            the same "faithful God, who will not suffer them to be tempted above
            that they are able, but will with the temptation also make a way to
            escape, that they may be able to bear it?"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            When we are most sensible of our utter helplessness, and most simple
            in our reliance upon Divine strength, then it is, that the
            <i> "soul melting for heaviness,"</i> is most especially upheld and
            established.

            <i>"Heaviness</i> in the heart of man makes it stoop; but a good
            word makes it glad." And how reviving is that "good word" of the
            Gospel, which proclaims the Savior anointed to "give the garment of
            praise for the spirit of <i>heaviness,"</i> and gifted with "the
            tongue of the learned, that he might know how to speak a word in
            season unto him that is weary!" And no less encouraging is it to
            view <i>Him "melting for heaviness</i>" "sore amazed, and very
            heavy" under the accumulated weight of imputed guilt; learning by
            this bitter discipline, "in that He Himself suffered being tempted,
            to support them that are tempted." Yet was He, like His faithful
            servant, <i>strengthened according to His Father's word,</i> in the
            moment of his bitterest agony, by the agency of His own creation.
            And this faithful support, given to the Head, is the seal and pledge
            of what every member in every trouble will most assuredly enjoy. "As
            the sufferings of Christ abound in His people, so their consolation
            also abounds by Christ." The blessed word will supply all their
            need—life for their quickening, light for their direction, comfort
            for their enjoyment, strength for their support<i
              >, "Strengthen me according to Your word."</i
            >
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            Lord, may I ever be kept from despondency—regarding it as sinful in
            itself, dishonorable to Your name, and weakening to my soul; and
            though I must "needs be sometime in heaviness through manifold
            temptations," yet let the power of faith be in constant exercise,
            that I may be able to expostulate with my soul, "Why are you cast
            down, O my soul? and why are you disturbed within me? hope in God:
            for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my countenance, and

            Every deviation in principle and conduct from the strait and narrow
            path, is <i>a way of lying.</i> Every traveler in <i>the way</i>

            "feeds on the ashes" of his own delusion. Does it seem a marvel,
            that the man of God should deprecate so earnestly the influence of
            gross sin? "The brand plucked out of the fire" retains a
            susceptibility of the fire. The oldest Christian in the family of
            God might at any moment of unwatchfulness be captivated by the chain
            of his former sins. Might not the recollection of past compliances
            with this shameful sin naturally have suggested the prayer—<i
              >Remove from me the way of lying?</i
            >
            But even in the profession of the Gospel, should we "be removed from
            Him that called us into the grace of Christ unto another gospel;"
            should erroneous doctrines find a place in our system; and—as the
            natural consequence of doctrinal errors—should any inconsistency be
            marked in our practice; should there be any allowed principles of
            sinful indulgence, self-righteousness, conformity to the world, or
            shrinking from the daily cross—then, indeed, will the prayer
            naturally flow from our hearts—<i
              >Remove from me the way of lying.</i
            >
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            Most justly are ways such as these called
            <i>"ways of lying."</i> They promise what it is impossible, in the
            nature of things, that they can ever perform: and prove to their
            deluded followers, that "those who observe lying vanities, forsake
            their own mercy." We can be at no loss to trace these
            <i>"ways,"</i> to their proper source;—to him, who, "when he speaks
            a lie, speaks of his own for he is a liar, and the father of it." A
            lie was his first—alas! too successful—instrument of temptation, by
            which he "beguiled Eve through his subtlety," and still does he
            pursue the same deadly work throughout the world lying under his
            sway, beguiling the blinded "children of disobedience," into the
            awful deception of mistaking their God, and into the blind choice of
            preferring "broken cisterns" to "the fountain of living waters."
          </p>
          <i> <p align="justify">The gracious knowledge of the law</p></i> is
          the only means of the <i>removal</i> of this evil way. David, as a
          king, had it written by him. He wished it written on him—not the book
          only before his eyes, but stamped on the heart. The external knowledge
          is the common benefit of all. The <i>gracious</i> knowledge is the
          covenant-blessing of the Lord's people—the only effective principle of
          holiness. The law is still what it was—an enemy to the ungodly—forcing
          a hateful light upon their conscience; but a delight to the servant of
          God—framing his will, and directing his conduct. Thus truth extirpates
          <i>lying.</i> Christ reigns instead of Belial.
          <p align="justify">
            Thus also we are enabled to "keep our hearts"—those leading
            wanderers, that mislead the rest. For wherever we see wandering
            eyes, wandering feet, and a wandering tongue, all flow from a heart,
            that has taken its own liberty in wandering from God. But with the
            law as our rule, and the Spirit as our guide, we shall be directed
            and kept in a safe and happy path.
          </p>
          <i> <p align="justify">Grant me Your law graciously. Grant me</p></i>
          a clearer perception of its holy character—a more sensitive shrinking
          from transgressing it—a more cordial approval of its spirit—a more
          entire conformity to its directions.

            Only two ways lie before us for our choice<i
              >, "the way of lying,"</i
            >
            and <i>"the way of truth."</i> God by the light of His word guides
            us into one—Satan by his temptations allures us into the other.
            <i> The way of lying</i> is the natural choice of man. The
            <i>choice of the way of truth</i> is the Lord's work in the hearts
            of His people—the seal of His special eternal love. His teaching
            shows us <i>the way</i>; and His grace enables us to
            <i>"choose"</i> it . And who in his subsequent course has ever found
            reason to alter his first determination? Does Mary regret her
            "choice of the good part?" One whose solid and reflecting judgment
            was not likely to make a rash or hasty choice, tells us, of the
            outset of his course, "What things were gain to me, those I counted
            loss for Christ." The experience of twenty years—instead of bringing
            matter for repentance—only confirmed him in his choice: and he
            repeats his determination with increasing energy of expression;
            <i>"Yes, doubtless, and I count all things but loss</i> for the
            excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord." In the same
            spirit one of the ancient fathers expresses himself: "If I have any
            possessions, health, credit, learning—this is all the contentment I
            have of them—that I may have
            <i
              >something to despise for Christ, who comprises in His own person
              all and everything that is most desirable."</i
            >  
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The connection of this verse with the preceding well illustrates the
            bias of the believer's heart. His experience of the deceitfulness of
            sin, Satan, and his own heart, stirs up the prayer<i
              >, "Remove from me the way of lying."</i
            >
            But his choice is expressed in this verse<i
              >, "I have chosen the way of truth."</i
            >
            The sincere desire to have

            <i>"the way of lying removed from us,"</i> is a clear evidence, that
            we have already <i>"chosen the way of truth:" </i>that "the spirit
            of truth has guided us to Him," who is indeed
            <i>"the way of truth"</i>—the true and only "way to God!" And of all
            ways that could be set before the Christian, this is the way he
            would <i>"choose"</i>—as bringing most glory to his God, exalting
            the Savior, honoring the Spirit of God, and securing the salvation
            of his own soul. Whatever becomes of me—the Christian would feel—'I
            would have no other way than this. Yes, though I should perish, I
            would abide in it. So transcendent is the discovery of the glory of
            God—scarcely less clear than the glory of heaven itself!'
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The practical pathway, however, is often rugged—always narrow. We
            may have to encounter not only the reviling of an ungodly world, but
            even the suspicions of our brethren, who may not always understand
            our motives. Yet if our heart is upright with God, "none of these
            things will move us. Our choice is made, and we are prepared to
            abide the cost."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But that our choice may be daily established, let us not forget the
            treasury of our life, light, and grace. Let us
            <i>lay the "judgments of God before us."</i> For we have always some
            new lesson to learn—some new duty to perform—some new snare to
            avoid. We must therefore walk by rule—as under the eye of a jealous
            God, who enlightens and cheers our path—under the eye of the
            ungodly, who "watch for our halting"—under the eye of weak
            Christians, who might be stumbled by our unsteady walk—under the eye
            of established Christians, who will be yet further established by
            the testimony of our consistent profession. The Gospel affords all
            the material for this strict and accurate walk. All is given that is
            needed. The obedience that is enjoined is secured. "God working in
            us," enables us to work for Him; and while we are humbly looking for
            further supplies, and diligently improving what has been already
            bestowed, He is pledged by promise to assist, as we are bound by
            duty to obey.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            What then—let me inquire—is the choice which I have made? I would
            remember that it is for eternity. And if, through the grace that has
            first chosen me, <i>"I have chosen the way of truth,"</i>—is the
            effect of this choice daily visible in a life and conversation well
            ordered according to the word of God? If it is good to "hide that
            word in my heart," as a safeguard against sin; it is good also
            <i>"to lay it before"</i> my eyes, as the chart to guide my
            course—the model to direct my work—the support to uphold my
            weakness.

            We have just seen the <i>choice</i> of the man of God, and the rule
            by which he acted upon it. Now we see his perseverance—<i
              >first choosing the way</i
            >—then <i>sticking to it.</i> While he complained of<i>
              "his soul cleaving to the dust,"</i
            >
            he would yet say—<i>I have stuck to Your testimonies.</i> Thus did
            he illustrate the apostle's delineation of the Christian's two
            hearts (as a converted African expressed it), "I delight in the law
            of God after the inward man; but I see another law in my members,
            warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity
            to the law of sin, which is in my members. So then with the mind I
            myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin." In
            the midst, however, of the most painful conflicts, the child of God
            holds fast his confidence. He feels that he hates the sin that he
            commits, and loves the Savior, whom, in spite of himself, he
            dishonors; so that, with all his sins and unworthiness, he fears not
            to put in his claim among the family of God.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But, reader, seriously ask yourself—How did you become a Christian?
            Was it by birth and education, or by choice? If indeed by grace you
            have been enabled to <i>"choose the way of truth,"</i> then be sure
            you firmly stick to it; or better, far better, that you had not made
            choice of it at all. "No man having put his hand to the plough, and
            looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.—If you
            <i>continue</i> in My word, then are you My disciples indeed. It had
            been better for you not to have known the way of righteousness,
            than, after you had known it, to turn from the holy commandment
            delivered to you." Yet, praised be God for the security of
            perseverance! He who enabled you to "put your hand to the plough"
            will keep it there in the habit of faith, firm and steadfast. "The
            Lord will perfect that which concerns you."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Yet this "cleaving to the Lord," can only be maintained by unceasing
            conflict. The length and weariness of the way, and the slowness of
            your progress, are sources of constant and harassing trial. Revert,
            then, to the ground of your original choice. Was it made under the
            Lord's light and direction? This reason may well bind you to
            <i>"stick to"</i> it. For are not the ways of God as pleasant—is not
            Christ as lovely—is not heaven as desirable—as at the beginning?
            No—have you not even more reason to adhere to your
            <i>choice,</i> than you had to make it? It was formed before at
            least you could fully know for yourself. Now "you have tasted"—you
            have the seal of experience. Is not the crown more joyous in the
            nearer prospect?
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Backslider! "has God been to you a wilderness, and a land of
            darkness," that you virtually give your testimony after trial—'Satan
            is the better master, and I will return to him?' The world is the
            happiest path; and I will walk in it. This is, indeed, choosing a
            murderer in the stead of a Father, "forsaking the fountain" for the
            "broken cistern." Oh! must there not be repentance in this path? May
            that repentance come before it be too late! Ponder who it was, that
            befriended you in the moment of a dreadful extremity, and snatched
            you as "a brand from the burning." Ponder the endearing proofs of
            His love—condescending to become a man, "a man of sorrows," and to
            die in the agony of the cross, bearing for you the eternal curse of
            God. And does not gratitude remind you, what returns of faithful
            service are due from a creature so infinitely indebted to Him?
            Surely the steadfast perseverance with which His heart cleaved to
            His costly work, may serve to put to shame your unsteadiness in
            <i>"sticking to His testimonies."</i>
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Believer! you are determined to abide by your choice—but not in your
            own strength. Remember him, who one hour declared, that he would
            sooner die with Christ than deny Him; and the next hour denied Him
            with oaths and curses. Learn, then, to follow up your resolution
            with instant prayer<i>, "O Lord, put me not to shame."</i> Leave me
            not to myself, lest I become a <i>shame</i> to myself, and an
            offence to Your Church. "I will keep Your statutes. O forsake me not
            utterly." Dependence upon the Lord, in a deep sense of our weakness,
            is the principle of perseverance. Never will he shut out the prayer
            of His faithful servant. He has promised, "My people shall never be
            ashamed;" and therefore, taking firm hold of His promise, you may
            "go on your way rejoicing."

            A glowing picture of the Christian's delight in the ways of God! If
            we <i>"have chosen the way of God's commandments,"</i> and have been
            able to <i>"stick to"</i> this way, surely we shall wish to
            <i>"run in it"</i> with constancy and cheerfulness. We shall want to
            mend our pace. If we walk, we shall long to <i>"run."</i> There is
            always the same reason for progress, that there was for setting out.
            Necessity, advantage, enjoyment, spur us on to the end. Whatever
            progress we have made, we shall desire to make more; we shall go on
            praying and walking, and praying that we may walk with a swifter
            motion; we shall be dissatisfied, yet not discouraged, "faint, yet
            pursuing." Now this is as it should be. This is after the pattern of
            the holy Apostle:, "Brethren, I count not myself to have
            apprehended: but this one thing I do; forgetting those things which
            are behind, and reaching forth unto those which are before, I press
            toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
            Jesus." But the secret as well as the pattern of Christian progress
            is—looking beyond the Apostle, and the "so great cloud of witnesses,
            with which we are encompassed"—and "looking unto Jesus." Faith is
            the principle of life, and supplies the daily motion of
            life;—directing our eye to Him as "the Author," until He "becomes
            the Finisher," of our faith. This is at once our duty, our
            privilege, our happiness, and our strength. This is the point, at
            which we begin to run; and we "so run, that we may obtain."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But let us more distinctly mark the medium through which this
            spiritual energy flows—<i>an enlarged heart.</i> Without this
            influence how could we run this
            <i>way of God's commandments?</i> Such is the extent and latitude of
            the course, that a straitened heart is utterly inadequate to carry
            us through. There must be large treasures of knowledge, in order
            that from a rich "treasure-house the good things" may pour out
            abundantly. For indeed spiritual "knowledge" is the principle of
            "multiplied grace." Scriptural truths, divinely fixed in the
            understanding, powerfully influence the heart. Christian privilege
            also greatly advances this important end. In seasons of depression
            we are "so troubled, that we cannot speak." We cannot pour out our
            hearts, as at other times, with a large measure of spirit and life.
            But when "we joy in God, having received the atonement," the spirit
            is invigorated, as with oil on the wheels, or as "with wings to
            mount" on high in the service of praise.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Very different, however, is this <i>enlargement of heart</i>

            from enlargement of gifts. Fluency of utterance is too often
            fearfully separated from the spiritual life, and utterly unconnected
            with delight in

            <i>the way of God's commandments.</i> It is expression, not
            feeling—counterfeit grace—public, not secret or personal, religion.
            The yoke of sin is not broken, and the self-deceiver will be found
            at last among the deluded throng of gifted hypocrites, "punished
            with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Indeed the spiritual principle is far too little realized. At the
            commencement of the course, conscious guilt straitens the approach
            to the throne of grace. Unbelief imprisons the soul. And even when
            the deliverer is known, who "sets at liberty them that are bruised,"
            still the body of death with all its clogging burden and confinement
            presses down the soul. Unbelief also continues to work, to narrow
            the conceptions of the gospel, and by the painful recollections of
            the past, to bring in distrust, distance, and bondage. And most
            painful is this restraint. For the soul, which is but beginning to
            see how desirable is the favor of God, feels also an earnest desire
            to honor Him. And to him who—having fully "tasted that the Lord is
            gracious"—asks, "What shall I render unto the Lord?" this remaining
            influence of "the spirit of bondage" is more afflicting, than
            perhaps was a greater measure of it in a less enlightened stage of
            his way. Still, however, this legal spirit pursues him. His
            comforts, ebbing and flowing, according as he is dissatisfied or
            satisfied with his Christian progress, clearly evince a secret
            "confidence in the flesh," greatly hindering that "rejoicing in
            Christ Jesus," which so <i>enlarges the heart.</i>

          <p align="justify">
            Thus by the shackles of sin, unbelief, and self-righteousness, we
            are indeed 'sore let and hindered in running the race set before
            us.' (Collect for Advent.) The light is obscured. Faith loses sight
            of its object. What otherwise would be a delight becomes a
            weariness. Obedience is irksome; self-denial intolerable; the cross
            heavy. The heart is, as it were, "shut up, and it cannot get forth."
            Faith is so low: desires are so faint; hopes so narrow, that it
            seems impossible to make progress. Frequent defeats induce
            despondency. The world is resorted to. Sin ensnares and captivates.
            Thus "we did run well; but we have been hindered."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            This sad evil naturally leads us to inquire for the remedy. The case
            is backsliding, not apostasy. The remedy therefore is in that
            <i>engagement,</i> which embraces a wider expanse of light, and a
            more full confidence of love. We find that we have not been
            "straitened" in God, but "in our own affections." If then the rich
            fool thought of enlarging his barns, when his stores had increased
            upon him, much more should we "enlarge the place of our tent," that
            we may make more room for God, encourage larger expectations, if we
            would have more full manifestations of Him. Let not the vessels
            fail, before the oil stays. Continually let the petition be sent up,
            "Oh that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast!" Whatever
            cause we have to cry out, "My leanness, my leanness!"—still let us,
            in the exercise of faith and prayer, be waiting for a more cheerful
            ability to love, serve, and praise. Let us be restless, until the
            prison-doors are again opened, and the command is issued to the
            prisoners, "Go forth: and to them that are in darkness—Show
            yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be
            in all high places." Who knows but the Lord will once more shine
            upon us; once more unloose our fetters, and renew our strength?
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But again and again must we be reminded that every motion must begin
            with God. <i>I will run</i>—but how? not in my own strength, but by
            "the good hand of my God upon me," delivering and
            <i>enlarging my heart.</i>

            He does not say—I will make no efforts, unless You work for me; but
            if <i> You will enlarge—I will run.</i> Weakness is not the plea for
            indolence, but for quickening grace. "Draw me"—says the Church, "we
            will run after You." Effectual calling will issue in
            <i>running.</i>" Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
            The secret of Christian energy and success is a

            <i>heart enlarged</i> in the love of God.

            Let me then begin betimes—make haste—keep straight on—fix my eye on
            the mark, "endure unto the end." I may yet expect in the joy of
            blessed surprise to exclaim, "Or ever I was aware, my soul made me
            like the chariots of Ammi-nadib." Godly sorrow had made me serious.
            Now let holy joy make me active. "The joy of the Lord is my
            strength;" and I am ready, under the power of constraining love, to
            work and to toil—to run without weariness—to "march onward" without
            fainting; not measuring my pace by my own strength, but looking to
            Him who "strengthens with all might by His Spirit in the inner man."

            We need no instruction in the way of sin. That has been our way,
            ever since Adam "sought out his own invention." The ungodly "desire
            no knowledge of the <i>way of God's statutes."</i> The heart leads
            the judgment, and "their heart is enmity to the law of God." But for
            a child of God, this is a prayer for constant use. The outward
            revelation is of no avail without the inward teaching. The Divine
            Instructor must interpret and apply His own rule. However plain the
            word may be, the darkness must be removed from the understanding.
            Light will not show an object, except the faculty of sight be given.
            A blind man cannot see at noonday. We know nothing spiritually,
            except as we are taught of God. The more we are taught, the more we
            feel our need of teaching, and the more pressing will be our cries
            for this invaluable blessing. The blind man must be led in the
            plainest and most direct, as well as in the more difficult and
            rugged paths. And thus do we need the shining of light from
            above—not only in the "deep things of God"—but for the reception of
            the most elementary truths. And yet we want not this knowledge for
            its own sake—to feed pride or speculation—but for its practical
            influence. For of what avail is the discovery even of important
            truth, if we be not molded into its likeness, and constrained "into
            the obedience of faith?" The connection of every thought with
            Christian practice, here directed to its proper end, is a most
            striking proof of the Divine origin of <i>the statutes.</i> The most
            clear instructions for the regulation of our conduct flow from
            single sentences or expressions in these <i>"statutes;"</i> and this
            clearly proves an infinite wisdom in their distribution, a reference
            in the eternal mind to every detail of practical duty, and a Divine
            power and unction, applying the word to the several circumstances of
            daily conduct. For, indeed, what mind but the mind of God could have
            comprehended in so small a compass such a vast system of
            instruction? In this view, therefore, the Lord's teaching becomes
            the spring of obedience. For how can <i>we "keep"</i> a way, which
            we do not understand? And who was ever
            <i>"taught the way of the Lord's statutes,"</i>

            who had not his heart constrained and directed by their spiritual
            beauty and sweetness? In this path we realize union with the Savior;
            "the love of God is perfected in us;" and our confidence is
            established before God.

            The object nearest to the believer's heart, and which causes him
            many an anxious—and too often many an unbelieving thought—is the
            grace of perseverance. Now the Lord's <i>teaching</i> is the
            principle of perseverance. It is
            <i>"the light of life,"</i> enlightening the mind, and quickening
            the heart. Under this influence, therefore, we live—we endure—we
            cannot fail of keeping <i>the way unto the end.</i> Thus the end
            crowns the work. For with this blessing of perseverance, is sealed
            to us the hope of victory over our spiritual enemies, and the
            participation of our Savior's glory. Confidence, indeed, without
            prayer and dependence upon our glorious Head, is most daring
            presumption. But that "well-ordered and sure covenant," which "is
            all our salvation, and all our desire," engages for our continuance
            in
            <i

            'He who is his own teacher'—says Bernard—and one greater than
            Bernard, 'has a fool for his master.' Man cannot teach what he does
            not know; and of God, and of His law, he knows nothing. Therefore
            the beginning of wisdom is a consciousness of ignorance, a distrust
            of our own understanding, and the heartfelt prayer<i
              >, "Give me understanding."</i
            >
            The spiritual <i>understanding</i> is the gift of Jesus Christ. He
            directs us to Himself, as its fountain, "I am the light of the
            world; he who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
            the light of life." This <i> understanding</i> differs from mere
            intellectual discernment or speculative knowledge. It is the spring
            of spiritual activity in our walk with God; so that our obedience is
            not outward and reluctant, but filial delight and wholeness of
            heart:—we desire not only to <i>keep the law of God to the end,</i>

            but every day <i>to the end, "with our whole heart."</i>—Such are
            our obligations towards Him, that we ought to study very accurately
            the character of our walk with Him; always remembering that service
            without <i> the heart—the whole heart</i>—is hateful in His sight;
            and that what is now wilfully withheld, will gradually draw away the
            rest in apostasy from Him. Now are we seeking more "engagedness of
            heart" for Him? Then will this prayer be a suitable expression of
            our need, and the utterance of a humble, resolute petitioner. It is
            not, however, enough, that we have once received, unless we are
            constantly receiving. We must ask, that we may receive; but after we
            have received, we must ask again. Yet is this prayer never offered
            up, until the soul has in part received what it is here seeking for.
            The natural man is "wise in his own conceit," and has therefore no
            idea of his need of Divine teaching.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But we must not be satisfied with even a clear apprehension of the
            doctrines of the Bible, and of the "truth as it is in Jesus."
            <i>"Give me understanding"</i>—'not only that I may believe these
            doctrines, but that I may <i>keep and observe</i> them.' In every
            path of duty, this cry is repeated, with an importunity that is
            never wearisome to the ears of our gracious Father. And in how many
            unnoticed instances has the answer been given, when some clear and
            heavenly ray has darted unexpectedly into the mind, or some
            providential concurrence of unforeseen circumstances has
            disentangled a path before intricate and involved, and marked it
            before us with the light of a sunbeam! How many whispers of
            conscience! how many seasonable suggestions in moments of darkness
            and perplexity, may the observant child of God record, as the answer
            to this needful prayer! "Whoever is wise, and will observe these
            things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord."
            Nor will our growth in spiritual <i> understanding</i> fail to
            evidence itself in the steady consistency of a well-ordered
            conversation! "Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among
            you? Let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness
            of wisdom." If then knowledge is valuable according to its
            usefulness, one ray of this practical knowledge—the result of prayer
            for heavenly teaching—is more to be prized than the highest
            attainments of speculative religion—flowing from mere human
            instruction.

            We are equally ignorant of
            <i>the path of God's commandments,</i> and impotent to
            <i>go in it.</i> We need therefore double assistance. Our mind must
            be enlightened; our hearts constrained; else our knowledge of this
            humbling <i>path</i> would make us shrink from it. But under the
            complete influence of Divine grace, when
            <i>understanding has been given</i> to discern the beauty of it, the
            soul's warmest desire is fixed upon it. Conscious helplessness looks
            upward—<i>Make me to go: </i>and He who said to the paralytic,
            "Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house," speaks the same
            word of quickening life and power to the
            <i>soul "giving heed,"</i> "expecting to receive something of Him."
            It is delightful to acknowledge of this work, that "all is of
            God"—that "it is He who works in us both to will and to do of His
            good pleasure." To him only can it belong. For since the natural
            inclination "is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can
            be," Almighty power must introduce a new and active bias, "Turn me,
            and I shall be turned.<i

          <p align="justify">
            But even when brought into <i>this path,</i> still we need
            accelerated motion to run with increasing alacrity. We need to take
            "the Lord God for our strength; and He shall make our feet like
            hinds' feet, and He shall <i>make us to walk</i> upon the high
            places." The <i>path,</i>

            indeed, is uninviting to the eye of sense. This distorted vision
            brings all its difficulties into full view; hiding all its
            counter-balancing enjoyments. Let us, however, exercise that
            "faith," which is "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
            of things not seen." Let us exhibit our proper character, "walking
            by faith, and not by sight," and our discernment of unseen things
            will be more clear, and our enjoyment of them more permanent. The
            prayer will then be with increasing earnestness<i

          <p align="justify">
            But we must not be content with walking in this way; we must seek to
            <i>"delight in it."</i> Delight is the marrow of religion. "God
            loves a cheerful giver," and accepts obedience, only when it is
            given, not when it is <i>forced.</i> He loves the service of that
            man, who considers it his highest privilege to render it, and whose
            heart rejoices in the way, "as a giant to run his race." Fervent
            prayer and cheerful obedience mark the experience of the thriving
            Christian. As a true "child of Zion, he is joyful in his king;" he
            loves His service, and counts it "perfect freedom"—the rule of love,
            mercy, and grace.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But is the self-condemned penitent distressed by this description of
            a child of God? He cannot find the same marks in himself; and he too
            hastily concludes, that he does not belong to the heavenly family;
            not considering, that his very grief is caused by his love to, and
            <i> "delight in"</i> that way in which he is so hindered, and in
            which he daily prays<i>, "Make me to go." </i>It was, probably, the
            same sense of weakness and inability,
            <i>"to go in the path of God's commandments," </i>which urged
            David's prayer; and if it urges yours, poor trembling penitent—if it
            sends you to a throne of grace, you will, before long, receive an
            answer of peace, and "go on your way rejoicing."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            This <i>delight in the path</i> is not only following the "man after
            God's own heart;" but it is the image of David's Lord, and our
            forerunner in this path. He could testify to His Father, "I delight
            to do Your will, O My God;" and to His disciples, "I have meat to
            eat that you know not of. My meat is to do the will of Him that sent
            Me, and to finish His work." And as a proof of the intenseness of
            His delight he could, to their great amazement, "go before them" to
            Jerusalem, unappalled by the "baptism" of blood which awaited Him;
            yes, even "straitened" with the unquenchable ardor of His love,
            "until it was accomplished."

            touch. The day of His power, in which He makes us willing, is a time
            of love. "I drew them"—says he, "with cords of a man, and with bands
            of love." Every man, who is conscious of the counteracting bias
            within, will deeply feel the need of this prayer<i
              >, "Incline my heart."</i
            >

            The native principle of man draws him to his own self—to his own
            indulgence—pleasure—<i>covetousness</i>—assuming a thousand forms of
            gratifying self, at the expense of love to God. Few but are ready to
            condemn this principle in others, while perhaps it may be their own
            "easily-besetting sin." When the mind is grasping after the world,
            as if it were our portion, we have the greatest reason to "take
            heed" to our Lord's admonition, and beware of "covetousness." When
            we invest earthly gratifications with any inherent excellency—<i
              >virtually </i
            >putting them in the place of God—then will be a season for special
            supplication—<i
              >Incline my heart to Your testimonies, and not to covetousness.</i
            >
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            There is probably no principle so opposed to the
            <i> Lord's testimonies.</i> It casts out the principle of obedience,
            since the love of God cannot co-exist with the love of the world;
            and the very desire to serve Mammon is a proof of unfaithfulness to
            God. We mark the deadly influence in direct breaches of the law of
            God. Balaam, in the indulgence of this propensity, set his will in
            mad contradiction to God; Ahab was tempted to murder; David, to
            murder and adultery; Achan, to steal; Judas, both to steal from his
            fellows, and to betray his Master; Gehazi and Ananias to lying. And
            besides—what is the matter of common but painful observation—how
            much of the good seed of the kingdom, that was springing up with the
            promise of a plentiful harvest, has this weed of rank luxuriance
            "choked, that it has become unfruitful!" Our Lord's parables,
            therefore—His providence—His promises—His terms of discipleship—His
            counsels—His own example of poverty and renunciation of this world's
            comfort—all are directed against this destructive principle. The
            power of the love of Christ delivered Matthew and Zaccheus from its
            influence, and
            <i>"inclined their hearts to the testimonies of God."</i> And has
            not faith still the same power to turn the heart from the world,
            from sin, from self, to Christ? Learn, then, to rest upon the
            promise of His love, and to delight in His <i>testimonies.</i>

            Earthly cares will be cast upon him, and earthly prospects will lose
            their splendor. This life of faith—living in union with a heavenly
            Savior, involves the only effective principle of resistance. Those
            who are risen with Christ will be temperate in earthly things,
            "setting their affections on things above." Such—such alone—will
            "mortify the members that are upon the earth—evil concupiscence, and
            <i>covetousness, which is idolatry."</i>
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            We desire to sit loose to our earthly comforts. Are we enabled to
            check our natural discontent with the Lord's dealings with us, and
            to restrain our eagerness to "seek great things for ourselves," by
            the recollection of His word, "Seek them not?"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Let us not forget, that the inclination—even if it is not brought
            into active and perceptible motion, is fatally destructive of the
            life of religion. "Those who <i>will be rich</i> fall into
            temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts,
            which drown men in destruction and perdition." Awful warning to
            professors!, "The love of money is the root of all evil; which while
            some have coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced
            themselves through with many sorrows." A most important exhortation
            to the people of God!" But you, O man of God, flee these things, and
            follow after righteousness." If the Lord loves you, He will not
            indeed lose you; but unless you "take heed, and beware of
            covetousness," He will not spare you. In the midst, therefore, of
            temptation without, and a world of sin within, go onwards, with the
            pilgrim's prayer indelibly fixed on your heart<i

            So strongly does the man of God deprecate temptation to
            self-indulgence, that he prays to be kept at the greatest possible
            distance from it. That his <i>heart</i> may not be
            <i>inclined to it:</i> he desires that
            <i>his eyes may be turned away from beholding it. </i>Keeping the
            eye is a grand means of "keeping the heart." Satan has so infused
            his poison into all the objects around us, that all furnish fuel for
            temptation: and the heart—naturally inclined to evil, and hankering
            after vanity—is stolen away in a moment. <i>Vanity</i> includes "all
            that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and
            the pride of life." All is sin, "because it is not of the Father,
            but is of the world." Of all that belongs to earth, "the preacher,
            the son of David"—standing on the vantage-ground, and having taken
            within his view the widest horizon of this world's excellency, has
            pronounced his judgment, "Vanity of vanities, says the preacher,
            vanity of vanities! all is vanity." We have just mentioned "the
            lusts of other things choking"
            <i>many a promising profession.</i> Our Lord's solemn caution to His
            own disciples implies their injury to <i>a sincere profession</i>,
            "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
            overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life;
            and so that day come upon you unawares." Some, indeed, seem to walk,
            as if they were proof against temptation. They venture to the very
            edge of the precipice, under a vain assurance that no danger is to
            be apprehended. But such a confidence is upon the brink of a
            grievous fall. The tender-hearted child of God, trusting in the
            promise, that "Sin shall not have dominion over him," knows that he
            can only enjoy the security of it, while he is shrinking from every
            occasion of sin. He "hates even the garment spotted by the flesh;"
            and, remembering how often his outward senses have ministered to the
            workings of his weak and treacherous heart, he continues in prayer<i
              >, "Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity!"</i
            >
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Probably the recollection of the circumstance of his own sin, would
            to the end of his life remind David of his special need of this
            prayer. Yet who that is conscious of his own weakness and
            corruption, will find the prayer unsuitable to his circumstances of
            daily temptation? But we must watch as well as pray. For as
            watchfulness without prayer is presumption, so prayer without
            watchfulness is self-delusion. To pray that

            <i>"our eyes"</i> may be <i>"turned from vanity,"</i> without
            "making a covenant with our eyes," that they should not
            <i>behold</i> it, is like "taking fire in our bosoms," and expecting
            "not to be burnt," because we have prayed that we might not be
            burnt. If we pray not to be "led into temptation," we must "watch
            that we enter not into it." The sincerity of our prayer will be
            proved by the watchfully avoiding the circumstances and occasions of
            temptation. The fear of sin will manifest itself by a fear of
            temptation to sin. "The knife will be put to the throat, if we be
            given to appetite." We shall be afraid of the wine sparkling in the
            glass.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But where is the harm of <i>beholding vanity,</i> if we do not
            follow it? When Eve <i>beheld</i> the forbidden fruit, perhaps she
            did not think of taking it: and when she took it, she did not think
            of eating it: but the beginning of sin "is as the letting out of
            water," whose progress once opened, beats down all before it. And
            who, after our "beguiled mother," has not found the eye an inlet to
            sin? When Bunyan's pilgrims were obliged to pass through Vanity
            Fair, beset on every side with temptations and allurements, they
            stopped their eyes and ears, and quickening their pace, cried<i
              >, "Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity!"</i
            >
            A striking reproof to us, who too often loiter and gaze, until we
            begin to covet those vanities, to which, as Christians, we "are
            dead!"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Is it asked—What will most effectually
            <i>"turn my eyes from vanity?"</i> Not the seclusion of
            contemplative retirement—not the relinquishment of our lawful
            connection with the world; but the transcendent beauty of Jesus
            unveiled to our eyes, and fixing our hearts. This will
            <i> "turn our eyes from vanity"</i> in its most glittering forms.
            The sight of the "pearl of great price" dims the luster of the
            "goodliest pearls" of earth; at once deadens us to the enticements
            of the world, and urges us forward in the pursuit of the prize. And
            is not this our object? It is not enough, that through special mercy
            I am preserved from temptations. I want to be <i>quickened</i> to
            more life, energy, delight, and devotedness
            <i>in the way of my God.</i> The secret of Christian progress is
            simplicity and diligence. <i>"This one thing I do</i>—forgetting the
            things that are behind, and reaching forth to those things that are
            before; I press towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling
            of God in Christ Jesus." The Spirit leaves no wish in the heart for
            <i>beholding vanity.</i> The world with all its flowery paths, is a
            dreary wilderness; and Christ and heaven are the only objects of
            desire, "He who shuts his eyes from seeing evil, he shall dwell on
            high; his place of defense shall be the munitions of rocks; bread
            shall be given him, his water shall be sure.

            Precious promises to those, that flee from temptation, and desire to
            walk in the ways of God!

            Often—instead of being <i>quickened in the way</i>—I am fainting

            as I am—as I would be—<i>to Your fear.</i> If "the fear of the Lord
            is the beginning of wisdom"—a "treasure"—a "strong confidence" "a
            fountain of life"—how wise—how rich—how safe—how happy—is
            <i>he who "is devoted to"</i> it! "Blessed" indeed is he—with the
            favor of his God, the secret of His love, the teaching of His grace,
            and the mercy of His covenant. The promises of the Old Testament are
            generally connected with the fear of God, as in the New Testament
            they are linked with faith. But in truth, so identified are these
            two principles in their operation, that the faith, by which we
            apprehend the forgiveness of God, and the privileges of His kingdom,
            issues in a godly, reverential, filial fear. To be
            <i>devoted to this fear,</i> completes the character of
            <i>a servant of God</i>—the highest honor in the universe—the
            substantial joy of heaven itself. It is an obedience of choice, of
            reverence, and of love. "Joining himself to the Lord, to serve Him,
            and to love the name of the Lord—to be His servant." 'Yes, gracious
            Lord, I had rather be bound than loosed.' I only wish to be loosed
            from the bonds of sin, that I might be bound to You forever. My
            heart is treacherous; lay Your own bonds upon me. "O Lord, truly I
            am Your servant: You have loosed my bonds;" <i>I am</i>
            <i>"devoted to Your fear."</i>

            Is this my desire, my mind, my determination, my character? Then let
            me plead my title to an interest in the promises of the word—rich
            and free, "exceeding great and precious,"—all mine, "yes and amen in
            Christ Jesus;" let me plead, that every <i>word</i> may be
            <i>"established"</i> in my victory over sin, advancing knowledge of
            Christ, experience of His love, conformity to His image, and,
            finally, in my preservation in Him unto eternal life.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But how far <i>has</i> the fear of God operated with me as a
            safeguard from sin, and an habitual rule of conduct? David's
            confidence in the promises of God, far from lessening his jealousy
            over himself, only made him more <i>"devoted to the fear"</i> of
            God. And if my assurance be well grounded, it will ever be
            accompanied with holy fear; the influence will be known by "standing
            more in awe of God's word;" having a more steady abhorrence of sin,
            and a dread of "grieving the Holy Spirit of God." Thus this filial
            fear produces a holy confidence; while confidence serves to
            strengthen fear: and their mutual influence quickens devotedness to
            the work of the Lord.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            It is interesting to remark, that the Christian privilege of
            assurance is not confined to the New Testament dispensation. David's
            pleading to have the
            <i>"word of his God established unto him,"</i> was grounded upon the
            tried foundations of faith. And this direct act of faith, as it
            regards God in Christ, His engagements and His promises, cannot be
            too confident. The promises are made to the whole Church, that we
            might each look for our part and interest in them. God loves to have
            His own seal and hand-writing brought before Him. "Put Me in
            remembrance"—He says: "let us plead together." "He cannot deny
            Himself."
          </p>
          <p align="justify"> </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Very cheering is it to mark, how the Lord
            <i>establishes His word</i> in our own experience. Every day He is
            fulfilling some promise, and a word made good at one time encourages
            our confidence for another. The word performed in part is an earnest
            of the whole, assuring us of the time, when we shall acknowledge His
            faithfulness, "who performs <i>all things</i>

            for us." Thus, as the word is eternally <i>established</i> on the
            foundation of the Divine engagements, its certainty is sealed to our
            own conviction. Our confidence is established, that if He has spoken
            a word, He may be trusted for that word.

            There is a <i>reproach,</i> which we have no cause to
            <i> fear,</i> but rather to glory in. It is one of the chief
            privileges of the Gospel—the honorable badge of our profession. But
            it was the <i>"reproach"</i>

            of bringing dishonor upon the name of his God, that David
            <i>feared,</i> and deprecated with most anxious, importunate prayer.
            The fear of this <i> reproach</i> is a practical principle of tender
            watchfulness and circumspection, and of habitual dependence upon an
            Almighty upholding power. "Hold me up, and I shall be safe,"—will be
            the constant supplication of one, that fears the Lord, and fears
            himself. We do not, perhaps, sufficiently consider the active malice
            of the enemies of the gospel, "watching for our halting;" else
            should we be more careful to remove all occasions of
            <i> "reproach"</i> on account of inconsistency of temper or
            conversation. None, therefore, that feel their own weakness, the
            continual apprehension of danger, the tendency of their heart to
            backslide from God, and to disgrace "that worthy name by which they
            are called," will think this prayer unseasonable or unnecessary<i

            Perhaps also the conflicting Christian may find this a suitable
            prayer. Sometimes Satan has succeeded in beguiling him into some
            worldly compliance, or weakened his confidence, by tempting him to
            look to himself for some warrant of acceptance (in all which
            suggestions he is aided and abetted by his treacherous heart): and
            then will this "accuser of the brethren" turn back upon him, and
            change himself "into an angel of light," presenting before him a
            black catalogue of those very falls, into which he had successfully
            led him. Bunyan does not fail to enumerate these
            <i> "reproaches,"</i> as among the most harassing assaults of
            Apollyon. In his desperate conflict with Christian, he taunts him
            with his fall in the Slough of Despond, and every successive
            deviation from his path, as blotting out his warrant of present
            favor with the King, and blasting all hopes of reaching the
            celestial city. Christian does not attempt to conceal or palliate
            the charge. He knows it is all true, and much more besides! but he
            knows that this is true also, "Where sin abounded, grace has much
            more abounded." "The blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God cleanses
            from all sin." Believers! In the heat of your conflict remember the
            only effective covering. <i>"Above all,</i> taking the shield of
            faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of
            the wicked." Do you not hate the sins, with which you have been
            overtaken? Are you not earnestly longing for deliverance from their
            power? Then, even while the recollections of their guilt and
            defilement humble you before the Lord, take fresh hold of the
            gospel, and you shall "overcome by the blood of the Lamb." Victory
            must come from the cross. And the soul that is directing its eye
            there for pardon, strength, and consolation, may sigh out the prayer
            with acceptance<i>, "Turn away my reproach which I fear."</i>
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But how deeply is the guilt of apostasy or backsliding aggravated by
            the acknowledgment, which all are constrained to make<i

            >How affecting is the Lord's admonition with us!, "What iniquity

            I have not caused you to serve with an offering, nor wearied you
            with incense." No, surely we have nothing to complain of our Master,
            of His work, or of His wages: but much, very much, to complain of
            ourselves, of our unwatchfulness, neglect, backsliding; and to
            humble ourselves on account of the consequent reproach upon our
            profession.

            inconsistencies of profession, may, for the Church's sake, be
            <i>"turned away from us."</i>

            Meanwhile, "let us accept it as the punishment of our iniquity;"
            and, in the recollection of the
            <i>goodness of the Lord's judgments,</i> still venture to hope and
            look for the best things to come out of it from our gracious Lord.

            Behold! An appeal to the heart-searching God, "You know that I love"
            <i>Your precepts!</i> The heartfelt acknowledgment of their
            <i> goodness</i> naturally leads us to <i>long after them.</i> The
            professor <i> longs after</i> the promises, and too often builds a
            delusive—because an unsanctifying—hope upon them. The believer feels
            it to be his privilege and safety to have an equal regard to both—to
            obey <i>the precepts of God</i> in dependence on His promises, and
            to expect the accomplishment of the promises, in the way of
            obedience to <i>the precepts.</i> The utmost extent of the
            professor's service is the heavy yoke of <i>outward conformity.</i>

            He knows nothing of an
            <i>"inward delight and longing after them."</i> Of many of them his
            heart complains, "This is a hard saying: who can hear it?" The
            Christian can give a good reason for his delight even in the most
            difficult and painful <i>precepts.</i> The moments of deepest
            repentance are his times of sweetest "refreshing from the presence
            of the Lord." Whatever be the pleasure of indulgence in sin, far
            greater is the ultimate enjoyment arising out of the mortification
            of it. Most fruitful is our Savior's <i> precept,</i> which
            inculcates on His followers self-denial and the daily cross. For by
            this wholesome discipline we lose our own perverse will; the power
            of sin is restrained, the pride of the heart humbled; and our real
            happiness fixed upon a solid and permanent basis. So that, whatever
            dispensation some might desire for breaking the
            <i>precept</i> without forfeiting the promise, the Christian blesses
            God for the strictness, that binds him to a steady obedience to it.
            To him it is grievous, not to keep it, but to break it. A
            <i>longing</i> therefore <i>after the precepts, </i>

            marks the character of the child of God: and may be considered as
            the pulse of the soul. It forms our fitness and ripeness for
            heaven.  
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            There are indeed times, when the violence of temptation, or the
            paralyzing effect of indolence, hides the movements of the "hidden
            man of the heart." And yet even in these gloomy hours, when the
            mouth is shut, and the heart dumb, before God, "so troubled, that it
            cannot speak"—even then, acceptable incense is ascending before the
            throne of God. We have a powerful intercessor "helping our
            infirmities"—interpreting our desires, and crying from within, "with
            groanings that cannot be uttered;" yet such as, being indited by our
            Advocate within, and presented by our Advocate above, are cheering
            pledges of their fulfillment. "He will fulfill the desire of them
            that fear Him: He also will hear their cry, and will save them."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            These <i>longings</i> might seem to betoken a vigorous exercise of
            grace. But shall I be satisfied, while the most fervent desires are
            so disproportioned to their grand object—so overborne by the
            corruption of the flesh—and while a heartless state is so hateful to
            my Savior? Idle confessions and complaints are unseemly and
            unfruitful. Let me rather besiege the mercy-seat with incessant
            importunity—<i>'Quicken me in Your righteousness.' </i>'I plead
            <i>Your righteousness</i>—Your righteous promise for the reviving of
            my spiritual life. I long for more lively apprehensions of Your
            spotless <i>righteousness.</i> Oh! let it invigorate my delight, my
            obedience, my secret communion, my Christian walk and conversation.'
            Such <i>longings,</i> poured out before the Lord for a fresh supply
            of <i>quickening</i> grace, are far different from "the desire of
            the slothful, which kills him," and will not be forgotten before
            God. "Delight yourself in the Lord; and He shall give you the
            desires of your heart." O for a more enlarged expectation, and a
            more abundant vouchsafement of blessing; that we may burst forth and
            break out, as from a living fountain within, in more ardent
            <i>longings for the Lord's precepts!</i>
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            But it may be asked—What weariness in, and reluctance to duties, may
            consist with the principle and exercise of grace? Where it is only
            in the members, not in the mind—where it is only partial, not
            prevalent—where it is only occasional, not habitual—where it is
            lamented and resisted, and not allowed—and where, in spite of its
            influence, the Christian still holds on in the way of duty, "grace
            reigns" in the midst of conflict, and will ultimately and gloriously
            triumph over all hindrance and opposition. But in the midst of the
            humbling views of sin that present themselves on every side, let me
            diligently inquire—Have I an habitual "hungering and thirsting after
            <i>righteousness?"</i> And since, at the best, I do but get my
            longings increased, and not satisfied; let the full satisfaction of
            heaven be much in my heart. "As for me, I will behold Your face in
            righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your
            likeness."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And what an expectation is this to pretend lo! To think what the
            infinitely and eternally blessed God is—and what "man is at his best
            estate," then to conceive of man—the worm of the dust—the child of
            sin and wrath—transformed into the likeness of God—how weighty is
            the sound of this hope! What then must its substantiation be? If the
            initial privilege be glorious, what will the fullness be! Glory
            revealed to us! transfused through us! becoming our very being! To
            have the soul filled—not with evanescent shadows—but with massive,
            weighty, eternal glory! Worlds are mere empty bubbles, compared with
            this, our sure, satisfying, unfading inheritance.

            A prayer of deep anxiety—large desire—simple faith! It is a
            sinner—feeling his need of mercy—yes, <i>mercies</i>—abundant
            mercy—mercies for every moment—looking for them only in the
            <i>Lord's salvation</i>—to be dispensed
            <i>according to His word.</i> Out of Christ we know only a God, of
            justice and holiness. In Christ we behold "a just God, and yet a
            Savior;" and in "His <i>salvation</i> mercy and truth are met
            together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other." Therefore
            general notions of <i>mercy</i> without a distinct apprehension of
            <i>salvation</i>

            have their origin in presumption, not in warranted faith. For can
            there be any communication of mercy from an unknown God? Can there
            be any communion with an angry God? "Acquaint now yourself with Him,
            and be at peace; thereby good shall come to you<i
              >" "The Lord's mercies, even His salvation."</i
            >
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            Can we conceive the moment, when this prayer is not suited to us?
            How can we be at any moment safe or happy without the spirit of it?
            To walk as a saved sinner, "accepted in the Beloved," conformed to
            His image, devoted to His service, sealed for His kingdom—this is,
            or should be, the sunshine of every day. Let this prayer live in the
            heart. Carry continually to the Lord the cry for all
            <i>His mercies</i>—specially for that, which is the seal and crown
            of them all—His <i>salvation.</i>
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            This prayer, however, is peculiarly suitable to the believer,
            longing to realize that which sometimes is clouded to his view—his
            personal interest in the <i>Lord's salvation!</i> It must
            <i>come to me;</i>

            or I shall never come to it. I want not a general apprehension—I am
            not satisfied with the description of it.
            <i>Let it come to me—Let Your mercies </i>be applied, so that I can
            claim them, and rejoice in them! I see <i>Your salvation</i> come to
            others. Who needs it more than I? <i>Let it come also to me.</i>
            <i>"Look upon me, and be merciful to me,</i> as You do to those that
            love Your name.
            <i
              >Remember me, O Lord, with the favor that You bear to Your
              people;</i
            > O visit me with Your salvation; that I may see the felicity of
            Your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, that
            I may glory with Your inheritance."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Now, are we seeking the assurance of this <i>salvation?</i>

            Are we waiting to realize its present power, saving us from
            sin—Satan—the world—ourselves—and "blessing us with all spiritual
            blessings in Christ Jesus?" Should a trial of faith and patience be
            ordained for us, yet in the end we shall find an enriching store of
            experience from His wise dispensations. That He has kept us from
            turning our backs upon His ways, when we had no comfort in them;
            that He has upheld us with His secret supplies of strength—is not
            this the work of His own Spirit within, and the pledge of the
            completion of the work? That He has enabled us, against all
            discouragements, to "continue instant in prayer," is surely an
            answer to that prayer, which in our apprehensions of it, had been
            cast out. That in waiting upon Him, we have found no rest in worldly
            consolation, is an assurance, that the Lord Himself will be our
            soul-satisfying and eternal portion. And who is there now in the
            sensible enjoyment of His love, who does not bless that Divine
            wisdom, which took the same course with them that has been taken
            with us, to bring them to these joys? When did a weeping seed-time
            fail of bringing a joyful harvest?
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But let not the ground of faith be forgotten—<i
              >According to Your word</i
            >—that it shall come fully—freely—eternally—to him who waits for it.
            "You meet him that rejoices and works righteousness; those that
            remember You in Your ways." Many, indeed, are satisfied with far too
            low a standard of spiritual enjoyments. It is comfortless to live at
            a distance from our Father's house, when we might be dwelling in the
            secret of His presence, and rejoicing in the smiles of His love. But
            let us not charge this dishonorable state upon the sovereignty of
            the Divine dispensations. Let us rather trace it to its true
            source—lack of desire—lack of faith—lack of prayer—lack of
            diligence. What infinite need have we of heavenly influence! What
            gracious encouragement to seek it! The way was blocked up—mercy has
            cleared the path, opened our access, "The golden scepter is always
            held out." Earnest prayer will bring a sure answer. The blessing is
            unspeakable.
            <i>Let Your mercies—Your salvation, come to me, O Lord.</i>

            What is the salvation which he had just been speaking of? The whole
            gift of the mercy of God—redemption from sin, death, and
            hell—pardon, peace, and acceptance with a reconciled God—constant
            communication of spiritual blessings—all that God can give, or we
            can want; all that we are able to receive here, or heaven can
            perfect hereafter. Now if this <i>comes to us</i>—comes to our
            hearts—surely it will furnish us at all times with
            <i>an answer to him who reproaches us. </i>The world casts upon us
            the reproach of the cross. "What profit is there that we have walked
            mournfully before the Lord of Hosts?" What is there to
            counterbalance the relinquishment of pleasure, esteem, and worldly
            comfort? The mere professor can give no answer. He has heard of it,
            but it has never <i>come to Him.</i>

            The believer is ready with his <i>answer,</i> 'I have found in the
            <i>Lord's salvation</i> pardon and peace, "not as the world
            gives"—and such as the world cannot take away. Here, therefore, do I
            abide, finding it <i>my happiness</i> not to live without the cross,
            and testifying in the midst of abounding tribulation, that there are
            no comforts like Christ's comforts.' This was David's
            <i>answer, </i>when family trials were probably an occasion of
            <i>reproach.</i>
            <i
              >"Although my house be not so with God, yet He has made with me an
              everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure: for this is
              all my salvation and all my desire."</i

          <p align="justify">
            But there is a far heavier <i>reproach</i> than that of the
            world—when the grand accuser injects hard thoughts of God—when he
            throws our guilt and unworthiness—our helplessness and difficulties,
            in our face. And how severe is this exercise in a season of
            spiritual desertion! Except the believer can stay his soul upon "a
            God who hides Himself, as still the God of Israel, the Savior," he
            is unprepared with <i>an answer to him who reproaches him.</i> Such
            appears to have been Job's condition, and Heman's, not to speak of
            many of the Lord's most favored people, at different stages of their
            Christian life. Most important, therefore, is it for us to pray for
            a realizing sense of
            <i>the Lord's mercies—even of His salvation</i>—not only as
            necessary for our peace and comfort—but to garrison us against every
            assault, and to enable us to throw down the challenge<i
              >, "Rejoice not against me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall
              arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light to
              me."</i
            >
            Free grace has saved me—an unspotted righteousness covers me—an
            Almighty arm sustains me—eternal glory awaits me. Who shall condemn?
            "Who shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
            our Lord?"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Now, for this bold front to our enemies, nothing is wanted beyond
            the reach of the weakest child of God. No extraordinary holiness—no
            Christian establishment in experience—nothing but simple, humble
            faith—<i>For I trust in Your word.</i> Faith makes this salvation
            ours, in all its fullness and almighty power: and, therefore, our
            confidence<i> in the word</i> will make us "ready always to give an
            answer to everyone who asks us a reason of the hope that is in us,
            with meekness and fear." "No weapon that is formed against you shall
            prosper; and every tongue that rises against you in judgment, you
            shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord; and
            their righteousness is of Me, says the Lord."

            But how often is our Christian boldness paralyzed by our feeble
            apprehensions of <i>the salvation of God! </i>Clear and full
            evangelical views are indispensable for the effective exercise of
            our weighty obligations. Any indistinctness here, from its necessary
            mixture of self-righteousness and unbelief, obscures the warrant of
            our personal interest, and therefore hinders the firm grasp of
            Almighty strength. Coldness and formality also deaden the power of
            Christian boldness. Much need, therefore, have we to pray for a
            realized perception of the freeness, fullness, holiness, and
            privileges of the Gospel. Much need have we to use our speedy
            diligence, without delay; our painful diligence, without indulgence:
            our continual diligence, without weariness; that we be not satisfied
            with remaining on the skirts of the kingdom; that it be not a matter
            of doubt, whether we belong to it or not; but that, grace being
            added to grace, "so an entrance may be ministered to us abundantly,
            into" all its rich consolations and everlasting joys.

            For the sake of the church and of the world, no less than for our
            own sakes, let us "give diligence" to clear up our interest in the
            Gospel. The want of personal assurance is not only a loss in our own
            souls, but a hindrance to our Christian usefulness. Hence our
            efforts are often powerless in parrying off the attack of
            <i>him that reproaches us,</i> as well as to "strengthen the weak
            hands, and confirm the feeble knees" of our brethren. The charge of
            hypocrisy, or the want of the "constraining" principle of "the love
            of Christ," stops the utterance of the word of truth, and obscures
            our character as a "saint of God," and "a witness" for His name.
            Justly, indeed, might He punish our unfaithfulness, by forbidding us
            any more to speak in His name. And therefore the dread of this
            grievous judgment, and the mourning over precious lost
            opportunities, stirs up the prayer—<i
              >'Take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth</i
            >—Not only take it not <i>out of my heart;</i> but let it be ready
            in my <i>mouth</i>

            for the confession of my Master.'
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            This valuable prayer may preserve us from denying Christ. Too apt
            are we to allow worldly communion, habits, and conversation without
            a word of restraint. Let the whole weight of Christian
            responsibility be deeply felt—faith in the heart, and confession
            with the mouth—the active principle, and the practical exercise.
            Should we be content with the dormant principle, where would be the
            Church—the witness for God in the world? Shall we shrink from the
            bold confession of Him, who "despised the shame of the cross" for
            us? Would not this imply distrust of our own testimony—<i
              >the word of truth?</i
            >
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            It does indeed need wisdom to know when, as well as what, to speak.
            There is "a time to keep silence," and "the prudent shall keep
            silence in that time." But is it our cross to be "dumb with
            silence?" And when we "hold our peace, even from good," is our
            "sorrow stirred—our hearts hot within us—the fire burning"? No—is
            not the plea of bashfulness or judicious caution often a
            self-deluding cover for the <i>real</i> cause of restraint—the lack
            of the personal apprehension of the Lord's mercy? "I believed, and
            therefore have I spoken." Oh! let not the word of truth be taken
            <i>utterly</i> out of our mouth. A stammering confession is better
            than silence. If we cannot say all we want of, or for our Savior,
            let us say what we can. 'God's servants are very sensible of the
            infinite value of the least atom of what belongs to Him.' And a word
            spoken in weakness may be a word of Almighty power, and a present
            help to some fainting spirit. In our connection with the world, many
            occasions will unexpectedly occur, if the heart be but wakeful and
            active to improve them. The common topics of earthly conversation
            often furnish a channel for heavenly communion, so that our
            communications with the world may be like Jacob's ladder, whose
            bottom rested upon the earth, but the top reached unto the heavens.
            And oh! what a relief is it to the burdened conscience, to stammer
            out, if it be but a few words for God, even though there be no
            sensible refreshings of His presence! Yet if we would speak for Him
            with power and acceptance, it must be out of the "good treasure and
            abundance of the heart." For it is only when "the heart is inditing
            a good matter, speaking of the things touching the King, that the
            tongue is as the pen of a ready writer."

              But let us take up this petition as the expression of the
            Christian's exercises with his God. 'That word
            <i>utterly'</i>—observes an eminently-tried believer—'though it
            seems to be beneath the notice of the mind, when one has got very
            low, is in reality one of the most blessed words in this most
            blessed book. How often, when I have formerly been upon the brink of
            giving up all for lost, and of saying, "Evil, be my good"—the
            thought has perhaps struck me, that, while I am struggling between
            despondency and rebellion, and too hard, too cold, too discouraged
            to look up to Him, the blessed Redeemer is pitying the struggle of
            my soul; and it has kept me where I was, led me to put off despair
            at least until tomorrow; and then before tomorrow I have seen
            something of the grace and glory of the Gospel.'
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            What then is the advice, which this man of God gives from his own
            experience? 'When you are most deeply deploring your sins, never
            fail to thank the Lord, or at least to think how you would thank
            Him, if you dared lift up a face overwhelmed with shame and defeat,
            that He has not taken away His truth UTTERLY; that He has left you
            clinging to some twig of hope, instead of leaving you to end—what
            thousands who look outwardly very calm—have found—the depth of the
            precipice of despair.' (Nottidge)

            The Psalmist's prayer here is the same confidence of faith, that was

              >For I have hoped in Your judgments,</i
            >
            an acceptable spirit of approach to God, and an earnest of the
            revival of life and comfort in the Lord's best time and way.

            The heaping up of so many words in this short verse, appears to be
            the struggle of the soul to express the vehemency of its longings to
            glorify its Savior. And, indeed, the Lord's return to us, unsealing
            the lips of the dumb, and putting
            <i>His word again into their mouth,</i> brings with it a fresh sense
            of constraining obligation. This fresh occupation in His praise and
            service is not only our present privilege, but an foretaste of our
            heavenly employment, when the word will never more
            <i>be taken out of our mouth,</i> but we shall "talk of His wondrous
            works"<i> "forever and ever."</i> The defects in the constancy and
            extent of our obedience (as far as our hearts are alive to the honor
            of God) must ever be our grief and burden; and the prospect of its
            completeness in a better world, is that, which renders the
            anticipation of heaven so delightful. There we shall be blessed with
            suitable feelings, and therefore be enabled to render suitable
            obedience—even one unbroken consecration of all our powers to His
            work. Then
            <i>"shall we keep His law continually forever and ever."</i> Once
            admitted to the "throne of God," we "shall serve Him day and night
            in His temple"—without sin—without inconstancy—without
            weariness—without end! We speak of heaven; but oh! to be there! To
            be engaged throughout eternity in the service of love to a God of
            love! In one day's continuance in the path of obedience even here,
            in the midst of the defilement which stains our holiest services,
            how sweetly do the moments roll away! But to be ever employed for
            Him, in that place, where "there shall in no wise enter anything
            that defiles"—this gives an emphasis and a dignity to the heavenly
            joy, which may well stamp it as "unspeakable and full of glory." May
            we not then encourage the hope, that the Lord is making us meet for
            heaven, by the strength and constancy of our desires
            <i>to keep the laws of God?</i> And is it not evident, that heaven
            itself can afford no real delight to one, who feels the service of
            God on earth to be irksome? He stands self-excluded by the
            constitution of his nature, by the necessity of the case. He has no
            heart for heaven, no taste for heaven, no capacity for enjoyment of
            heaven, "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he who is
            filthy, let him be filthy still; and he who is righteous, let him be
            righteous still; and he who is holy, let him be holy still."

          <p align="justify">
            Heavenly, gracious Father! who and what are we, that our hearts
            should be made the unworthy recipients of Your grace? that our will
            should be subdued into "the obedience of faith?" and that we should
            be permitted to anticipate that blessed period, when we
            <i>shall "keep Your law continually, forever and ever?" </i>May this
            prospect realize the happiness of our present obedience! May He, who
            has "bought us with a price" for His glory, reign in our hearts, and
            live upon our lips; that each of us may have His mark upon our
            foreheads—the seal of His property in us, and of our obligation to
            Him, "Whose I am, and whom I serve!"

            Not only perseverance but <i>liberty,</i> is the fruit of the Lord's
            mercy to our souls—not the liberty of sin—to do what we please—but
            of holiness—to do what we ought; the one, the iron bondage of our
            own will; the other, the easy yoke of a God of love. It was a fine
            expression of a heathen, "To serve God is to reign." Certainly in
            this service David found the liberty of a king.
            <i>The precepts of God</i> were not forced upon him; for he
            <i>sought them.</i> "More to be desired than gold, yes, than much
            fine gold; sweeter also than honey, and the honey-comb." The way of
            the Lord, which to the ungodly is beset with thorns and briers, is
            the king's highway of <i>liberty.</i> The child of God walks here in
            the gladness of his heart and the rejoicing of his conscience. Even
            in <i>"seeking these precepts,"</i> there is <i>"liberty"</i> and
            enlargement of heart; a natural motion, like that of the sun in its
            course, "going forth as a bridegroom, and rejoicing as a strong man
            to run a race." What must it be then, to walk in the full enjoyment
            of <i>the precepts!</i>

            "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." "They shall
            sing in the ways of the Lord,"—for "how great is His goodness; how
            great is His beauty!"   
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Are we then obeying <i>the precepts</i> as our duty, or

            <i>"seeking"</i> them as our privilege? Do we complain of the
            strictness of the law, or of the corruption of the flesh? Are the
            <i>precepts</i> of our own hearts our burden? Is sin or holiness our
            bondage? The only way to make religion easy, is to be always in it.
            The glow of spiritual activity, and the healthfulness of Christian
            <i>liberty,</i> are only to be found in the persevering and
            self-denying pursuit of every track of the ways of God, "If you
            continue in My word, then are you My disciples indeed: and you shall
            know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. If the Son,
            therefore, shall make you free, you shall be free indeed." To have
            the whole stream of all our thoughts, actions, motives, desires,
            affections, carried in one undivided current towards God, is the
            complete and unrestrained influence of His love upon our hearts.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Let but our eyes be opened, our judgments clearly exercised, our
            consciences suffered to speak; and this point is clear—Sin is
            slavery—Holiness is liberty. The sinner may live in bonds with as
            much delight as if he was in his element. He may seem even to
            himself to be at large, while in fact he is "shut up, and cannot
            come forth." For such is the tyranny under which he is bound, that
            he cannot help himself; and (to use the confession of a heathen)
            while 'he sees and approves better things, he follows the worse.'
            Every sin is a fresh chain of bondage, under the check of a cruel
            master. On the other hand—the Lord's commands—as He Himself
            declares, and all His servants testify—are "for our good always."
            His 'service is perfect freedom.' (Liturgy.) The life of liberty is
            to be under the bonds of holy love and duty. Let the trial be made
            of two Masters; conviction must follow.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            True it is, that the corrupt and rebellious inclinations will "lust"
            to the end. But as long as indulgence is denied, conflict excited,
            and the constant endeavor maintained to "bring every thought into
            captivity to the obedience of Christ," our liberty is established,
            even where it is not always enjoyed. Every fresh chain, by which we
            bind ourselves to the Lord, makes us more free. While, then, those
            who "promise us liberty are themselves the servants of corruption,"
            let us live as the children of God—the heirs of the
            kingdom—grateful—free—blood-bought souls—remembering the infinite
            cost at which our liberty was purchased, and the moment of extreme
            peril when we were saved. When the flesh was weak, and the "law weak
            through the flesh," and no resolution of ours could break us from
            the yoke of sin—then it was that "Christ both died, and rose, and
            revived, that He might be the Lord both of the dead and living,"
            "delivering us from the hand of our enemies, that we might serve Him
            without fear." And then indeed do we <i>"walk at liberty," </i>when
            we "break the bands" of all other lords "asunder," and consecrate
            ourselves entirely to His precepts.

          before the Babylonish monarch. Mark the difference of the spirit
          displayed by the Apostles, and especially by Peter, before and after
          the day of Pentecost. Look at Stephen before the council, and Paul
          before Felix, Festus, and Agrippa. "God had not given to them the
          spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind." Hear
          the great Apostle testifying of himself, "I am ready to preach the
          gospel to you that are at Rome also"—at the metropolis of the world,
          in the face of all opposition and contempt, and at the imminent hazard
          of my life<i>, "For"</i>—says he<i
            >, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."</i
          >
          In the same determination of soul, he exhorts his dear son in the
          faith<i>, "Be not ashamed </i>of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me
          His prisoner." To how many does "the fear of man bring a snare?" Many
          a good soldier has faced the cannon's mouth with undaunted front, and
          yet shrunk away with a coward's heart from the reproach of the cross,
          and been put to blush even by the mention of the Savior's name. Far
          better—the Son of Man "strengthening you"—to brave the fiery furnace,
          or the den of lions in His service, than like Jonah, by flinching from
          the cross, to incur the sting of conscience and the frown of God.

            Professing Christians! Are we ready to bear our testimony for Jesus,
            against the sneer and ridicule of the ungodly? We are not likely to
            "be brought before kings and rulers for the Son of Man's sake." Yet
            no less do we need Divine help and strong faith in withstanding the
            enmity of a prejudiced relative or scornful neighbor. Young people!
            you are perhaps in especial danger of being ashamed of your Bible,
            your religion, your Savior. You may be brought under the snare of
            the "fear of man," and be tempted to compromise your religion, and
            to sacrifice your everlasting all from a dread of "the reproach of
            Christ." But remember Him, who for your sake "before Pontius Pilate
            witnessed a good confession;" and shall the dread of a name restrain
            you from sharing His reproach, and banish the obligations of love
            and gratitude from your hearts? Have you forgotten, that you once
            owned the service of Satan? and will you not be as bold for Christ,
            as you were for him? Were you once "glorying in your shame;" and
            will you now be ashamed of your glory? Oh! remember who has said,
            "Whoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words, in this adulterous
            and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed,
            when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels."
            Think much and often of this word. Think on this day. Think on the
            station of "the fearful and unbelieving" on the left hand on that
            day. Think on their eternal doom. What is a prison, compared to
            hell? What need to pray and tremble! If you are sincere in your
            determination, and simple in your dependence, then will the "love of
            Christ constrain you," not to a cold, calculating, reluctant
            service; but to a confession of your Savior, bold, unfettered, and
            "faithful even unto death." Every deviation from the straight path
            bears the character of being <i>ashamed</i> of Christ. How much have
            you to speak in behalf of <i>His testimonies,</i> His ways, His
            love! When in danger of the influence of "the fear of man," look to
            Him for strength. He will give to you, as He gave to Stephen, "a
            mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to
            gainsay or resist." Thus will you, like them, be strengthened "to
            profess a good profession before many witnesses."

            It is but poor comfort to the believer to be able to talk well to
            others upon the ways of God, and even to "bear the reproach" of His
            people, when his own heart is cold, insensible, and dull. But why
            does he not rouse himself to the active exercise of faith<i
              >, "I will delight</i
            >

            myself in Your commandments?" That which is the burden of the carnal
            heart is the delight of the renewed soul. The former "is enmity
            against God: and therefore is not, and cannot be, subject to His
            law." The latter can <i> delight</i> in nothing else. If the gospel
            separates the heart from <i> sinful</i> delights, it is only to make
            room for delights of a more elevated, satisfying, and enduring
            nature. Satan, indeed, generally baits his temptations with that
            seductive witchery, which the world calls pleasure. But has he
            engrossed all pleasure into his service? Are there no pleasures
            besides "the pleasures of sin?" Do the ways of the Lord promise
            nothing but difficulty and trial? What means then the experience of
            him, who could "rejoice in them, as much as in all riches," and who
            "loved them above gold, yes, above fine gold?" The "fatted calf" of
            our Father's house is surely a most gainful exchange for "the husks"
            of the "far country." The delights of holiness go deeper than
            sensual pleasures. The joy of the saint is not that false, polluted,
            deadly joy, which is all that the worldling knows, and all that he
            has to look for: but it flows spontaneously from the fountain of
            living waters, through the pure channel of "the word of God, which
            lives and abides forever." No, so independent is it of any earthly
            spring, that it never flourishes more than in the desolate
            wilderness, or the sick-bed solitude; so that, "although the
            fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines, yet
            we will rejoice in the Lord, we will joy in the God of our
            salvation." Men of the world see what religion takes away, but they
            see little of what it gives; else would they reproach—not our
            folly—but their own blindness. "Thus says the Lord God, Behold, My
            servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, My servants
            shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, My servants shall
            rejoice, but you shall be ashamed; behold, My servants shall sing
            for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall
            howl for vexation of spirit."  The love and delight of the soul
            first fixes on <i>the commandments.</i> Then how natural is the flow
            of <i>delight in them!</i>

            even at the very time that we are "abhorring ourselves in dust and
            ashes" for our neglect of them; and God never has our hearts, until
            something of this delight is felt and enjoyed. But do we complain of
            the dullness of our hearts, that restrains this pleasure? Let us
            seek for a deeper impression of redeeming love. This will be the
            spring of grateful obedience and holy delight. Let us turn our
            complaints into prayers, and the Lord will quickly turn them into
            praises. Let us watch against everything, that would intercept our
            communion with Jesus. Distance from Him must be accompanied with
            poverty of spiritual enjoyment.<i

            David seems at a loss for expressions adequately to set forth the
            fervency of his love and delight in the ways and word of God. Here
            we find him <i>lifting up his hands </i>with the gesture of one, who
            is longing to embrace the object of his desire with both hands and
            his whole heart. Perhaps also in
            <i>lifting up his hands unto the commandments,</i> he might mean to
            express his looking upward for assistance to keep them, and to live
            in them. But how humbling this comparison with ourselves! Alas! how
            often from the neglect of this influence of the Spirit of God, do
            our "hands hang down," instead of being <i>lifted up,</i> in these
            holy ways! We are too often content with a scanty measure of love:
            without any sensible "hungering and thirsting after righteousness;"
            neither able to pray with life and power, nor to hear with comfort
            and profit, nor to "do good and communicate" with cheerfulness, nor
            to meditate with spiritual delight, nor to live for God with zeal
            and interest, nor to anticipate the endurance of the cross with
            unflinching resolution—the soul being equally disabled for heavenly
            communion and active devotedness. Shall we look for ease under the
            power of this deadening malady? Let us rather struggle and cry for
            deliverance from it. Let us subscribe ourselves before God as
            wretched, helpless, and guilty. He can look upon us, and revive us.
            Let us then "take hold upon His covenant," and plead that He will
            look upon us. Let us "put Him in remembrance" of the glory of His
            name, which is much more concerned in delivering us out of this
            frame, by His quickening grace, than in leaving us, stupid, corrupt,
            and carnal in it. Professor! awake: or beg of the Lord to awaken
            you! For if your cold sleeping heart is contented with the prospect
            of a heaven hereafter, without seeking for a present foretaste of
            its joy, it may be a very questionable matter whether heaven will
            ever be yours.

            It is in holy meditation on the word of God, that all the graces of
            the Spirit are manifested. What is the principle of faith, but the
            reliance of the soul upon the promises of the word? What is the
            sensation of godly fear, but the soul trembling before the
            threatenings of God? What is the object of hope, but the apprehended
            glory of God? What is the excitement of desire or love, but longing,
            endearing contemplations of the Savior, and of His unspeakable
            blessings? Hence we can scarcely conceive of the influence of grace
            separated from spiritual meditation on the word. It is this which,
            under Divine teaching, draws out its hidden contents, and exhibits
            them to the soul, as the objects upon which the principles and
            affections of the Divine life are habitually exercised. Not that any
            benefit can be expected from meditation, even upon the word of God,
            as an abstract duty. If not deeply imbued with prayer, it will
            degenerate into dry speculative study. Without some distinct
            practical application, it will be unedifying in itself, and
            unsatisfactory for its important ends—the discerning of the mind of
            God, and feeding upon the rich provision of the Gospel.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Why then is the Bible read only—not <i>meditated</i> on? Because it
            is not <i>loved.</i> We do not go to it, as the hungry man to his
            food, as the miser to his treasure. The loss is incalculable. Our
            superficial knowledge has no practical influence. It is only as we
            "search," that we "know it for our good."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Let it then be a matter of daily inquiry. Does my reading of the
            word of God furnish food for my soul, matter for prayer, direction
            for conduct? Scriptural study, when entered upon in a prayerful
            spirit, will never, like many other studies, be unproductive. The
            mind that is engaged in it, is fitly set for bearing fruit; it will
            "bring forth fruit in due season." Meditation kindles love, as it is
            the effect of love, "While I was musing, the fire burned." "Whoever
            looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues in it, this man
            is blessed in his deed." But let us take heed, that the root of
            religion in the soul is not cankered by the indulgence of secret
            sin. The largest supply of Christian ordinances will fail to refresh
            us, except the heart be kept right with God in simplicity of faith,
            love, and diligence in the service of Christ.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Come then, Christian, let us set our hearts to a vigorous,
            delighting devotedness to <i>the statutes of our God.</i> "It is not
            a vain thing for us; because it is our life." But to regard
            <i>some</i>

            of the words only would be to obey our own will, not God's. Let us
            <i>lift up our hands to them all.</i> How shadowy is the joy of
            speculative contemplation, if it does not draw the heart to
            practical exercise! Let faith return our obligations in the full
            apprehension of the Lord's mercy. And then will love constrain us to
            nothing less than "a living sacrifice" to His service. If the
            professor sleeps in notional godliness, let us employ our active
            <i>meditation</i> in searching for the mine that lies not on the
            surface, but which never fails to enrich diligent, patient,
            persevering labor.

            What is faith? It is <em>hope upon God's word.</em> The warrant of
            faith is therefore <em>the word.</em> The object of faith is He who
            <em>causes us to hope.</em> He has not forgotten—He cannot forget,
            His

            <em>word</em>. But He permits—no, commands <em>His servants</em> to
            remind Him of it in order to exercise their faith, diligence, and
            patience. Often, indeed, <em>"hope</em> deferred makes the heart
            sick." But it is not needless delay—not ignorance of the fittest
            time—not forgetfulness—not changeableness—not weakness. Meanwhile,
            however, constantly plead the promise—<em
              >Remember the word unto Your servant.</em
            >
            This is the proper use of the promises, as "arguments with which to
            fill our mouths, when we order our cause before God." When thus
            pleaded with the earnestness and humility of faith, they will be
            found to be the blessed realities of unchanging love.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Now—have not circumstances of Providence, or the distinct
            application of the Spirit, made some words of God especially
            precious to your soul? Such words are thus made your own, to be laid
            up against some future time of trial, when you may "put your God in
            remembrance" of them. Apply this exercise of faith to such a word as
            this, "Him who comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out." Then plead
            your interest in it as a coming sinner, "Lord,
            <em>I hope in this Your word."</em>
            <em>"You have caused me to hope"</em> in it.
            <em>"Remember this word unto Your servant."</em> Thus is prayer
            grounded upon the promise, which it forms into a prevailing
            argument, and sends back to heaven; nothing doubting, but that it
            will be verified in God's best time and way.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Take another case; God has engaged Himself to be the God of the seed
            of believers. His sacramental ordinance is the seal of this promise.
            The believer brings his child to this ordinance, as the exercise of
            his faith upon the faithfulness of God. Let him daily put his finger
            upon this promise,
            <em
              >Remember the word unto Your servant, upon which You have caused
              me to hope.</em
            >
            This is, as Augustine said of his mother, 'bringing before God His
            own handwriting.' Will He not <i>remember His word?</i> Faith may be
            tried, perhaps long tried. "But He abides faithful. He cannot deny
            Himself." Faith trusts—not what the eye sees, but what the word
            promises.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Again—Have we ever found <em>God's word hoped on,</em> a covering
            and strength against besetting sin? This will surely be an
            encouragement to cry under the same temptation—<em
              >Remember Your word.</em
            >

            "He who has delivered, does deliver, and will even to the end
            deliver." He "has done great things for us." And is not this an
            earnest of continued mercy?
            <em>"Because You have been my help,</em> therefore under the shadow
            of Your wings will I rejoice." Thus may we confidently receive a
            promise as the distinct message to our soul, when we are conscious
            of a readiness to receive the whole word as the rule of our life.
            And does it not set an edge upon prayer,
            <em>to eye a promising God,</em> and to consider His promises—not as
            hanging in the air, without any definite direction or meaning, but
            as individually spoken and belonging to myself as a child and

            <em>servant of God?</em> This is the experience and comfort of the
            life of faith. This unfolds the true secret of living to God; ending
            at last with the honorable death-bed testimony, "Behold, this day I
            am going the way of all the earth: and you know in all your hearts
            and in all your souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good
            things, which the Lord your God spoke concerning you; all have come
            to pass to you; and not one thing has failed thereof."

            David was encouraged to plead <em>the word</em> of promise in
            prayer, from the recollection of its
            <em>comfort in his affliction.</em> For the man of God is not
            exempted from affliction, but he is comforted in it with God's
            comforts, flowing from the fountain-head. And truly no comforts are
            like God's comforts, and there are none beside His. They are indeed
            strong consolations, both in their foundation and their influence;
            supporting—not only in the prospect, but under the actual pressure
            of trouble, and fully proportioned to the need of the most sinking
            calamity. Never therefore are we left unsupported in such a time, or
            called to drink a cup of unmingled tribulation. In the moments of
            our bitterest sorrow, how are we compelled to stand amazed at the
            tenderness, which is daily and hourly exercised towards us! We have
            always some word exactly suited to our affliction, and which we
            could not have understood without it; and "a word"
            <em>thus "spoken</em> in due season, how good is it!" One word of
            God, sealed to the heart, infuses more sensible relief, than ten
            thousand words of man. When therefore <em>the word </em>assures of
            the presence of God in <em>affliction</em><i>;</i> of His continued
            pity and sympathy in His most severe dispensations; and of their
            certain issue to our everlasting good; must not we say of it,
            <em>This is our comfort in our affliction?</em>

            How does the Savior's love stream forth from this channel on every
            side; imparting life, refreshment, strength to those, who but for
            this <em>comfort</em>

            would have "fainted," and "perished in their affliction!" This
            indeed was the end, for which the Scriptures were written; and such
            power of consolation have they sometimes administered to the
            afflicted saint, that tribulation has almost ceased to be a trial,
            and the retrospect has been the source of thankful recollection.

            But first the word becomes life—then <em>comfort.</em>

            And <em>those only,</em> who have felt the
            <em>quickening power of the word, </em>can realize its consolations.
            Be thankful, then, Reader, if, when dead in sins, it
            <em>"quickened you;"</em> and, when sunk in trouble, once and again
            it has revived you. Yet do not think, that it is any innate power of
            its own, that works so graciously for you. No. The exhibition of the
            Savior is the spring of life and consolation. It is because it
            "testifies of Him," "the consolation of Israel" "afflicted in all
            our afflictions"—and never failing to uphold with "grace sufficient
            for us." It is not, however, the word without the Spirit, nor the
            Spirit generally without the word; but the Spirit by the word—first
            putting life into the word, and then by the word quickening the
            soul. The word then is only the instrument. The Spirit is the
            Almighty agent. Thus the work is the Lord's; and nothing is left for
            us, but self-renunciation and praise.
