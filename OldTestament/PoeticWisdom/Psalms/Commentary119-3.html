           <br />

          The scorn of an ungodly world is one of the afflictions, which realize
          to us the comfort of the word. And this is a trial, from which no
          exemption is to be expected, "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus
          shall suffer persecution." Not even David—though a king—a man of
          wisdom and prudence, and therefore not likely to give unnecessary
          offence; and whose character and rank might be expected to command
          respect—not even was he shielded from the derision of the proud on
          account of the profession and service of his God. Thus it ever was and
          ever will be. Faith in the doctrine of Christ, and conformity to the
          strict commandments of the gospel, must expose us to the taunts of the
          unbeliever and the worldling. Yet, where the heart is right with God,
          the derision of the proud, instead of forcing us to decline from the
          law of God, will strengthen our adherence to it. David answered the
          bitter derision of Michal with a stronger resolution to abide by his
          God, "I will yet be more vile than thus." He counted it his glory, his
          duty, his joy. None, however, but a believer knows what it is to bear
          this cross: and none but a real believer can bear it. It is one of the
          touchstones of sincerity, the application of which has often been the
          means of "separating the precious from the vile," and has unmasked the
          self-confident professor to his own confusion. Oh! how many make a
          fair profession, and appear "good soldiers of Jesus Christ," until the
          hour of danger proves them deserters, and they reap only the fruits of
          their self-confidence in their own confusion!<br />

           <br />

          It is, therefore, of great importance to those who are just setting
          out in the warfare, to be well armed with the word of God. It kept
          David steadfast amid the derision of the proud; and it will keep young
          Christians from being frightened or overcome by the sneer of an
          ungodly world. But that it may "dwell in us richly in all wisdom," and
          be suited to our own case, it will be well, under circumstances of
          reproach, to acquaint ourselves with the supporting promises and
          encouragements to suffer for righteousness' sake. Above all, the
          contemplation of the great sufferer Himself—meeting this poignant
          trial in meekness, compassion, and prayer—will exhibit "a refuge from
          the storm, and a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible
          ones is as the storm against the wall." The mere professor knows not
          this refuge; he possesses not this armor; so that when "affliction or
          persecution arises for the word's sake, immediately he is
          offended."<br />

           <br />

          Christian! be satisfied with the approbation of your God. Has He not
          adopted you into His family, stamped you with His image, assured you
          by His Spirit, sealed you for His kingdom? And is not this "honor that
          comes from God only" enough—far more than enough—to counterbalance the
          derision of the proud? Think of the day, when "the rebuke of the
          people shall be taken away from off all the earth," when "he will
          confess their name before His Father, and before His angels," when
          "the saints shall judge the world," when "the upright shall have
          dominion over them in the morning." Can we be Christians, if this sure
          prospect does not infinitely more than compensate for all "the hard
          speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken against us?"<br />

           <br />

          Thus—blessed be God—the weapons of our warfare are drawn from the
          Divine armory; and therefore depending on the grace, and following the
          example, of Jesus, we suffer, as the way to victory—the road to an
          everlasting crown.<br />

              52. I remembered Your judgments of old, O Lord; and have comforted
              myself.</b

          The Lord's dealings with His people were a frequent subject of
          meditation to the Psalmist, and now were they his present support
          under "the scourge of the tongue." Evidently they are put upon record
          for the encouragement of future generations. We are ready to imagine
          something peculiar in our own case, and to "think it strange
          concerning the fiery trial which is to try us, as though some strange
          thing happened unto us." But when we remember the Lord's judgments of
          old, with His people, we comfort ourselves in the assurance, that "the
          same afflictions are accomplished in our brethren, that have been in
          the world;" and that "as the sufferings of Christ have abounded in
          them, so their consolation also abounded by Christ." They also
          encountered the same derision of the proud, and always experienced the
          same support from the faithfulness of their God. We do not
          sufficiently consider the mercy and gracious wisdom of God, in
          occupying so much of His written word with the records of His
          judgments of old. One class will pay a prominent attention to the
          preceptive, another to the doctrinal, parts of revelation—each
          forgetting that the historical records comprise a full and striking
          illustration of both, and have always proved most supporting grounds
          of consolation to the Lord's people. The important design in casting
          so large a portion of the small volume of Revelation into an
          historical form, is every way worthy of its author. "Whatever things
          were written before, were written for our learning; that we through
          patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope;" and how
          admirably adapted the means are to the end, the diligent student in
          the Scripture field will bear ample witness. Willfully, therefore, to
          neglect the historical portion of the sacred volume, from the idea of
          confining our attention to what we deem the more spiritual parts of
          scripture—would show a sad deficiency of spiritual apprehension, and
          deprive ourselves of the most valuable instruction, and most abundant
          comfort. This neglect would exclude us from one eminent means of
          increasing "patience," in the example of those "who through faith and
          patience inherit the promises;" of receiving "comfort," in the
          experience of the faithfulness of God manifested in every age to His
          people: and of enlivening our "hope," in marking the happy issue of
          the "patience of the saints," and the heavenly support administered
          unto them. So far, therefore, are we from being little interested in
          the Scriptural records of past ages, that it is evident that the
          sacred historians, as well as the prophets, "ministered not unto
          themselves, but unto us the things which are now reported."<br />

           <br />

          Let us select one or two instances as illustrative of this subject.
          Why were the records of the deluge, and of the overthrow of the cities
          of the plain, preserved, but as exhibitions to the church, that "the
          Lord"—the Savior of Noah, the eighth person, and the deliverer of just
          Lot, "knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to
          reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished?" What a
          source of comfort then to the tempted people of God is the remembrance
          of these judgments of old! Take again the wonderful history of the
          overthrow of the Egyptians, and the consequent deliverance of God's
          ancient people. How often does the church recollect this interposition
          as a ground of assurance, that under similar circumstances of trial,
          the same illustrious displays of Divine faithfulness and love may be
          confidently expected! She looks back upon what the "arm of the Lord
          has done in ancient days, and in the generation of old," as the
          pattern of what He ever would be, and ever would do, for His purchased
          people. Thus also God Himself recalls to our mind this overthrow and
          deliverance as a ground of present encouragement and support,
          "According to the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt will I
          show unto him marvelous things"—and the Church echoes back this
          remembrance in the expression of her faith, gratitude, and expectation
          for spiritual blessings: "He will subdue our iniquities, and You will
          cast all their sins into the depths of the sea." Such is the
          interesting use that may be made of the historical parts of Scripture!
          Such is the comfort to be derived from the remembrance of the Lord's
          judgments of old! And is not the recollection of His judgments of old
          with ourselves, productive of the same support? Does not the
          retrospect of His dealings with our own souls serve to convince us,
          that "all His paths are mercy and truth?" The assurance is therefore
          warranted alike by experience and by Scripture, "We know that all
          things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
          the called according to His purpose."<br />

              53. Horror has taken hold upon me, because of the wicked that
              forsake Your law.</font
            ></b
          ><br />

            <br />

          The remembrance of the Lord's judgments of old, while it brings
          comfort to His people as regards themselves, stirs up a poignancy of
          compassionate feeling for the ungodly. And indeed to a feeling and
          reflecting mind, the condition of the world must excite commiseration
          and concern! A "whole world lying in wickedness!" lying therefore in
          ruins! the image of God effaced! the presence of God departed! Horror
          has taken hold of me! to see the law of Him, who gave being to the
          world, so utterly forsaken! so much light and love shining from heaven
          in vain! The earthly heart cannot endure that any restraint should be
          imposed; much less that any constraint, even of love, should be
          employed to change its bias, and turn it back to its God. Are you then
          a believer? then you will be most tender of the honor of the law of
          God. Every stroke at His law you will feel as a stroke at your own
          heart. Are you a believer? then will you consider every man as your
          brother; and weep to see so many of them around you, crowding the
          broad road to destruction, and perishing as the miserable victims of
          their own deceivings. The prospect on every side is, as if God were
          cast down from His throne, and the creatures of His hand were
          murdering their own souls.<br />

           <br />

          But how invariably does a languor respecting our own eternal interest
          affect the tenderness of our regard for the honor of our God; so that
          we can look at the wicked that forsake God's law, with comparative
          indifference! Awful indeed is the thought, that it ever can be with us
          a small matter, that multitudes are sinking! going down into
          perdition! with the name of Christ—under the seal of baptism—partakers
          of the means of gospel grace—yet perishing! Not, indeed, that we are
          to yield to such a feeling of horror, as would paralyze all exertion
          on their behalf. For do we owe them no duty—no prayer—no labor? Shall
          we look upon souls hurrying on with such dreadful haste to
          unutterable, everlasting torments; and permit them to rush on blinded,
          unawakened, unalarmed! If there is a horror to see a brand apparently
          fitting for the fire, will there not be a wrestling endeavor to pluck
          that brand out of the fire? Have we quite forgotten in our own case
          the fearful terrors of an unconverted state—the Almighty power of
          wrath and justice armed against us—the thunder of that voice,
          "Vengeance belongs to Me, I will recompense, says the Lord?" Oh! if
          the love of the Savior and the love of souls were reigning with more
          mighty influence in our hearts, how much more devoted should we be in
          our little spheres of labor! how much more enlarged in our
          supplications, until all the kingdom of Satan were subject to the
          obedience of the Son of God, and conquered by the force of His
          omnipotent love!<br />

           <br />

          But if the spirit of David, renewed but in part, was thus filled with
          horror in the contemplation of the wicked, what must have been the
          affliction—what the intensity of His sufferings, "who was holy,
          harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners"—yes, "of purer eyes than
          to behold iniquity"—during thirty-three years of continued contact
          with a world of sin! What shall we say of the condescension of His
          love, in wearing "the likeness of sinful flesh"—dwelling among
          sinners—yes, "receiving sinners, and eating with them!"<br />

           <br />

          Blessed Spirit! impart to us more of "the mind that was in Christ
          Jesus," that the law of God may be increasingly precious in our eyes,
          and that we may be "exceedingly jealous for the Lord God of Hosts!"
          Help us by Your gracious influence to plead with sinners for God, and
          to plead for sinners with God!<br />

              54. Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my
              pilgrimage.</font
            ><br />

              </b
          ><br />

          Come, Christian pilgrim, and beguile your wearisome journey heavenward
          by "singing the Lord's song in this strange land." With the statutes
          of God in your hand and in your heart, you are furnished with a song
          for every step of your way, "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not
          want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures: He leads me beside
          the still waters. He restores my soul: He leads me in the paths of
          righteousness for His name's sake. Yes, though I walk through the
          valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil; for You are with
          me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table
          before me in the presence of my enemies: You anoint my head with oil;
          my cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the
          days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
          How delightfully does this song bring before you Him, who having laid
          down His life for you, engages Himself as your Provider, your Keeper,
          your Guide, your faithful and unchangeable Friend! Such a song,
          therefore, will smooth your path, and reconcile you to the many
          inconveniences of the way; while the recollection that this is only
          the house of your pilgrimage and not your home; and that "there
          remains a rest for the people of God," will support the exercise of
          faith and patience to the end. How striking the contrast between the
          wicked that forsake the law, and the Christian pilgrim, who makes it
          the subject of his daily song, and the source of his daily comfort!
          Yes, these same statutes, which are the yoke and burden of the
          ungodly, lead the true servant of the Lord from pleasure to pleasure;
          and, cherished by their vigorous influence, his way is made easy and
          prosperous. Evidently, therefore, our knowledge and delight in the
          Lord's statutes will furnish a decisive test of our real state before
          Him.<br />

           <br />

          But it is important to remember that our cheerful song is connected
          with a pilgrim-spirit. Never forget that we are not at home; only
          happy strangers on our passage homewards. Here we have no settled
          habitation—no rest. We are looking for a better country: and as we
          look, we are seeking for it. Our "hearts are in the ways of it." Every
          day advances us nearer to it. In this spirit the statutes of the Lord
          will be our song. Here are the deeds of conveyance—our title made sure
          to an estate—not small, of little account, or of uncertain
          interest—but "an inheritance" of incalculable value, made over to us.
          Here we have sure direction—such as cannot mislead us—for the
          attainment of it. Here we are stimulated by the examples of our
          fellow-pilgrims, who have reached their home; and as we follow their
          track, many are the cordials by the way, and home brightens in the
          nearer prospect.<br />

           <br />

          What reason have we then every moment to guard against the debasing,
          stupifying influence of the world, which makes us forget the proper
          character of a pilgrim! And what an habitual conflict must be
          maintained with the sloth and aversion of a reluctant heart to
          maintain our progress in the journey towards Zion! Reader! have you
          entered upon a pilgrim's life? Then what is your solace and
          refreshment on the road? It is dull, heavy, wearisome, to be a pilgrim
          without a song. And yet it is only the blessed experience of the
          Lord's statutes, that will tune our song. "If therefore you have
          tasted that the Lord is gracious;" if He has thus "put a new song into
          your mouth," oh! do not permit any carelessness or neglect to rob you
          of this heavenly anticipation. And that your lips be not found mute,
          seek to maintain a lively contemplation of the place where you are
          going—of Him who as your "forerunner is for you entered" there—and of
          the prospect, that, having "prepared a place for you, He will come
          again, and take you to Himself; that where He is, there you may be
          also." In this spirit, and with these hopes before you, you may take
          up your song, "O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.
          I will bless the Lord at all times—His praise shall continually be in
          my mouth." Thus may you go on your pilgrimage "singing in the ways of
          the Lord," and commencing a song below, which in the world of praise
          above, shall never, never cease.<br />

          How did this man of God live in the statutes of God! In the day they
          were his pilgrim song—in the night his happy meditation. And, truly,
          if we can ever spend the waking moments of the night with God, "the
          darkness is no darkness with us, but the night shines as the day."
          Many a tried believer has found this cordial for the restlessness of a
          wakeful night more restorative to the quiet and health of his earthly
          frame, than the most sovereign specifics of the medical world. "So He
          gives His beloved sleep." And if in any night of affliction we feel
          the hand of the Lord grievous to us, do we not find in the remembrance
          of the Lord a never-failing support? What does our darkness arise
          from, but from our forgetfulness of God, blotting out for a while the
          lively impressions of His tender care, His unchanging faithfulness,
          and His mysterious methods of working His gracious will? And to bring
          up as it were from the grave, the remembrance of God's name, as
          manifested in His promises, and in the dispensation of His love; this
          is indeed the "light that is sown for the righteous," and which
          "springs up out of darkness." It is to eye the character of the Lord
          as All-wise to appoint, Almighty to secure, All-compassionate to
          sympathize and support. It is to recollect Him as a "father pitying
          his children;" as a "friend who loves at all times," and who "sticks
          closer than a brother." And even in those seasons of depression, when
          unwatchfulness or indulgence of sin have brought the darkness of night
          upon the soul, though the remembrance of the name of the Lord may be
          grievous, yet it opens the way to consolation. It tells us, that there
          is a way made for our return; that "the Lord waits, that He may be
          gracious;" and that in the first step of our return to our Father, we
          shall find Him full of mercy to his backsliding children. Thus, though
          "weeping may endure for a night, joy comes in the morning."<br />

           <br />

          Study the Lord's revelation of His own name; and what more full
          perception can we conceive of its support in the darkest midnight of
          tribulations? "And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him
          (Moses), and proclaimed the name of the Lord. And the Lord passed by
          before him, and proclaimed—The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and
          gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping
          mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin, and
          that will by no means clear the guilty." Can we wonder that such a
          name as this should be exhibited as a ground of trust? "The name of
          the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runs into it and is safe."
          "Those who know Your name will put their trust in You." Even our
          suffering Lord appears to have derived support from the remembrance of
          the name of the Lord in the night of desertion, "O my God, I cry in
          the daytime, and You do not hear; and in the night-season, and am not
          silent. But You are holy, O You who inhabits the praises of Israel!"
          And from the experience of this source of consolation, we find the
          tempted Savior directing His tempted people to the same support, "Who
          is among you who fears the Lord, who obeys the voice of His servant,
          who walks in darkness, and has no light? let him trust in the name of
          the Lord, and stay upon his God."<br />

           <br />

          The main principles of the Gospel are involved in this remembrance of
          the Lord's name. Memory is the storehouse, in which the substance of
          our knowledge is treasured up. Recollections without faith are shadowy
          notions. But we have confidence that our God in Himself—and as engaged
          to us—is all that the Bible declares Him to be. How vast then are our
          obligations to His dear Son—the only medium, by which His name could
          be known or remembered, "who has" so "declared Him!" And here is the
          spring of practical religion. We shall keep His law when we remember
          His name. A sense of our obligations will impel us forward in
          diligence, heavenly-mindedness, and self-devotedness in our appointed
          sphere. Obedience will partake far more of the character of privilege
          than of duty, when an enlightened knowledge of God is the principle of
          action.<br />

          How is it, believer, that you are enabled to sing of the Lord's
          statutes—and to remember His name? This you have, because you keep His
          precepts. Thus you are able to tell the world, that in keeping His
          "commandments there is great reward"—that the "work of righteousness
          is peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness, and assurance
          forever." Christian! let your testimony be clear and decided—that ten
          thousand worlds cannot bestow the happiness of one day's devotedness
          to the service of your Lord. For is it not in this path that you
          realize fullness of joy in "fellowship with the Father, and with His
          Son Jesus Christ?" "He that has My commandments, and keeps them, he it
          is that loves me; and he who loves Me shall be loved of My Father; and
          I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him—My Father will love
          him; and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him." If you
          were walking more closely with God in "the obedience of faith," the
          world would never dare to accuse religion as the source of melancholy
          and despondency. No man has any right to the hope of happiness in a
          world of tribulation, but he who seeks it in the favor of his God. Nor
          can any enjoy this favor, except as connected, in the exercise of
          faith, with conformity to the will, and delight in the law, of his
          God. Thus not only are the "statutes of the Lord right," but they
          "rejoice the heart." There is a sweetness and satisfaction in the
          work, as well as a good flowing out of it—a current as well as a
          consequent privilege—cheering the soul in the act of exercise, just as
          the senses are regaled at the very instant with the object of their
          gratification.<br />

           <br />

          But let us remark how continually David was enriching his treasury of
          spiritual experience with some fresh view of the dealings of God with
          his soul: some answer to prayer, or some increase of consolation,
          which he records for his own encouragement, and for the use of the
          Church of God. Let us seek to imitate him in this respect; and we
          shall often be enabled to say as he does—This I had—this comfort I
          enjoyed—this support in trouble—this remarkable manifestation of His
          love—this confidence I was enabled to maintain—it was made my own,
          because I kept Your precepts.<br />

           <br />

          This I had—not, this I hoped for. He speaks of "the promise of the
          life that now is"—that by which God clears away the charge, "It is
          vain to serve Him; and what profit is it, that we have kept His
          ordinances?" Nor is it any boasting of merit, but only an
          acknowledgment of the gracious dispensation of his God. Such a reward
          for such poor service, can only be undeserved "mercy," having respect,
          not to the worthiness of the work, but to the faithfulness of the
          promise. Perfect keeping, according to the legal requirements, there
          cannot be. Evangelical perfection, in aiming at the mark, and
          constantly pressing onward towards it, there may be.<br />

           <br />

          How important therefore is it—in the absence of this Christian
          confidence—to examine, "Is there not a cause?" and what is the cause?
          Have not "strangers devoured my strength; and I knew it not?" Is the
          Lord "with me as in months past?"—with me in my closet?—with me in my
          family?—with me at my table?—with me in my daily employments and
          conversation with the world? When I hear the faithful people of God
          telling of His love, and saying—This I had; must I not, if unable to
          join their cheerful acknowledgment, trace it to my unfaithful walk,
          and say—This I had not, because I have failed in obedience to Your
          precepts; because I have been careless and self-indulgent; because I
          have slighted Your love; because I have "grieved Your Holy Spirit,"
          and forgotten to ask for the "old paths, that I might walk therein,
          and find rest to my soul?" O let this scrutiny and recollection of our
          ways realize the constant need of the finished work of Jesus, as our
          ground of acceptance, and source of strength. This will bring healing,
          restoration, increasing devotedness, tenderness of conscience,
          circumspection of walk, and a determination not to rest, until we can
          make this grateful acknowledgment our own. At the same time, instead
          of boasting that our own arm, our own diligence, or holiness, "have
          gotten us" into this favor, we shall cast all our attainments at the
          feet of Jesus, and crown Him Lord of all forever.<br />

               <br />

              57. You are my portion, O Lord; I have said that I would keep Your
              words.</b
            ><br />

             </font
          ><br />

          Man, as a dependent being, must be possessed of some portion. He
          cannot live upon himself. It must, however, be not only good, but his
          own good—something that he may lay claim to as his own. It must also
          be a large portion, because the powers and capacities to be filled are
          large. If he has not a satisfying portion, he is a wretched empty
          creature. But where and how shall he find this portion? "There be many
          that say, Who will show us any good? Lord! lift up the light of Your
          countenance upon us." And then the goodness of the Lord, in having
          offered Himself as the portion of an unworthy sinner! So that we can
          now lay claim to Him, as having wholly and fully made Himself over to
          us, and having engaged to employ His perfections for our happiness! "I
          will be your God." Surely every good is centered in the chief good—the
          fountain of all blessings, temporal, spiritual, eternal. What, then,
          is the folly, madness, and guilt, of the sinner, in choosing his
          "portion in this life:" as if there were no God on the earth, no way
          of access to Him, or no happiness to be found in Him? That such
          madness should be found in the heart of man, is a most affecting
          illustration of his departure from God. But that God's own "people
          should commit these two evils—forsaking the fountain of living waters,
          and hewing out for themselves broken cisterns"—this is the fearful
          astonishment of heaven itself.<br />

           <br />

          But we cannot know and enjoy God as our portion, except as He has
          manifested Himself in His dear Son. And in the knowledge and enjoyment
          of Him, can we envy those who "in their lifetime receive their good
          things," and therefore have nothing more to expect? Never, indeed,
          does the poverty of the worldling's portion appear more striking, than
          when contrasted with the enjoyment of the child of God, "Soul"—said
          the rich fool, "you have much goods laid up for many years." But God
          said, "This night your soul shall be required of you." Augustine's
          prayer was, "Lord, give me Yourself!" And thus the believer exults,
          "Whom have I in heaven but You? and there is none upon earth that I
          desire but You. Return unto your rest, O my soul. The Lord Himself is
          the portion of my inheritance and of my cup. You maintain my lot. The
          lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; yes, I have a goodly
          heritage. I will bless the Lord, who has given me counsel."<br />

           <br />

          Elsewhere the believer makes this confession to himself, "The Lord is
          my portion—says my soul." Here, as if to prove his sincerity, he
          "lifts up his face unto God." "You are my portion, O Lord." And surely
          the whole world cannot weigh against the comfort of this Christian
          confidence. For it is as impossible, that His own people should ever
          be impoverished, as that His own perfections should molder away. But a
          portion implies, not a source of ordinary pleasure, but of rest and
          satisfaction, such as leaves nothing else to be desired. Thus the Lord
          can never be enjoyed, even by His own children—except as a portion—not
          only above all, but in the place of all. Other objects indeed may be
          subordinately loved: but of none but Himself must we say, "He is
          altogether lovely.""In all things He must have the preeminence"—one
          with the Father in our affections, as in His own subsistence. The
          moment that any rival is allowed to usurp the throne of the heart, we
          open the door to disappointment and unsatisfied desires.<br />

           <br />

          But if we take the Lord as our portion, we must take Him as our king.
          I have said—this is my deliberate resolution—that I would keep Your
          words. Here is the Christian complete—taking the Lord as his portion,
          and His word as his rule. And what energy for holy devotedness flows
          from the enjoyment of this our heavenly portion! Thus delighting
          ourselves in the Lord, He gives us our heart's desire; and every
          desire identifies itself with His service. All that we are and all
          that we have, are His; cheerfully surrendered as His right, and
          willingly employed in his work. Thus do we evidence our interest in
          His salvation; for "Christ became the author of eternal salvation unto
          all those who obey Him."<br />

           <br />

          Reader! inquire—was my choice of this Divine portion considerate,
          free, unreserved? Am I resolved that it shall be steadfast and
          abiding? that death itself shall not separate me from the enjoyment of
          it? Am I ready to receive a Sovereign as well as a Savior? Oh! let me
          have a whole Christ for my portion! Oh! let Him have a whole heart for
          His possession. Oh! let me call nothing mine but Him.<br />

           <br />

          'The heart touched with the loadstone of Divine love: trembling with
          godly fear, yet still looking towards God by fixed believing—points at
          the love of election. He who loves may be sure he was loved first. He
          who chooses God in Christ for his delight and portion, may conclude
          confidently, that God has chosen him to enjoy Him, and be happy in Him
          forever.' (Leighton)<br />

          Delight in the Lord as our portion, naturally leads us to entreat His
          favor as "life," and "better than life," to our souls. And if we have
          said that we would keep His words, we shall still entreat His favor—to
          strengthen and encourage us in His way. We shall entreat it with our
          whole hearts, as though we felt our infinite need of it, and were
          determined to wrestle for it in Jacob's spirit, "I will not let You
          go, except You bless me." If we have known what unspeakable happiness
          it is to be brought into the favor of God "by the blood of Christ;"
          and if by "Him also we have access unto that grace wherein we stand,"
          how shall we prize the sense of Divine favor, the light of our
          Father's countenance! We shall never be weary of this source of daily
          enjoyment. It is to us as the light of the sun, which shines every day
          with renewed and unabated pleasure. We "joy in God, through our Lord
          Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement." Mercy,
          however, is the source of that favor which we entreat; and the word is
          the warrant of our expectation—Be merciful to us according to Your
          word. As sinners, we need this favor. As believers, we entreat it in
          the assurance that praying breath, as the breath of faith, will not be
          spent in vain. Any indulged indolence, or neglect, or
          unfaithfulness—relaxing our diligence, and keeping back the whole
          heart from God—will, indeed, never fail to remove the sunshine from
          the soul. But the blood of Christ still opens the way of return to the
          backslider, even though he may have wandered, as it were, to the ends
          of the earth. For "if from thence you shall seek the Lord your God,
          you shall find Him, if you seek Him with all your heart and all your
          soul.""A whole heart" in seeking the Lord, is the seal of the Lord's
          heart in returning to us, "I will rejoice over them"—says He, "to do
          them good; and I will plant them in this land assuredly, with my whole
          heart, and with my whole soul."<br />

           <br />

          Reader! if you are a child of God, the favor of God will be to you the
          "one thing needful." In other things, you will not venture to choose
          for yourself; "for who knows what is good for man in this life?" But
          in this choice you will be decided. This grand, incomparable desire
          will fill your heart. This will be to you as the portion of ten
          thousand worlds. Nothing will satisfy besides.<br />

           <br />

          You may, indeed, be a child of God without the enjoyment of the
          blessing; but not so, if you be content to be without it. If the wise
          sovereignty of our God is pleased to withhold it, still the child in
          submission will entreat it. Much more, when it is withdrawn in
          righteous chastening of carelessness or folly, will the cry be
          reiterated upon the ground of the covenant—Be merciful to me according
          to Your word.<br />

           <br />

          The Psalmist's determination, lately mentioned, to keep God's word,
          was not a hasty impulse, but a considerate resolve, the result of much
          thinking on his former ways of sin and folly. How many, on the other
          hand, seem to pass through the world into eternity without a serious
          thought on their ways! Multitudes live for the world—forget God and
          die! This is their history. What their state is, is written as with a
          sunbeam in the word of truth, "The wicked shall be turned into hell,
          and all the nations that forget God." When "no man repents him of his
          wickedness, saying, What have I done?"—this banishing of reflection is
          the character and ruin of an unthinking world. Perhaps one serious
          thought might be the new birth of the soul to God—the first step of
          the way to heaven. For when a man is arrested by the power of grace,
          he is as one awaking out of sleep, lost in solemn and serious
          thoughts—'What am I? where am I? what have I been? what have I been
          doing? I have a soul, which is my everlasting all—yet a soul without a
          Savior—lost—undone. What is my prospect for its happiness? Behind me
          is a world of vanity, an empty void. Before me a fearful unknown
          eternity. Within me an awakened conscience, to remind me of an angry
          God, and a devouring hell. If I stay here, I perish; if I go forward,
          I perish; if I return home to my offended Father, I can but perish.'
          The resolution is formed; '"I will arise," and fight my way through
          all difficulties and discouragements to my Father's house.' Thus does
          every prodigal child of God "come to himself;" and this his first step
          of return to his God involves the whole work of repentance. The
          wanderer thinks on his ways, and turns his feet to the testimonies of
          his God; witnessing, to his joyful surprise, every hindrance removed,
          the way marked with the blood of his Savior, and his Father's smiles
          in this way welcoming his return homeward. This turn is the practical
          exercise of a genuine faith; and "because he considers, and turns away
          from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely
          live—he shall not die."<br />

           <br />

          But this considerate exercise is needed, not only upon the first
          entrance into the ways of God, but in every successive step of our
          path. It will form the habit of daily "communion with our own heart;"
          without which, disorder and confusion will bewilder our steps.
          Probably David did not know how far his feet had backslidden from the
          ways of his God, until this serious consideration of his state brought
          conviction to his soul—so imperceptible is the declining of the heart
          from God! Nor is it a few transient thoughts or resolutions, that will
          effect this turn of the heart to God. A man may maintain a fruitless
          struggle to return to God for many years in sincerity and earnestness;
          while the simple act of faith in the power and love of Jesus will at
          once bring him back. Thus, while "thinking on his ways," let him walk
          in Christ as the way of return—and he will walk in the way of God's
          testimonies with acceptance and delight. In this spirit of simplicity,
          he will listen to the first whisper of the convincing voice of the
          Spirit, which marks the early steps of return from secret declension
          from God. He will also thankfully accept the chastening rod, as the
          Lord's appointed instrument of restoring His wandering children to
          Himself. For so prone are they to turn their feet away from the
          Lord—so continually are they "turning aside like a deceitful bow."—and
          so deaf are they, from the constitution of their sinful nature, to the
          ordinary calls of God; that, in love and tender faithfulness to their
          souls, He is often constrained, by the stroke of His heavy hand, to
          arrest them in their career of thoughtlessness, and turn them back to
          Himself. Most suitable then for such a state is the prayer of
          Basil—'Give me any cross, that may bring me into subjection to Your
          cross; and save me in spite of myself!'<font color="#FF0000"

              60. I made haste, and delayed not, to keep Your commandments.</b

           <br />

          A superficial conviction brings with it a sense of duty, without
          constraining to it. Men stand reasoning and doubting, instead of
          making haste. But a sound conviction sweeps away all excuses and
          delays. No time will be lost between making and performing
          resolutions. Indeed, in a matter of life and death—of eternal life and
          eternal death—the call is too clear for debate, and there is no room
          for delay. Many a precious soul has been lost by waiting for "a more
          convenient season"—a period, which probably never arrives, and which
          the willful neglect of present opportunity provokes God to put far
          away. Today is God's time. Tomorrow ruins thousands. Tomorrow is
          another world. "Today—while it is called today; if you will hear His
          voice" "make haste, and delay not." Resolutions, however sincere, and
          convictions, however serious, "will pass away, as the morning cloud
          and as the early dew," unless they are carefully cherished, and
          instantly improved. The bonds of iniquity will soon prove too strong
          for the bonds of your own resolutions; and in the first hour of
          temptation, conviction left to chance to grow, will prove as powerless
          as the "seven green withs" to bind the giant Samson. If ever delays
          are dangerous, much more are they in this concern of eternity. If
          therefore convictions begin to work, instantly yield to their
          influence. If any worldly or sinful desire is touched, let this be the
          moment for its crucifixion. If any affection is kindled towards the
          Savior, give immediate expression to its voice. If any grace is
          reviving, let it be called forth into instant duty. This is the
          best—the only—expedient to fix and detain the motion of the Spirit now
          striving in the heart: and who knows but the improvement of the
          present advantage may be the moment of victory over difficulties
          hitherto found insuperable, and may open the path to heaven with less
          interruption, and more steady progress?<br />

           <br />

          It is from the neglect of this haste that convictions often
          alternately ebb and flow so long, before they settle in a sound
          conversion. Indeed the instant movement—making haste, and delaying
          not—marks the principle of the spiritual life. This was the prodigal's
          resolution, no sooner formed than in action. He said, "I will arise,
          and go to my father—and he arose, and came to his father." When
          Matthew heard the voice, "Follow Me—he left all, rose up and followed
          Him." When Zaccheus was called from the top of the sycamore-tree,
          "Make haste, and come down, for today I must abide at your house—he
          made haste, and came down, and received Him joyfully."<br />

           <br />

           <br />

          Ah! as you prize a hope for eternity; as you wish to "flee from the
          wrath to come," and to "flee for refuge to the hope set before
          you"—beware of smothering early convictions. They may prove the first
          dawn of eternal day upon the soul—the first visit of the quickening
          Spirit to the heart. Guard them with unceasing watchfulness. Nourish
          them with believing prayer. "Exercise" them unto practical
          "godliness." "Quench not the Spirit." Let not the spark be
          extinguished by opposition of the world. Let it not expire for lack of
          the fuel of grace. Let it not lie dormant or inactive. "Stir up the
          gift of God which is in you." Every exercise, every motion, adds grace
          to grace, and increases its vigor, health, and fruitfulness. The more
          we do, the more we find we can do. The withered hand, whenever
          stretched forth in obedience to the Savior's word, and in dependence
          on His grace, will never lack a supply of spiritual strength. Every
          successive act strengthens the disposition, until a continual
          succession has formed the ready and active habit of godliness. Thus
          the Lord works in setting us to work. Therefore
          think—determine—turn—make haste, and delay not; and we wish you God
          speed; "we bless you in the name of the Lord."<br />

           <br />

          Professor! did you realize eternity, would you hover as you do between
          heaven and hell? If you were truly alive and awake, no motion would be
          swift enough for your desire to "flee from the wrath to come"—to flee
          for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before you." If ever God should
          touch your heart to feel the heavenly sweetness of communion with Him,
          will there be no regret, that the privilege was not sooner sought and
          enjoyed? Had I betaken myself earlier to a hearty interest in the ways
          of God, how much more knowledge, experience, and comfort should I have
          attained! how much more honor should I have brought to God! how much
          more profit to my fellow-sinners! Remember, every day of carnal
          pleasure or lukewarm formality is a day lost to God—to your own
          happiness—to eternity.<br />

           <br />

          A word to the believer—Have you any doubts to clear up, any peace to
          regain in the ways of the Lord? Make haste to set your heart to the
          work. Make haste to the blood of atonement. Be on the watch to "hear
          the Shepherd's voice," even if it be the voice of reproof. Promptness
          is a most important exercise of the habit of faith. Delay brings guilt
          to the conscience. The blessing of conviction—the comfortable sense of
          acceptance—the freedom of the Lord's service—is sacrificed to sloth
          and procrastination. The work that is hard today will be harder still
          tomorrow, by the resistance of this day's convictions. A greater cost
          of self-denial, a heavier burden of sorrow, and increasing unfitness
          for the service of God, will be the issue of delay. Be continually
          therefore looking for some beam of light to descend, and some
          influence of grace to flow in upon you from your exalted Head. A
          simple and vigorous faith will quickly enliven you with that love,
          delight, rejoicing in the Lord, readiness to work, and cheerfulness to
          suffer, which will once again make the ways of God "pleasantness and
          peace" to your soul.<br />

              61. The bands of the wicked have robbed me; but I have not
              forgotten Your law.</font
            ></b
          ><br />

           <br />

          Are we not too apt to cull out the easy work of the Gospel, and to
          call this love to God? Whereas true love is supreme, and ready to be
          at some loss, and to part with near and dear objects, knowing that He
          "is able to give us much more than" we lose for Him. Our resolution to
          keep His commandments will soon be put to the test. Some trial to the
          flesh will prove whether we flinch from the cross, or study to prepare
          ourselves for it. Few of us, perhaps, have literally known this trial
          of David. But the lesson to be learned from his frame of mind under
          it, is of great importance to all who profess to have their "treasure
          in heaven." It teaches us, that only exercised faith will sustain us
          in the time of trouble. This faith will enable us instantly to
          recollect our heavenly portion, and to assure our interest in it, in a
          remembrance of the law of our God. Had David forgotten God's law, no
          other resource of comfort opened before him. But it was
          ready—substantiating to his mind "the things that were not seen and
          eternal." Look again at the Apostle's deliberate estimate of this very
          trial—not only bearing his loss, but absolutely forgetting it in the
          enjoyment of his better portion, "Yes, doubtless, and I count all
          things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my
          Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things; and do count
          them but dung, that I may win Christ."<br />

           <br />

          The temper of mind under such trials as this, serves indeed most
          clearly to discover the real bent of the heart. If we are in
          possession of a spiritual and heavenly portion, we shall bear to be
          robbed by the bands of the wicked, and yet, "hold fast our
          profession." David, under this calamity, "encouraged himself in the
          Lord his God." Job, under the same visitation, "fell upon the ground,
          and worshiped." The blessings, indeed, we lose, are but as a feather
          compared with the blessings which we retain. The Providence of God is
          an abundant support for His children. Their prospects (not to speak of
          their present privileges) effectually secure them from ultimate loss,
          even in the spoiling of their worldly all. Thus the early Christians
          permitted the bands of the wicked to rob them—no, "they took joyfully
          the spoiling of their goods; knowing in themselves, that they had in
          heaven a better and an enduring substance." We have, indeed, little
          reason to be frightened from religion by the anticipation of its
          trials. The exchange of the world for God, and of the service of sin
          for the ways of heaven, leaves no room for regret in life, in death,
          or in eternity. The Christian's darkest hour is ten thousand times
          brighter than the brightest day of the ungodly. The hope of the crown
          will enable us to bear the cross, and to realize its sanctifying
          support as a matter for unbounded praise.<br />

           <br />

          But how desolate are the poor votaries of the world in the hour of
          trouble! Ignorant of the all-sufficiency of the refuge of the gospel;
          instead of being driven to it by the gracious visitations of God, they
          would rather retreat into any hiding-place of their own, than direct
          their steps backward to Him. Their circumstances of distress are most
          intensely aggravated by the sullen rebellion of the heart, which
          refuses to listen to those breathings of the Savior's love, that would
          guide them to Himself, as their sure, peaceful, and eternal rest!
          Would that we could persuade them to cast their souls in penitence and
          faith before His blessed cross! The burden of sin, as Bunyan's pilgrim
          found, would then drop from their backs. And this burden once
          removed—other burdens, before intolerable, would be found
          comparatively light; no—all burdens would be removed in the enjoyment
          of the Christian privilege of casting all—sin—care—and trouble, upon
          Jesus. Contrast the state of destitution without Him, with the
          abundant resources of the people of God. We have a double heaven—a
          heaven on earth, and a heaven above—one in present sunshine—the other
          in "the city, which has no need of the sun"—where our joys will be
          immediate—unclouded—eternal. Thus our portion embraces both worlds.
          Our present "joy no man takes from us;" and we have "laid up treasures
          in heaven," where the bands of the wicked can "never break through,
          nor steal."<br />

           <br />

          Christian! does not your faith realize a subsistence of things not
          seen? The only realities in the apprehension of the world are "the
          things that are seen, and are temporal." Your realities are "the
          things that are not seen, and are eternal." Then, remember—if you be
          robbed of your earthly all, your treasure is beyond the reach of harm.
          You can still say, "I have all, and abound." You can live splendidly
          upon your God, though all is beggary around you. You confess the
          remembrance of the law of your God to be your unfailing stay, "Unless
          Your law had been my delights, I should then have perished in my
          affliction."<br />

          Another exercise of sacred pleasure is the ways of the Lord! His
          portion was always satisfying to this holy man, and he was daily
          feeding upon it with fresh delight. There was no occasion for the
          painful restrictions and mortifications of a monastery to oblige him
          to self-denying observances. Much less was there any desire, by these
          extraordinary services, to work out a righteousness of his own, to
          recommend him to the favor of God. His diligence in this heavenly work
          was the spontaneous effusion of a heart "filled with the Spirit."
          Presenting the morning and the evening service "seven times a day,"
          was not enough for him; but he must rise at midnight to continue his
          song of praise. These hours sometimes had been spent in overwhelming
          sorrow. Now they were given to the privileged employment of praise.
          Indeed it seems to have been his frequent custom to stir up his
          gratitude by a midnight review of the Lord's daily manifestations of
          mercy. A most exciting example—especially for the child of sorrow,
          when "wearisome nights are appointed to him," and he "is full of
          tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day!" Thus "let the saints
          be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds." We observe
          this Christian enjoyment under circumstances of outward trial. When
          "at midnight—their feet made fast in the stocks—Paul and Silas prayed,
          and sang praises to God:" they gave thanks, because of His righteous
          judgments.<br />

           <br />

          We often complain of our lack of spirituality in the Divine life—how
          much our body hinders the ascent of the soul heavenwards—how often
          drowsiness overcomes our evening communion with our God; the "weakness
          of the flesh" overpowering the "willingness of the Spirit." But, after
          making all due allowances for constitutional infirmity, how far are we
          "instant in season and out of season" in the mortification of the
          flesh? Do we earnestly seek for a heart delighting in heavenly things?
          The more the flesh is denied for the service of God, the more we shall
          be elevated for the enjoyment, and realize the privilege of the work;
          and instead of having so often to mourn that our "souls cleave to the
          dust," we shall "mount upwards with eagles' wings," and even now by
          anticipation, take our place before "the throne of God and the Lamb."
          Such is the active influence of self-denial in exercising our graces,
          and promoting our comfort! Oh! how much more fervent would be our
          prayers— how much more fruitful in blessings—were they enlivened with
          more abundant delight in the 'angelic work of praise!' (Baxter.) The
          theme is always before us. The subject of the heavenly song should
          constantly engage our songs on earth—Jesus and His love—the
          "worthiness of the Lamb that was slain"—His "power, and riches, and
          wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing." Midnight
          wakefulness would be far sweeter than slumber; yes, night itself would
          be turned into day, did the judgments of God, as manifested in the
          glory of the Savior, thus occupy our hearts. Lord! tune my heart to
          Your praise, and then no time will be unseasonable for this blessed
          employment. Time thus redeemed from sleep will be an foretaste of the
          unwearied service of heaven.<br />

           <br />

          Those that love the Lord's service naturally associate with kindred
          spirits—with those that fear Him, and keep His precepts. These two
          features identify the same character: as cheerful obedience is always
          the fruit of filial fear. These then are the Lord's people; and union
          with Him is in fact union with them. Sometimes the society of the
          refined and intelligent of this world may be more congenial to our
          natural taste. But ought there not to be a restraint here? Ought not
          the Christian to say, "Surely the fear of God is not in this place?"
          and "should I love them that hate the Lord?" Let those of us, who live
          in close, and to a certain degree necessary, contact with the world,
          subject their hearts to an evening scrutiny on this subject. 'Has the
          society of this day refreshed my soul, or raised my heart to spiritual
          things? Has it promoted a watchful temper? Or has it not rather
          "quenched the spirit" of prayer, and restrained my communion with God?
          To meet the Christian in ordinary courtesy, not in unity of heart, is
          a sign of an unspiritual walk with God. Fellowship with God is
          "walking in the light." "Fellowship one with another" is the natural
          flow. "The communion of saints" is the fruit and effect of communion
          with God.<br />

           <br />

          The calls of duty, or the leadings of Providence, may indeed
          unavoidably connect us with those, who "have no fear of God before
          their eyes." Nor should we repel them, by religiously affecting a
          sullen or uncourteous habit. But such men, whatever be their
          attractions, will not be the companions of our choice. Fellowship with
          them is to "remove the ancient landmark;" to forget the broad line of
          separation between us and them; and to venture into the most hazardous
          atmosphere. If indeed our hearts were ascending, like a flame of fire,
          with a natural motion heavenwards, and carrying with them all in their
          way, the choice of the companions of our pilgrimage would be a matter
          of little importance. But so deadening to our spirit is the
          conversation of the men of this world (however commanding their
          talents, or interesting their topics), that even if we have been just
          before enlivened by the high privilege of communion with God, the free
          and self-indulgent interchange of their society will benumb our
          spiritual powers, and quickly freeze them again. To underrate
          therefore the privileged association with them that fear God, is to
          incur—not only a most awful responsibility in the sight of God; but
          also a most serious hazard to our own souls.<br />

           <br />

          If then we are not ashamed to confess ourselves Christians, let us not
          shrink from walking in fellowship with Christians. Even if they should
          exhibit some repulsive features of character, they bear the image of
          Him, whom we profess to love inexpressibly and incomparably above all.
          They will be our companions in our eternal home; they ought therefore
          to be our brothers now. How sweet, and holy, and heavenly, is this
          near relation with them in our common Lord! Shall we not readily
          consent to his judgment, who pronounced "the righteous to be more
          excellent than his neighbor?" "Iron sharpens iron." If then "the iron
          be blunt," this will be one of the best means of "whetting the edge."
          The most established servants of God gladly acknowledge the sensible
          refreshment of this union of heart. It is marked in the word of God,
          as the channel of the communication of heavenly wisdom—as a feature in
          the character of the citizens of Zion—and as that disposition, which
          is distinguished with manifest tokens of the Savior's presence; and
          which the great day will crown with the special seal of His
          remembrance. "They that feared the Lord spoke often one to another;
          and the Lord hearkened, and heard" it; "and a book of remembrance was
          written before Him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought
          upon His name. And they shall be Mine, says the Lord of Hosts, in that
          day when I make up My jewels."<br />

          What full provision is made for man's happiness! The first creation
          was full of mercy. God knew that He had created a being full of want.
          Every faculty wanted some suitable object, as the source of enjoyment
          in the gratification—of suffering in the denial; and now has He
          charged Himself with making provision for them all—so perfect, that no
          want is left unprovided for.<br />

           <br />

          But what a picture does the earth now present on every side—a world of
          rebels! yet a world full of the mercy of the Lord! "O Lord, how
          manifold are Your works! in wisdom have You made them all. The earth
          is full of Your riches. The eyes of all wait upon You, and You give
          them their meat in due season. You open Your hand, and satisfy the
          desire of every living thing." And how does the contemplation of the
          Lord's mercy in providence encourage our faith, in the expectancy of
          spiritual privileges! "O Lord! You preserve man and beast. How
          excellent is Your loving-kindness, O God! therefore the children of
          men put their trust under the shadow of Your wings. They shall be
          abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Your house; and You shall
          make them drink of the river of Your pleasures." 'As You largely
          bestow Your blessings upon all creatures according to their nature and
          condition, so I desire the spiritual blessings of the lively light of
          Your law and word, which are fitting and convenient for the being and
          happiness of my soul.' As an ignorant sinner, "what I see not, teach
          me." Teach me Your statutes; that which You have appointed, as the way
          of duty, and the path to glory—that path which I am utterly unable to
          discover, or when discovered, to walk in, without the help of Your
          grace. And indeed the hearts of His people are the vessels, into which
          the Lord is continually pouring more and more of Himself, until they
          shall "be filled with all the fullness of God." Every good, according
          to its character and degree, is diffusive. And thus the goodness or
          mercy of God pervades His whole
          universe—natural—plentiful—free—communicative.<br />

           <br />

          Yet none but a believer will understand how to use the plea which is
          here employed. The mercy that he sees on every side, is to him a
          pledge and earnest of that mercy, which his soul needs within. The
          world indeed in its present fallen state, when seen through the medium
          of pride and discontent, exhibits a picture of misery, not of mercy;
          and only ministers occasion for complaint against the Creator. But the
          believer—feeling the infinite and eternal desert of sin—cannot but
          know, that the lowest exercise of goodness in God is an act of free
          undeserved mercy. No wonder then that he sees mercy in everything—in
          every part of the universe of God—a world full of mercy. The very food
          we eat, our clothing, our habitations, the contrivances for our
          comfort, are not mere displays of goodness, but manifestations of
          mercy. Having forfeited all claim upon the smallest consideration of
          God, there could have been no just ground of complaint, had all these
          blessings been made occasions of suffering, instead of comfort and
          indulgence.<br />

           <br />

          Indeed is it not a marvel, that when man—full of mercy—is lifting up
          his hand against his God—employing against him all the faculties,
          which His mercy gave and has preserved—that God should be so seldom
          provoked to strike by their aggravated provocations? What
          multitude—what weight—what variety of mercy does He still shower upon
          us! Even our hair, though seemingly so unimportant, the seat of
          loathsome, defiling, and even mortal disease—is the object of His
          special care. All the limbs of the body, all the faculties of the
          mind, all the affections of the heart, all the powers of the will:
          keeping us in health, and capable of acting for our own happiness—how
          does He restrain them from those exercises or movements which might be
          fatal to our happiness!<br />

           <br />

          And then the question naturally recurs—and to a spiritual mind will
          never weary by its recurrence—Whence flows all this mercy? Oh! it is
          delightful indeed to answer such an inquiry—delightful to contemplate
          Him, "in whom" we are not only "blessed with all spiritual blessings;"
          but who is also the medium, through which our temporal comforts are
          conveyed to us. How sweet to eye these mercies, as bought with the
          most precious blood that ever was known in the world, and to mark the
          print of the nails of our crucified Friend stamped upon the least of
          them! We allow it to add a relish to our enjoyments, that we can
          consider them as provided by some beloved friend; and should not our
          mercies be doubly sweet in remembrance of that munificent Friend, who
          purchased them for us so dearly; who bestows them upon us so richly;
          yes, who gives Himself with them all?<br />

           <br />

          Have we heard of this mercy of God? And do we feel the need of it for
          ourselves—for every moment? Then let us apply to the throne of grace
          in the free and open way of acceptance and access. Let us go to the
          King (as Benhadad's servants to the king of Israel,) in the spirit of
          self-condemnation and faith. Our acceptance does not depend (as in the
          case referred to) upon a "perhaps;" but it rests upon the sure word of
          promise, "Him who comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out."<br />

              65. You have dealt well with Your servant, O Lord, according to

          ><br />

           <br />

          There is a time for all things in the believer's experience—for
          confession, prayer, and praise. This Psalm mostly expresses the
          confessions and prayers of the man of God—yet mingled with thankful
          acknowledgments of mercy. He had prayed, "Deal bountifully with Your
          servant." Perhaps here is the acknowledgment of the answer to his
          prayer—You have dealt well with Your servant, O Lord, according to
          Your word. And who among us has not daily reason to make the same
          acknowledgment? Even in those trials, when we have indulged hard
          thoughts of God, a clearer view of His judgments, and a more simple
          dependence upon His faithfulness and love, will rebuke our impatience
          and unbelief, and encourage our trust. Subsequent experience altered
          Jacob's hasty view of the Lord's dealings with him. In a moment of
          peevishness, the recollection of the supposed death of a beloved son,
          and the threatened bereavement of another, tempted him to say, "All
          these things are against me." At a brighter period of his day, when
          clouds were beginning to disperse, we hear that "the spirit of Jacob
          revived: And Jacob said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive, I
          will go and see him before I die." And when his evening sun was going
          down almost without a cloud, in the believing act of "blessing the
          sons of" his beloved "Joseph," how clearly does he retract the
          language of his former sinful impatience!, "God, before whom my
          fathers, Abraham and Isaac, did walk—the God which fed me all my life
          long to this day—the Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the
          lads!" This surely was in the true spirit of the acknowledgment—You
          have dealt well with Your servant, O Lord, according to Your word.<br />

            <br />

          And how is it that any of us have ever harbored a suspicion of
          unbelief? Has God in any one instance falsified His promise? Has "the
          vision" failed to come at the end? Has it ever "lied?" Has He not
          "confirmed His promise by an oath," "that we might have two immutable
          things" as the ground of "strong consolation?" Any degree less than
          the full credit that He deserves, is admitting the false principle,
          that God is a man, that He should lie, and the son of man, that He
          should repent. It weakens the whole spiritual frame, shakes our grasp
          of the promise, destroys our present comfort, and brings foreboding
          apprehensions of the future. Whereas, if we have faith and patience to
          wait, "in the mount the Lord shall be seen." "All things" may seem to
          be "against us," while at the very moment, under the wonder-working
          hand of God, they are "working together for our good." When therefore
          we "are in heaviness through manifold temptations," and we discover a
          "needs-be" for it all; and "the trial of faith is found unto praise
          and honor and glory"—when we are thus reaping the fruitful discipline
          of our Father's school, must we not put a fresh seal to our
          testimony—You have dealt well with Your servant, O Lord? But why
          should we delay our acknowledgment until we come out of our trial?
          Ought we not to give it even in the midst of our "heaviness?" Faith
          has enabled many, and would enable us, to "glorify God in the fires;"
          to "trust" Him, even when "walking in darkness, and having no light;"
          and, even while smarting under His chastening rod, to acknowledge,
          that He has dealt well with us.<br />

           <br />

          But if I doubt the reasonableness of this acknowledgment, then let me,
          while suffering under trials, endeavor to take up different language.
          'Lord, You have dealt ill with Your servant; You have not kept Your
          word.' If in a moment of unbelief my impatient heart, like Jacob's,
          could harbor such a dishonorable suspicion, my conscience would soon
          smite me with conviction—'What! shall I, who am "called out of
          darkness into marvelous light"—shall I, who am rescued from slavery
          and death, and brought to a glorious state of liberty and life,
          complain? Shall I, who have been redeemed at so great a price, and who
          have a right to "all the promises of God in Christ Jesus," and who am
          now an "heir of God, and joint heir with Christ," murmur at my
          Father's will? Alas, that my heart should prove so foolish, so weak,
          so ungrateful! Lord! I would acknowledge with thankfulness, and yet
          with humiliation, You have dealt well with Your servant, according to
          Your word.' But how sinfully do we neglect these honorable and
          cheering acknowledgments! Were we habitually to mark them for future
          remembrance, we should be surprised to see how their numbers would
          multiply. "If we should count them, they are more in number than the
          sand." And truly such recollections—enhancing every common, as well as
          every special mercy—would come up as a sweet savor to God "by Christ
          Jesus.""Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless
          His holy name; and do not forget all His benefits."<br />

              66. Teach me good judgment and knowledge; for I have believed Your
              commandments.<br />

               </b
            ></font
          ><br />

          If the perception of the Lord's merciful dealings with my soul is
          obscure—Teach me good judgment and knowledge. Give me a clear and
          enlarged apprehension, that I may be ready with my acknowledgment,
          "All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth." Or even with an
          enlightened assurance of His wise and faithful dispensations, still
          would I urge this petition before Him, as needful for every step of my
          path. Indeed this prayer illustrates the simplicity and intelligence
          of Christian faith—always desiring, asking, and expecting the most
          suitable blessings. For what blessings can be more suitable to an
          ignorant sinner, than good judgment and knowledge: knowledge of
          ourselves, of our Savior, of the way of obedience—and good judgment,
          to apply this knowledge to some valuable end? These two parts of our
          intellectual furniture have a most important connection and dependence
          upon each other. Knowledge is the speculative perception of general
          truth. Judgment is the practical application of it to the heart and
          conduct. No school, but the school of Christ—no teaching, but the
          teaching of the Spirit—can ever give this good judgment and knowledge.
          Solomon asks it for himself—Paul for his people. Both direct us to God
          as the sole fountain and author.<br />

            <br />

          We cannot fail to observe a very common defect in Christians;—warm
          affections connected with a blind or loose judgment. Hence, too often,
          a lightness in religion, equally unsteady in profession and in
          practice—easily satisfied with a narrow compass in the vast field of
          Scripture, instead of grasping a full survey of those truths, which
          are so intimately connected with our Christian establishment and
          privilege. Much perplexing doubt, discouragement, and fear; much
          mistaken apprehension of important truth, much coldness and
          backsliding of heart and conduct, arises from the want of an accurate
          and full apprehension of the scriptural system.<br />

           <br />

          This prayer has a special application to the tender and sensitive
          child of God. The disease of his constitution is too often a
          scrupulous conscience—one of the most active and successful enemies to
          his settled peace and quietness. The faculty of conscience partakes,
          with every other power of man, of the injury of the fall; and
          therefore, with all its intelligence, honesty, and power, it is liable
          to misconception. Like a defect of vision, it often displaces objects:
          and, in apparently conflicting duties, that which touches the feeling,
          or accords with the temper, is preferred to one, which, though more
          remotely viewed, really possessed a higher claim. Thus it pronounces
          its verdict from the predominance of feeling, rather than from the
          exercise of judgment—more from an indistinct perception of the subject
          presented to the mind, than from a simple immediate reference "to the
          law and testimony." Again—matters of trivial moment are often insisted
          upon, to the neglect of important principles. External points of
          offence are more considered, than the habitual mortification of the
          inward principle. Conformity to the world in dress and appearance is
          more strongly censured than the general spirit of worldliness in the
          temper and conduct of outward non-conformists; while the spirit of
          separation from the world, is totally disregarded. Thus are
          non-essentials confounded with fundamentals—things indifferent with
          things unlawful, from a narrow misconception of what is directly
          forbidden and allowed. Conscience, therefore, must not be trusted
          without the light of the word of God; and most important is the
          prayer—Teach me good judgment and knowledge.<br />

            <br />

          The exercises of this state of feeling are both endless and causeless.
          In the well-intended endeavor to guard against a devious track, the
          mind is constantly harassed with an over-anxious inquiry, whether the
          right path is accurately discovered; and thus at once the pleasure and
          the progress of the journey are materially hindered. The influence
          therefore of this morbid sensibility is strenuously to be resisted. It
          renders the strait way more strait. It retards the work of grace in
          the soul. It is usually connected with self-righteousness. It savors
          of, and tends to produce, hard thoughts of God. It damps our
          cheerfulness in His service, and unfits us for the duty of the present
          moment. What however is more than all to be deprecated, is, that it
          multiplies sin; or, to speak more clearly, it superinduces another
          species of sin, besides the actual transgression of the law of God.
          For opposition to the dictates of conscience in any particular is sin,
          even though the act itself may be allowed by the law of God. We may
          therefore sin in the act of doing good, or in obedience to the liberty
          and enjoyment of the gospel, as well as in the allowed transgression
          of the law. Indeed, under the bondage of a scrupulous conscience, we
          seem to be entangled in the sad necessity of sinning. The dictates of
          conscience, even when grounded upon misconception, are authoritative.
          Listening to its suggestions may be sinning against "the liberty, with
          which Christ has made us free," and in which we are commanded to
          "stand fast." No human authority can free from its bonds. Resistance
          to its voice is disobedience to God's viceregent, and therefore, in a
          qualified sense at least, disobedience to God Himself. And thus it is
          sin, even when that which conscience condemns may be innocent.<br />

           <br />

          The evil of a scrupulous conscience may often be traced to a diseased
          temperament of body, to a naturally weak or perverted understanding,
          to the unfavorable influence of early prejudice—to a lack of simple
          exercise of faith, or perception of the matters of faith. In these
          cases faith may be sincere, though weak; and the sin, such as it is,
          is a sin of infirmity, calling for our pity, forbearance, prayer, and
          help. In many instances however, willful ignorance, false shame that
          will not inquire, or a pertinacious adherence to deep-rooted opinion,
          is the source of the disease. Now such persons must be roused, even at
          the hazard of wounding the conscience of the more tenderly scrupulous.
          But as the one class decidedly sin, and the other too frequently
          indulge their infirmity, the excitement will probably be ultimately
          useful to both. Both need to have the conscience enlightened; and to
          obtain "a right judgment in all things"—by a more diligent "search in
          the Scriptures"—by "seeking the law at the mouth of the priest"—and,
          above all, by earnest prayer with the Psalmist—Teach me good judgment
          and knowledge. Thus they will discern between what is imperative, and
          what is indifferent; between what is lawful, and what is expedient. If
          "whatever is not of faith is sin," then the only prospect of the
          removal of the doubt will be increase of faith—that is, a more full
          persuasion of the Divine warrant and instruction. "Howbeit there is
          not in everyone this knowledge:" yet the exhortation speaks alike to
          all, "Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
          Christ." Indeed the most favorable symptoms of scrupulosity (except
          where the disease originates in external causes) partake of the guilt
          of willful ignorance; because none can be said sincerely to ask for
          good judgment and knowledge, who do not diligently improve all means
          of obtaining it. If therefore, the scrupulous shrink from honestly
          seeking the resolution of their difficulties in private conferences
          (where they are to be had) with Ministers or experienced Christians,
          so far they must be considered as wilfully ignorant. We would indeed
          "receive them," "bear with their infirmities," and encourage them to
          expect relief from their hard bondage in the way of increasing
          diligence, humility, and prayer. While their minds are in doubt
          concerning the path of duty, their actions must be imperfect and
          unsatisfactory. Let them therefore wait, inquire, and pray, until
          their way be made plain. This done, let them act according to their
          conscience, allowing nothing that it condemns, neglecting nothing
          which it requires. The responsibility of error (should error be
          eventually detected) will not be—the too implicit following of the
          guidance of conscience—but the want of due care and diligence for its
          more clear illumination. Generally, however, the rule will apply, "If
          your eye be single, your whole body shall be full of light."<br />

           <br />

          But, besides the scrupulous conscience, the imperfectly enlightened
          conscience presents a case equally to be deprecated. Often does it
          charge to a sinful source those incessant variations of feelings,
          which originate in bodily indisposition, or accidental influence of
          temptation. Sins of infirmity are confounded with sins of indulgence:
          occasional with habitual transgressions of duty. Only a part of the
          character is brought under cognisance: and while short-comings or
          surprisals are justly condemned: yet the exercise of contrition,
          faith, love, and watchfulness, is passed by unnoticed. Thus the gospel
          becomes the very reverse of the appointment of its gracious Author. It
          brings ashes for beauty, mourning for the oil of joy, and the spirit
          of heaviness for the garment of praise. If this evil is "not a sin
          unto death," it is "a sore evil under the sun," which may often give
          occasion for the prayer—Teach me good judgment and knowledge; that, in
          the simplicity of faith, I may be blessed with a tender conscience,
          and be delivered from the bondage of a scrupulous, and from the
          perplexity of an unenlightened, conscience. Let my heart never condemn
          me where it ought not. Let it never fail to condemn me where it
          ought.<br />

           <br />

          But, alas! the perception of our need of this good judgment and
          knowledge, is far too indistinct and uninfluential. We need to cry for
          these valuable blessings with deeper earnestness, and more diligent
          and patient waiting upon God. Divine wisdom is a treasury, that does
          not spend by giving; and we may ask to be enriched to the utmost
          extent of our wants, "in full assurance of faith." But this faith
          embraces the whole revelation of God—the commandments as well as the
          promises. And thus it becomes the principle of Christian obedience.
          For can we believe these commandments to be as they are represented,
          "holy, just, and good," and not delight in them? "In those is
          continuance"—said the prophet, "and we shall be saved." Convinced of
          their perfection, acknowledging their obligations, loving them, and
          living in them, we shall "come to full age" in the knowledge of the
          Gospel, and, "by reason of use have our senses exercised to discern
          both good and evil."<br />

          The teaching of good judgment and knowledge will lead us to deprecate,
          instead of desiring, a prosperous state. But should the Christian, by
          the appointment of God, be thrown into the seductive atmosphere, he
          will feel the prayer that is so often put into his lips, most
          peculiarly expressive of his need, "In all time of our wealth—Good
          Lord, deliver us!" (Litany.) A time of wealth is indeed a time of
          special need. It is hard to restrain the flesh, when so many are the
          baits for its indulgence. Such mighty power is here given to the
          enemy, while our perception of his power is fearfully weakened! Many
          and affecting instances are recorded of the hardening of the heart
          even of the Lord's people, in the deadening influence of a proud and
          worldly spirit. But the fate of the ungodly is written as with a
          sunbeam for our warning, "When Jeshurun waxed fat, he kicked—I spoke
          to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear." But how
          awful will be the period, when the question shall speak to the
          conscience with all the poignancy of self-conviction, "What fruit had
          you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed?" What is the end
          of this flowery path? "Death!" "Surely You set them in slippery
          places: You cast them down into destruction. How are they brought into
          desolation as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors"
          "the prosperity of fools shall destroy them."<br />

           <br />

          Our Savior's allotment for His people, "In the world you shall have
          tribulation"—marks not less His wisdom than His love. This is the
          gracious rod, by which He scourges back His prodigal children to
          Himself. This is the wise discipline, by which He preserves them from
          the poisoned sweetness of carnal allurements, and keeps their hearts
          in a simple direction towards Himself, as the well-spring of their
          everlasting joy. With all of them this one method has been pursued.
          All have been taught in one school. All have known the power of
          affliction in some of its varied forms of inward conflict or outward
          trouble. All have found a time of affliction a time of love. All have
          given proof, that the pains bestowed upon them have not been in vain.
          Thus did Manasseh in affliction beseech "the Lord, and humble himself
          greatly before the Lord God of his fathers." Thus also in afflictions
          the Lord "heard Ephraim bemoaning himself;" and beheld Israel "seeking
          Him early," and the forlorn wandering child casting a wishful,
          penitent look towards his Father's house, as if the pleasures that had
          enticed his heart from home, were now embittered to the soul.<br />

           <br />

          And thus the Christian can give some account of the means, by which
          his Father is leading and preparing him for heaven. Perhaps he did not
          at first see the reason. It was matter of faith, not of consciousness.
          But in looking back, how clear the path, how valuable the benefit,
          Before I was afflicted, I went astray: but now have I kept Your word.
          'I never prized it before. I could indeed scarcely be said to know it.
          I never understood its comfort, until affliction expounded it to me. I
          never until now saw its suitableness to my case.' But what an
          heightened aggravation of guilt, when these especial mercies fail of
          their gracious end—when vanity, worldliness, and sin still reign with
          uncontrolled sway! Ah! when sinners are unhumbled "under the mighty
          hand of God"—when they are afflicted, and not purged by
          affliction—when it is said of them, "They received not correction"—it
          seems the forerunner of that tremendous judgment, "Why should you be
          stricken any more?"<br />

           <br />

          Heavenly Father! keep Your poor, weak, erring child from this fearful
          doom. Let not that measure of prosperity, which You may be pleased to
          give, prove my curse. But especially let every cross, every affliction
          which You are pleased to mingle in my cup, conform me more to my
          Savior's image, restrain my heart from its daily wanderings, endear
          Your holy ways and word to my soul, and give me sweeter anticipations
          of that blessed home, where I shall never wander more, but find my
          eternal happiness in keeping Your word.<br />

          The blessed effects of chastisement, as a special instance of the
          Lord's goodness, might naturally lead to a general acknowledgment of
          the goodness of His character and dispensation. Judging in unbelieving
          haste, of His providential and gracious dealings, feeble sense
          imagines a frown, when the eye of faith discerns a smile, upon His
          face; and therefore in proportion as faith is exercised in the review
          of the past, and the experience of the present, we shall be prepared
          with the ascription of praise—You are good. This is indeed the
          expression—the confidence—the pleading—of faith. It is the sweet taste
          of experience—restraining the legality of the conscience, the many
          hard and dishonorable thoughts of God, and invigorating a lively
          enjoyment of Him. Indeed 'this is the true and genuine character of
          God. He is good—He is goodness. Good in Himself—good in His
          essence—good in the highest degree. All the names of God are
          comprehended in this one of Good. All the acts of God are nothing else
          but the effluxes of His goodness distinguished by several names
          according to the object it is exercised about. When He confers
          happiness without merit, it is grace. When He bestows happiness
          against merit, it is mercy. When He bears with provoking rebels, it is
          patience. When He performs His promise, it is truth. When He
          commiserates a distressed person, it is pity. When He supplies an
          indigent person, it is bounty. When He supports an innocent person, it
          is righteousness. And when He pardons a penitent person, it is mercy.
          All summed up in this one name—Goodness. None so communicatively good
          as God. As the notion of God includes goodness, so the notion of
          goodness includes diffusiveness. Without goodness He would cease to be
          a Deity; and without diffusiveness He would cease to be good. The
          being good is necessary to the being God. For goodness is nothing else
          in the notion of it but a strong inclination to do good, either to
          find or to make an object, wherein to exercise itself, according to
          the propensity of its own nature; and it is an inclination of
          communicating itself, not for its own interest, but for the good of
          the object it pitches upon. Thus God is good by nature; and His nature
          is not without activity. He acts consistently with His own nature—You
          are good, and do good.' (Charnock)<br />

           <br />

          How easily is such an acknowledgment excited towards an earthly
          friend! Yet who has not daily cause to complain of the coldness of his
          affections towards his God? It would be a sweet morning's reflection
          to recollect some of the innumerable instances, in which the goodness
          of God has been most distinctly marked, to trace them in their
          peculiar application to our own need; and above all to mark, not only
          the source from which they come, but the channel through which they
          flow. A view of covenant love does indeed make the goodness of God to
          shine with inexpressible brightness "in the face of Jesus Christ;" and
          often when the heart is conscious of backsliding, does the
          contemplation of this goodness under the influence of the Spirit,
          prove the Divinely appointed means of "leading us to repentance." Let
          us therefore wait on, even when we see nothing. Soon we shall see,
          where we did not look for it. Soon we shall find goodness
          unmingled—joy unclouded, unspeakable, eternal.<br />

           <br />

          Meanwhile, though the diversified manifestations—the materials of our
          happiness, in all around us, be countless as the particles of sand,
          and the drops of dew; yet without heavenly teaching they only become
          occasions of our deeper misery and condemnation. It is not enough that
          the Lord gives—He must teach us His statutes. Divine truths can only
          be apprehended by Divine teaching. The scholar, who has been longest
          taught, realizes most his need of this teaching, and is most earnest
          in seeking it. Indeed, "the earth is full of the goodness of the
          Lord," yet we may be utterly ignorant of it. The instances of goodness
          in the shape of a cross, we consider to be the reflection on it.
          Nothing is goodness in our eyes, that crosses our own inclination. We
          can hardly bear to hear of the cross, much less to take it up. We talk
          of goodness, but yield to discontent. We do not profess to dislike
          trial—only the trial now pressing upon us—any other cross than this;
          that is, my will and wisdom rather than God's. Is there not,
          therefore, great need of this prayer for Divine teaching, that we may
          discern the Lord's mercies so closely crowded together, and make the
          due improvement of each? Twice before had the Psalmist sent up this
          prayer and plea. Yet he seems to make the supplication ever new by the
          freshness and vehemency of his desires. And let me ever make it new by
          the remembrance of that one display of goodness, which casts every
          other manifestation into the shade, "God so loved the world, that He
          gave His only-begotten Son."<br />

           <br />

          This constitutes of itself a complete mirror of infinite and
          everlasting goodness—the only intelligent display of His goodness—the
          only manifestation, that prevents from abusing it. What can I say to
          this—but You are good, and do good? What may I not then expect from
          You! '"Teach me Your statutes." Teach me the Revelation of
          Yourself—Teach me the knowledge of Your Son. For "this is life
          eternal, that I might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ
          whom You have sent."'<br />

          If the Lord does us good, we must expect Satan to do us evil. Acting
          in his own character, as a "liar and the father of it," he readily
          puts it into the hearts of his children to forge lies against the
          children of God! But all is overruled by the ever-watchful care and
          providence of God, for the eventual good of His church. The cross
          frightens the insincere, and removes them out of the way; while the
          steadfastness of His own people marvelously displays to the world the
          power and triumph of faith. A most delightful source of encouragement
          in this fiery trial is, to take off the eye from the objects of sense,
          and to fix it upon Jesus as our pattern, no less than our life. For
          every trial, in which we are conformed to His suffering image,
          supplies to us equal direction and support. Do "the proud forge lies
          against us?" So did they against Him. "The disciple is not above his
          master, nor the servant above his Lord. It is enough for the disciple,
          that he be as his master, and the servant as his Lord. If they have
          called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they
          call them of his household?" "Consider Him, therefore, that endured
          such contradiction of sinners against Himself, lest you be wearied and
          faint in your minds."<br />

           <br />

          But is it always lies that are forged against us? Is there no
          worldliness, or pride, or inconsistency in temper and walk, that opens
          the mouths of the enemies of the gospel, and causes "the way of truth
          to be evil spoken of?" Do they not sometimes "say all manner of evil"
          against some of us, for Christ's sake; yet alas! not altogether
          "falsely?" "Woe unto the world, because of offences! for it must needs
          be that offences come; but woe to that man, by whom the offence
          comes!" If, however, the reproach of the world be "the reproach of
          Christ," "let us hold fast the profession of our faith without
          wavering; for He is faithful that promised." Insincerity of heart can
          never support us to a consistent and persevering endurance of the
          cross. A heart divided between God and the world will ever be found
          faulty and backsliding. Wholeness of heart in the precepts of God
          adorns the Christian profession, awes the ungodly world, realizes the
          full extent of the Divine promises, and pours into the soul such a
          spring-tide of enjoyment, as more than counterbalances all the
          reproach, contempt, and falsehood, which the forge of the great enemy
          is employing against us with unceasing activity, and relentless
          hatred. Yet do not forget, believer, that these proofs of the
          malicious enmity of the proud must often be received as the gentle
          stroke of your Father's chastisement. Let the fruits of it, then, be
          daily visible in the work of mortification—in the exercise of the
          suffering graces of the gospel—in your growing conformity to His
          image—and in a progressive fitness for the world of eternal
          uninterrupted love.<br />

           <br />

          A dreadful description of the hardened state of the proud forgers of
          lies! Yet not of their state only, but of every sinner, who stands out
          in willful rebellion against God. The tremendous blow of almighty
          justice has benumbed his heart, so that the pressure of mountains of
          sin and guilt is unfelt! The heart is left of God, "seared with a hot
          iron," and therefore without tenderness; "past feeling;" unsoftened by
          the power of the word: unhumbled by the rod of providential
          dispensations, given up to the heaviest of all spiritual judgments!
          But it is of little avail to stifle the voice of conscience, unless
          the same power or device could annihilate hell. It will only "awake
          out of sleep, like a giant refreshed with wine," and rage with
          ten-fold interminable fury in the eternal world, from the temporary
          restraint, which for a short moment had benumbed its energy. Willful
          resistance to the light of the gospel, and the strivings of the
          Spirit, constrained even from a God of love the message of judicial
          abandonment, "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears
          heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear
          with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be
          healed." Who then among us will not cry—From hardness of heart, and
          contempt of Your word and commandment, Good Lord! deliver us!
          (Litany.) Tenderness is the first mark of the touch of grace, when the
          heart becomes sensible of its own insensibility, and contrite on
          account of its own hardness. 'Nothing'—said Jerome, in a letter to a
          friend—'makes my heart sadder, than that nothing makes it sad.' But
          when "the plague of our own heart" begins to be "known," and becomes a
          matter of confession, humiliation, prayer; the promise of "a new
          heart" is as life from the dead. The subject of this promise delights
          in God's law; and this amid the sometimes overwhelming power of
          natural corruption, gives a satisfactory witness of a change "from
          death unto life."<br />

           <br />

          Christian! can you daily witness the wretched condition of the
          ungodly, without the constraining recollection of humiliation and
          love? What sovereign grace, that the Lord of glory should have set His
          love upon one so vile! What mighty power, to have raised my insensible
          heart to that delight in His law, which conforms me to the image of
          His dear Son! Deeply would I "abhor myself:" and gladly would I
          acknowledge, that the service of ten thousand hearts would be a poor
          return for such unmerited love. What, oh, "what shall I render to the
          Lord!"—Prayer for them who are still lying in death—praise for myself
          quickened from death. But what can give the vital breath, pulse,
          feeling, and motion? "Come, from the four winds, O breath; and breathe
          upon the slain, that they may live."<br />

           <br />

          Let us apply, for the purpose of daily self-examination, this
          description of the heart, either as given up to its natural
          insensibility, or as cast into the new mold of delight in the law of
          God. Such an examination will prove to us, how much even renewed souls
          need the transforming, softening influences of grace. "The
          deceitfulness of sin hardens the heart" to its original character, as
          fat as grease, unfeeling, incapable of impression, without a Divine
          touch. O Lord, let not my heart be unvisited for one day, one hour, by
          that melting energy of love, which first made me feel, and constrained
          me to love.<br />

           <br />

              71. It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
              learn Your statutes.</b
            ></font
          ><br />

           <br />

          If I mark in myself any difference from the ungodly—if I can feel that
          my natural insensibility is yielding to the influence of grace—if I am
          enabled to "delight in God's law," which before I had neglected as a
          "strange thing," if this softening transformation has been wrought in
          the school of affliction; let me thankfully acknowledge—It is good for
          me that I have been afflicted. None indeed but the Lord's scholars can
          know the benefit of this school and this teaching. The first lessons
          are usually learned under the power of the word pricking and piercing
          the heart; yet issuing in joyous good. All special lessons afterward
          will probably be learned here. 'I never'—said Luther—'knew the meaning
          of God's word, until I came into affliction. I have always found it
          one of my best schoolmasters.' This teaching distinguishes the
          sanctified from the unsanctified cross, explaining many a hard text,
          and sealing many a precious promise—the rod expounding the word, and
          the Divine Teacher effectually applying both.<br />

            <br />

          Indeed, but for this discipline we should miss much of the meaning and
          spiritual blessing of the word. For how can we have any experimental
          acquaintance with the promises of God, except under those
          circumstances for which the promises are made? When, for example, but
          in the day of trouble, could we understand the full mercy of such a
          gracious word, as, "Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I will deliver
          you, and you shall glorify Me?" And how much more profitable is this
          experimental learning than mere human instruction! When, therefore, we
          pray for a clearer apprehension and interest in the blessed book, and
          for a deeper experience of its power upon our hearts; we are, in fact,
          often unconsciously supplicating for the chastening rod of our
          Father's love. For it is the man "whom the Lord chastens," that He
          "teaches out of His law." Peter, indeed, when on the mount of
          transfiguration, said, "It is good for us to be here. Let us build
          here three tabernacles." Here let us abide, in a state of comfort,
          indulgence, and sunshine. But well was it added by the sacred
          historian, "Not knowing what he said." The judgment of David was far
          more correct, when he pronounced, that it was good for him that he had
          been afflicted. For so often are we convicted of inattention to the
          voice of the Lord—so often do we find ourselves looking back upon
          forsaken Sodom, or lingering in the plain, instead of pressing onward
          to Zoar, that the indulgence of our own liberty would shortly hurry us
          along the pathway of destruction. Alas! often do we feel the spirit of
          prayer to be quenched for a season by "a heart overcharged with the
          cares of this life"—or by the overprizing of some lawful comfort—or by
          a temper inconsistent with our Christian profession—or by an undue
          confidence in the flesh. And at such seasons of backsliding, we must
          count among our choicest mercies the gracious discipline, by which the
          Lord schools us with the cross, that we may learn His statutes.<br />

           <br />

          After all, however, this must be a paradox to the unenlightened man.
          He can only "count it" all grief—not "all joy—when he falls into
          diverse temptations." His testimony is—It is evil—not it is good—for
          me that I have been afflicted. And even God's children, as we have
          before remarked, do not always take up this word while smarting under
          the rod. The common picture of happiness is freedom from trouble, not,
          as Scripture describes it, the portion of trouble. Yet how true is
          God's judgment, when it is the very end of affliction to remove the
          source of all trouble, and consequently to secure—not to destroy—solid
          happiness! We must however determine the standard of real good by its
          opposition—not its accordance—to our own fancy or indulgence. The
          promise of "every good thing" may be fulfilled by a plentiful cup of
          affliction. Present evil may be "working together for" ultimate
          "good." Let God take His own way with us. Let us interpret His
          providences by His covenant—His means by His end—and instead of
          fainting under the sharpness of His rod, we shall earnestly desire the
          improvement of it.<br />

           <br />

          Are you, then, tried believer, disposed to regret the lessons you have
          already learned in this school? Or have you purchased them at too dear
          a cost? Do you grieve over the bleedings of a contrite heart, that
          have brought you under the care of the healing physician? Or could you
          by any other way have obtained so rich a knowledge of His love, or
          have been trained to such implicit obedience to His will? As Jesus,
          "though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He
          suffered;" so may we "rejoice, inasmuch as we are partakers of His
          sufferings," and be thankful to learn the same obedience, as the
          evidence and fruit of our conformity to Him.<br />

           <br />

          The Lord save us from the greatest of all afflictions, an affliction
          lost! "Be instructed, O Jerusalem, lest My soul depart from you; lest
          I make you desolate, a land not inhabited." "He who being often
          reproved, hardens his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that
          without remedy." A call to tremble and repent, to watch and pray, and
          "turn to Him that smites us!"<br />

           <br />

          Oh! is there one of that countless throng surrounding the everlasting
          throne, who has not sung, "It is good for me that I have been
          afflicted?" "And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are
          these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I
          said unto him, Sir, you know. And he said unto me, These are they
          which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and
          made them white in the blood of the Lamb."<br />

              72. The law of Your mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
              and silver.</font

          ><br />

           <br />

          Well might David acknowledge the benefit of affliction, since he had
          thus learned in God's statutes something that was better to him than
          thousands of gold and silver. This was indeed an enlightened judgment
          for one to form, who had so small a part of the law of God's mouth,
          and so large a portion of this world's treasure. And yet, if we study
          only his book of Psalms to know the important uses and privileges of
          this law, and his son's book of Ecclesiastes, to discover the real
          value of paltry gold and silver, we shall, under Divine teaching, be
          led to make the same estimate for ourselves. Yes, believer, with the
          same, or rather with far higher delight than the miser calculates his
          thousands of gold and silver, do you tell out the precious contents of
          the law of your God. After having endeavored in vain to count the
          thousands in your treasure, one single name sums up their value, "the
          unsearchable riches of Christ." Would not the smallest spot of ground
          be estimated at thousands of gold and silver, were it known to conceal
          under its surface a mine of inexhaustible treasure? This it is that
          makes the word so inestimable. It is the field of the "hidden
          treasure." "The pearl of great price" is known to be concealed here.
          You would not, therefore, part with one leaf of your Bible for all the
          thousands of gold and silver. You know yourself to be in possession of
          the substance—you have found all besides to be a shadow. "I lead"—says
          the Savior, "in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of
          judgment; that I may cause them that love me to inherit substance; and
          I will fill their treasures." The grand motive, therefore, in
          "searching the Scriptures," is because "they testify of Christ." A
          sinner has but one want—a Savior. A believer has but one desire—to
          "know and win Christ." With a "single eye," therefore, intent upon one
          point, he studies this blessed book. "With unveiled face he beholds in
          this glass the glory of the Lord:" and no arithmetic can compute the
          price of that, which is now unspeakably better to him than the
          treasures of the earth.<br />

           <br />

          Christian! bear your testimony to your supreme delight in the book of
          God. You have here opened the surface of much intellectual interest
          and solid instruction. But it is the joy that you have found in the
          revelation of the Savior, in His commands, in His promises, in His
          ways, that leads you to exclaim, "More to be desired are they than
          gold, yes, than much fine gold!" Yes, indeed—every promise— every
          declaration—centering in Him, is a pearl; and the word of God is full
          of these precious pearls. If then they be the richest who have the
          best and the largest treasure, those who have most of the word in
          their hearts, not those who have most of the world in their
          possession—are justly entitled to this preeminence. "Let then the word
          of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom." For those who are rich in
          this heavenly treasure are men of substance indeed.<br />

           <br />

          True—this is a correct estimate of the worth of God's law—better than
          this world's treasure. But is it better to me? Is this my decided
          choice? How many will inconsiderately acknowledge its supreme value,
          while they yet hesitate to relinquish even a scanty morsel of earth
          for an interest in it! Do I then habitually prefer this law of God's
          mouth to every worldly advantage? Am I ready to forego every selfish
          consideration, if it may only be the means of uniting my heart more
          closely to the Book of God? If this be not my practical conviction, I
          fear I have not yet opened the mine. But if I can assent to this
          declaration of the man of God, I have made a far more glorious
          discovery than Archimedes; and therefore may take up his expression of
          joyful surprise—'I have found it! I have found it!' What? That which
          the world could never have given me—that of which the world can never
          deprive me.<br />
          <br />

          And—Lord—help me to prize the law as coming from Your mouth. Let it be
          forever written upon my heart. Let me be daily exploring my hidden
          treasures. Let me be enriching myself and all around me with the
          present possession and interest in these heavenly blessings.<br />

           <br />

          Yet how affecting is it to see men poor in the midst of great riches!
          Often in the world we see the possessor of a large treasure—without a
          heart to enjoy it—virtually therefore a pauper. Oftener still in the
          Church do we see professors (may it not be so with some of us?) with
          their Bibles in their hands—yet poor even with the external interest
          in its "unsearchable riches." Often also do we observe a want of value
          for the whole law or revelation of God's mouth. Some parts are highly
          honored to the depreciation of the rest. But let it be remembered that
          the whole of Scripture "is given by inspiration of God and is
          therefore profitable" for its appointed end. Oh! beware of resting
          satisfied with a scanty treasure. Prayer and diligence will bring out
          not only "things new," but the "old" also with a new and brighter
          glow. Scraping the surface is a barren exercise. Digging into the
          affections is a most enriching employ. No vein in this mine is yet
          exhausted. And rich indeed shall we be, if we gather only one atom of
          the gold each day in prayerful meditation. But as you value your
          progress and peace in the ways of God—as you have an eye to your
          Christian perfection—put away that ruinous thought—true as an
          encouragement to the weak, but false as an excuse to the slothful—that
          a little knowledge is sufficient to carry us to heaven.<br />

           <br />

          In the vast universe of wonder, man is the greatest wonder—the noblest
          work of God. A council of the Sacred Trinity was held respecting his
          creation, "God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
          likeness." Every part of creation bears the impress of God. Man—man
          alone—bears His image, His likeness. Everywhere we see His track—His
          footsteps. Here we behold His face. What an amazing thought, that the
          three Eternal subsistents in the glorious Godhead, should have united
          in gracious design and operation towards the dust of the earth! But
          thus man was formed—thus was he raised out of his parent dust, from
          this low original, to be the living temple, and habitation of Divine
          glory—a Being full of God. The first moment that he opened his eyes to
          behold the light and beauty of the new-made world, the Lord separated
          him for His own service, to receive the continual supply of His own
          life. His body was fitted as a tabernacle for his soul, "curiously
          wrought" by the hand of God; and all its parts and "members written in
          this book, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was
          none of them." Most naturally therefore does the contemplation of this
          "perfection of beauty" raise the adoring mind upward, "I will praise
          You; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are Your
          works; and that my soul knows right well." Your hands have made me and
          fashioned me.<br />

           <br />

          Could we suppose that man was formed to eat, to sleep, and to
          die—that, after taking a few turns upon the grand walk of life, he was
          to descend into the world of eternal silence, we might well ask the
          question of God, "Why have You made all men in vain?" But the first
          awakening of man from his death-like sleep enlightens him in the right
          knowledge of the end of his creation. If I am conscious of being the
          workmanship of God, I shall feel my relationship to Him, and the
          responsibility of acting according to it. I would plead then this
          relation before Him in asking for light, life, and love. I cannot
          serve You as a creature, except I be made a new creature. Give me a
          spiritual being, without which my natural being cannot glorify You.
          You have indeed "curiously wrought" my frame; but sin has marred all.
          Make me Your spiritual "workmanship, created in Christ Jesus." Give me
          understanding—spiritual knowledge, that I may learn Your commandments,
          "Renew a right spirit within me."<br />

           <br />

          But the natural man feels no need of this prayer. No, he is puffed up
          in his own wisdom. He cannot receive the Divine testimony, which
          levels him, while he "understands not," with "the beasts that perish,"
          and tells him, that he must "become a fool, that he may be wise." But
          should he ever know his new state of existence, he will offer up this
          prayer eagerly and frequently; and every step of his way heavenward he
          will feel increasing need of Divine "wisdom and spiritual
          understanding."<br />
          <br />

          How does the song of heaven remind us of this end of our creation!,
          "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power! for
          You have created all things; and for Your pleasure they are, and were
          created." In harmony with this song we must acknowledge, that the
          "Lord has made all things for Himself"—that He "created all things for
          His glory." And the recollection that He "created us by Jesus Christ,"
          brings before us the grand work of redemption, and the work of the new
          creation consequent upon it. He who created us in His own image, when
          that image was lost, that He might not lose His property in us, put a
          fresh seal upon His natural right, and "purchased us with His own
          blood." Oh! let us not be insensible to this constraining motive to
          learn His commandments. "You are not your own, for you are bought with
          a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which
          are God's."<b

          How cheering is the sight of a man of God! How refreshing his
          converse! How satisfactory and enlivening is the exhibition of his
          faith! The goodness of God to one becomes thus the joy and comfort of
          all. What an excitement is this to close communion with our God, that
          the light which we thus receive will shine on those around us! What a
          comfort will it be even in our own hour of temptation, that the hope,
          which we may then be enabled to maintain in the word of God, shall
          prove the stay, not only of our own souls, but of the Lord's people!
          Many a desponding Christian, oppressed with such fears as this, "I
          shall one day perish by the hand of Saul"—when he hears of one and
          another exercised in the same trials, and who have hoped in God's
          word, and have not been disappointed, will be glad when he sees them.
          Thus David recorded his conflicts, that we may not despair of our own;
          and his triumphs, that "in the name of our God we might set up our
          banners." "I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of
          the Lord in the land of the living. Wait on the Lord, be of good
          courage, and He shall strengthen your heart: wait, I say, on the
          Lord." Thus also, under affliction, he was comforted with the thought
          of comforting others with the history of his own experience, "My soul
          shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and
          be glad. O praise the Lord with me, and let us magnify His name
          together. He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.
          Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord. Bring my
          soul out of prison, that I may praise Your name; the righteous shall
          compass me about, for You shall deal bountifully with me."<br />

           <br />

          In this view, the believer, who has been "sifted in the sieve" of
          temptation, without the least "grain" of faith or hope "falling upon
          the earth," stands forth as a monument of the Lord's faithfulness, to
          "strengthen the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees, and to say
          to them that are of fearful heart, Be strong, fear not." Those that
          are "fearful, and of little faith," are glad when they see him. They
          "thank God" for him, and "take courage" for themselves. What a motive
          is this to keep us from despondency; that, instead of destroying by
          our unbelief, those who are already "cast down," we may enjoy the
          privilege of upholding their confidence, and ministering to their
          comfort! And how should the weak and distressed seek for and prize the
          society of those, who have been instructed by the discipline of the
          Lord's school!<br />

           <br />

          Believer! what have you to tell to your discouraged brethren of the
          faithfulness of your God? Cannot you put courage into their hearts, by
          declaring that you have never been "ashamed of your hope?" Cannot you
          tell them from your own experience, that Jesus "is for a
          foundation-stone, a tried stone, a sure foundation?" Cannot you show
          them, that, because He has borne the burden of their sins, He is able
          to "bear their griefs, and to carry their sorrows?" that you have
          tried Him, and that you have found Him so? Oh! be animated to know
          more of Christ yourself; let your hope in Him be strengthened, that
          you may cause gladness in the hearts of those that, see you; so that,
          "whether you be afflicted, or whether you be comforted, it may be for
          their consolation and salvation."<br />

           <br />

          But, O my God! how much cause have I for shame, that I impart so
          little of Your glorious light to those around me! Perhaps some poor
          trembling sinner has been glad when he saw me, hoping to hear
          something of the Savior from my lips, and has found me straitened, and
          cold, and dumb. Oh! that I may be so "filled with the Spirit," so
          experienced in Your heavenly ways, that I may invite "all that do not
          fear to come to me," that I may "declare what You have done for my
          soul;" so that, "when men are cast down, they may say, There is
          lifting up."<br />

           <br />

           <b
            ><font color="#FF0000"
              ><br />

              75. I know, O Lord, that Your judgments are right, and that You in
              faithfulness have afflicted me.</font
            ></b
          ><br />

           <br />

          This is the Christian's acknowledgment—fully satisfied with the
          dispensation of God. This is his confidence—so invigorating to his own
          soul—so cheering to the church. The Lord's dealings are called His
          judgments—not as having judicial curses, but as the acts of His
          justice in the chastening of sin. Perhaps also—as the administration
          of His wise judgments in their measure and application. But here is
          not only the confession of the Lord's general judgment, but of His
          especial faithfulness to Himself. And this he knew—not from the
          dictates of the flesh (which would have given a contrary verdict), but
          from the testimony of the word, and the witness of his own experience.
          It could not be doubted—much less denied—'I know, O Lord, that Your
          rules of proceeding are agreeable to Your perfect justice and wisdom;
          and I am equally satisfied, that the afflictions that You have laid
          upon me from time to time, are only to fulfill Your gracious and
          faithful promise of making me eternally happy in Yourself.' Blessed
          fruit of affliction! when we can thus "see the end of the Lord, that
          the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy"—that His "thoughts
          towards us are thoughts of peace, and not of evil!" "The patience and
          faith of the saints" teach this difficult but most consoling lesson,
          in deciphering the mysterious lines in God's providence.<br />

           <br />

          The child of God under the severest chastisement must acknowledge
          justice. Our gracious reward is always more—our "punishment always
          less, than our iniquities deserve." "Why should a living man
          complain?" In trouble he is indeed—but not in hell. If he complain,
          let it be of none but himself, and his own wayward choice. I know, O
          Lord, that Your judgments are right—and who can doubt the wisdom? Who
          would charge the operator with cruelty, in cutting out the proud
          flesh, that was bringing death upon the man? Who would not acknowledge
          the right judgment of his piercing work? Thus, when the Lord's painful
          work separates us from our sin, weans us from the world, and brings us
          nearer to Himself, what remains for us, but thankfully to acknowledge
          His righteousness and truth? Unbelief is put to rebuke; and we, if we
          have indulged suspicion "that God has forgotten to be gracious," must
          confess, "This is our infirmity."<br />

           <br />

          This assurance of the Lord's perfect justice, wisdom, and intimate
          knowledge of our respective cases, leads us to yield to His
          appointments in dutiful silence. Thus Aaron, under his most afflictive
          domestic calamity, "held his peace." Job under a similar dispensation
          was enabled to say, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away:
          blessed be the name of the Lord!" Eli's language in the same trial
          was, "It is the Lord; let Him do what seems Him good." David hushed
          his impatient spirit, "I was dumb; I opened not my mouth, because You
          did it." And when Shimei cursed him, he said, "Let him alone; let him
          curse; for the Lord has bidden him." The Shunammite, in the meek
          resignation of faith, acknowledged, "It is well." Hezekiah kissed the
          rod, while it was smiting him to the dust, "Good is the word of the
          Lord which You have spoken." Thus uniform is the language of the
          Lord's people under chastisement—I know, O Lord, that Your judgments
          are right.<br />

           <br />

          But the confession of justice may be mere natural conviction. Faith
          goes further, and speaks of faithfulness. David not only acknowledges
          God's right to deal with him as He saw fit, and even His wisdom in
          dealing with him as He actually had done, but His faithfulness in
          afflicting—not His faithfulness though He afflicted—but in afflicting
          him; not as if it were consistent with His love, but as the very fruit
          of His love. It is not enough to justify God. What abundant cause is
          there to praise Him! It is not enough to forbear to murmur. How
          exciting is the display of His faithfulness and love! Yes—the trials
          appointed for us are none else than the faithful performance of His
          everlasting engagements. And to this cause we may always trace (and it
          is our privilege to believe it, where we cannot visibly trace it) the
          reason of much that is painful to the flesh. Let us only mark its
          gracious effects in our restoration—instruction—healing of our
          backslidings, and the continual purging of sins—and then say—'Is not
          the faithfulness of God gloriously displayed?' The Philistines could
          not understand Samson's riddle—how "Meat could come out of the eater,
          and sweetness out of the strong." As little can the world comprehend
          the fruitfulness of the Christian's trials; how his gracious Lord
          sweetens to him the bitter waters of Marah, and makes the cross not so
          much the punishment as the remedy of sin. He finds therefore no
          inclination, and he feels that he has no interest in having any change
          made in the Lord's appointments, revolting as they may be to the
          flesh. He readily acknowledges that His merciful designs could not
          have been accomplished in any other way; while under trials many sweet
          tokens of love are given, which, under circumstances of outward
          prosperity, could not have been received with the same gratitude and
          delight.<br />

            <br />

          You that are living at ease in the indulgence of what this poor world
          can afford, how little does the Christian envy your portion! How
          surely in some future day will you be taught by experience to envy
          his! The world's riches are daily becoming poorer, and its pleasures
          more tasteless; and what will they be, and how will they appear, when
          eternity is at hand! Whereas affliction is the special token of our
          Father's love, conformity to the image of Jesus, and preparation for
          His service and kingdom. It is the only blessing that the Lord gives,
          without requiring us to ask for it. We receive it, therefore, as
          promised, not as threatened; and when the "peaceable fruits of
          righteousness," which it works in God's time and way, spring up in our
          hearts, humbly and gratefully will we acknowledge the righteousness of
          His judgments, and the faithfulness of His corrections.
