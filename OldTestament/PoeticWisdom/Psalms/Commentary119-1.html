            This most interesting and instructive Psalm, like the Psalter
            itself, "opens with a Beatitude for our comfort and encouragement,
            directing us immediately to that happiness, which all mankind in
            different ways are seeking and inquiring after. All would secure
            themselves from the incursions of misery; but all do not consider
            that misery is the offspring of sin, from which therefore it is
            necessary to be delivered and preserved, in order to become happy or
            <i>blessed." (Bishop Horne)</i>
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            The <i>undefiled </i>character described in this verse marks, in an
            evangelical sense, "an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit", not
            one who is without sin, but one who in the sincerity of his heart
            can say, "I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do
            not do, but what I hate I do."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            As his <i>way </i>is, so is his<i> "walk"</i>, "in the law of the
            Lord." He is "strengthened in the Lord, and he walks up and down in
            His name;" his "ears hearing a word behind him, saying, This is the
            way—walk in it"—when he is "turning to the right hand or to the
            left." And if the pardon of sin, imputation of righteousness, the
            communion of saints, and a sense of acceptance with God; if
            protection in providence and grace; and—finally and forever, the
            beatific vision, are the sealed privileges of His upright people,
            then there can be no doubt, that
            <i>"blessed are the undefiled in the way." </i>And if temporal
            prosperity, spiritual renovation and fruitfulness, increasing
            illumination, fellowship with the Savior, peace within,
            and—throughout eternity—a right to the tree of life, are privileges
            of incalculable value; then surely
            <i>"the walk in the law of the Lord" </i>

            is "the path of pleasantness and peace." "Truly"—indeed may we say,
            "God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But let each of us ask—What is the <i>"way" </i>of my heart with
            God? Is it always an <i>"undefiled way?"</i> Is "iniquity" never
            "regarded in the heart?" Is all that God hates habitually lamented,
            abhorred, forsaken? "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me,
            and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in me, and
            lead me in the way everlasting."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Again—What is my <i>"walk?" </i>Is it from the living principle of
            union with Christ? This is the direct—the only source of spiritual
            life. We are first quickened in Him. Then we walk in Him and after
            Him. Oh! that this my walk may be steady, consistent, advancing! Oh!
            that I may be ever listening to my Father's voice, "I am the
            Almighty God; walk before me, and be perfect!"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Is there not enough of defilement in the most
            <i> "undefiled way," </i>and enough of inconsistency in the most
            consistent <i> "walk" </i>to endear to us the gracious declaration
            of the gospel, "If any man sins, we have an advocate with the
            Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous?"

              <em

                with the whole heart.</em

          <p align="justify">
            The "testimony," in the singular number, usually denotes the whole
            canon of the inspired writings—the revelation of the will of God to
            mankind—the standard of their faith. <em>"Testimonies"</em> appear,
            chiefly, to mark the <i>preceptive </i>part of Scripture; that part,
            in which this man of God always found his spiritual delight and
            perfect freedom. Mark his language:
            <em
              >"I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, as much us in
              all riches. Your testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever;
              for they are the rejoicing of my heart."</em
            >
            Not, however, that this blessedness belongs to the mere outward act
            of obedience; but rather to that practical habit of mind, which
            seeks to know the will of God in order to <i>"keep" </i>it.<i
            > </i>This habit is under the influence of the promise of God, "I
            will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes,
            and you shall keep my judgments, and do them." And in thus
            <em>"keeping the testimonies of God,"</em> the believer maintains
            the character of one, that
            <em>"seeks Him with the whole heart."</em>
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            Oh! how many seek, and seek in vain, for no other reason, than
            because they do not <i>"seek Him with the whole heart!" </i>The
            worldling's "heart is divided; now shall he be found faulty." The
            professor "with his mouth shows much love; but his heart goes after
            his covetousness." The backslider
            <i>"has not turned unto Me with his whole heart, </i>but feignedly,
            says the Lord." The faithful, upright believer alone brings his
            heart, <i>his whole heart, </i>to the Lord: "When You said, Seek my
            face, my heart said unto You, Your face, Lord, will I seek." For he
            alone has found an object, that attracts and fills his whole heart,
            and, if he had a thousand hearts, would attract and fill them all.
            He has found his way to God by faith in Jesus. In that way he
            continues to seek. His whole heart is engaged to know and love more
            and more. Here alone the blessing is enjoyed, and the promise made
            good:
            <i
              >"You shall seek Me, and find Me, when you shall search for Me
              with all your heart."</i
            >
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            But let me not shrink from the question, Do I
            <i>"keep His testimonies" </i>from constraint, or from love? Surely
            when I consider my own natural aversion and enmity to the law of
            God, and the danger of self-deception in the external service of the
            Lord, I have much need to pray<i
              >, "Incline my heart to Your testimonies. Give me
              understanding—save me, and I shall keep Your testimonies." </i
            >And if they are blessed, who seek the Lord

            <i>with their whole heart, </i>how am I seeking Him? Alas! with how
            much distraction! with how little heart-work! Oh! let me "seek His
            strength" in order to "seek His face."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Lord! search—teach—incline—uphold me. Help me to plead Your gracious
            promise, "I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the Lord;
            and they shall be my people, and I will be their God;
            <i>for they shall return unto Me with their whole heart."</i>

            This was not their character from their birth. Once they were
            <em>doing</em> nothing but <em>iniquity</em>. It was iniquity
            without mixture, without cessation—from the fountain-head. Now it is
            written of them<i>, "they do no iniquity." </i>Once they walked,
            even as others, in the way of their own hearts, "enemies to God by
            wicked works." Now <i>"they walk in His ways." </i>They are "new
            creatures in Christ; old things are passed away; behold! all things
            are become new." This is their highly-privileged state, "Sin shall
            have no dominion over them: for they are not under the law, but
            under grace." They are "born of God, and they cannot practice sin:
            for his seed remains in them, and they cannot sin, because they are
            born of God." Their hatred and resistance to sin are therefore now
            as instinctive, as was their former enmity and opposition to God.
            Not, indeed, that the people of God are as "the saints made
            perfect," who <i>"do no iniquity." </i>This is a dream of
            perfection—unscriptural and self-deluding. The unceasing advocacy of
            their Heavenly Friend evidently supposes the indwelling power of
            sin, to the termination of our earthly pilgrimage. The supplication,
            also, in the prayer of our Lord teaches them to ask for daily pardon
            and deliverance from "temptation," as for "daily bread." Yes—to our
            shame be it spoken—we are sinners still; yet—praised be God!—not
            "walking after the course," not "fulfilling the desires," of sin.
            The acting of sin is now like the motion of a stone upward, violent
            and unnatural. If sin is not cast out, it is dethroned. We are not,
            as before, "its willing people," but its reluctant, struggling
            captives. It is not "the day of its power."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And here lies the holy liberty of the Gospel—not, as some have
            imagined—a liberty to "continue in sin, that grace may abound"; but
            a deliverance from the guilt and condemnation
            <i>of abhorred, resisted, yet still indwelling, sin. </i>When our
            better will has cast it off—when we can say in the sight of a
            heart-searching God<i>, "What we hate, that do we"</i>—the
            responsibility is not ours: "It is not we who do it, but sin which
            dwells in us."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Still let us inquire, is the promise of deliverance from sin sweet
            to us? And does our successful resistance in the spiritual conflict
            realize the pledge of its complete fulfillment? Blessed Jesus! what
            do, we owe to Your cross for the present redemption from its guilt
            and curse, and much more for the blissful prospect of the glorified
            state, when this hated sin shall be an inhabitant no more forever!
            Oh, let us take the very print of Your death into our souls in the
            daily crucifixion of sin. Let us know the "power of Your
            resurrection," in a habitual "walk in newness of life."

            We have seen the character of the Man of God. Let us mark the
            authority of God, <i>commanding </i>him to a
            <i>diligent </i>obedience. The very sight of the command is enough
            for him. He obeys for the <i> command's </i>sake, however contrary
            it may be to his own will. But has he any reason to complain of the
            yoke? Even under the dispensation, which "genders unto bondage" most
            encouraging were the obligations to obedience<i
              >, "that it may be well </i
            >with them, and with their children forever." Much more, then, we,
            under a dispensation of love, can never lack a motive for obedience!
            Let the daily mercies of Providence stir up the question, "What
            shall I render to the Lord?" Let the far richer mercies of grace
            produce "a living sacrifice" to be "presented to the Lord." Let "the
            love of Christ constrain us." Let the recollection of the "price
            with which we were bought," remind us of the Lord's ownership in us,
            and of our obligations to "glorify Him in our body, and in our
            spirit, which are His." Let us only "behold the Lamb of God;" let us
            hear His wrestling supplications, His deserted cry, His expiring
            agonies—the price of our redemption; and then let us ask
            ourselves—Can we lack a motive?
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But what is the scriptural character of evangelical obedience? It is
            the work of the Spirit, enabling us to "obey the truth." It is the
            end of the purpose of God, who "has chosen us in Christ before the
            foundation of the world, <i>that we should be </i>holy and without
            blame before Him in love." It is the only satisfactory test of our
            profession.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Then let me begin my morning with the inquiry, "Lord, what will You
            have me to do?" "Teach me Your way, O Lord; I will walk in Your
            truth; unite my heart to fear Your name." Let me trade with all my
            talents for You: ever watchful, that I may be employed in Your work;
            setting a guard upon my thoughts, my lips, my tempers, my pursuits,
            that nothing may hinder, but rather everything may help me, in
            <i>keeping Your precepts diligently.</i>

          <p align="justify">
            But why do I ever find <i>the precepts </i>to be "grievous" to me?
            Is it not that some indolence is indulged; or some "iniquity
            regarded in my heart;" or some principle of unfaithfulness divides
            my services with two masters, when I ought to be "following the Lord
            fully?" Oh! for the spirit of "simplicity and godly sincerity" in
            the precepts of God. Oh! for that warm and constant love, which is
            the main-spring of devoted diligence in the service of God. Oh! for
            a larger supply of that "wisdom which is from above," and which is

            The Lord has indeed <i>"commanded us to keep His precepts." </i>But,
            alas! where is our power? Satan would make the sense of our weakness
            an excuse for indolence. The Spirit of God convinces us of it, as an
            incitement to prayer, and an exercise of faith. If, Reader, your
            heart is right with God, you "consent to the law that it is good;"
            you "delight in it after the inner man;" you would not have one jot
            or tittle altered, mitigated, or repealed, that it might be more
            conformed to your own will, or allow you more liberty or
            self-indulgence in the ways of sin. But do you not sigh to think,
            that, when you aim at the perfect standard of holiness, you should,
            at your best moments, and in your highest attainments, fall so far
            below it; seeing indeed the way before you, but feeling yourself
            without ability to walk in it? Then let a sense of your helplessness
            for the work of the Lord lead you to the throne of grace, to pray,
            and watch, and wait, for the strengthening and refreshing influences
            of the Spirit of grace. Here let your faith realize at one and the
            same view your utter insufficiency, and your complete
            All-sufficiency. Here behold Him, who is ever presenting Himself
            before God as our glorious Head, receiving in Himself, according to
            the good pleasure of the Father, the full supply for this and every
            successive moment of inexpressible need. Our work is not therefore
            left upon our own hands, or wrought out at our "own charges." So
            long as he has the "Spirit of grace" he will be found
            "sufficient"—Divine "strength will be made perfect in weakness."
            "Without Him we can do nothing;" "through Him, all things." Even the
            "worm Jacob shall thresh the mountains," when the Lord says, "Fear
            not, I will help you."

            In connecting this verse with the preceding, how accurately is the
            middle path preserved, equally distant from the idea of
            self-sufficiency to <i>"keep the Lord's statutes," </i>and self
            justification in neglecting them! The first attempt to render
            spiritual obedience will quickly convince us of our utter
            helplessness. We might as soon create a world, as create in our
            hearts one pulse of spiritual life. And yet our inability does not
            cancel our obligation. Shall God lose His right, because sin has
            palsied our ability? Is not a drunken servant still under his
            master's law? and is not the sin which prevents him from performing
            his duty, not his excuse, but his aggravation? Thus our weakness is
            that of a heart, which "cannot be subject to the law of God," only
            because it is carnal, "enmity against God." The obligation therefore
            remains in full force. Our inability is our sin, our guilt, and
            condemnation.

          <p align="justify">
            What then remains for us, but to return the mandate to heaven,
            accompanied with an earnest prayer, that the Lord would write upon
            our hearts those <i>statutes,</i> to which He requires obedience in
            His word?<i
              >, "You have commanded us to keep Your statutes diligently." </i
            >We acknowledge, Lord, our obligation; but we feel our impotency.
            Lord, help us: we look unto You.<i>
              "Oh that our ways were directed to keep Your statutes!" </i
            >"Give what You command—and then command what You will."
            (Augustine.)
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Now, as if to exhibit the fullness and suitableness of the promises
            of the gospel, the commands and prayers are returned back again from
            heaven with promises of quickening and directing grace. Thus does
            the Lord fully answer His end with us. He did not issue the
            commands, expecting that we could turn our own hearts to them; but
            that the conviction of our entire helplessness might cast us upon
            Him, who loves to be sought, and never will be thus sought in vain.
            And indeed this is a part of the "mystery of godliness," that in
            proportion as we depend upon Him who is alike, "the Lord our
            righteousness," and our strength; our desire after holiness will
            increase, and our prayers become more fervent. He who commands our
            duty, perfectly knows our weakness; and he who feels his own
            weakness is fully encouraged to depend upon the power of his Savior.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Faith is then the principle of evangelical obedience, and the
            promises of His grace enable us for duty, at the very time that we
            are commanded to it. In this view are brought together the supreme
            authority of the Lawgiver, the total insufficiency of the creature,
            the full provisions of the Savior, and the all-sufficiency of "the
            God of grace." We pray for what we lack; we are thankful for what we
            have; we trust for what is promised. Thus "all is of God." Christ
            "is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first
            and the last." Thus "grace reigns" triumphant. The foundation is
            laid in grace, and the headstone will be brought forth with
            shoutings, crying, "Grace, grace unto it!" The Savior's work is
            finished, and Jesus is crowned Lord of all forever.

            The Lord expects our obedience to be not only
            <i> "diligent," </i>but universal. Willingly to dispense with the
            least of the

            <i>commandments,</i> proves that we have yet to learn the spirit of
            acceptable obedience. Grace is given and suited for all, no less
            than for one of them, "that we might walk worthy of the Lord
            <i>unto all pleasing." </i>One lust "regarded in the heart" is
            sufficient to keep possession for the tyrant, however others may be
            restrained. Even Herod could "do many things;" and yet his
            adulterous wife cherished in his bosom, too plainly proved the
            sovereignty of sin to be undisturbed. Saul slew all the Amalekites
            <i>but one; </i>and that single exception to universal obedience
            marked his unsoundness, cost him the loss of his throne, and brought
            him under the awful displeasure of his God. And thus the one corrupt
            unmortified member brings the whole body to hell. Reserves are the
            canker upon godly sincerity. A secret indulgence, "the rolling of
            the sweet morsel under the tongue," "the part of the price kept
            back"—stamps our service as a robbery, not as an offering. We may be
            free, sincere, and earnest in many parts of our prescribed duty; but
            this "root of bitterness" renders the whole an abomination.

          <p align="justify">
            Sincerity therefore must be the stamp of my Christian profession.
            Though utterly unable to render perfect obedience to the least of
            the commandments, yet my desire and purpose will
            <i>have respect unto them all. </i>I shall no more venture to break
            the least, than the greatest of them; much less shall I ever think
            of attempting to atone for the breach of one by the performance of
            the rest. They are indeed many commandments; yet—like links in a
            chain—they form but one law; and I know who has said, "Whoever shall
            keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of
            all."

            However the professor may confine his regard to the second table (as
            if the first were ceremonial, or obsolete, or the regulation of the
            outward man was the utmost extent of the requirement,) I would fix
            my eye with equal regard to both; yet specially marking any command
            in either of them; that may appear most directly opposed to my
            besetting corruptions. Thus "walking in the fear of the Lord," I may
            hope to walk "in the comfort of the Holy Spirit" and "hereby shall I
            know that I am of the truth, and shall assure my heart before God."

            But where, in my strictest walk, is my hope of acceptance, but in
            Him, whose obedience has "fulfilled all righteousness" in my stead,
            and whose death "has redeemed me from the curse" of my
            unrighteousness, when repentance, prayers, and tears, would have
            been of no avail? Yet it is only in the path of holiness that we can
            realize our acceptance. The heart occupied with this world's
            pleasure knows nothing of this heavenly joy. Its brightness is
            dimmed—its freshness fades—its life withers—in the very breath of an
            unholy world. A godly assurance of the present favor of God must be
            weakened by self-indulgence, unwatchfulness, allowance of secret
            sins, or neglect of secret duties. "If you return to the
            Almighty"—said a wise man, "you shall be built up,<i>
              you shall put away iniquity </i
            >far from yourself. <i>Then </i>shall you have your delight in the

            Let us then carefully examine the character of our assurance. Does
            it rest simply and exclusively upon the testimony of the Gospel?
            Will it abide the test of the word of God? Is it productive of
            tenderness of conscience, watchfulness, and circumspection of
            conduct? Does it exercise our diligence in adding grace to grace,
            that we may "make our calling and election sure," and that "an
            entrance may be ministered to us <i> abundantly </i>into the
            everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?" How boldly
            can we plead our Christian confidence in the path of godliness<i

          the whole revelation of His word—so called—as the rule by which He
          judges our present state, and will pronounce our final sentence.
          David's attainments here seemed to be as nothing. So much remained
          unlearned and unknown, that he could only anticipate the time,
          <i>when he shall have learned </i>them. <i> "Your commandment"</i>—he
          exclaims, "is <i>exceedingly broad." </i>When the Apostle, after
          twenty years' acquaintance with the gospel, expressed it as the one
          desire of his heart, "That I may know Christ;" evidently he
          entertained the same humbling views of his high attainments, and the
          same exalted apprehensions of the value of treasures yet unexplored,
          and progressively opening before him. Thus the wisest saints are only
          students in the Divine School. Yet whatever their <i>learning </i>be,
          it casts them into the mold and spirit of their doctrine. Conceit of
          one's knowledge, is the greatest enemy to knowledge, and the strongest
          proof of ignorance; so that, "if any man thinks that he knows
          anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know." "He deceives
          himself."
          <p align="justify">
            But what is the motive, that enlivens the believer in this holy
            <em>learning?</em> Is it that he may live upon the airy breath of
            human applause? No, rather that he may
            <em>"praise his God with uprightness of heart."</em> When our mind
            is dark, our lips are sealed. But when "He opens our understandings"
            to <em>"learn His judgments,"</em> He will next "open our lips, and
            our mouth shall show forth His praise." And this indeed is the end
            for which "His people are formed;" for which they "are called out of
            darkness into marvelous light." This is the daily frame, in which
            our God will be glorified. Yet must we live as well as sing His
            praise. <em>"The praise of the upright heart</em> will be shown in
            the holy walk and conversation."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But let us watch, that our <em>praise</em> really flows "out of the
            abundance" of what our hearts have <em>"learned"</em> of His
            <em> "righteous judgments."</em> For do we not sometimes speak of
            our Savior with a secret lurking after self-exaltation? May we not
            really be seeking and serving ourselves in the very act of seeming
            to serve and honor Him? Surely the very thought of the selfishness
            that defiles our holiest earthly praise, may well quicken our
            longings after that world of praise, where the flame burns active,
            bright, incessant; where we shall offer our sacrifices without
            defilement, without intermission, without weariness, without end!

            The resolution to <em>"keep the Lord's statutes"</em> is the natural
            result of having <em>"learned His righteous judgments."</em> But how
            happily does David combine "simplicity" of dependence with "godly
            sincerity" of obedience! Firm in his purpose, but distrustful of his
            strength, instantly upon forming his resolution, he recollects that
            the performance is beyond his power; and therefore the next moment,
            and almost the same moment, he follows it up with prayer,
            <em>"I will keep Your statutes: O forsake me not utterly." </em>Oh!
            beware of self-confidence in the Christian course. We stumble or
            advance, as we lean upon an arm of flesh, or upon an Almighty
            Savior.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Temporary desertion may be the seasonable chastisement of spiritual
            wantonness. When grace has been given in answer to prayer, it was
            not duly prized, or diligently improved. The "Beloved"—in answer to
            solicitation, "has come into His garden," He knocks at the door, but
            the spouse is "asleep." The answer to prayer was not expected, not
            waited for, and therefore not enjoyed; and the sleeper awakes too
            late, and finds herself forsaken by the object of her desire.
            Again—when we have given place to temptation; when love for our
            Savior "waxes cold," and our earnestness in seeking Him is fainting;
            we must not be surprised, if we are left for a time to the trial of
            a deserted state.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Yet we sometimes speak of the hidings of God's countenance, as if it
            were a sovereign act, calling for implicit submission; when the
            cause should at least be sought for, and will generally be found, in
            some "secret thing" of indulgence, unwatchfulness, or
            self-dependence. It was while David "kept silence" from the language
            of contrition, that he felt the pressure of the heavy hand of his
            frowning God. And may not the darkness, which has sometimes clouded
            our path, be the voice of our God, "Your own wickedness shall
            correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you; know therefore
            and see, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have forsaken
            the Lord your God."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But in the engagement of the Lord's everlasting covenant, how clear
            is the warrant of faith!—how ample the encouragement for prayer<i
              >, "</i
            ><em>Forsake me not utterly!"</em> David knew and wrote of the
            Lord's unchangeable faithfulness to His people; and while he dreaded
            even a temporary separation from his God more than any worldly
            affliction, he could plead that gracious declaration, "Nevertheless,
            my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor permit my
            faithfulness to fail."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            We would not indeed make the promises of grace an encouragement to
            carelessness: yet it is indispensable to our spiritual establishment
            that we receive them in their full, free, and sovereign declaration.
            How many fainting souls have been refreshed by the assurances, "For
            a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I
            gather you: with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you, says
            the Lord your Redeemer!" "My sheep shall never perish; neither shall
            any pluck them out of My hand." In a lowly, self-abased, and
            dependent spirit, we shall best, however, learn to "make our boast
            in the Lord;" "confident of this very thing, that he who has begun a
            good work in us, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ." And
            even if awhile destitute of sensible consolation, still our language
            will be, "I will wait upon the Lord, who hides His face from the
            house of Jacob; and I will look for Him."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Great, indeed, is the danger and evil to the soul, if we apprehend
            the Lord to have forsaken us, because we are in darkness; or that we
            are out of the way, because we are in perplexity. These are the very
            hand-posts, that show us that we are in the way of His own promised
            leading—painful exercise—faithful keeping—eternal salvation: "I will
            bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in
            paths that they have not known; I will make darkness light before
            them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them,
            <em>and not forsake them."</em>

            Oh! the rest—the satisfaction of placing an implicit confidence in a
            covenant-keeping God!
          </p>
          <em> <p align="justify">Forsaken</p></em> we may be—but not
          <em>utterly</em>. David was <em>forsaken,</em> not like Saul. Peter
          was <em>forsaken,</em> not like Judas, <em>utterly</em> and forever.
          What foreboding have you of such desertion? Is your heart willing to
          forsake Him? Have you no mournings and thirstings for His return? "If,
          indeed, you forsake Him, He will <em>forsake</em>

          you." But can you forsake Him? 'Let Him do as seems good to Him (is
          the language of your heart); I will wait for Him, follow after Him,
          cleave to His word, cling to His cross.' Mark His dealings with you.
          Inquire into their reason. Submit to His dispensation. If He
          <em>forsakes,</em> beg His return: but trust your
          <em>forsaking</em> God. "Though He slays me, yet will I trust in Him."
          Though my comfort is clouded, my hope remains unchanging,
          unchangeable—such as I would not resign for the glory of an earthly
          kingdom. What are these earnest breathings—this abiding confidence,
          but His own work in us? And can the Lord "forsake the work of His own
          hands?" Sooner should heaven and earth pass, than the faithful
          engagements of the gospel be thus broken.

            Why is the young man so especially called to <em>cleanse</em>

            that the youth of man—the bloom and freshness of his mind, "his
            first love"—should naturally be devoted to the service of sin? Ever
            since fallen man "begat a son in his own likeness," "the imagination
            of man's heart has been evil from his youth." For "who can bring a
            clean thing out of an unclean?" And never does the heart utter the
            cry, "My Father! You are the guide of my youth," until the misery of
            wandering without a guide has been painfully felt. And even when
            Divine grace has awakened the desire to return homewards, the habit
            of wandering from God, and the long-cherished pollutions of sin,
            seem to form an almost invincible barrier to progress.

          <p align="justify">
            The fearful power of "youthful lusts," and the madness with which
            the heart is hurried into forbidden indulgences, give solemn weight
            to the inquiry,
            <em>"How shall a young man cleanse his way?"</em> And the answer is
            ready. Let him <em>"take heed thereto according to Your word."</em>

            Thus did Joseph, and Daniel with his young companions,
            <em>"cleanse their way"</em> in the defilement of an heathen
            atmosphere. It was probably the recollection of this purifying
            efficacy of the word, that induced the venerable Beza to mention in
            his will, among his chief matters of thankfulness to God—the mercy
            of having been called to the knowledge of the truth at the age of
            sixteen; thus, during a course of more than seventy years' walk with
            God, "escaping the pollutions of the world through lust." But the
            <em>"way can only be cleansed"</em> by the cleansing of the heart;
            for how can a corrupt fountain "send forth" other than "bitter
            waters?" "Out of the heart are the issues of life." Hence the urgent
            need to cry, "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right
            spirit within me."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            How precious, therefore, is <em>the word of God,</em> as the means
            of this cleansing operation! When our Savior had been setting forth
            Himself as "the way, the truth, and the life," and exhibiting the
            high privilege of union with Himself, "Now," He adds,
            <em
              >"you are clean, through the word which I have spoken unto you." </em
            >This is "the truth," which He pleaded with His Father as the means
            of our sanctification. This sets out our purifying hope. Here are
            the promises, by which we "cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
            flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." Thus is
            restored to man that golden "crown"—the stamp of his Maker's
            holiness—which "fell from his head when he sinned."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But oh! how does the recollection force itself upon us, that our way
            needs daily <em>cleansing!</em> so defiled are our actions, our
            thoughts, our motives—no more, our prayers and services. Let us then
            <em> "take heed according to the word of God"</em>—specially
            thankful for its heavenly light, which guides us to the "Fountain,
            that is opened for sin and for uncleanness." Let us also, under the
            same Divine light, seek for the daily sanctifying influence of the
            Spirit of God.

            Attention to the word, however important, can never be practically
            effective without earnest prayer. Indeed this is the character of
            the Lord's people, "a generation of <em>seekers;"</em> and yet how
            much do we lose of the comfort of our religion, and obscure the
            glory of our profession, by neglecting to bring
            <em>"our whole heart"</em> to this work! When sin is vigorous, and
            our spiritual affections are dull, and various hindrances combine in
            prayer—at this crisis strong faith is needed to overcome and to
            persevere. But here the soul too commonly yields to the difficulty,
            and contents itself either with heartless complainings, or with just
            sufficient exertion to quiet the voice of conscience, and produce a
            delusive peace within. But the Lord will not be found thus. His
            promise is not to such seekers as these; and if we are satisfied
            with this state, we must look for a very scanty measure of spiritual
            success, accompanied with the total absence of spiritual enjoyment.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            In a far different spirit David could appeal, "<em
              >With my whole heart have I sought You."</em
            >
            And this assurance, instead of producing self-confidence, will, so
            far as it is genuine, invariably show itself in a prayerful
            acknowledgment of our weakness<i>, "</i
            ><em>O let me not wander from Your commandments."</em> Yet the
            feeblest desire and attempt to seek the Lord is the Spirit's rising
            beam in the heart, a "day of small things" not to be "despised." It
            is distinguished from every other principle by the simplicity of its
            object, "This one thing I do. One thing have I desired of the Lord;
            that will I seek after." My God! my Savior!
            <em>with my whole heart have I sought You.</em> "The desire of my
            soul is to Your name, and to the remembrance of You. With my soul
            have I desired You in the night; yes, with my spirit within me will
            I seek You early."

            When the soul is thus conscious of "following the Lord fully," there
            is a peculiar <em>dread of wandering.</em> In a careless or
            half-hearted state, wanderings are not watched, so long as they do
            not lead to any open declension. Secret prayer will be hurried over,
            worldly thoughts unresisted, waste of time in frivolous pursuits
            indulged, without much concern. Not so, when the heart is
            <em>fully</em> in pursuit of its object. There is a carefulness,
            lest wandering thoughts should become habitual. There is a
            resistance of the first step, that might lead into a devious path.
            The soul remembers the "wormwood and the gall," "the roaring lion,"
            and the devouring wolf; and in the recollection of the misery of its
            former wandering, dreads any departure from the Shepherd's fold.

            This blessed state of mind the flock of Christ should cherish with
            godly jealousy. Yet let it be remembered, that daily progress in the
            heavenly walk is not maintained by yesterday's grace. Humble and

            What an aggregate of guilt and misery is comprehended in this short
            word "sin"! Sin is the greatest curse that ever entered the universe
            of God, and the parent of every other curse! Its guilt is aggravated
            beyond the conception of thought. Injury to a Superior—a Father—a
            Sovereign! Its power is misery wherever it extends—in the family—in
            the world. In eternity its power is unrestrained. Sometimes the
            death-bed scene casts a fearful gleam of light upon "the worm that
            never dies, and the fire that never shall be quenched." But
            experience alone, can develop its full-grown horrors.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            How supremely important therefore is the object of our preservation
            from sin! and how wisely adapted are the means to the end! That

            <em>word—</em>which the man of God had just before mentioned as the
            guide to the <em>cleansing of the way</em>—he
            <em>hides within his heart</em>—not for concealment, but for
            security, that it may be ready for constant use. It is not therefore
            a mere acquaintance with <em>the word,</em> that will avail us.
            There must be a cordial assent—a sound digestion—a constant respect.
            It must be to us the rule that we would not transgress—the treasure
            that we are afraid to lose.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Often indeed Satan shuts out its entrance. He "catches away that
            which was sown." Too often, again, it is "withered or choked" in the
            soil. But "the honest and good heart" <em>"hides it,</em> keeps it,
            and brings forth fruit with perseverance, unto perfection."Here it
            "dwells richly in all wisdom," the storehouse, as occasion requires;
            a principle of holiness; a covering from sin. In this view it is
            recommended by one who had well acquainted himself with its valuable
            uses: "My son, let them (the Divine precepts) not depart from your
            eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion. So shall they be life to
            your soul, and grace to your neck. Then shall you walk in your way
            safely, and your foot shall not stumble." David also gives us the
            same experience: "By the word of Your lips I have kept myself from
            the paths of the destroyer." And it was probably this recollection,
            combined with a sense of continual danger, that suggested the
            prayer, "Order my steps in Your word; and let not any iniquity have
            dominion over me."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The value of <em>the word</em> is inestimable, as our means of
            walking with God in the hurry, business, and temptation of the day.
            The <b>Psalms </b>furnish precious materials for spontaneous prayer;
            the <b> promises</b>, food for comfort; the <b>rules</b>, such light
            in perplexity; the instruction, such solid matter for godly
            conference—all operating for one end—a preservation from sin. Being
            from <em>the word</em>—a manifestation of the Savior's love—what a
            keeping of the heart! what a quickening motive! How seasonable in
            worldly temptation is the warning of

            <em>the word</em> <em>hidden</em> in the heart, "No man, having put
            his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of
            God!" So in the spiritual conflict, let this <em>word</em>, "Him who
            comes to Me, I will never cast out," be
            <em>hidden in the heart</em>—what a preservation is it against
            unbelief!
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Take <em>the word</em> to the wavering believer, alarmed by ridicule
            or persecution, "If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me
            before it hated you." Fearing that he shall never hold out to the
            end; "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Trembling lest his
            sins should rise up to his condemnation, "The blood of Jesus Christ
            the Son of God cleanses from all sin." And then as to duties: Let
            his Savior's <em>word</em> rebuke his indolence and unwatchfulness,
            "What! could you not watch with Me one hour? Watch and pray, that
            you enter not into temptation." Hide in the heart the sorrowful
            story of His agony in the garden, and His death on the cross, that
            "sin may appear yet more exceedingly sinful."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But how is <em>the word</em> to gain entrance into hearts like ours?
            How shall it be <em>"hid"</em> in so unkindly a soil? No power of
            man surely can plant it there. The Holy Spirit's Almighty agency
            must be diligently sought; for in proportion as we are filled with
            His gracious influence shall we be armed, as was our Master, for the
            effectual resistance of our spiritual temptations.

          <p align="justify">
            Lastly, connected with this subject, mark
            <em>the Christian's character</em>, "In whose heart is my law." His
            <em>security</em>, "None of his steps shall slide." His
            <em>happiness</em>, "O how I love Your law." His <em>victory</em>,
            "The word of God abides in him, and he has overcome the wicked one."
            All infallibly provided by the covenant promise, "I will put My law
            in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts." Oh! let us not
            then shrink from a close contact with <em>the word,</em> though the
            cost may be the cutting off a right hand for the saving of the life.
            There is no better test of our security, than our willingness to
            come to the searching light of <em>the word.</em>

            "Praise is lovely for the upright." It is at once their duty and
            their privilege. But what does highest exercise amount to, when
            placed on the ground of its own merit? We clothe our ideas with
            magnificence of language, and deck them out with all the richness of
            imagery; and perhaps we are pleased with our forms of praise. But
            what are they in His sight beyond the offering of a contemptible
            worm, spreading before its Maker its own mean and low notions of
            Divine Majesty? If a worm were to raise its head, and cry—'O sun!
            You are the source of light and heat to a widely-extended
            universe'—it would, in fact, render a higher praise to the sun, than
            we can ever give to our Maker. Between it and us there is some
            proportion—between us and God none. Yet, unworthy as the offering
            confessedly is, He will not despise it. No, more, instead of
            spurning it from His presence, He has revealed Himself as
            "inhabiting the praises of Israel;" thus intimating to us, that the
            service of praise is "set forth in His sight as incense;" and at the
            same time, that it should be the daily and unceasing exercise of one
            at his own home.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The true character of praise, however, depends entirely upon the
            state of the heart. In the contemplative philosopher it is only
            cheerless, barren admiration: in the believer it becomes a principle
            of comfort and encouragement. For, can he forget the revelation,
            which his God has given of Himself in the gospel of His dear Son;
            how it divests every attribute of its terrors, and shines before us
            in all the glory of His faithfulness and love? The ascription of
            praise, "<em>Blessed are You, O Lord,"</em> frames itself therefore
            into the prophet's song, "Who is a God like You, who pardons
            iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of His
            heritage? He retains not His anger forever, because He delights in
            mercy."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Truly then He is<em> "blessed"</em> in Himself, and delights to
            communicate His blessedness to His people. Hence we are emboldened
            to ask for continual <em>"teaching in His statutes,"</em> in the
            truths which He has revealed, and the precepts which He has
            enjoined; that we may "be followers of Him, as dear children," and
            "walk with Him in love."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The practical influence, however, of Divine light, constitutes its
            peculiar privilege. Man's teaching puffs up—God's teaching humbles.
            Man's teaching may lead us into error as well as into truth—God's
            teaching is "the unction from the Holy One, by which we know all
            things." Man's teaching may make us more learned—God's teaching
            makes us more holy. It persuades, while it enlightens. It draws the
            heart, inclines the will, and carries out the soul to Christ. The
            tried character of God encourages us to look for His teaching<i
              >, "</i
            ><em>Good and upright</em> is the Lord; <em> therefore</em> will He
            teach sinners in the way." Our warrant is especially confirmed in
            approaching Him as our covenant God, "Lead me in Your truth, and
            <em>teach me; for You are the God of my salvation.</em> Teach me to
            do Your will: <em>for You are my God."</em>

            surrounded as you are with the means of instruction, what progress

            blessings are the gracious reward of thus honoring our God. This
            also is the material of our general conversation, fruitful in

            Samaria her neighbors, to Jesus. What might we not do for our
            fellow-sinners, if our conversation with them was the overflowing of
            a heart full of love; guided by a single desire to glorify our
            Savior, and to edify His Church! Fearful, indeed, is the guilt of
            sinful silence; and those, who thus prove their unfaithfulness to
            God, may well tremble at His awful denunciations. And yet it is
            possible to be bold in speech for God, when in the closet, the
            family, or the world, our consciences justly convict us of
            insincerity: "You who teach another, do you not teach yourself?" Let
            us seek, therefore, to have our hearts "filled with the Spirit";
            otherwise ours will be "the talk of the lips, which tends only to
            poverty."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            This subject illustrates the <em>character</em> of the Lord's
            people, "The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue
            talks of judgment;" <em>their resolution</em>, "My mouth shall show
            forth Your righteousness and Your salvation all the day; for I know
            not the numbers thereof;" <em>their prayer</em>, "O Lord, open my
            lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise;"
            <em>their blessing</em>, "The lips of the righteous feed many. A
            wholesome tongue is a tree of life." The example of the Savior, here
            as everywhere, is our perfect and encouraging pattern: "I have
            preached righteousness in the great congregation; Lo! I have not
            refrained My lips, O Lord, You know." In this spirit of their
            Master, the Apostles awed their persecutors into forbearance: "We
            cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            How sinful is it to employ our lips for any but the Lord! Yet not
            less sinful is our reluctance to employ them for Him! Surely the
            day, when perhaps we have been fluent in worldly conversation, and
            yet have neglected our opportunities of speaking a word for Him,
            must be considered a lost day! Is there not much cause for
            watchfulness, prayer, and self-denial; lest our silence should deny
            Him, whom by every obligation we are bound to confess? If our
            inability to bear a testimony for our Lord is not painful to us,
            must we not suspect, if not the sincerity, at least the strength, of
            our attachment to His precious name? and we can do no better than
            retire into our closets with the prayer of contrition, "Enter not
            into judgment with Your servant, O Lord."

            How natural is it to be speaking of that which is our delight! The
            man of God was always <em>declaring the Lord's judgments,</em>

            because they were his <em>rejoicing. </em>There is indeed a real joy
            in despising earthly joys. "How sweet"—said Augustine, referring to
            the period of his conversion, "was it in a moment to be free from
            those delightful vanities, to lose which had been my dread; to part
            with which was now my joy!" More satisfying is the believer's
            <em>rejoicing in the way of God,</em>

            than that of the miser in his untold riches. Here he may safely say
            to his soul, "Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take
            your ease." And these are the only riches within the reach of all.
            If we are poor in this world, it is the Lord's providence. If we are
            poor in grace, it is our own fault. It is because we have despised
            our Lord's "counsel to buy from Him gold tried in the fire, that we
            may be rich." And what is this enriching portion?, "Things present
            or things to come;" something enjoyed, and much more expected: the
            mercies of eternity added to the blessings of time; the riches of
            both worlds—all assured to him by the covenant of grace
            <em>"in the way of the Lord's testimonies."</em>
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Is it not then most strange, that, with such treasure in possession
            and in prospect, the child of God should be so careless in
            increasing his store, and in confirming his own interest in it? But
            the <em> riches of God's testimonies</em> have this peculiar
            property, that they cease to rejoice the heart, when they are not
            uppermost there. Have there not been times, when we have actually
            rejoiced in the accession of some worldly good, or the
            accomplishment of some worldly desire, more than in this heavenly
            treasure? What then do we count our <em>riches?</em> To thrive in
            grace, or in the world? To be rich towards God, or for our own
            indulgence?
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But though we would <em>rejoice in the testimonies,</em>

            and would not, for all this world can afford, lose a verse or a
            letter of our Bibles, yet we cannot be satisfied with a general
            interest. Many texts—doctrinal, practical, or experimental—have been
            specially sealed by the Divine Spirit upon our hearts. This or that
            promise—yes, all the land of promise, as much as I can set my foot
            upon—is mine. From these precious <em> testimonies,</em> shall we
            not increase our little stock, until we have apprehended the full
            enjoyment of the whole; if indeed the fullness of that which is
            called "unsearchable" can ever be, in this life at least, completely
            enjoyed?  
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But it is not so much in the Lord's testimonies, as
            <em> "in the way of them,"</em> that David rejoiced—the way to God,
            of which they testify; "the way of holiness," in which they lead—the
            narrow way of the cross—so contrary to our natural desires and
            inclinations, that none but the true sheep of Christ can ever enter,
            or continue in it. Who that walks in these <em>ways</em> will fail
            to find them, in duties no less than in privileges, "paths of
            pleasantness and peace?" Our happiness is not withered, but
            flourishing. "Thus says the Lord, Stand in the ways, and see, and
            ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and
            you shall find rest for your souls."

            Our <em>rejoicing in the testimonies of God</em> will naturally flow
            in a habitual <em>meditation in them.</em> The thoughts follow the
            affections. The carnal man can never be brought to this resolution.
            Having no spiritual taste, he has no ability for spiritual
            <em> meditation</em>. Indeed many sincere Christians, through
            remaining weakness and depravity, are too often reluctant to it.
            They are content with indolent reading: and, with scarcely a
            struggle or a trial, yield themselves up to the persuasion, that
            they are unable sufficiently to abstract their minds for this
            blessed employment. But let the trial prove the work. Perseverance
            will accomplish the victory over mental instability, and the
            spiritual difficulty will give way to prayer, "Lord! help me."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The fruitfulness of meditation will soon be manifest. Does it not
            "stir up the gift of God that is in us," and keep the energies of
            the heart in a wakeful posture of conflict and resistance? Besides
            this, meditation is the digestive faculty of the soul, which
            converts the word into real and proper nourishment: so that this
            revolving of a single verse in our minds is often better than the
            mere reading of whole chapters. "Your words were found, and
            <em>I ate them;</em> and Your word was to me the joy and the
            rejoicing of my heart." Thus the mind becomes the instrument of
            faith and love—of joy and strength.  
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But this meditation not only includes the stated times of thought,
            but the train of holy thoughts, that pass through the mind during
            the busy hours of the day. This maintains a habitual flow of
            spiritual desires, and excites the flame of love within, until at
            length the Psalmist's resolution becomes the inwrought habit of our
            minds<i>, "</i><em>I will meditate in Your precepts."</em>
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Can we lack a subject for meditation, if indeed the salvation of
            Jesus has been made known to our souls? While musing upon the
            glorious theme, does not "the fire burn" within, as if our hearts
            were touched with a live coal from the altar of God? Chide then,
            believer, your dull and sluggish spirit, that permits the precious
            manna to lie ungathered upon the ground, that is slow to entertain
            these heavenly thoughts, or rather that heavenly guest, whose
            peculiar office it is to "help our infirmities," and especially to
            "take of Christ's, and show it to us."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The exercise, however, of this, as of every other duty, may prove a
            barren form, that imparts neither pleasure nor profit. Let each of
            us then ask—'What distinct experimental benefit have I received from
            the word? Do I endeavor to read it with prayerful meditation, until
            I find my heart filled with it?'
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But this communing with the word is not for contemplation, but for
            practice. By <em>meditating on God's precepts,</em>

            we learn to have respect unto His ways—carefully "pondering the path
            of our feet," that we "turn not aside."<em>
              "Your loving-kindness is before my eyes; and I have walked in Your
              truth."</em
            >
            "My foot," says Job, "has held His steps; His ways have I kept, and
            not declined. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of His
            lips; I have esteemed the words of His mouth more than my necessary
            food."

            As <em>delight</em> quickens to <em>meditation</em>, so does the
            practical habit of <em>meditation</em> strengthen the principle of

            <em>delight</em>. In the enjoyment of this delight, the Christian
            (however small his attainments may be) would rather live and die,
            than in the pursuit, and even in the possession, of the most
            satisfying pleasures of a vain and empty world. But if it be a real
            <em>"delight in the Lord's statutes,"</em> it will be universal—when
            they probe the secret lurking-places within, and draw out to the
            full light the hidden indulgences of a heart that is yet carnal;
            when they call for the entire crucifixion of every corrupt
            inclination, and the unreserved surrender of all to the self-denying
            service of our God. This spirit is very different from the
            <em> delight</em> of the hypocrite, which is rather to "know," than
            to do, the "ways of his God;" and, therefore, who is satisfied with
            outward conformity, with little or no desire to "understand the
            errors" of his heart, that he might be "cleansed from secret
            faults." The spring of our obedience will therefore prove its
            sincerity; and the reality of our love will be manifested by its
            fruitfulness and active cheerfulness in our appointed sphere of
            duty.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            We may also observe here an evidence of adoption. Obedience is not a
            burden, but a <em>delight.</em> The servant may
            <em> perform</em> the statutes of God; but it is only the son who
            <em>"delights in them."</em> But what—we may ask—is the spring of
            adoption? It is "the Spirit of the Son sent into our hearts, whereby
            we cry, Abba, Father." It is because we are at peace with God
            through Jesus Christ; because the <em> statutes</em> are the message
            of reconciliation through Him, that they become delightful to those,
            who are partakers of this great salvation. "The spirit of adoption,"
            therefore, as the principle of delight, is the spring of acceptable
            obedience in the Lord's service.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And surely those who are serving Him in this happy filial walk, are
            not likely to <em>"forget His word."</em> As the eye is continually
            turned to the object of its affection, so the eye of the soul, that
            has been fixed with <em>delight</em> on the ways of God, will be
            habitually resting upon them. As one of the wise heathens
            observed—'I never yet heard of a covetous old man, who had forgotten
            where he had buried his treasure.' The reason is abundantly evident.
            His heart is in it. And this explains the forgetfulness of the
            ungodly or the formalist. They have no
            <em> delight in the statutes.</em> And who is not glad to
            <em>forget</em> what is distasteful? But if we "have tasted that the
            Lord is gracious"—if we have found a treasure "in the way of His
            testimonies"—we cannot <em>forget</em>

            the sweetness of the experience, or where to go to refresh ourselves
            with the repetition of it.  
          </p>
          <em> <p align="justify">Forgetfulness of the word</p></em> is,
          however, to the Christian, a source of continual complaint, and
          sometimes also of most distressing temptation. Not that there is
          always a real charge of guilt upon the conscience. For, as Thomas
          Boston somewhat quaintly observes—'Grace makes a good heart-memory,
          even where there is no good head-memory.' But means must be used, and
          helps may be suggested. Watchfulness against the influence of the
          world is of the first importance. How much of the good seed is choked
          by the springing thorns! If our hearts are ever refreshed with
          spiritual delight, we should be as cautious of an uncalled-for advance
          into the world, as of exposing an invalid's susceptible frame to a
          damp or an unhealthy atmosphere. Whatever warmth has been kindled in
          spiritual duties, may be chilled by one moment's unwary rush into an
          unkindly climate.
          <p align="justify">
            We would also recommend increasing attention to the word, as the
            means of its preservation—the exercise of "faith," without which it
            will "not profit"—the active habit of love, bringing with it a more
            habitual interest in the statutes—all accompanied with unceasing
            prayer for the gift of the Holy Spirit, made the express subject of
            promise for this purpose. Under His heavenly teaching and
            recollection, what <em>delight</em> will be found
            <em>in the statutes!</em> what blessed remembrance of His word! And
            what a happy spirit is this
            <em>delight and remembrance of the word</em>—the affections
            glowing—the memory pondering—the presence and manifestation of truth
            keeping the heart in close communion with God! "O Lord God,
            <em>keep this forever</em> in the imagination of the thoughts of the
            heart of Your people, and prepare their hearts unto You."

            This prayer appears to have been much upon David's heart, and in its
            substance and object it is again repeated. Nor does he fail to
            acknowledge the answer to it. The believer, like David, is a man of
            large expectations. As regards himself—his own daily provocations
            and backslidings—he cannot stand upon his own ground. But when he
            brings with him the name, the blood, the intercession of Jesus; as
            soon could God deny His own beloved Son, as resist the supplication
            of those who present this all-prevailing plea. Not only so, but—is
            He not His own gift to His children, as the pledge of every other
            gift? And what other pledge can they need, to encourage them to draw
            near with the largest desire, and the most heavenly expectation? We
            may, indeed, be too bold in our manner of approach to God; but we
            cannot be too bold in our expectations from Him. Standing as we do
            upon such high and sure ground, it is equally dishonorable to Him,
            and impoverishing to ourselves, to ask only a little of Him. Rather
            let us, according to His own command, "open our mouths wide; and He
            will fill them." Rather let us expect that He will <i>deal</i>—not
            only favorably—but <i> bountifully with His servants</i>—that, as
            "our God, He will supply all our need according to His riches in
            glory by Christ Jesus."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And, indeed, the most experienced believer cannot forget, that he is
            in himself still the same poor, weak, empty, helpless creature as at
            first. Nothing, therefore, short of a <i>bountiful</i> supply can
            answer his continual neediness. And such a supply is always at hand.
            The act of prayer increases the power to pray. The throne of grace
            is a well, which no power or malice of the Philistines can stop up.
            We need not say, "We have nothing to draw with, and the well is
            deep." Faith will enable us "with joy to draw out of this well of
            salvation." Let us bring our empty vessels, until "there is not a
            vessel more." Yes—believer—there is indeed a
            <i> bountiful</i> supply of grace—of every kind—suited to every
            need—grace to pardon—grace to quicken—grace to bless. Oh! see, then,
            that you come not empty away. Remember—who it is that pleads before
            the throne. Remember—that the grace you need is in His hand. From
            eternity He foreknew your case. He laid your portion by. He has kept
            it for the time of need; and now He only waits for an empty vessel,
            into which to pour His supply. He is ready to show you, how
            infinitely His grace exceeds all thoughts—all prayers—all
            desires—all praises.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And say—what has been the fruit of your pleading, waiting expectancy
            at "the throne of grace?" Have you not returned thence with a fresh
            spring of devotedness in His service, with every selfish thought
            forgotten in the desire, that you
            <i>"may live, and keep His word?"</i>

            Nothing touched or moved your reluctant heart, but the apprehension
            of <i> bountiful</i> redeeming love. This makes obedience
            easy—delightful—natural—in a manner unavoidable. It "constrains" to
            it. The man now <i>lives</i>—not the animal life of appetite—not the
            sensual life of vanity and pleasure—but the only life that deserves
            the name. He lives singly, supremely "to Him who died for him, and
            rose again." He <i>"lives, and keeps His word."</i> His motto and
            character now is, "To me to live is Christ." He values life only by
            his opportunities of serving his God. The first archangel knows not
            a higher object of existence. And how encouraging the reflection,
            that in this glorious object the lowest servant in the household of
            God is an equal participant with the most blessed inhabitant of
            heaven!

            In order <i>to keep God's word,</i> must we not pray to understand

            <i>the law</i>—but make me
            <i>behold the wonders of the law.</i> David had acquired in the
            Divine school "more understanding than all his teachers;" yet he
            ever comes to his God under a deep sense of his blindness. Indeed
            those who have been best and longest taught, are always the most
            ready to "sit at the feet of Jesus," as if they had everything to
            learn. It is an unspeakable mercy to know a little, and at the same
            time to feel that it is only a little. We shall then be longing to
            know more, and yet anxious to know nothing, except as we are taught
            of God.

            There are indeed in <i>God's law</i> things so
            <i> wondrous,</i> that "the angels desire to look into them." The
            exhibition of the scheme of redemption is in itself a world of
            wonders. The display of justice exercised in the way of mercy, and
            of mercy glorified in the exercise of justice, is a wonder, that
            must fill the intelligent universe of God with everlasting
            astonishment. And yet these <i>"wondrous things" </i>

            are hidden from multitudes, who should be most deeply interested in
            the knowledge of them. They are "hidden," not only from the ignorant
            and unconcerned, but "from the wise and prudent; and revealed" only
            "to babes"—to those who practically acknowledge that important
            truth, that a man "can receive nothing, except it be given him from
            heaven." External knowledge is like the child spelling the letters
            without any apprehension of the meaning. It is like reading a large
            and clear print with a thick veil before our eyes. Oh! how needful
            then is the prayer—'Unveil;'<i>, "Open my eyes:" </i>let the veil be
            taken away from the law, that I may understand it; and from my
            heart, that I may receive it!

          <p align="justify">
            But do not even Christians often find the word of God to be as a
            sealed book? They go through their accustomed portion, without
            gaining any increasing acquaintance with its light, life, and power,
            and without any distinct application of its contents to their
            hearts. And thus it must be, whenever reading has been unaccompanied
            with prayer for Divine influence. For we not only need to have
            <i>our "eyes opened to behold"</i>

            fresh wonders, but also to give a more spiritual and transforming
            perception of those wonders, which we have already beheld.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But are we conscious of our blindness? Then let us hear the counsel
            of our Lord, that we "anoint our eyes with eye-salve, that we may
            see." The recollection of the promises of Divine teaching is fraught
            with encouragement. The Spirit is freely and abundantly promised in
            this very character, as "the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
            knowledge of God." If, therefore, we desire a clearer insight into
            these <i>"wondrous things"</i> of revelation—if we would behold the
            glorious beauty of our Immanuel—if we would comprehend something
            more of the immeasurable extent of that love, with which "God so
            loved the world, as to give His only-begotten Son," and of that
            equally incomprehensible love, which moved that Son so cheerfully to
            undertake our cause—we must make daily, hourly use of this important
            petition<i>, "Open my eyes!"</i>

            This confession, however, from a solitary wanderer would have had
            little comparative meaning. But in the mouth of one, who was
            probably surrounded with every sort of worldly enjoyment, it shows
            at once the vanity of ''earth's best joys," and the heavenly
            tendency of the religion of the Bible. This has been ever the
            character, confession, and glory of the Lord's people. We "would not
            live always;" and gladly do we hear the warning voice, that reminds
            us to "arise and depart, for this is not our rest." And was not this
            especially the character, not of David only, but of David's Lord?
            Born at an inn— "having nowhere to lay His head"—suffering
            hunger—subsisting upon alms—neglected by His own—He "looked for some
            to take pity, but there was none, and for His comforters, but He
            found none"—might He not justly take up the confession, "I am
            <i>a stranger in the earth?"</i>

            This verse exhibits the Christian in many most interesting points of
            view; distant from his proper home—without a fixed residence—with no
            particular interest in the world—and submitting to all the
            inconveniences of a <i>stranger</i> on his journey homewards. Such
            is his state!
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And the word of God includes all that he needs—a guide, a guard, a
            companion—to direct, secure, and cheer his way. "When you go, it
            shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall keep you; and when you
            awake, it shall talk with you." Most suitable then is
            <i>the stranger's</i> prayer<i
              >, "hide not Your commandments from me."</i
            >
            Acquaintance with the word of God supplies the place of friends and
            counselors. It furnishes light, joy, strength, food, armor, and
            whatever else he may need on his way homewards.

            The pilgrim-spirit is the pulse of the soul. All of us are traveling
            to eternity. The worldling is at home <i>in the earth</i>—a pilgrim
            only by restraint. His heart would say, "It is good for me to be
            here. Let God dispose of heaven at His pleasure. I am content to
            have my "portion in this life." The child of God is
            <i>a stranger in the earth.</i>

            Heaven is the country of his birth. His kindred—his inheritance—his
            Savior—his hope—his home—all is there. He is "a citizen of no
            insignificant city," of "the heavenly Jerusalem." He is therefore a
            pilgrim in affection, no less than in character. How cheering is the
            thought, that "here we have no continuing city," if in heart and
            soul we are "seeking one to come!"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            We know, indeed, that we cannot—we would not—call this world our
            home, and that it is far better to be without it, than to have our
            portion in it. But do we never feel at home
            <i>in the earth,</i> thus forgetting our proper character, and our
            eternal prospects? Do we always live, speak, and act as
            <i>"strangers in the earth;"</i> in the midst of earthly enjoyments,
            sitting loose to them, as if our treasure was in heaven? Does our
            conversation in the society of the world savor of the home, where we
            profess to be going? Is the world gaining ascendancy in our
            affection? Let the cross of Calvary be the object of our daily
            contemplation—the ground of our constant "glorying;" and the world
            will then be to us as a "crucified" object.

          <p align="justify">
            And lastly, let us not forget, that we are looking forward, and
            making a progress towards a world, where none are strangers—where
            all are children of one family, dwelling in one eternal home.
            <i>"In our Father's house,"</i> said our gracious Head,

            This intense desire and affection is the Christian's answer to his
            prayers—<i>Open my eyes—Hide not Your commandments from me.</i>

            For who that is conversant with this blessed revelation but
            <i>longs</i> to be filled with it? In contrasting this glow with the
            church of Laodicea, under a brighter dispensation, "neither cold nor
            hot" which state, we may ask, most nearly resembles our own? Observe
            also, not only the fervor, but the steady uniformity, of this
            religion. It was not a rapture, but a habit; constant and uniform;
            <i>"at all times."</i> With us such enjoyments are too often favored
            seasons, happy moments; alas! only moments—why not days, and months,
            and years? The object of our desires is an inexhaustible spring. The

            <i>longing of the soul </i>can never over-reach its object. The
            <i>cherished desire,</i> therefore, will become the established
            habit—the element in which the child of God lives and thrives.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            This uniformity is the most satisfactory test of our profession.
            Often are <i>the judgments </i>prized in affliction, when all other
            resources fail: or under a pang of conscience when the terror of the
            Lord is frowning upon the sinner. But the excitement wears off, and
            the heart returns to its hardness. Often also the impulse of novelty
            gives a strong but temporary impression. This is very different from
            the Christian, whose study is stretching out its desires
            <i>at all times;</i> finding the judgments a cordial or a
            discipline, a support or a preservation, as his need may require.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Not less important is this habit, as the test of the soul's
            prosperity. We are not satisfied with <i>occasional</i> fellowship
            with a beloved friend. His society is the life of our life. We seek
            him in his own ways, where he is accustomed to resort. We feel the
            blank of his absence. We look out for his return with joyous
            anticipation.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Now, is this the picture of <i>our soul's longing</i> for communion
            with Jesus? We may feel His loss, should the stated seasons of
            prayer fail in bringing Him near to us. But do we <i>long</i> for
            Him <i>at all times?</i> Do we "wait for Him in the way of
            <i>His judgments,"</i>

            where He is usually found? And when spiritual exercises are
            necessarily exchanged for the occupations of the world, do we seize
            the leisure moment to catch a word—a glimpse—a look? Is not the
            heart silent with shame in the recollection of the cold habit of
            external or occasional duty?
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But why this low ebbing of spiritual desire? Do we live near to the
            throne of grace? Have we not neglected prayer for the influence of
            the Spirit? Have we not indulged a light, vain, and worldly spirit,
            than which nothing more tends to wither the growth of vital
            religion? Or have not the workings of unbelief been too faintly
            resisted? This of itself will account for much of our dullness;
            since the rule of the kingdom of grace is, "According to your faith
            be it unto you." Grace is, indeed, an insatiable principle.
            Enjoyment, instead of satisfying, only serves to sharpen the
            appetite. Yet if we are content to live at a low rate, there will be
            no sensible interest in the consolation of the Gospel. We know,
            desire, and are satisfied with little; and, therefore, we enjoy but
            little. We live as borderers on the land, instead of bearing our
            testimony: "Surely it flows with milk and honey;
            <i>and this is the fruit of it."</i> This is not the thriving, the
            cheerfulness, the adorning of the Gospel. It is rather the obscuring
            of the glory of our Christian profession, and of the happiness of
            its attendant privileges.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Let not the fervor of desire here expressed be conceived to be out
            of reach; nor let it be expected in the way of some sudden
            manifestation or excitement. Rather let us look for it in a patient,
            humble, and persevering waiting upon the Lord. We may have still to
            complain of coldness and wanderings. Yet strength to wait will be
            imperceptibly given: faith will be sustained for the conflict; and
            thus "our souls will make their boast in the Lord," even though an
            excited flow of enjoyment should be withheld. One desire will,
            however, tread upon another, increasing in fullness, as the grand
            object is nearer our grasp.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            At all events, let us beware of resting satisfied with the
            confession of our lukewarmness to our fellow-creatures, without
            "pouring out our heart before the Lord." There is a fullness of
            grace in our glorious Head to "strengthen the things which remain,
            which are ready to die," as well as at the beginning to "quicken" us
            when "dead in trespasses and sins." Abundant, also—are the promises
            and encouragements to poor, dry, barren souls, "I will heal their
            backslidings; I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the
            lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon." For what purpose are
            promises such as these given, but that they may be "arguments," with
            which to "fill our mouth," when in the contrition of faith we again
            venture to "order our cause before God?" And "will He plead against
            us with His great power?" No! but "He will put His strength in us;"
            and we shall yet again "run the way of His commandments" with an
            enlarged heart.

            David and Hezekiah are instructive beacons in the church, that they,

            Pride probably influences all, who
            <i>"err from the Lord's commandments;"</i> yet doubtless "the
            Righteous Judge" will make an infinite difference between
            <i>errors</i> of infirmity and obstinate wilfulness. The confession
            of the man of God, "I have gone astray like a lost sheep "—is widely
            different in character from the subjects of this awful
            <i

            We wonder not at this expression of the mind of God concerning
            pride. There is no sin more abhorrent to His character. It is as if
            we were taking the crown from His head, and placing it upon our own.
            It is man making a God of himself—acting from himself, and for
            himself. Nor is this principle less destructive to our own
            happiness. And yet it is not only rooted, but it often rears its
            head and blossoms, and bears fruit, even in hearts which "hate and
            abhor" its influence. It is most like its father, the Devil, in
            serpentine deceitfulness. It is always active—always ready
            imperceptibly to mix itself up with everything. When it is mortified
            in one shape, it rises in another. When we have thought that it was
            gone, in some unexpected moment we find it here still. It can
            convert everything into nourishment, even God's choicest gifts—yes,
            the graces of His Spirit. Let no saint, therefore, however near he
            may be living to God, however favored with the shinings of His
            countenance—consider himself beyond the reach of this temptation.
            Paul was most in danger, when he seemed to be most out of it; and
            nothing but an instant miracle of grace and power saved him from the
            "snare of the Devil."

            Indeed, the whole plan of salvation is intended to humble the pride
            of man, by exhibiting his restoration to the Divine favor, as a free
            gift through the atoning blood of the cross. How hateful, therefore,
            is

            <i>proud</i> man's resistance to this humbling doctrine of the
            cross, and the humbling requisitions of the life of faith flowing
            from it! This makes the sure "foundation" of the believer's hope, "a
            stone of stumbling" to the unbeliever's ruin. As regards also the
            means of salvation—how can pride lift up his head in the view of the
            Son of God, "taking upon Him the form of a servant," that He might
            bear the curse of man? "Behold, the soul that is lifted up, is not
            upright in him."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But can a sinner—can a saint—be <i>proud?</i>—one who owes
            everything to free and sovereign grace—one who has wasted so much
            time—abused so much mercy—so grieved the Spirit of God—who has a
            heart so full of atheism—unbelief—selfishness? No, the very pride
            itself should be the matter of the deepest daily humiliation. Thus
            the remembrance of it may, under Divine grace, prove an effectual
            means of subduing it in our hearts. We shall overcome corruption by
            its own working, and meet our adversary with his own weapons. And if
            this cursed principle be not wholly destroyed, yet the very sight of
            its corruption, deepening our contrition, will be overruled for our
            spiritual advancement.

            frustrate His gracious intentions, or build again the things which
            He would have destroyed. May we love to lie low—lower than

            The <i>proud under the rebuke of God</i> are usually distinguished
            by their enmity to His people. They delight to pour upon them

            <i>"reproach and contempt,"</i> with no other provocation given,
            than that their <i>keeping the testimonies</i> of God condemns their
            own neglect. This must, however, be counted as the cost of a
            decided, separate, and consistent profession. Yet it is such a
            portion as Moses valued above all the treasures of the world; yet it
            is that <i>reproach,</i> which our Master Himself "despised," as
            "reckoning it not worthy to be compared with "the joy that was set
            before Him." For did He bear His cross only on the way to Calvary?
            It was laid for every step in His path; it met Him in every form of
            suffering, of <i>"reproach and contempt."</i> Look then at Him, as
            taking up His daily cross in breathing the atmosphere of a world of
            sin, and "enduring the contradiction of sinners against Himself."
            Mark Him consummating His course of
            <i>"reproach and contempt,"</i> by suffering "outside the gate;" and
            can we hesitate to "go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His
            reproach?"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The trial, however—especially if cast upon us by those whom we have
            loved and valued, or by those whom we wish to love and value
            us—proves most severe; and the spreading our case, after David's
            example, before the Lord, is the only preservation from faintness<i

          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            Perhaps <i>"contempt"</i> is more hard to bear than
            <i> "reproach."</i> Even our enemies think of us so much better than
            we deserve, that it strikes with peculiar poignancy. Yet when the
            submissive prayer of deprecation is sent us; doubtless some
            answer—and <i>that</i> the right answer—will be given; and whether
            the <i>"reproach"</i> be removed, or "grace" given "sufficient" to
            endure it, the outcome will prove alike for the glory of God, and
            the prosperity of our own souls.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But let us beware of that "way of escape" in returning to the world,
            which the insincere are ever ready to pursue. They dare not act
            according to the full conviction of their consciences: they dare not
            confront their friends with the avowal of their full determination
            to form their conduct by the principles of the word of God. This is
            hard—this is impossible. They know not the "victory which overcomes
            the world", and, therefore, cannot bear the mark upon their
            foreheads, "These are those who follow the Lamb wherever He goes."
            Far better, however, will be the heaviest weight
            <i>of "reproach and contempt,"</i> than any such endeavor to remove
            it from ourselves.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The desire to escape the cross convicts the heart of unfaithfulness,
            and makes way for tenfold difficulties in our path. Every worldly
            compliance against the voice of God is a step into the by-path,
            which deviates wider and wider from the strait and narrow way,
            brings discredit upon our professions, proves a stumbling-block in
            the way of the weak, and will cause us, if not actually to come
            short, at least to <i>"seem to come short, </i>of the promised
            rest."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But is the weight of the cross really "above what we are able to
            bear?" He who bore it for us will surely enable us to endure it for
            Him, and, upheld by Him, we cannot sink. It is a sweet exchange, by
            which the burden of sin is removed, and bound to His cross; and what
            remains to us is the lighter cross of
            <i>"reproach and contempt,"</i>—the badge of our discipleship. If,
            then, we have the testimony of our consciences, that in the midst of
            the persecuting world we <i>"have kept His testimonies,"</i>

            here is our evidence of adoption, of our Father's special love, of
            the indwelling, comforting, supporting Spirit. Here, then, is our
            warrant of hope, that the overwhelming weight will be
            <i>removed from us; </i>and that we shall be able to testify to our
            Master's praise in the Churches of God, that "His yoke is easy, and
            His burden is light."

            David might well give his testimony to "the words of the Lord," that
            they were "tried words," for perhaps no one had ever tried them more
            than himself, and certainly no one had more experience of their
            faithfulness, sweetness, and support. Saul and his
            <i>"princes might indeed sit and speak against him;"</i> but he had
            a resource, of which they could never deprive him, "Not as the world
            gives, give I unto you." As our blessed Master was employed in
            communion with His Father, and delighting in His work at the time
            when the <i>"princes did sit and speak against him;"</i> so, under
            similar circumstances of trial, this faithful servant of God, by
            <i> meditation in the Lord's statutes, </i>extracted spiritual food
            for his support; and in this strength of his God he was enabled to
            "suffer according to His will, and to commit the keeping of his soul
            to Him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator."

            The children of Israel in Egypt, Daniel in Babylon, and the
            disciples of Christ in the early ages of the Church, have each found
            "this same affliction to be accomplished in themselves." that God is
            pleased to permit it, to show "that his kingdom is not of this
            world," to wean His people from earthly dependencies, and to bring
            out before the world a more full testimony of His name.

          <p align="justify">
            One other reason is suggested by this verse—to make His word more
            precious by the experience of its sustaining consolation in the
            conflict with the power of the world. Often, indeed, from a lack of
            a present application of the word—young Christians especially are in
            danger of being put to rebuke by the scorner's sneer. The habit of
            scriptural <i> meditation</i> will realize to them a present God,
            speaking "words of spirit and life" to their souls. The importance,
            therefore, of an accurate and well-digested acquaintance with this
            precious book cannot be too highly estimated. In the Christian's
            conflict it is "the sword of the Spirit," which, if it be kept
            bright by constant use, will never be wielded without the victory of
            faith. Such powerful support does it give against fainting under
            persecution, that the good soldier may ever be ready to thank God,
            and to take courage. Christ has left it, indeed, as the portion of
            His people, "In the world you shall have tribulation;"
            counterbalanced, however, most abundantly, by the portion which they
            enjoy in Him, "In Me you shall have peace." If, therefore, the
            one-half of this portion may seem hard, the whole legacy is such as
            no servant of Christ can refuse to accept, or indeed will receive
            without thankfulness.

            What could we want more in a time of difficulty than comfort and
            direction? David had both these blessings. As the fruit of
            <i> his "meditation in the Lord's statutes,"</i> in his distress
            they were his

            <i>"delight;"</i> in his perplexity they were his
            <i>"counselors."</i> He would not have exchanged his
            <i>delight</i> for the best joys of earth. And so wisely did his
            counselors direct his course, that, though
            <i>"princes sat and spoke against him,"</i> they "could find no
            occasion nor fault." The testimonies of God were truly his
            <i>"counselors."</i> He guided his own conduct by the rules laid
            before him in the book of God, as if he were having recourse to the
            most experienced counselors, or rather as if the prophets of his God
            were giving the word from His mouth. Thus the subject as well as the
            sovereign, had his counsel. On one side was Saul and his
            counselors—on the other side, David and the
            <i>testimonies of his God.</i>

            Which was better furnished with that "wisdom which is profitable to
            direct?" Subsequently as a king, David was constrained to make
            <i>"the testimonies of his God his counselors"</i>; and, probably,
            to his constant regard to their voice he owed much of his earthly
            prosperity.  
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            In such a dark world as this, beset with temptation at every turn,
            we preeminently need sound and wise counsel. But all of us carry an
            evil <i>counselor</i> within us, and it is our folly to listen to
            his voice. God has given us His word as a sure counselor, and "he
            who hearkens to its counsel is wise."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Now, do we value the privilege of this heavenly counsel? Every
            improvement must increase our <i>delight</i> in it; a heartless
            interest shuts out this blessing. But those who make
            <i>the word their delight</i> will always find it
            <i>their counselor.</i> Yet a mere cursory reading will never
            realize to us its holy delight or counsel. It must be brought home
            to our own experience, and consulted on those trivial occasions of
            every day, when, unconscious of our need of Divine direction, we are
            too often inclined to lean to our own counsel. The Christian is a
            man of faith, every step of his way. And this habitual use and daily
            familiarity with the testimonies of God will show him the pillar and
            the cloud, in all the dark turns of his heavenly road. The word will
            be to him as the "Urim and Thummin"—an infallible <i>counselor.</i>
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Sometimes, however, perplexity arises from the conflict, not between
            conscience and sinful indulgence (in which case Christian sincerity
            would always determine the path), but between duty and duty. When,
            however, acknowledged obligations seem to interfere with each other,
            the counsel of the word will mark their relative importance,
            connection, and dependence: the present path in providence: the
            guidance which has been given to the Lord's people in similar
            emergencies; and the light which the daily life of our Great
            Exemplar exhibits before us.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The great concern, however, is to cultivate the habit of mind, which
            falls in most naturally with the counsel of the word. "Walking in
            the fear of the Lord," in a simple spirit of dependence, and torn
            away from the idolatry of taking counsel from our own hearts, we
            cannot <i> materially</i> err; because there is
            <i>here a suitableness between the disposition and the promise</i>—a
            watchfulness against the impetuous bias of the flesh; a paramount
            regard to the glory of God, and a meek submission to His gracious
            appointment. If the counsel, however, should prove fallible, the
            fault is not in the word, but in the indistinctness of our own
            perception. We need not a clearer rule, or a surer guide, but a more
            single eye. And if, after all, it may not mark every precise act of
            duty (for to do this, even all the world "could not contain the
            books that should be written"), yet it determines the standard to
            which the most minute acting of the mind should be brought; and the
            disposition, which will reflect the light of the will of God upon
            our path.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But let it be remembered, that any lack of sincerity in the
            heart—any allowance of self-dependence, will always close the
            avenues of this Divine light and counsel. We are often unconsciously
            "walking in the light of our own fire, and in the sparks that we
            have kindled." Perhaps we sought, as we conceived, the guidance of
            the Lord's counsel, and supposed that we were walking in it. But, in
            the act of seeking, and as the preparation for seeking, did we
            subject our motives and inclinations to a strict, cautious,
            self-suspecting scrutiny? Was the heart schooled to the discipline
            of the cross? Was "every thought brought into captivity to the
            obedience of Christ?" Or was not our heart possessed with the
            object, before counsel was sought at the mouth of God? Oh! how
            careful should we be to walk warily in those uncertain marks of
            heavenly counsel, that fall in with the bias of our own inclination!
            How many false steps in the record of past experience may be traced
            to the counsel of our own hearts, sought and followed to the neglect
            and counsel of God; while no circumstance of perplexity can befall
            us in the spirit of humility, simplicity, and sanctity, when the
            counsel of the Lord will fail!
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            An undue dependence upon human counsel, whether of the living or the
            dead, greatly hinders the full influence of the counsel of the word.
            However valuable such counsel may be, and however closely it may
            agree with the word, we must not forget, that it is not the
            word—that it is fallible, and therefore must never be resorted to in
            the first place, or followed with that full reliance, which we are
            warranted to place on the revelation of God.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            On the other hand, what is it to have God's word as our

            <i>"Counselor?"</i> Is it not to have Himself, "the only wise God?"
            When our Bibles, in seasons of difficulty, are searched in a humble,
            prayerful, teachable spirit, we are as much depending upon the Lord
            Himself for counsel, as if we were listening to an immediate
            revelation from heaven. We need not a new revelation, or a sensible
            voice from above, for every fresh emergency. It is enough, that our
            Father has given us this blessed "word as a light to our feet, and a
            lamp to our path."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Let me then inquire—What is the counsel of God, that speaks directly
            to myself? If I am an unawakened sinner, it warns me to turn from
            sin; it invites me to the Savior; it directs me to wait upon God. If
            I am a professor, slumbering in the form of godliness, it shows me
            my real condition; it instructs me in the all-sufficiency of Christ,
            and cautions me of the danger of hypocrisy. If through grace I am
            made a child of God, still do I need my Father's counsel to recover
            me from perpetual backsliding, to excite me to increased
            watchfulness, and to strengthen my confidence in the fullness of His
            grace, and the faithfulness of His love. Ever shall I have reason
            for the grateful acknowledgment, "I will bless the Lord, who has
            given me counsel." And every step of my way would I advance,
            glorifying my God and Father by confiding in His counsel unto the

            Sin is no trifle to a child of God. It is his heaviest sorrow. Thus
            David—thus the Great Apostle found it. And where is the believer who
            has not full sympathy with their complaints? To have a
            <i>soul cleaving to the dust,</i> and not to feel the trouble, is
            the black mark of a sinner, dead in sins—dead to God. To "know the
            plague of our own heart," to feel our misery, to believe and to
            apply the remedy, is the satisfactory evidence of a child of God.
            <i>Dust</i> is the portion of the world, and they wish for no
            better. But that the soul of the man of God should continually
            <i>cleave to the dust,</i> is most strange and humbling. And yet
            such is the influence of his evil nature—such the power of self-will
            and self-indulgence—such the regard to human praise, and cherishing
            of self-admiration, that were it not that he "abhors himself" for
            the very <i> dust that cleaves </i>to him, he would question the
            existence of a renewing change. He knows what he ought to be. He has
            tasted the blessedness of "mounting upward on eagles' wings." But
            every attempt to rise is hindered by the clogging weight that keeps
            him down.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            It is, however, the cleaving of his soul that is so painful—not
            occasional, but constant—not like the bird of the morning that
            descends for a moment, and then soars his upward flight; but it
            seems as if, like the "serpent—dust was to be his food;" as if the
            spiritual, heaven-born soul was to sink and grovel below. And then,
            as the dust of the summer-road blinds the eye, and obscures the
            view—how does this earthliness of soul darken the view of the
            Savior, dim the eye of faith, and hide the glorious prospects which,
            when beheld in the clear horizon, enliven the weary pilgrim on his
            way!
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But this complaint is the language of conflict and humiliation—not
            of despondency. Observe the believer carrying it to the Lord—'Here I
            lie in the <i>dust,</i> without life or power. Oh! Savior, who "came
            that I might have life, and that I might have it more abundantly"—<i
              >Quicken me:</i
            >
            Breathe into me Your own life, that I may rise from the <i>dust,</i>

            and <i>cleave</i> to You.' This cry for quickening grace is the
            exercise of faith. We have a covenant to plead. Faith is the hand
            that takes hold of the promise<i>, "according to Your word."</i> Can
            this word fail? "Sooner shall heaven and earth pass away, than one
            jot or one tittle pass" from the engagements of a covenant-keeping
            God. "He is faithful who promised." The man who takes hold of this
            plea, is "a Prince who has power with God, and prevails."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But how different is the character of the mere professor! ready
            probably to make the same confession, yet without humiliation,
            without prayer, without faith. Nothing is more common than to hear
            the complaint—<i>"My soul cleaves to the dust." </i>The world has
            such power over us—we are so cold—so dead to spiritual things:'
            while, perhaps, the complaint is never once brought with wrestling
            supplication, but rather urged in indolent self-delight, as an
            evidence of the good state of the heart before God.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Yet it is not the complaint of sickness, but an application to the
            physician, which advances the recovery of the patient. We do not
            usually expect to better our condition, by mourning over its
            badness, or merely wishing for its improvement. Nor is it the
            confession of sin, but the application to the Great Physician, that
            marks genuine contrition before God. That confession which
            evaporates in heartless complaints, belongs not to the tenderness of
            a renewed heart. But the utterance of genuine prayer is the voice of
            God's own "Spirit making intercession for us;" and then, indeed, how
            cheering the encouragement, that He "who searches the hearts, knows
            what is the mind of the Spirit, because He makes intercession for
            the saints according to the will of God!"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Some are ready to give up or delay their duty, when they have been
            unable to bring their heart to it. Thus does "Satan get advantage of
            us" by our "ignorance of his devices." <i>Quickening</i> grace is
            not the ground or warrant for duty. Indisposition to duty is not our
            weakness, but our sin—not therefore to be indulged, but resisted. We
            must mourn over the dullness which hinders us, and diligently wait
            for the 'help we every moment need.' God keeps the grace in His own
            hands, and gives it at His pleasure, to exercise our daily
            dependence upon Him. The acting of grace strengthens the habit.
            Praying helps to pray. If the door is closed, "Knock, and it shall
            be opened." Assuredly it will not long be shut to him, who has faith
            and patience to wait until it be opened.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Now let me sift the character of my profession. Is it a habitual,
            persevering, overcoming conflict with sin? Do I not sometimes
            indulge in fruitless bemoanings of my state, when I had far better
            be exercising myself in vigorous actings of grace? If I find
            <i>"my soul cleaving to the dust,"</i> am I not sometimes "lying on
            my face," when I ought to be "taking heaven by violence," by
            importunate petitions for <i> quickening</i> grace? Are my prayers
            invigorated by confidence in the word of God? Oh! let me remember
            that "those who wait upon the Lord" shall shake off
            <i>the dust</i> to which they have <i>cleaved</i> so long, and
            "shall mount with wings like eagles," to take possession of their
            heavenly home.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            O Lord, make me more deeply ashamed, that
            <i>"my soul should cleave to the dust."</i> Breathe upon me fresh
            influence from Your <i> quickening</i> Spirit. Help me to plead Your
            word of promise; and oh! may every fresh view of my sinfulness,
            while it prostrates me in self-abasement before You, be overruled to
            make the Savior daily and hourly more precious to my soul. For
            defiled as I am in myself, in every service of my heart, what but
            the unceasing application of His blood, and the uninterrupted
            prevalence of His intercession, give me a moment's confidence before
            You, or prevent the very sins that mingle with my prayers from
            sealing my condemnation? Blessed Savior! it is nothing but Your
            everlasting merit, covering my person, and honoring my sacrifice,
            which satisfies the justice of an offended God, and restrains it
            from breaking forth as a devouring fire—to consume me upon my very
            knees.
