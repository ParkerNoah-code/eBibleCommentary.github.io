        <h2>Psalm 1</h2>
        <p>
          This psalm, though without a title, may reasonably be thought to be a
          psalm of David; since the next psalm, which is also without a title,
          is ascribed to him (Acts 4:25); and since both are joined together as
          one psalm by the Jews (Acts 4:25); and since this is the general
          preface to the whole book, which is chiefly of David's penning.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 1.
            <em
              >Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the
              wicked,<br />
              nor stand on the path of sinners,<br />
              nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Blessed is the man</em>. The words may be rendered, "O, the
          blessednesses of the man", or "of this man"; he is doubly blessed, a
          thrice happy and blessed man; blessed in things temporal and
          spiritual; happy in this world, and in that to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is to be praised and commended as a good man, so the Targum: "The
          goodness, or, Oh, the goodness of the man;" or as others, "Oh, the
          right goings or happy progress, or prosperous success of the man," who
          answers to the following descriptions; which right walking of his is
          next observed, and his prosperity in Psalms 1:3. Some have interpreted
          this psalm of Christ, and indeed these are properly spoken of him.
