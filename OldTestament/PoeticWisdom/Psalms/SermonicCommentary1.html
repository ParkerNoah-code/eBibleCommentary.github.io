        <h2>Psalm 1</h2>
        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 1.
            <em
              >Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the
              wicked,<br />
              nor stand on the path of sinners,<br />
              nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "Progress in Sanctification," or "The Purity of the Christian," or
          "The Blessedness of the Righteous." Upon the last subject speak of the
          believer as BLESSED—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. By God;<br />
          2. In Christ;<br />
          3. With all blessings;<br />
          4. In all circumstances;<br />
          5. Through time and eternity;<br />
          6. To the highest degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teaches a godly man to beware, (1) of the opinions, (2) of the
          practical life, and (3) of the company and association of sinful men.
          Show how meditation upon the Word will assist us in keeping aloof from
          these three evils because of the insinuating and progressive nature of
          sin.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 2.
            <em
              >but his delight is in Yahweh’s law.<br />
              On his law he meditates day and night.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>THE WORD OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          1. The believer's delight in it.<br />
          2. The believer's acquaintance with it.
        </p>
        <p>We long to be in the company of those we love.</p>
        <p>
          I. What is meant by "the law of the Lord."<br />
          II. What there is in it for the believer to delight in.<br />
          III. How he shows his delight, thinks of it, reads much, speaks of it,
          obeys it, does not delight in evil.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 3.
            <em
              >He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,<br />
              that produces its fruit in its season,<br />
              whose leaf also does not wither.<br />
              Whatever he does shall prosper.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>"The fruitful tree."</p>
        <p>
          I. Where it grows.<br />
          II. How it came there.<br />
          III. What it yields.<br />
          IV. How to be like it.
        </p>
        <p>"Planted by the rivers of water."</p>
        <p>
          I. The origination of Christian life, "planted."<br />
          II. The streams which support it.<br />
          III. The fruit expected from it.
        </p>
        <p>Topics:</p>
        <p>
          1. Influence of religion upon prosperity<br />
          2. The nature, causes, signs, and results of true prosperity.<br />
          3. "Fruit in his season," virtues to be exhibited at certain seasons—
          patience in affliction; gratitude in prosperity; zeal in opportunity,
          etc.<br />
          4. "His leaf also shall not wither;" the blessing of retaining an
          unwithered profession.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 4.
            <em
              >The wicked are not so,<br />
              but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>Sin puts a negative on every blessing.</p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 5.
            <em
              >Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,<br />
              nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>The sinner's double doom:</p>
        <p>
          1. Condemned at the judgment-bar.<br />
          2. Separated from the saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reasonableness of these penalties, "therefore," and the way to escape
          them. "The congregation of the righteous" viewed as the church of the
          first-born above.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 6.
            <em
              >For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,<br />
              but the way of the wicked shall perish.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          A sweet encouragement to the tried people of God. The knowledge here
          meant:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Its character.—It is a knowledge of observation and approbation.<br />
          2. Its source.—It is caused by omniscience and infinite love.<br />
          3. Its results.—Support, deliverance, acceptance, and glory at last.
        </p>
        <p>
          His way of pleasure, of pride, of unbelief, of profanity, of
          persecution, of procrastinating, of self-deception, etc.: all these
          shall come to an end.
