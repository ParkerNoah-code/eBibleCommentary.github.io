        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Title of the Book</h2>
        <p>
          The book is called "Koheleth" in the Hebrew, a title taken from its
          opening sentence, &quot;The words of Koheleth, the son of David, King
          in Jerusalem.&quot; In the Greek and Latin Versions it is entitled
          ’Ecclesiastes,’ which Jerome elucidates by remarking that in Greek a
          person is so called who gathers the congregation, or ecclesia. What
          Symmachus gave is uncertain, but probably Παροιμιαστηìς,
          ’Proverb-monger.’ In modern versions the name is usually
          ’Ecclesiastes; or, The Preacher.’ Luther boldly gives ’The Preacher
          Solomon.’ This is not a satisfactory rendering to modern ears; and,
          indeed, it is difficult to find a term which will adequately represent
          the Hebrew word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Koheleth is a participle feminine from a root kahal (whence the Greek
          καλεìω, Latin calo, and English &quot;call&quot;), which means,
          &quot;to call, to assemble,&quot; especially for religious or solemn
          purposes. The word and its derivatives are always applied to people,
          and not to things. So the term, which gives its name to our book,
          signifies a female assembler or collector of persons for Divine
          worship, or in order to address them. It can, therefore, not mean
          &quot;Gatherer of wisdom,&quot; &quot;Collector of maxims,&quot; but
          &quot;Gatherer of God’s people&quot; (1 Kings 8:1). Others make it
          equivalent to &quot;Debater,&quot; which term affords a clue to the
          variation of opinions in the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is generally constructed as a masculine and without the article,
          but once as feminine (Ecclesiastes 7:27, if the reading is correct),
          and once with the article (Ecclesiastes 12:8). The feminine form is by
          some accounted for, not by supposing Koheleth to represent an office,
          and therefore as used abstractedly, but as being the personification
          of Wisdom, whose business it is to gather people unto the Lord and
          make them a holy congregation. In Proverbs sometimes Wisdom herself
          speaks (e.g. Proverbs 1:20), sometimes the author speaks of her (e.g.
          Proverbs 8:1, etc.). So Koheleth appears now as the organ of Wisdom,
          now as Wisdom herself, supporting, as it were, two characters without
          losing altogether his identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          He appears rather as addressing general readers than teaching his own
          people from an elevated position; and the title assigned to him is
          meant to designate him, not only as one who by word of mouth
          instructed others, but one whose life and experience preached an
          emphatic lesson on the vanity of mundane things.
        </p>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Let us see what are the usual arguments for the Solomonic authorship.
          We will endeavor to set them forth very briefly, but fairly and
          intelligibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The first and most potent is the unanimous verdict of all writers
          who have mentioned the book from primitive times to the days of
          Luther, whether Christian or Jewish. The common opinion was that the
          three works, Canticles, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes, were composed by
          Solomon; the first, as some said, being the production of his earlier
          days, the second written in his maturity, and the third dictated aft
          the close of life, when he had learned the vanity of all that he had
          once valued, and had repented of his evil ways and turned once more to
          the fear of the Lord as the only stable comfort and hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The book purports to be written by Solomon; the writer speaks
          continually in the first person; and as the work is confessedly
          inspired and canonical, any doubt as to the literal accuracy of the
          inscription throws discredit on the truth and authority of Scripture.
          In a treatise of this nature it is altogether unlikely that the author
          should attribute his own sentiments to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is nothing in the contents which militates against the
          Solomonic authorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There is nothing in the language which is not compatible with the
          time of Solomon.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It is a composition of such consummate skill and excellence that it
          could have proceeded from no one but this wisest of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. There are such a multitude and variety of coincidences in
          expression and phraseology with Proverbs and Canticles, which are
          confessedly more or less the work of Solomon, that Ecclesiastes must
          proceed from the same author. Such are the grounds upon which
          Ecclesiastes is attributed to Solomon. The opinion has a certain
          attraction for all simple believers, who are content to take things on
          trust, and, provided a theory makes no very violent demands on
          credulity, to accept it with unquestioning confidence.
        </p>
        <h2>Outline</h2>
        <p>
          Taking seriously the frame of the narrative is important to a proper
          interpretation of the book and understanding what the Koheleth is
          conveying.

        <p class="hangingindent">

          2009).

        <h2>Articles</h2>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          Eric Ortlund,
          <a
            href="https://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/56/56-4/JETS_56-4_694-706_Ortlund.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            ><em>The Gospel in the Book of Ecclesiastes</em></a
          >, JETS 56/4 (2013). Ortlund writes: "Qohelet does not speak about
          life without God, but of life of both sinner and saint under the sun,
          and God's strange manner of ordering (or, perhaps better,
          'frustrating') our lives." This view seems to align more with the text
          and consequently with the Gospel than the majority view. He defends
          this understanding of Ecclesiastes and then explicates it's
          implications for the Gospel message.
