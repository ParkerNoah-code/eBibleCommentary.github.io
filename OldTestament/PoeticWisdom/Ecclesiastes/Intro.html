        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Title of the Book</h2>
        <p>
          THE book is called in the Hebrew Koheleth, a title taken from its
          opening sentence, &quot;The words of Koheleth, the son of David, King
          in Jerusalem.&quot; In the Greek and Latin Versions it is entitled
          ’Ecclesiastes,’ which Jerome elucidates by remarking that in Greek a
          person is so called who gathers the congregation, or ecclesia. Aquila
          transliterates the word, Κωλεìθ; what Symmachus gave is uncertain, but
          probably Παροιμιαστηìς, ’Proverb-monger.’ The Venetian Greek has ̔Η
          ̓Εκκλησιάστρια and ̔Η ̓Εκκλησιάζουσα. In modern versions the name is
          usually ’Ecclesiastes; or, The Preacher.’ Luther boldly gives ’The
          Preacher Solomon.’ This is not a satisfactory rendering to modern
          ears; and, indeed, it is difficult to find a term which will
          adequately represent the Hebrew word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Koheleth is a participle feminine from a root kahal (whence the Greek
          καλεìω, Latin calo, and English &quot;call&quot;), which means,
          &quot;to call, to assemble,&quot; especially for religious or solemn
          purposes. The word and its derivatives are always applied to people,
          and not to things. So the term, which gives its name to our book,
          signifies a female assembler or collector of persons for Divine
          worship, or in order to address them. It can, therefore, not mean
          &quot;Gatherer of wisdom,&quot; &quot;Collector of maxims,&quot; but
          &quot;Gatherer of God’s people&quot; (1 Kings 8:1). Others make it
          equivalent to &quot;Debater,&quot; which term affords a clue to the
          variation of opinions in the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is generally constructed as a masculine and without the article,
          but once as feminine (Ecclesiastes 7:27, if the reading is correct),
          and once with the article (Ecclesiastes 12:8). The feminine form is by
          some accounted for, not by supposing Koheleth to represent an office,
          and therefore as used abstractedly, but as being the personification
          of Wisdom, whose business it is to gather people unto the Lord and
          make them a holy congregation. In Proverbs sometimes Wisdom herself
          speaks (e.g. Proverbs 1:20), sometimes the author speaks of her (e.g.
          Proverbs 8:1, etc.). So Koheleth appears now as the organ of Wisdom,
          now as Wisdom herself, supporting, as it were, two characters without
          losing altogether his identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, it is to be noted, with Wright, that Solomon, as
          personified Wisdom, could not speak of himself as having gotten more
          wisdom than all that were before him in Jerusalem (Ecclesiastes 1:16),
          or how his heart had great experience of wisdom, or how he had applied
          his heart to discover things by means of wisdom (Ecclesiastes 7:23,
          25). These things could not be said in this character, and unless we
          suppose that the writer occasionally lost himself, or did not strictly
          maintain his assumed personation, we must fall back upon the
          ascertained fact that the feminine form of such words as Koheleth has
          no special significance (unless, perhaps, it denotes power and
          activity), and that such forms were used in the later stage of the
          language to express proper names of men. Thus we find Solphereth,
          &quot;scribe&quot; (Nehemiah 7:57), and Pochereth, &quot;hunter&quot;
          (Ezra 2:57), where certainly males are intended. Parallels are found
          in the Mishna.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, as is supposed, Solomon is designated Keheleth in allusion to his
          great prayer at the dedication of the temple (1 Kings 8:23-53, 56-61),
          it is strange that no mention is anywhere made of this celebrated
          work, and the part he took therein. He appears rather as addressing
          general readers than teaching his own people from an elevated
          position; and the title assigned to him is meant to designate him, not
          only as one who by word of mouth instructed others, but one whose life
          and experience preached an emphatic lesson on the vanity of mundane
          things.
        </p>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Let us see what are the usual arguments for the Solomonic authorship.
          We will endeavor to set them forth very briefly, but fairly and
          intelligibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The first and most potent is the unanimous verdict of all writers
          who have mentioned the book from primitive times to the days of
          Luther, whether Christian or Jewish. The common opinion was that the
          three works, Canticles, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes, were composed by
          Solomon; the first, as some said, being the production of his earlier
          days, the second written in his maturity, and the third dictated aft
          the close of life, when he had learned the vanity of all that he had
          once valued, and had repented of his evil ways and turned once more to
          the fear of the Lord as the only stable comfort and hope. St. Jerome,
          in his ’Commentary,’ gives the opinion which was prevalent in his day:
          &quot;Itaque juxta numerum vocabu-lorum tria volumina edidit:
          Proverbia, Ecclesiasten, et Cantica Canticorum. In Proverbiis parvulum
          docens et quasi de officiis per sententias erudiens; in Ecclesiaste
          vero maturae virum aetatis instituens, ne quicquam in mundi rebus
          purer esse perpetuum, sed caduca et brevia universa quae cernimus; ad
          extremum jam consummatum virum et calcato seeculo praeparatum, in
          Cantico Canticorum sponsi jungit amplexibus.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The book purports to be written by Solomon; the writer speaks
          continually in the first person; and as the work is confessedly
          inspired and canonical, any doubt as to the literal accuracy of the
          inscription throws discredit on the truth and authority of Scripture.
          In a treatise of this nature it is altogether unlikely that the author
          should attribute his own sentiments to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is nothing in the contents which militates against the
          Solomonic authorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There is nothing in the language which is not compatible with the
          time of Solomon.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It is a composition of such consummate skill and excellence that it
          could have proceeded from no one but this wisest of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. There are such a multitude and variety of coincidences in
          expression and phraseology with Proverbs and Canticles, which are
          confessedly more or less the work of Solomon, that Ecclesiastes must
          proceed from the same author. Such are the grounds upon which
          Ecclesiastes is attributed to Solomon. The opinion has a certain
          attraction for all simple believers, who are content to take things on
          trust, and, provided a theory makes no very violent demands on
          credulity, to accept it with unquestioning confidence.
