        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Books of 1 and 2 Samuel, originally one book in the Hebrew Bible,
          cover a crucial period in Israel's history, chronicling the nation's
          transition from a loose confederation of tribes led by judges to a
          united monarchy under the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon. 1 Samuel
          begins with the birth and calling of the prophet Samuel, who becomes
          the last of the judges and anoints Israel's first king, Saul. Despite
          a promising start, Saul's disobedience and poor choices lead to God
          rejecting him as king. The narrative then shifts to the rise of David,
          a shepherd boy who, after defeating Goliath, becomes a military hero,
          eventually being anointed as Saul's successor.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Samuel focuses on David's reign as king, highlighting his military
          victories, the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital city, and
          God's covenant promise to establish David's throne forever. However,
          the book also showcases David's human flaws and the consequences of
          his sins, such as his adultery with Bathsheba and the resulting
          turmoil within his family. The book concludes with David's final years
          and the ascension of his son Solomon to the throne.
