        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Book of Zechariah is a prophetic work in the Old Testament that is
          part of the Minor Prophets. Zechariah, along with Haggai, prophesied
          to the Jewish people who had returned from the Babylonian exile in the
          late 6th century BCE, during the reign of the Persian king Darius. The
          book is known for its rich symbolism, apocalyptic visions, and
          messianic prophecies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book can be divided into two main sections. The first section
          (chapters 1-8) contains a series of eight visions that Zechariah
          receives in one night. These visions offer encouragement and hope to
          the people, assuring them of God's presence, protection, and future
          blessings. They also emphasize the importance of spiritual renewal and
          the rebuilding of the temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second section (chapters 9-14) consists of two "oracles" or
          prophetic messages. These chapters contain a mix of prophecies, some
          of which refer to events in the near future, while others point to the
          distant future and the coming of the Messiah. This section includes
          famous messianic prophecies, such as the prediction of the triumphant
          entry of the Messiah into Jerusalem on a donkey (9:9), and the
          prophecy of the piercing of the Messiah and the mourning that follows
          (12:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Zechariah's prophecies emphasize the importance of repentance,
          spiritual renewal, and faithfulness to God. They also stress God's
          sovereignty over history and His ultimate plan to establish His
          kingdom through the coming Messiah. The book portrays a future time of
          restoration and blessing for God's people, when Jerusalem will be a
          center of worship for all nations.
