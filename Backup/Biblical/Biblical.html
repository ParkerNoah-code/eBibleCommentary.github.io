        <a href="NT.html">New Testament</a> - "The Four Apostles" is a famous
        painting by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer, completed in
        1526. The artwork consists of two large panels, each featuring two
        apostles, making up a diptych. The painting was created during a time of
        significant religious change, influenced by the Protestant Reformation,
        which Dürer supported. The left panel depicts the apostles John and
        Peter, while the right panel shows Mark and Paul.

        <a href="Theology.html">Theology</a> - Herman Bavinck (1854–1921) was a
        prominent Dutch Reformed theologian known for his comprehensive and
        systematic approach to Christian doctrine. Bavinck became a key figure
        in the neo-Calvinist movement, closely associated with Abraham Kuyper.
        His magnum opus, the four-volume <em>Reformed Dogmatics</em>, is widely
        regarded as one of the most significant works of Reformed theology,
        offering a profound synthesis of biblical scholarship, historical
        theology, and philosophical insight.
