<h2>24. Of The Civil Magistrate</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> God, the Supreme Lord and King of all the world, hath
          ordained civil magistrates to be under him, over the people, for his
          own glory and the public good, and to this end hath armed them with
          the power of the sword, for the defense and encouragement of them that
          do good, and for the punishment of evil-doers.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Romans 13:1-4, 1 Peter 2:13-14</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> It is lawful for Christians to accept and execute the office
          of a magistrate when called thereunto;<sup>a</sup> in the management
          whereof, as they ought especially to maintain piety, justice, and
          peace, according to the wholesome laws of each commonwealth,<sup>b</sup>
          so, for that end, they may lawfully, now under the New Testament, wage
          war upon just and necessary occasion.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Proverbs 8:15-16, Romans 13:1-2, Romans 13:4
          <br/>

          b: 2 Samuel 23:3, Psalm 2:10-12, Psalm 82:3-4, 1 Timothy 2:2, 1 Peter
          2:13

          <br/>

          c: Matthew 8:9-10, Luke 3:14, Acts 10:1-2, Romans 13:4, Revelation
          17:14, Revelation 17:16
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Although the magistrate is bound to encourage, promote, and
          protect the professors and profession of the gospel, and to manage and
          order civil administrations in a due subserviency to the interest of
          Christ in the world, and to that end to take care that men of corrupt
          minds and conversations do not licentiously publish and divulge
          blasphemy and errors, in their own nature subverting the faith and
          inevitably destroying the souls of them that receive them: yet in such
          differences about the doctrines of the gospel, or ways of the worship
          of God, as may befall men exercising a good conscience, manifesting it
          in their conversation, and holding the foundation, not disturbing
          others in their ways or worship that differ from them; there is no
          warrant for the magistrate under the gospel to abridge them of their
          liberty.
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> It is the duty of people to pray for magistrates,<sup>a</sup>
          to honor their persons,<sup>b</sup> to pay them tribute and other
          dues,<sup>c</sup> to obey their lawful commands, and to be subject to
          their authority, for conscience' sake.<sup>d</sup> Infidelity or
          difference in religion doth not make void the magistrate's just
          and legal authority, nor free the people from their due obedience to
          him:<sup>e</sup> from which ecclesiastical persons are not
          exempted;<sup>f</sup> much less hath the Pope any power or
          jurisdiction over them in their dominions, or over any of their
          people; and least of all to deprive them of their dominions or lives,
          if he shall judge them to be heretics, or upon any other pretense
          whatsoever.<sup>g</sup>
