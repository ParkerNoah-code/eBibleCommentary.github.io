<h2>27. Of The Communion of Saints</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> All saints that are united to Jesus Christ their head, by
          his Spirit and by faith, although they are not made thereby one person
          with him have fellowship with him in his graces, sufferings, death,
          resurrection, and glory:<sup>a</sup> and being united to one another
          in love, they have communion in each other's gifts and
          graces,<sup>b</sup> and are obliged to the performance of such duties,
          public and private, as do conduce to their mutual good, both in the
          inward and outward man.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: John 1:16, Romans 6:5-6, Ephesians 2:5-6, Ephesians 3:16-19,
          Philippians 3:10, 2 Timothy 2:12, 1 John 1:3

          <br/>

          b: 1 Corinthians 3:21-23, 1 Corinthians 12:7, Ephesians 4:15-16,
          Colossians 2:19

          <br/>

          c: Romans 1:11-12, Romans 1:14, Galatians 6:10, 1 Thessalonians 5:11,
          1 Thessalonians 5:14, 1 John 3:16-18
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> All saints, by profession, are bound to maintain an holy
          fellowship and communion in the worship of God, and in performing such
          other spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification;<sup>a</sup>
          as also in relieving each other in outward things, according to their
          several abilities and necessities. Which communion, though especially
          to be exercised by them in the relations wherein they stand, whether
          in families or churches, yet as God offereth opportunity, is to be
          extended unto all those who, in every place, call upon the name of the
          Lord Jesus.<sup>b</sup>

          a: Isaiah 2:3, Acts 2:42, Acts 2:46, 1 Corinthians 11:20, Hebrews
          10:24-25
