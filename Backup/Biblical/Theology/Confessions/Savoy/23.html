<h2>22. Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath-Day</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> The light of nature showeth that there is a God, who hath
          lordship and sovereignty over all; is just, good, and doth good unto
          all; and is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon,
          trusted in, and served with all the heart, and with all the soul, and
          with all the might.<sup>a</sup> But the acceptable way of worshipping
          the true God is instituted by himself, and so limited to his own
          revealed will, that he may not be worshipped according to the
          imaginations and devices of men, or the suggestions of Satan, under
          any visible representations or any other way not prescribed in the
          Holy Scripture.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Joshua 24:14, Psalm 18:3, Psalm 31:23, Psalm 62:8, Psalm 119:68,
          Jeremiah 10:7, Mark 12:33, Acts 17:24, Romans 1:20, Romans 10:12

          <br/>

          b: Exodus 20:4-6, Deuteronomy 4:15-20, Deuteronomy 12:32, Matthew
          4:9-10, Matthew 15:9, Acts 17:25, Colossians 2:23
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Religious worship is to be given to God, the Father, Son,
          and Holy Ghost; and to him alone:<sup>a</sup> not to angels, saints,
          or any other creature:<sup>b</sup> and since the fall, not without a
          Mediator; nor in the mediation of any other but of Christ alone.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Matthew 4:10, John 5:23, 2 Corinthians 13:14
          <br/>
          b: Romans 1:25, Colossians 2:18, Revelation 19:10
          <br/>
          c: John 14:6, Ephesians 2:18, Colossians 3:17, 1 Timothy 2:5
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Prayer with thanksgiving, being one special part of natural
          worship,<sup>a</sup> is by God required of all men;<sup>b</sup> but
          that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son,<sup>c</sup>
          by the help of his Spirit,<sup>d</sup> according to his will,<sup>e</sup>
          with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and
          perseverance;<sup>f</sup> and, when with others, in a known
          tongue.<sup>g</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Philippians 4:6
          <br/>
          b: Psalm 65:2
          <br/>
          c: John 14:13-14, 1 Peter 2:5
          <br/>
          d: Romans 8:26
          <br/>
          e: 1 John 5:14
          <br/>

          f: Genesis 18:27, Psalm 47:7, Ecclesiastes 5:1-2, Matthew 6:12,
          Matthew 6:14-15, Mark 11:24, Ephesians 6:18, Colossians 4:2, Hebrews
          12:28, James 1:6-7, James 5:16
        </p>
<p>g: 1 Corinthians 14:14</p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Prayer is to be made for things lawful,<sup>a</sup> and for
          all sorts of men living, or that shall live hereafter;<sup>b</sup> but
          not for the dead,<sup>c</sup> nor for those of whom it may be known
          that they have sinned the sin unto death.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 1 John 5:14
          <br/>
          b: Ruth 4:12, 2 Samuel 7:29, John 17:20, 1 Timothy 2:1-2
          <br/>
          c: 2 Samuel 12:21-23, Luke 16:25-26, Revelation 14:13
          <br/>
          d: 1 John 5:16
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> The reading of the Scriptures, preaching, and hearing the
          Word of God, singing of psalms; as also the administration of baptism
          and the Lord's Supper, are all parts of religious worship of God,
          to be performed in obedience unto God with understanding, faith,
          reverence, and godly fear. Solemn humiliations, with fastings and
          thanksgivings upon special occasions, are in their several times and
          seasons to be used in a holy and religious manner.
        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> Neither prayer, nor any other part of religious worship, is
          now, under the gospel, either tied unto, or made more acceptable by
          any place in which it is performed, or towards which it is
          directed:<sup>a</sup> but God is to be worshipped everywhere<sup>b</sup>
          in spirit and truth;<sup>c</sup> as in private families<sup>d</sup>
          daily,<sup>e</sup> and in secret each one by himself,<sup>f</sup> so
          more solemnly in the public assemblies, which are not carelessly or
          willfully to be neglected or forsaken, when God, by his Word or
          providence, calleth thereunto.<sup>g</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: John 4:21
          <br/>
          b: Malachi 1:11, 1 Timothy 2:8
          <br/>
          c: John 4:23-24
          <br/>

          d: Deuteronomy 6:6-7, 2 Samuel 6:18, 2 Samuel 6:20, Job 1:5, Jeremiah
          10:25, Acts 10:2, 1 Peter 3:7

          <br/>
          e: Matthew 6:11
          <br/>
          f: Matthew 6:6, Ephesians 6:18
          <br/>

          g: Isaiah 56:6-7, Proverbs 1:20-21, Proverbs 1:24, Proverbs 8:34, Luke
          4:16, Acts 2:42, Acts 13:42, Hebrews 10:25
        </p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> As it is of the law of nature that, in general, a due
          proportion of time by God's appointment be set apart for the
          worship of God; so, by his Word, in a positive, moral, and perpetual
          commandment, binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly
          appointed one day in seven for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto
          him:<sup>a</sup> which, from the beginning of the world to the
          resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and, from the
          resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the
          week,<sup>b</sup> which in Scripture is called the Lord's
          day,<sup>c</sup> and is to be continued to the end of the world, as
          the Christian Sabbath,<sup>d</sup> the observation of the last day of
          the week being abolished.
        </p>
<p>
          a: Exodus 20:8, Exodus 20:10-11, Isaiah 56:2, Isaiah 56:4, Isaiah
          56:6-7

          <br/>
          b: Genesis 2:2-3, Acts 20:7, 1 Corinthians 16:1-2
          <br/>
          c: Revelation 1:10
          <br/>
          d: Exodus 20:8, Exodus 20:10, Matthew 5:17-18
        </p>
<p>
<b>8.</b> This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men,
          after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common
          affairs beforehand, do not only observe an holy rest all the day from
          their own works, words, and thoughts, about their worldly employments
          and recreations;<sup>a</sup> but also are taken up the whole time in
          the public and private exercises of his worship, and in the duties of
          necessity and mercy.<sup>b</sup>
