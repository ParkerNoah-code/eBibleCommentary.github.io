<h2>28. Of The Sacraments</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Sacraments are holy signs and seals of the covenant of
          grace,<sup>a</sup> immediately instituted by Christ,<sup>b</sup> to
          represent him and his benefits, and to confirm our interest in
          him:<sup>c</sup> and solemnly to engage us to the service of God in
          Christ, according to his Word.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Genesis 17:7, Genesis 17:10, Romans 4:11
          <br/>
          b: Matthew 28:19, 1 Corinthians 11:23
          <br/>
          c: 1 Corinthians 10:16, 1 Corinthians 11:25-26, Galatians 3:27
          <br/>
          d: Romans 6:3-4, 1 Corinthians 10:16, 1 Corinthians 10:21
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> There is in every sacrament a spiritual relation or
          sacramental union, between the sign and the thing signified; whence it
          comes to pass that the names and the effects of the one are attributed
          to the other.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Genesis 17:10, Matthew 26:27-28, Titus 3:5</p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> The grace which is exhibited in or by the sacraments,
          rightly used, is not conferred by any power in them; neither doth the
          efficacy of a sacrament depend upon the piety or intention of him that
          doth administer it,<sup>a</sup> but upon the work of the Spirit,<sup>b</sup>
          and the word of institution, which contains, together with a precept
          authorizing the use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy
          receivers.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 2:28-29, 1 Peter 3:21
          <br/>
          b: Matthew 3:11, 1 Corinthians 12:13
          <br/>
          c: Matthew 26:27-28
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> There be only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in
          the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Lord's Supper:
          neither of which may be dispensed by any but by a minister of the Word
          lawfully called.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Matthew 28:19-20, Matthew 28:19, 1 Corinthians 4:1, 1 Corinthians
          11:20, 1 Corinthians 11:23, Hebrews 5:4
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> The sacraments of the Old Testament, in regard of the
          spiritual things thereby signified and exhibited, were, for substance,
          the same with those of the New.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: 1 Corinthians 10:1-4</p>
