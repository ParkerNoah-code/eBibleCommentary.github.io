<h2>32. Of The Last Judgment</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in
          righteousness by Jesus Christ,<sup>a</sup> to whom all power and
          judgment is given of the Father.<sup>b</sup> In which day, not only
          the apostate angels shall be judged,<sup>c</sup> but likewise all
          persons, that have lived upon earth, shall appear before the tribunal
          of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds; and
          to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good
          or evil.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Acts 17:31
          <br/>
          b: John 5:22
          <br/>
          c: 1 Corinthians 6:3, 2 Peter 2:4, Jude 6
          <br/>

          d: Ecclesiastes 12:14, Matthew 12:36-37, Romans 2:16, Romans 14:10,
          Romans 14:12, 2 Corinthians 5:12
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> The end of God's appointing this day, is for the
          manifestation of the glory of his mercy in the eternal salvation of
          the elect;<sup>a</sup> and of his justice in the damnation of the
          reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient.<sup>b</sup> For then shall
          the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fulness of
          joy glory, with everlasting reward in the presence of the Lord:<sup>c</sup>
          but the wicked, who know not God, and obey not the gospel of Jesus
          Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with
          everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the
          glory of his power.<sup>d</sup>

          <br/>
          d: Matthew 25:41, Matthew 25:46, 2 Thessalonians 1:9
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there
          shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin, and for
          the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity:<sup>a</sup>
          so will he have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off all
          carnal security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what
          hour the Lord will come; and may be ever prepared to say, Come, Lord
          Jesus, come quickly. Amen.<sup>b</sup>
