<h2>30. Of The Lord's Supper</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Our Lord Jesus, in the night wherein he was betrayed,
          instituted the sacrament of his body and blood, called the Lord's
          Supper, to be observed in his churches, to the end of the world; for
          the perpetual remembrance and showing forth of the sacrifice of
          himself in his death, the sealing of all benefits thereof unto true
          believers, their spiritual nourishment and growth in him, their
          further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto him; and
          to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each
          other, as members of his mystical body.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 1 Corinthians 10:16-17, 1 Corinthians 10:21, 1 Corinthians
          11:23-26, 1 Corinthians 12:13
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> In this sacrament Christ is not offered up to his Father,
          nor any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sins of the quick
          or dead,<sup>a</sup> but only a memorial of that one offering up of
          himself, by himself, upon the cross, once for all, and a spiritual
          oblation of all possible praise unto God for the same;<sup>b</sup> so
          that the Popish sacrifice of the mass, as they call it, is most
          abominable, injurious to Christ's own only sacrifice, the alone
          propitiation for all the sins of the elect.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Hebrews 9:22, Hebrews 9:25-26, Hebrews 9:28
          <br/>
          b: Matthew 26:26-27, 1 Corinthians 11:24-26
          <br/>

          c: Hebrews 7:23-24, Hebrews 7:27, Hebrews 10:11-12, Hebrews 10:14,
          Hebrews 10:18
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> The Lord Jesus hath, in this ordinance, appointed his
          ministers to declare his word of institution to the people, to pray,
          and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them
          apart from a common to an holy use; and to take and break the bread,
          to take the cup, and (they communicating also themselves) to give both
          to the communicants;<sup>a</sup> but to none who are not then present
          in the congregation.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Matthew 26:26-28, Mark 14:22-24, Luke 22:19-20, 1 Corinthians
          11:23-27

          <br/>
          b: Acts 20:7, 1 Corinthians 11:20
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Private masses, or receiving this sacrament by a priest, or
          any other, alone;<sup>a</sup> as likewise the denial of the cup to the
          people;<sup>b</sup> worshipping the elements, the lifting them up, or
          carrying them about for adoration, and the reserving them for any
          pretended religious use, are all contrary to the nature of this
          sacrament, and to the institution of Christ.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 1 Corinthians 10:6
          <br/>
          b: Mark 4:23, 1 Corinthians 11:25-29
          <br/>
          c: Matthew 15:9
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to
          the uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as
          that truly, yet sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the
          name of the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of
          Christ;<sup>a</sup> albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain
          truly, and only, bread and wine, as they were before.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Matthew 26:26-28
          <br/>
          b: Matthew 26:29, 1 Corinthians 11:26-28
        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of
          bread and wine, into the substance of Christ's body and blood
          (commonly called transubstantiation) by consecration of a priest, or
          by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to
          common sense and reason; overthroweth the nature of the sacrament; and
          hath been, and is the cause of manifold superstitions, yea, of gross
          idolatries.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Luke 24:6, Luke 24:39, Acts 3:21, 1 Corinthians 11:24-26</p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible
          elements in this sacrament,<sup>a</sup> do then also inwardly by
          faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but
          spiritually, receive and feed upon Christ crucified, and all benefits
          of his death: the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally
          or carnally in, with, or under the bread and wine; yet as really, but
          spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as
          the elements themselves are, to their outward senses.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 1 Corinthians 11:28
          <br/>
          b: 1 Corinthians 10:16
        </p>
<p>
<b>8.</b> All ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy
          communion with Christ, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table,
          and cannot without great sin against him, while they remain such,
          partake of these holy mysteries, or be admitted thereunto; yea,
          whosoever shall receive unworthily, are guilty of the body and blood
          of the Lord, eating and drinking judgment to themselves.
