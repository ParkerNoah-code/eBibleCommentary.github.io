      <h1>Savoy Declaration of Faith</h1>
      

<h2>A Preface</h2>
<p>
          Confession of the Faith that is in us, when justly called for, is so
          indispensable a due all owe to the Glory of the Sovereign GOD, that it
          is ranked among the Duties of the first Commandment, such as Prayer
          is; and therefore by Paul yoked with Faith itself, as necessary to
          salvation: with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with
          the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Our Lord Christ himself,
          when he was accused of his Doctrine, considered simply as a matter of
          fact by Preaching, refused to answer; because, as such, it lay upon
          evidence, and a matter of testimony of others; unto whom therefore he
          refers himself: But when both the High-Priest and Pilate expostulate
          his Faith, and what he held himself to be; he without any demur at
          all, cheerfully makes his Declaration, That he was the Son of God; so
          to the High-Priest: and that he was a King, and born to be a King;
          thus to Pilate. Though upon the uttering of it his life lay at stake;
          Which holy Profession of his is celebrated for our example, 1 Tim. vi.
          13.
        </p>
<p>
          Confessions, when made by a company of Professors of Christianity
          jointly meeting to that end, the most genuine and natural use of such
          Confessions is, That under the same form of words, they express the
          substance of the same common salvation or unity of their faith;
          whereby speaking the same things, they show themselves perfectly
          joined in the same mind, and in the same judgment, 1 Cor i.10.
        </p>
<p>
          And accordingly such a transaction is to be looked upon but as a meet
          or fit medium or means whereby to express that their common faith and
          salvation, and no way to be made use of as an imposition upon any:
          Whatever is of force or constraint in matters of this nature, causeth
          them to degenerate from the name and nature of Confessions, and turns
          them from being Confessions of Faith, into Exaetions and Impositions
          of Faith.
        </p>
<p>
          And such common Confessions of the Orthodox faith, made in simplicity
          of heart by any such body of Christians, with concord among
          themselves, ought to be entertained by all others that love the truth
          as it is in Jesus, with an answerable rejoicing: For if the unanimous
          opinions and assertions but in some few points of Religion, and that
          when by two Churches, namely, that of Jerusalem, and the Messengers of
          Antioch met, assisted by some of the Apostles, were by the Believers
          of those times received with so much joy, (as it is said, They
          rejoiced for the consolation) much more this is to be done, when the
          whole substance of Faith, and form of wholesome words shall be
          declared by the Messengers of a multitude of Churches, though wanting
          those advantages of Counsel and Authority of the Apostles, which that
          Assembly had.
        </p>
<p>
          Which acceptation is then more specially due, when these shall (to
          choose) utter and declare their Faith, in the same substance for
          matter, yea, words, for the most part, that other Churches and
          Assemblies, reputed the most Orthodox, have done before them: For upon
          such a correspondency, all may see that actually accomplished, which
          the Apostle did but exhort unto, and pray for, in those two more
          eminent Churches of the Corinthians and the Romans, (and so in them
          for all the Christians of his time) that both Jew and Gentile, that
          is, men of different persuasions, (as they were) might glorify GOD
          with one mind and with one mouth. And truly, the very turning of the
          Gentiles to the owning of the same Faith, in the substance of it, with
          the Christian Jew (though differing in greater points than we do from
          our Brethren) is presently after dignified by the Apostle with this
          style, That it is the Confession of Jesus Christ himself; not as the
          Object only, but as the Author and Maker thereof: I will confess to
          thee (saith Christ to God) among the Gentiles. So that in all such
          accords, Christ is the great and first Confessor; and we, and all our
          Faith uttered by Us, are but the Epistles, (as Paul) and Confessions
          (as Isaiah there) of their Lord and ours; He, but expressing what is
          written in his heart, through their hearts and mouths, to the glory of
          God the Father: And shall we not all rejoice herein, when as Christ
          himself is said to do it upon this occasion: as it there also follows,
          I will sing unto thy Name.
        </p>
<p>
          Further, as the soundness and wholesomeness of the matter gives the
          vigor and life to such Confessions, so the inward freeness,
          willingness, and readiness of the Spirits of the Confessors do
          contribute to the beauty and loveliness thereunto: As it is in Prayer
          to God, so in Confessions made to men. If two or three met, do agree,
          it renders both, to either the more acceptable. The Spirit of Christ
          is in himself too free, great and generous a Spirit, to suffer himself
          to be used by any human arm, to whip men into belief; he drives not,
          but gently leads into all truth, and persuades men to dwell in the
          tents of like precious Faith; which would lose of its preciousness and
          value, if that sparkle of freeness shone not in it: The Character of
          his People, is to be a willing people in the day of his power (not
          Man’s) in the beauties of holiness, which are the Assemblings of the
          Saints: one glory of which Assemblings in that first Church, is said
          to have been, They met with one accord; which is there in that Psalm
          prophesied of, in the instance of that first Church, for all other
          that should succeed.
        </p>
<p>
          And as this great Spirit is in himself free, when, and how far, and in
          whom to work, so where and when he doth work, he carrieth it with the
          same freedom, and is said to be a free Spirit, as he both is, and
          works in us: And where this Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
        </p>
<p>
          Now as to this Confession of ours, besides, that a conspicuous
          conjunction of the particulars mentioned, hath appeared therein: There
          are also four remarkable Attendants thereon, which added, might
          perhaps in the eyes of sober and indifferent Spirits, give the whole
          of this Transaction a room and rank amongst other many good and
          memorable things of this Age; at least all set together, do cast as
          clear a gleam and manifestation of God’s Power and Presence, as hath
          appeared in any such kind of Confessions, made by so numerous a
          company these later years.
        </p>
<p>
          The first, is the Temper (or distemper rather) of the Times, during
          which, these Churches have been gathering, and which they have run
          through. All do (out of a general sense) complain that these times
          have been perilous, or difficult times (as the Apostle foretold); and
          that in respect to danger from seducing spirits, more perilous than
          the hottest seasons of Persecution.
        </p>
<p>
          We have failed through an Aestuatio, Fluxes and Refluxes of great
          varieties of Spirits, Doctrines, Opinions and Occurrences, and
          especially in the matter of Opinions, which have been accompanied in
          their several seasons, with powerful persuasions and temptations, to
          seduce those of our way. It is known, men have taken the freedom
          (notwithstanding what Authority hath interposed to the contrary) to
          vent and vend their own vain and accursed imaginations, contrary to
          the great and fixed Truths of the Gospel, insomuch, as to take the
          whole Round and Circle of Delusions, the Devil hath in this small
          time, ran; it will be found, that every Truth, of greater or lesser
          weight, hath by one or the other hand, at one time or another, been
          questioned and called to the Bar amongst us, yea, and impleaded, under
          the pretext (which hath some degree of Justice in it) that all should
          not be bound up to the Traditions of former times, nor take Religion
          upon trust.
        </p>
<p>
          Whence it hath come to pass, that many of the soundest Professors were
          put upon a new search and disquisition of such Truths, as they had
          taken for granted, and yet had lived upon the comfort of: to the end
          they might be able to convince others, and establish their own hearts
          against that darkness and unbelief, that is ready to close with error,
          or at least to doubt of the truth, when error is speciously presented.
          And hereupon we do professedly account it one of the greatest
          advantages gained out of the Temptations of these Times, yea the honor
          of the Saints and Ministers of these Nations, That after they had
          sweetly been exercised in, and had improved practical and experimental
          Truths, this should be their further Lot, to examine and discuss, and
          indeed anew to learn over every Doctrinal Truth, both out of the
          Scriptures, and also with a fresh taste thereof in their own hearts;
          which is no other than what the Apostle exhorts to, Try all things,
          hold fast that which is good. Conversion unto God at first, what is it
          else than a savory and affectionate application, and the bringing home
          to the heart with spiritual light and life, all truths that are
          necessary to salvation, together with other lesser Truths? All which
          we had afore conversion taken in but notionally from common Education
          and Tradition.
        </p>
<p>
          Now that after this first gust those who have been thus converted
          should be put upon a new probation and search out the Scriptures, not
          only of all principles explicitly ingredients to Conversion; (unto
          which the Apostle referreth the Galatians when they had diverted from
          them) but of all other superstructures as well as fundamentals; and
          together therewith, anew to experiment the power and sweetness of all
          these in their own souls: What is this but tried Faith indeed? And
          equivalent to a new conversion unto the truth? An Anchor that is
          proved to be sure and steadfast, that will certainly hold in all
          contrary storms. This was the eminent seal and commendation which
          those holy Apostles that lived and wrote last (Peter, John and Jude in
          their Epistles) did set and give to the Christians of the latter part
          of those primitive times. And besides, it is clear and evident by all
          the other Epistles, from first to last, that it cost the Apostles as
          much, and far more care and pains to preserve them they had converted,
          in the truth, than they had taken to turn them thereunto at first: And
          it is in itself as great a work and instance of the power of God, that
          keeps, yea, guards us through faith unto salvation.
        </p>
<p>
          Secondly, let this be added (or superadded rather) to give full weight
          and measure, even to running over, that we have all along this season,
          held forth (though quarreled with for it by our brethren) this great
          principle of these times, That amongst all Christian States and
          Churches, there ought to be vouchsafed a forbearance and mutual
          indulgence unto Saints of all persuasions, that keep unto, and hold
          fast the necessary foundations of faith and holiness, in all other
          matters extra fundamental, whether of Faith or Order.
        </p>
<p>
          This to have been our constant principle, we are not ashamed to
          confess to the whole Christian world. Wherein yet we desire we may be
          understood, not as if in the abstract we stood indifferent to
          falsehood or truth, or were careless whether faith or error, in any
          Truths but fundamental, did obtain or not, so we had our liberty in
          our petty and smaller differences; or as if to make sure of that, we
          had cut out this wide cloak for it: No, we profess that the whole, and
          every particle of that Faith delivered to the Saints (the substance of
          which we have according to our light here professed) is, as to the
          propagation and furtherance of it by all Gospel means, as precious to
          us as our lives; or what can be supposed dear to us; and in our sphere
          we have endeavored to promote them accordingly: But yet withal, we
          have and do contend for this, That in the concrete, the persons of all
          such gracious Saints, they and their errors, as they are in them, when
          they are but such errors as do and may stand with communion with
          Christ, though they should not repent of them, as not being convinced
          of them to the end of their days; that those, with their errors (that
          are purely spiritual, and intrench and overthrow not civil societies,)
          as concrete with their persons, should for Christ’s sake be borne
          withal by all Christians in the world; and they notwithstanding be
          permitted to enjoy all Ordinances and spiritual Privileges according
          to their light, as freely as any other of their brethren that pretend
          to the greatest Orthodoxy; as having as equal, and as fair a right in
          and unto Christ, and all the holy things of Christ, that any other can
          challenge to themselves.
        </p>
<p>
          And this doth afford a full and invincible testimony on our behalf, in
          that whiles we have so earnestly contended for this just liberty of
          Saints in all the Churches of Christ, we ourselves have no need of it:
          that is, as to the matter of the profession of Faith which we have
          maintained together with others: and of this, this subsequent
          Confession of Faith gives sufficient evidence. So as we have the
          confidence in Christ, to utter in the words of those two great
          Apostles, That we have stood fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath
          made us free (in the behalf of others, rather than ourselves) and
          having been free, have not made use of our liberty for a cloak of
          error or maliciousness in ourselves. And yet, lo, whereas from the
          beginning of the rearing of these Churches, that of the Apostle hath
          been (by some) prophesied of us, and applied to us, That while we
          promised (unto others) liberty, we ourselves would become servants of
          corruption, and be brought in bondage to all sorts of fancies and
          imaginations, yet the whole world may now see after the experience of
          many years ran through (and it is manifest by this Confession) that
          the great and gracious God hath not only kept us in that common unity
          of the Faith and Knowledge of the Son of God, which the whole
          Community of Saints have and shall in their Generations come unto, but
          also in the same Truths, both small and great, that are built
          thereupon, that any other of the best and more pure Reformed Churches
          in their best times (which were their first times) have arrived unto:
          This Confession withal holding forth a professed opposition unto the
          common errors and heresies of these times.
        </p>
<p>
          These two considerations have been taken from the seasons we have gone
          through.
        </p>
<p>
          Thirdly, let the space of time itself, or days, wherein from first to
          last the whole of this Confession was framed and consented to by the
          whole of us, be duly considered by sober and ingenious spirits: the
          whole of days in which we had meetings about it (set aside the two
          Lord’s days, and the first day’s meeting, in which we considered and
          debated what to pitch upon) were but 11 days, part of which also was
          spent by some of us in Prayer, others in consulting; and in the end
          all agreeing. We mention this small circumstance but to this end
          (which still adds unto the former) That it gives demonstration, not of
          our freeness and willingness only, but of our readiness and
          preparedness unto so great a work; which otherwise, and in other
          Assemblies, hath ordinarily taken up long and great debates, as in
          such a variety of matters of such concernment, may well be supposed to
          fall out. And this is no other than what the Apostle Peter exhorts
          unto, Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a
          reason, or account of the hope that is in you. The Apostle Paul saith
          of the spiritual Truths of the Gospel, That God hath prepared them for
          those that love him. The inward and innate constitution of the new
          Creature being in itself such as is suited to all those Truths, as
          congenial thereunto: But although there be this mutual adaptness
          between these two, yet such is the mixture of ignorance, darkness and
          unbelief, carnal reason, pre-occupation of judgment, interest of
          parties, wantonness in opinion, proud adhering to our own persuasions,
          and perverse oppositions and averseness to agree with others, and a
          multitude of such like distempers common to believing man: All which
          are not only mixed with, but at times (especially in such times as
          have passed over our heads) are ready to overcloud our judgments, and
          to cause our eyes to be double, and sometimes prevail as well as
          lusts, and do bias our wills and affections: And such is their
          mixture, that although there may be existent an habitual preparedness
          in men’s spirits, yet not always a present readiness to be found,
          specially not in such a various multitude of men, to make a solemn and
          deliberate profession of all truths, it being as great a work to find
          the spirits of the just (perhaps the best of Saints) ready for every
          truth, as to be prepared to every good work.
        </p>
<p>
          It is therefore to be looked at, as a great and special work of the
          Holy Ghost, that so numerous a company of Ministers, and other
          principal brethren, should so readily, speedily, and jointly give up
          themselves unto such a whole Body of Truths that are after godliness.
        </p>
<p>
          This argues that they had not their faith to seek; but, as is said of
          Ezra, that they were ready Scribes, and (as Christ) instructed unto
          the Kingdom of Heaven, being as the good householders of so many
          families of Christ, bringing forth of their store and treasury New and
          Old. It shows these truths had been familiar to them, and they
          acquainted with them, as with their daily food and provision (as
          Christ’s allusion there insinuates): In a word, that so they had
          preached, and that so their people had believed, as the Apostle speaks
          upon one like particular occasion. And the Apostle Paul considers (in
          cases of this nature) the suddenness or length of time, either one way
          or the other; whether it were in men’s forsaking of learning of the
          truth. Thus the suddenness in the Galatians’ case in leaving the
          truth, he makes a wonder of it: I marvel that you are SO SOON (that
          is, in so short a time) removed from the true Gospel unto another.
          Again on the contrary, in the Hebrews he aggravates their
          backwardness, That when for the first time you ought to be Teachers,
          you had need that one teach you the very first principles of the
          Oracles of God. The Parallel contrary to both these having fallen out
          in this transaction, may have some ingredient and weight with
          ingenious spirits in its kind, according to the proportion is put upon
          either of these forementioned in their adverse kind, and obtain the
          like special observation.
        </p>
<p>
          This accord of ours hath fallen out without having held any
          correspondency together, or prepared consultation, by which we might
          come to be advised of one another’s minds. We allege this not as a
          matter of commendation in us; no, we acknowledge it to have been a
          great neglect: And accordingly one of the first proposals for union
          amongst us was, That there might be a constant correspondence held
          among the Churches for counsel and mutual edification, so for time to
          come to present the like omission.
        </p>
<p>
          We confess that from the first, every [one], or at least the
          generality of our Churches, have been in a manner like so many Ships
          (though holding forth the same general colors) launched singly, and
          sailing apart and alone on the vast Ocean of these tumultuating times,
          and they exposed to every wind of Doctrine, under no other conduct
          than the Word and Spirit, and their particular Elders and principal
          Brethren, without Associations among ourselves, or so much as holding
          out common lights to others, whereby to know where we are.
        </p>
<p>
          But yet whilst we thus confess to our own shame this neglect, let all
          acknowledge, that God hath ordered it for his high and greater glory,
          in that his singular care and power should have watched over each of
          these, as that all should be found to have steered their course by the
          same Chart, and to have been bound for one and the same Port, and that
          upon this general search now made, that the same holy and blessed
          truths of all sorts, which are current and warrantable amongst all the
          other Churches of Christ in the world, should be found to be our
          Lading.
        </p>
<p>
          The whole, and every [one] of these things when put together, do cause
          us (whatever men of prejudiced and opposite spirits may find out to
          slight them) with a holy admiration, to say, That this is no other
          than the Lord’s doing; and which we with thanksgiving do take from his
          hand as a special token upon us for good, and doth show that God is
          faithful and upright towards those that are planted in his house: And
          that as the Faith was but once for all, and intentionally first
          delivered unto the Saints; so the Saints, when not abiding scattered,
          but gathered under their respective Pastors according to God’s heart
          into an house, and Churches unto the living God, such together are, as
          Paul forspake it, the most steady and firm pillar and seat of Truth
          that God hath any where appointed to himself on earth, where his truth
          is best conserved, and publicly held forth; there being in such
          Assemblies weekly a rich dwelling of the Word amongst them, that is, a
          daily open house kept by the means of those good Householders, their
          Teachers and other Instructors respectively appropriated to them, whom
          Christ in the virtue of his Ascension, continues to give as gifts to
          his people, himself dwelling amongst them; to the end that by this, as
          the most sure standing permanent means, the Saints might be perfected,
          till we all (even all the Saints in present and future ages) do come
          by this constant and daily Ordinance of his unto the unity of the
          Faith and Knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the
          measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (which though growing
          on by parts and piecemeal, will yet appear complete, when that great
          and general Assembly shall be gathered, then when this world is ended,
          and these dispensations have had their fullness and period) and so
          that from henceforth (such a provision being made for us) we be no
          more children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
          Doctrine.
        </p>
<p>
          And finally, this doth give a fresh and recent demonstration, that the
          great Apostle and High-priest of our profession is indeed ascended
          into heaven, and continues there with power and care, faithful as a
          son over his own house, whose house are we, if we hold fast the
          confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end: and shows
          that he will, as he hath promised, be with his own Institutions to the
          end of the world.
        </p>
<p>
          It is true, that many sad miscarriages, and divisions, breeches,
          fallings off from holy Ordinances of God, have along this time of
          tentation (especially in the beginning of it) been found in some of
          our Churches; and no wonder, if what hath been said be fully
          considered: Many reasons might further be given hereof, that would be
          a sufficient Apology, without the help of a retortion upon other
          Churches (that promised themselves peace) how that more destroying
          ruptures have befallen them, and that in a wider sphere and compass;
          which though it should not justify us, yet may serve to stop others’
          mouths.
        </p>
<p>
          Let Rome glory of the peace in, and obedience of her Children, against
          the Reformed Churches for their divisions which occurred (especially
          in the first rearing of them) whilst we all know the causes of their
          dull and stupid peace to have been carnal interests, worldly
          correspondencies, and coalitions, strengthened by gratifications of
          all sorts of men by that Religion, the principles of blind Devotion,
          Traditional Faith, Ecclesiastical Tyranny, by which she keeps her
          Children in bondage to this day. We are also certain, that the very
          same prejudices that from hence they would cast upon the Reformed (if
          they were just) do lie as fully against those pure Churches raised up
          by the Apostles themselves in those first times: for as we have heard
          of their patience, sufferings, consolations, and the transcending
          gifts poured out, and graces shining in them, so we have heard
          complaints of their divisions too, of the forsakings of their
          Assemblies, as the custom or manner of SOME was (which later were in
          that respect felo de se, and needed no other delivering up to Satan as
          their punishment, than what they executed upon themselves). We read of
          the shipwreck also of Faith and a good Conscience, and overthrowings
          of the faith of some; and still but of some not all, nor the most:
          which is one piece of an Apology the Apostle again and again inserts
          to future ages, and through mercy we have the same to make.
        </p>
<p>
          And truly we take the confidence professedly to say, that these
          tentations common to the purest Churches of Saints separated from the
          mixture of the world, though they grieve us (for who is offended, and
          we burn not?), yet they do not at all stumble us, as to the truth of
          our way, had they been many more: We say it again, these stumble us no
          more (as to that point) than it doth offend us against the power of
          Religion itself, to have seen, and to see daily in particular persons
          called out and separated from the world by an effectual work of
          conversion, that they for a while do suffer under disquietments,
          vexations, turmoils, unsettlements of spirit, that they are tossed
          with tempests and horrid tentations, such as they had not in their
          former estate, whilst they walked according to the course of this
          world: For Peter hath sufficiently instructed us whose business it is
          to raise such storms, even the Devil’s; and also whose design it is,
          that after they have suffered a while, thereby they shall be settled,
          perfected, established, that have so suffered, even the God of all
          Grace. And look what course of dispensation God holds to Saints
          personally, he doth the like to bodies of Saints in Churches and the
          Devil the same for his part too: And that consolatory Maxim of the
          Apostle, God shall tread down Satan under your feet shortly, which
          Paul uttereth concerning the Church of Rome, shows how both God and
          Satan have this very hand therein; for he speaks that very thing in
          reference unto their divisions, as the coherence clearly manifests;
          and so you have both designs expressed at once.
        </p>
<p>
          Yea, we are not a little induced to think, that the divisions,
          breaches, etc., of those primitive Churches would not have been so
          frequent among the people themselves, and not the Elders only, had not
          the freedom, liberties, and rights of Members (the Brethren, we mean)
          been stated and exercised in those Churches, the same which we
          maintain and contend for to be in ours.
        </p>
<p>
          Yea (which perhaps may seem more strange to many) had not those
          Churches been constituted of members enlightened further than with
          notional and traditional knowledge, by a new and more powerful light
          of the Holy Ghost, wherein they had been made partakers of the Holy
          ghost and the heavenly gift, and their hearts had tasted the good Word
          of God, and the Powers of the world to come, and of such Members at
          lowest, there had not fallen out those kinds of divisions among them.
        </p>
<p>
          For Experience hath shown, that the common sort of mere Doctrinal
          Professors (such as the most are nowadays), whose highest education is
          but freedom from moral scandal, joined with devotion to Christ through
          mere Education, such as in many Turks is found towards Mohammed, that
          these finding and feeling themselves not much concerned in the active
          part of Religion, so they may have the honor (especially upon a
          Reformation of a new Refinement) that themselves are approved Members,
          admitted to the Lord’s Supper, and their Children to the Ordinance of
          Baptism; they regard not other matters (as Gallio did not), but do
          easily and readily give up themselves unto their Guides, being like
          dead fishes carried with the common stream; whereas those that have a
          further renewed Light by a work of the Holy Ghost, whether saving or
          temporary, are upon the quite contrary grounds apt to be busy about,
          and inquisitive into, what they are to receive and practice, or
          wherein their Consciences are professedly concerned and involved: And
          thereupon they take the freedom to examine and try the spirits,
          whether of God or no: And from hence are more apt to dissatisfaction,
          and from thence to run into division, and many of such proving to be
          enlightened but with a temporary, not saving Faith (who have such a
          work of the Spirit upon them, and profession in them, as will and doth
          approve itself to the judgment of the Saints, and ought to be so
          judged, until they be otherwise discovered) who at long-run, prove
          hypocrites, through indulgence unto Lusts, and then out of their Lusts
          persist to hold up these divisions unto breach of, or departings from,
          Churches, and the Ordinances of God, and God is even with them for it,
          they waxing worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived; and even
          many of those that are sincere, through a mixture of darkness and
          erroneousness in their Judgments, are for a season apt out of
          Conscience to be led away with the error of others, which lie in wait
          to deceive.
        </p>
<p>
          Insomuch as the Apostle upon the example of those first times,
          forseeing also the like events in following generations upon the
          causes, hath been bold to set this down as a ruled Case, that likewise
          in other Churches so constituted and de facto emprivileged as that of
          the Church of Corinth was (which single Church, in the Sacred Records
          about it, is the completest Mirror of Church Constitution, Order, and
          Government, and Events thereupon ensuing, of any one Church whatever
          that we have a story of), his Maxim is, There must be also divisions
          amongst you; he setly inserts an [ALSO] in the case, as that which had
          been his own observation, and that which would be epi to polu the fate
          of the other Churches like thereunto, so prophesieth he: And he speaks
          this as peremptorily, as he doth elsewhere in that other, We must
          through tribulations enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: Yea, and that
          all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution:
          There is a [MUST] upon both alike; and we bless God, that we have run
          through both, and do say, and we say no more, That as it was then, so
          it is now, in both respects.
        </p>
<p>
          However, such hath been the powerful hand of God’s providence in
          these, which have been the worst of our Trials, That out of an
          approved Experience and Observation of the Issue, we are able to add
          that other part of the Apostle’s Prediction, That therefore such rents
          must be, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you;
          which holy issue God (as having aimed at it therein) doth frequently
          and certainly bring about in Churches, as he doth bring upon them that
          other fate of division, Let them therefore look unto it, that are the
          Authors of such disturbances, as the Apostle warneth, Gal. V. 10. The
          experiment is this, That we have seen, and do daily see, that
          multitudes of holy and precious souls, and (in the Holy Ghost ‘s word)
          approved Saints, have been, and are the more rooted and grounded by
          means of these shakings, and do continue to cleave the faster to
          Christ, and the purity of his Ordinances, and value them the more by
          this cost God hath put them to for the enjoying of them, Who having
          been planted in the House of the Lord, have flourished in the Courts
          of our God, in these evil times, to show that the Lord is upright. And
          this experimented event from out of such divisions, hath more
          confirmed us, and is a louder Apology for us, than all that our
          opposites are able from our breaches to allege to prejudice us.
        </p>
<p>
          We will add a few words for conclusion, and give a more particular
          account of this our Declaration. In drawing up this Confession of
          Faith, we have had before us the Articles of Religion, approved and
          passed by both Houses of Parliament, after advice had with an Assembly
          of Divines, called together by them for that purpose. To which
          Confession, for the substance of it, we fully assent, as do our
          Brethren of New England, and the Churches also of Scotland, as each in
          their general Synods have testified.
        </p>
<p>
          A few things we have added for obviating some erroneous Opinions, that
          have been more broadly and boldly here of late maintained by the
          Asserters, than in former times; and made other additions and
          alterations in method, here and there, and some clearer Explanations,
          as we found occasion.
        </p>
<p>
          We have endeavored throughout, to hold such Truths in this our
          Confession, as are more properly termed matters of Faith; and what is
          of Church-order, we dispose in certain Propositions by itself. To this
          course we are led by the Example of the Honorable Houses of
          Parliament, observing what was established, and what omitted by them
          in that Confession the Assembly presented to them. Who thought it is
          not convenient to have matters of Discipline and Church Government put
          into a Confession of Faith, especially the particulars thereof, as
          then were, and still are controverted and under dispute by men
          Orthodox and found in Faith. The 30th chap. Therefore of that
          Confession, as it was presented to them by the Assembly, which is of
          Church Censures, their Use, Kinds, and in whom placed: As also chap.
          31, of Synods and Councils, by whom to be called, of what force in
          their Decrees and Determinations. And the 4th Paragr. of the 20th
          chap., which determines what Opinions and Practices disturb the peace
          of the Church, and how such Disturbers ought to be proceeded against
          by the Censures of the Church, and punished by the Civil Magistrate.
          Also a great part of the 24th chap. of Marriage and Divorce. These
          were such doubtful assertions, and so unsuitable to a Confession of
          Faith, as the Honorable Houses in their great Wisdom thought fit to
          lay them aside: There being nothing that tends more to heighten
          Dissensions among Brethren, than to determine and adopt the manner of
          their difference, under so high a Title, as to be an Article of our
          Faith: So that there are two whole Chapters, and some Paragraphs in
          other Chapters in their Confession, that we have upon this account
          omitted; and the rather do we give this notice, because that Copy of
          the Parl. followed by us, is in few men’s hands; the other as it came
          from the Assembly, being approved of in Scotland, was printed and
          hastened into the world, before the Parl. had declared their
          Resolutions about it; which was not till June 20, 1648, and yet had
          been, and continueth to be the Copy (ordinarily) only sold, printed,
          and reprinted for these 11 years.
        </p>
<p>
          After the 19th chap. of the Law, we have added a cap. of the Gospel,
          it being a Title that may not well be omitted in a Confession of
          Faith: In which Chapter, what is dispersed, and by intimation in the
          Assemblies’ Confession, with some little addition, is here brought
          together, and more fully, under one head.
        </p>
<p>
          That there are not Scriptures annexed, as in some Confessions (though
          in divers others it’s otherwise), we give the same account as did the
          Reverend Assembly in the same case; which was this: ‘The Confession
          being large, and so framed, as to meet with the common errors, if the
          Scriptures should have been alleged with any clearness, and by showing
          where the strength of the proof lieth, it would have required a
          Volume.’
        </p>
<p>
          We say further, it being our utmost end in this (as it is indeed of a
          Confession) humbly to give an account what we hold and assert in these
          matters; that others, especially the Churches of Christ may judge of
          us accordingly: This we aimed at, and not so much to instruct others,
          or convince gainsayers. These are the proper works of other
          Institutions of Christ, and are to be done in the strength of express
          Scripture. A Confession is an Ordinance of another nature.
        </p>
<p>
          What we have laid down and asserted about Churches and their
          Government, we humbly conceive to be the Order which Christ himself
          hath appointed to be observed, we have endeavored to follow Scripture
          light; and those also that went before us according to that Rule,
          desirous of nearest uniformity with Reforming Churches, as with our
          Brethren in New England, so with others, that differ from them and us.
        </p>
<p>
          The Models and Platforms of this subject laid down by learned men, and
          practiced by Churches, are various: We do not judge it brotherly, or
          grateful, to insist upon comparisons, as some have done; but this
          Experience teacheth, That the variety, and possibly the Disputes and
          Emulations arising thence, have much strengthened, if not fixed, this
          unhappy persuasion in the minds of some learned and good men, namely,
          That there is no settled Order laid down in Scripture; but it’s left
          to the Prudence of the Christian Magistrate, to compose or make a
          choice of such a Form as is most suitable and consistent with their
          Civil Government. Where this Opinion is entertained in the persuasion
          of Governors, there, Churches asserting their Power and Order to be
          jure divino, and the appointment of Jesus Christ, can have no better
          nor more honorable Entertainment, than a Toleration or Permission.
        </p>
<p>
          Yet herein there is this remarkable advantage to all parties that
          differ, about what is in Government is of Christ’s appointment; in
          that such Magistrates have a far greater latitude in conscience, to
          tolerate and permit the several forms of each so bound up in their
          persuasion, than they have to submit unto what the Magistrate shall
          impose: And thereupon the Magistrate exercising and indulgency and
          forbearance, with protection and encouragement to the people of God,
          so differing from him, and amongst themselves: Doth therein discharge
          as great a faithfulness to Christ, and love to his people, as can any
          way be supposed and expected from any Christian Magistrate, of what
          persuasion soever he is. And where this clemency from Governors is
          shown to any sort of persons, or Churches of Christ, upon such a
          principle, it will in equity produce this just effect, That all that
          so differ from him, and amongst themselves, standing in equal and
          alike difference from the principle of such a Magistrate, he is
          equally free to give alike liberty to them, one as well as the other.
        </p>
<p>
          This faithfulness in our Governors we do with thankfulness to God
          acknowledge, and to their everlasting honor, which appeared much in
          the late Reformation. The Hierarchy, Common Prayer-Book, and all other
          things grievous to God’s People, being removed, they made choice of an
          Assembly of learned men, to advise what Government and Order is meet
          to be established in the room of these things; and because it was
          known there were different opinions (as always hath been among godly
          men) about forms of Church Government, there was by the Ordinance
          first sent forth to call an Assembly, not only a choice made of
          persons of several persuasions, to sit as Members there, but liberty
          given, to a lesser number, if dissenting, to report their Judgments
          and Reasons, as well and as freely as the major part.
        </p>
<p>
          Hereupon the Honorable House of Commons (an Indulgence we hope will
          never be forgotten) finding by Papers received from them, that the
          Members of the Assembly were not like to compose differences among
          themselves, so as to join in the same Rule for Church Government, did
          order further as followeth: That a Committee of Lords and Commons,
          etc., do take into consideration the differences of the Opinions in
          the Assembly of Divines in point of Church government, and to endeavor
          a union if it be possible; and in case that cannot be done, to
          endeavor the finding out some way, how far tender consciences, who can
          not in all things submit to the same Rule which that be established,
          may be born according to the Word, and as may stand with the Public
          Peace.
        </p>
<p>
          By all which it is evident, the Parliament purposed not to establish
          the Rule of Church Government with such rigor, as might not permit and
          bear with a practice different from what they had established: In
          persons and Churches of different principles, if occasion were. And
          this Christian Clemency and indulgence in our Governors, hath been the
          foundation of that Freedom and Liberty, in the managing of Church
          affairs, which our Brethren, as well as WE, that differ from them, do
          now, and have many years enjoyed.
        </p>
<p>
          The Honorable Houses by several Ordinances of Parliament after much
          consultation, having settled Rules for Church Government, and such an
          Ecclesiastical Order as they judged would best joint with the Laws and
          Government of the Kingdom, did publish them, requiring the practice
          hereof throughout the Nation; and in particular, by the Min. of the
          Pr. of Lon. But (upon the former reason, or the like charitable
          consideration) these Rules were not imposed by them under any Penalty,
          or rigorous enforcement, though frequently urged thereunto by some.
        </p>
<p>
          Our Reverend Brethren of the Province of London, having considered of
          these Ordinances, and the Church Government laid down in them,
          declared their Opinions to be, That there is not a complete Rule in
          those Ordinances; also that there are many necessary things not yet
          established, and some things wherein their consciences are not so
          fully satisfied. These Brethren, in the same Paper, have published
          also their joint Resolution to practice in all things according to the
          Rule of the Word, and according to these Ordinances, so far as they
          conceive them [to] correspond to it, and in so doing, they trust they
          shall not grieve the Spirit of the truly godly, nor give any just
          occasion to them that are contrary minded, to blame their proceedings.
        </p>
<p>
          We humbly conceive that (WE being dissatisfied in these things as our
          Brethren) the like liberty was intended by the Honorable Houses, and
          may be taken by us of the Congregational way (without blame or grief
          to the spirits of those Brethren at least), to resolve, or rather to
          continue in the same Resolution and Practice in these matters, which
          indeed were our practices in times of greatest opposition, and before
          this Reformation was begun.
        </p>
<p>
          And as our Brethren the Ministers of London, drew up and published
          their opinions and apprehensions about Church Government into an
          entire System; so we now give the like public account of our
          Consciences, and the Rules by which we have constantly practiced
          hitherto; which we have here drawn up, and do present. Whereby it will
          appear how much or how little we differ in these things from our
          Presbyterian Brethren.
        </p>
<p>
          And we trust there is no just cause by which any man, either for our
          differing from the present settlement, it being out of Conscience, and
          not out of contempt, or our differences one from another, being not
          willful, should charge either of us with that odious reproach of
          Schism. And indeed, if not for our differing from the State
          settlement, much less because we differ from our Brethren, our
          differences being in some lesser things, and circumstances only, as
          themselves acknowledge. And let it be further considered, that we have
          not broken from them or their Order by these differences (but rather
          they from us), and in that respect we less deserve their censure; our
          practice being no other than what it was in our breaking from
          Episcopacy, and long before Presbytery, or any such form as now they
          are in, was taken up by them; and we will not say how probable it is,
          that the yoke of Episcopacy had been upon our neck to this day, if
          some such way (as formerly, and now is, and hath been termed Schism)
          had not with much suffering been then practiced, and since continued
          in.
        </p>
<p>
          For Novelty wherewith we are likewise both charged by the Enemies of
          both, it is true, in respect of the public and open Profession, either
          of Presbytery or Independency, this Nation hath been a stranger to
          each way, it ‘s possible, ever since it hath been Christian; though
          for ourselves we are able to trace the footsteps of an Independent
          Congregational way in the ancientest customs of the Churches; as also
          in the Writings of our soundest Protestant Divines, and (that which we
          are much satisfied in) a full concurrence throughout all in the
          substantial parts of Church Government, with our Reverend Brethren in
          the old Puritan Non-conformists, who being instant in Prayer and much
          sufferings, prevailed in the Lord, and we reap with joy what they
          sowed in tears. Our Brethren also that are for Presbyterial
          Subordinations, profess what is of weight against Novelty for their
          way.
        </p>
<p>
          And now therefore seeing the Lord, in whose hand is the heart of
          Princes, hath put into the hearts of our Governors, to tolerate and
          permit (as they have done many years) persons of each persuasion, to
          enjoy their Consciences, though neither come up to the Rule
          established by Authority: And that which is more, to give us both
          Protection, and the same encouragement, that the most devoted
          Conformists in those former Superstitious Times enjoyed; yea, and by a
          public Law to establish this Liberty for time to come; and yet
          further, in the midst of our fears, to set over us a Prince that owns
          this Establishment, and cordially resolves to secure our Churches in
          the enjoyment of these Liberties, if we abuse them not to the
          disturbance of the Civil Peace.
        </p>
<p>
          This should be a very great engagement upon the hearts of all, though
          of different persuasions, to endeavor our utmost, jointly to promote
          the honor and prosperity of such a Government and Governors by
          whatsoever means, which in our Callings as Ministers of the Gospel,
          and as Churches of Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace, we are any way
          able to do; as also to be peaceably disposed one towards another, and
          with mutual toleration to love as brethren, notwithstanding such
          differences: remembering, as it’s very equal we should, the
          differences that are between Presbyterians and Independents being
          differences between fellow-servants, and neither of them having
          authority given from God or Man, to impose their Opinions, one more
          than the other. That our Governors after so solemn an establishment,
          should thus bear with us both, in our greater differences from their
          Rule: and after this, for any of us to take a fellow-servant by the
          throat, upon the account of a lesser reckoning, and nothing due to him
          upon it, is to forget, at least not to exercise, that compassion and
          tenderness we have found, where we had less ground to challenge or
          expect it.
        </p>
<p>
          Our prayer unto God is, That whereto we have already attained, we all
          may walk by the same rule, and that wherein we are otherwise minded,
          God would reveal it to us in his due time.
