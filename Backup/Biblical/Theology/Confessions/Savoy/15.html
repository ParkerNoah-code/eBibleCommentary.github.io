<h2>14. Of Saving Faith</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe
          to the saving of their souls,<sup>a</sup> is the work of the Spirit of
          Christ in their hearts,<sup>b</sup> and is ordinarily wrought by the
          ministry of the Word;<sup>c</sup> by which also, and by the
          administration of the seals, prayer, and other means it is increased
          and strengthened.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Hebrews 10:39
          <br/>
          b: Ephesians 1:17-19, Ephesians 2:8, 2 Corinthians 4:13
          <br/>
          c: Romans 10:14, Romans 10:17
          <br/>
          d: Luke 17:5, Acts 20:32, Romans 1:16-17, Romans 4:11, 1 Peter 2:2
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> By this faith a Christian believeth to be true whatsoever is
          revealed in the Word, for the authority of God himself speaking
          therein;<sup>a</sup> and acteth differently upon that which each
          particular passage thereof containeth; yielding obedience to the
          commands,<sup>b</sup> trembling at the threatenings,<sup>c</sup> and
          embracing the promises of God for this life and that which is to
          come.<sup>d</sup> But the principal acts of saving faith are
          accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone for justification,
          sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of
          grace.<sup>e</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: John 4:42, Acts 24:14, 1 Thessalonians 2:13, 1 John 5:10
          <br/>
          b: Romans 16:26
          <br/>
          c: Isaiah 66:2
          <br/>
          d: 1 Timothy 4:8, Hebrews 11:13
          <br/>
          e: John 1:12, Acts 15:11, Acts 16:31, Galatians 2:20
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> This faith, althought it be different in degrees, and may be
          weak or strong;<sup>a</sup> yet it is in the least degree of it
          different in the kind or nature of it (as is all other saving grace)
          from the faith and common grace of temporary believers; and therefore,
          though it may be many times assailed and weakened, yet it gets the
          victory;<sup>b</sup> growing up in many to the attainment of a full
          assurance through Christ,<sup>c</sup> who is both the author and
          finisher of our faith.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Matthew 6:30, Matthew 8:10, Romans 4:19-20, Hebrews 5:13-14
          <br/>
          b: Luke 22:31-32, Ephesians 6:16, 1 John 5:4-5
          <br/>
          c: Colossians 2:2, Hebrews 6:11-12, Hebrews 10:22
          <br/>
          d: Hebrews 12:2
