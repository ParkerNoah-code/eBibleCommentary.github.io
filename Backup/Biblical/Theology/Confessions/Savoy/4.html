<h2>3. Of Godâ€™s Eternal Decree</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> God from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy counsel
          of his own will, freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to
          pass;<sup>a</sup> yet so as thereby neither is God the author of
          sin,<sup>b</sup> nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures,
          nor is the liberty or contingency of second causes taken away, but
          rather established.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 9:15, Romans 9:18, Romans 11:33, Ephesians 1:11, Hebrews
          6:17

          <br/>
          b: James 1:13, James 1:17, 1 John 1:5
          <br/>
          c: Proverbs 16:33, Matthew 17:12, John 19:11, Acts 2:23, Acts 4:27-28
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Although God knows whatsoever may or can come to pass upon
          all supposed conditions,<sup>a</sup> yet hath he not decreed anything
          because he foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to pass
          upon such conditions.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 1 Samuel 23:11-12, Matthew 11:21, Matthew 11:23, Acts 15:18
          <br/>
          b: Romans 9:11, Romans 9:13, Romans 9:16, Romans 9:18
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory,
          some men and angels<sup>a</sup> are predestinated unto everlasting
          life, and others fore-ordained to everlasting death.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Matthew 25:41, 1 Timothy 5:21
          <br/>
          b: Proverbs 16:4, Romans 9:22-23, Ephesians 1:5-6
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> These angels and men, thus predestinated and fore-ordained,
          are particularly and unchangeably designed; and their number is so
          certain and definite that it can not be either increased or
          diminished.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: John 13:18, 2 Timothy 2:19</p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God,
          before the foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal
          and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of his
          will, hath chosen in Christ, unto everlasting glory,<sup>a</sup> out
          of his mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or
          good works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in
          the creature, as conditions, or causes moving him thereunto;<sup>b</sup>
          and all to the praise of his glorious grace.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 8:30, Ephesians 1:4, Ephesians 1:9, Ephesians 1:11, 1
          Thessalonians 5:9, 2 Timothy 1:9

          <br/>

          b: Romans 9:11, Romans 9:13, Romans 9:16, Ephesians 1:4, Ephesians 1:9

          <br/>
          c: Ephesians 1:6, Ephesians 1:12
        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he, by
          the eternal and most free purpose of his will, fore-ordained all the
          means thereunto.<sup>a</sup> Wherefore they who are elected, being
          fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ,<sup>b</sup> are effectually
          called unto faith in Christ by his Spirit working in due season; are
          justified, adopted, sanctified,<sup>c</sup> and kept by his power
          through faith unto salvation.<sup>d</sup> Neither are any other
          redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted,
          sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.<sup>e</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Ephesians 1:4-5, Ephesians 2:10, 2 Thessalonians 2:13, 1 Peter 1:2
          <br/>
          b: 1 Thessalonians 5:9-10, Titus 2:14
          <br/>
          c: Romans 8:30, Ephesians 1:5, 2 Thessalonians 2:13
          <br/>
          d: 1 Peter 1:5
          <br/>

          e: John 6:64-65, John 8:47, John 10:26, John 17:9, Romans 8:28-39, 1
          John 2:19
        </p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> The rest of mankind God was pleased, according to the
          unsearchable counsel of his own will, whereby he extendeth or
          withholdeth mercy as he pleaseth, for the glory of his sovereign power
          over his creatures, to pass by, and to ordain them to dishonor and
          wrath for their sin, to the praise of his glorious justice.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Matthew 11:25-26, Romans 9:17-18, Romans 9:21-22, 2 Timothy
          2:19-20, 1 Peter 2:8, Jude 4
        </p>
<p>
<b>8.</b> The doctrine of this high mystery of predestination is to be
          handled with special prudence and care,<sup>a</sup> that men attending
          the will of God revealed in his Word, and yielding obedience
          thereunto, may, from the certainty of their effectual vocation, be
          assured of their eternal election.<sup>b</sup> So shall this doctrine
          afford matter of praise, reverence, and admiration of God;<sup>c</sup>
          and of humility, diligence, and abundant consolation to all that
          sincerely obey the gospel.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Deuteronomy 29:29, Romans 9:20
          <br/>
          b: 2 Peter 1:10
          <br/>
          c: Romans 11:33, Ephesians 1:6
          <br/>
          d: Luke 10:20, Romans 8:33, Romans 11:5-6, Romans 11:20, 2 Peter 1:10
