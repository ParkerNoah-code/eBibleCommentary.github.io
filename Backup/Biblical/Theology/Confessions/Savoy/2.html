      <h1>Savoy Declaration of Faith</h1>
      

<h2>1. Of the Holy Scripture</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and
          providence, do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God,
          as to leave men inexcusable;<sup>a</sup> yet are they not sufficient
          to give that knowledge of God, and of his will, which is necessary
          unto salvation;<sup>b</sup> therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry
          times, and in divers manners, to reveal himself, and to declare that
          his will unto his Church;<sup>c</sup> and afterwards, for the better
          preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure
          establishment and comfort of the Church against the corruption of the
          flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same
          wholly unto writing;<sup>d</sup> which maketh the holy Scripture to be
          most necessary;<sup>e</sup> those former ways of God's revealing
          his will unto his people being now ceased.<sup>f</sup>

          <br/>

<b>2.</b> Under the name of holy Scripture, or the Word of God
          written, are now contained all the books of the Old and New
          Testaments, which are these: Of the Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus,

          and Second Epistles of Peter, The First, Second, and Third Epistles of
          John, The Epistle of Jude, The Revelation. All which are given by
          inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Luke 16:29, Luke 16:31, Ephesians 2:20, 2 Timothy 3:16, Revelation
          22:18-19
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine
          inspiration, are no part of the Canon of the Scripture; and therefore
          are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise
          approved, or made use of, than other human writings.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Luke 24:27, Luke 24:44, Romans 3:2, 2 Peter 1:21</p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> The authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to
          be believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or
          church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof;
          and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 1 Thessalonians 2:13, 2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:19, 2 Peter 1:21, 1
          John 5:9
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church
          to an high and reverent esteem of the holy Scripture;<sup>a</sup> and
          the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the
          majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the
          whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes
          of the only way of man's salvation, the many other incomparable
          excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby
          it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet,
          notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible
          truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the
          Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 1 Timothy 3:15
          <br/>

          b: Isaiah 59:21, John 16:13-14, 1 Corinthians 2:10-12, 1 John 2:20, 1
          John 2:27
        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary
          for his own glory, man's salvation, faith, and life, is either
          expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence
          may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be
          added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of
          men.<sup>a</sup> Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination
          of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of
          such things as are revealed in the Word;<sup>b</sup> and that there
          are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government
          of the Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be
          ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to
          the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Galatians 1:8-9, 2 Thessalonians 2:2, 2 Timothy 3:15-17
          <br/>
          b: John 6:45, 1 Corinthians 2:9-12
          <br/>
          c: 1 Corinthians 11:13-14, 1 Corinthians 14:26, 1 Corinthians 14:40
        </p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves,
          nor alike clear unto all;<sup>a</sup> yet those things which are
          necessary to be known, believed, and observed, for salvation, are so
          clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other,
          that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the
          ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of
          them.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 2 Peter 3:16
          <br/>
          b: Psalm 119:105, Psalm 119:130
        </p>
<p>
<b>8.</b> The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language
          of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at
          the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the
          nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care
          and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;<sup>a</sup>
          so as in all controversies of religion the Church is finally to appeal
          unto them.<sup>b</sup> But because these original tongues are not
          known to all the people of God who have right unto, and interest in
          the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and
          search them,<sup>c</sup> therefore they are to be translated into the
          vulgar language of every nation unto which they come,<sup>d</sup> that
          the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in
          an acceptable manner,<sup>e</sup> and, through patience and comfort of
          the Scriptures, may have hope.<sup>f</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Matthew 5:18
          <br/>
          b: Isaiah 8:20, John 5:39, John 5:46, Acts 15:15
          <br/>
          c: John 5:39
          <br/>

          d: 1 Corinthians 14:6, 1 Corinthians 14:9, 1 Corinthians 14:11-12, 1
          Corinthians 14:24, 1 Corinthians 14:27-28

          <br/>
          e: Colossians 3:16
          <br/>
          f: Romans 15:4
        </p>
<p>
<b>9.</b> The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the
          Scripture itself; and therefore, when there is a question about the
          true and full sense of any scripture (which is not manifold, but one),
          it must be searched and known by other places that speak more
          clearly.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Acts 15:15, 2 Peter 1:20-21</p>
<p>
<b>10.</b> The Supreme Judge, by which all controversies of religion
          are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient
          writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined,
          and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the holy
          Scripture delivered by the Spirit; into which Scripture so delivered,
          our faith is finally resolved.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Matthew 22:29, Matthew 22:31, Ephesians 2:20, Acts 28:25</p>
