<h2>16. Of Good Works</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Good works are only such as God hath commanded in his holy
          Word,<sup>a</sup> and not such as, without the warrant thereof, are
          devised by men out of blind zeal, or upon any pretense of good
          intention.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Micah 6:8, Romans 12:2, Hebrews 13:21
          <br/>

          b: 1 Samuel 15:21-23, Isaiah 29:13, Matthew 15:9, John 16:2, Romans
          10:2, 1 Peter 1:18
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> These good works, done in obedience to God's
          commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively
          faith;<sup>a</sup> and by them believers manifest their
          thankfulness,<sup>b</sup> strengthen their assurance,<sup>c</sup>
          edify their brethren,<sup>d</sup> adorn the profession of the
          gospel,<sup>e</sup> stop the mouths of the adversaries,<sup>f</sup>
          and glorify God,<sup>g</sup> whose workmanship they are, created in
          Christ Jesus thereunto,<sup>h</sup> that, having their fruit unto
          holiness, they may have the end, eternal life.<sup>i</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: James 2:18, James 2:22
          <br/>
          b: Psalm 116:12-13, 1 Peter 2:9
          <br/>
          c: 2 Peter 1:5-10, 1 John 2:3, 1 John 2:5
          <br/>
          d: Matthew 5:16, 2 Corinthians 9:2
          <br/>
          e: 1 Timothy 6:1, Titus 2:5, Titus 2:9-12
          <br/>
          f: 1 Peter 2:15
          <br/>
          g: John 15:8, Philippians 1:11, 1 Peter 2:12
          <br/>
          h: Ephesians 2:10
          <br/>
          i: Romans 6:22
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves,
          but wholly from the Spirit of Christ.<sup>a</sup> And that they may be
          enabled thereunto, besides the graces they have already received,
          there is required an actual influence of the same Holy Spirit to work
          in them to will and to do of his good pleasure;<sup>b</sup> yet are
          they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to
          perform any duty unless upon a special motion of the Spirit; but they
          ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in
          them.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Ezekiel 36:26-27, John 15:4-6
          <br/>
          b: Philippians 2:13, Philippians 4:13, 2 Corinthians 3:5
          <br/>

          c: Isaiah 64:7, Acts 26:6-7, Philippians 2:12, 2 Timothy 1:6, Hebrews
          6:11-12, 2 Peter 1:3, 2 Peter 1:5, 2 Peter 1:10-11, Jude 1:20-21
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> They who in their obedience attain to the greatest height
          which is possible in this life, are so far from being able to
          supererogate and to do more than God requires, as that they fall short
          of much which in duty they are bound to do.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Nehemiah 13:22, Job 9:2-3, Luke 17:10, Galatians 5:17</p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> We cannot, by our best works, merit pardon of sin, or
          eternal life at the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion
          that is between them and the glory to come, and the infinite distance
          that is between us and God, whom by them we can neither profit nor
          satisfy for the debt of our former sins;<sup>a</sup> but when we have
          done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable
          servants;<sup>b</sup> and because, as they are good, they proceed from
          his Spirit;<sup>c</sup> and as they are wrought by us, they are
          defiled and mixed with so much weakness and imperfection that they
          cannot endure the severity of God's judgment.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Job 22:2-3, Job 35:7-8, Psalm 16:2, Romans 3:20, Romans 4:2, Romans
          4:4, Romans 4:6, Romans 8:18, Ephesians 2:8-9, Titus 3:5-7

          <br/>
          b: Luke 17:10
          <br/>
          c: Galatians 5:22-23
          <br/>

          d: Psalm 130:3, Psalm 143:2, Isaiah 64:6, Romans 7:15, Romans 7:18,
          Galatians 5:17
        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> Yet notwithstanding, the persons of believers being accepted
          through Christ, their good works also are accepted in him,<sup>a</sup>
          not as though they were in this life wholly unblamable and
          unreprovable in God's sight;<sup>b</sup> but that he, looking
          upon them in his Son, is pleased to accept and reward that which is
          sincere, although accompanied with many weaknesses and
          imperfections.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Genesis 4:4, Hebrews 11:4, Exodus 28:38, Ephesians 1:6, 1 Peter 2:5

          <br/>
          b: Job 9:20, Psalm 143:2
          <br/>

          c: Matthew 25:21, Matthew 25:23, 2 Corinthians 8:12, Hebrews 6:10,
          Hebrews 13:20-21
        </p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter of
          them they may be things which God commands, and of good use both to
          themselves and others;<sup>a</sup> yet because they proceed not from a
          heart purified by faith,<sup>b</sup> nor are done in a right manner,
          according to the Word,<sup>c</sup> nor to a right end, the glory of
          God;<sup>d</sup> they are therefore sinful, and cannot please God, or
          make a man meet to receive grace from God.<sup>e</sup> And yet their
          neglect of them is more sinful and displeasing unto God.<sup>f</sup>
