<h2>19. Of The Law of God</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> God gave to Adam a law of universal obedience written in his
          heart, and a particular precept of not eating the fruit of the tree of
          knowledge of good and evil, as a covenant of works, by which he bound
          him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual
          obedience; promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death
          upon the breach of it; and endued him with power and ability to keep
          it.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Genesis 1:26-27, Genesis 2:17, Job 28:28, Ecclesiastes 7:29, Romans
          2:14-15, Romans 5:12, Romans 5:19, Romans 10:5, Galatians 3:10,
          Galatians 3:12
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> This law, so written in the heart, continued to be a perfect
          rule of righteousness after the fall of man; and, was delivered by God
          upon mount Sinai in ten commandments, and written in two tables;<sup>a</sup>
          the four first commandments containing our duty towards God, and the
          other six our duty to man.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Exodus 34:1, Deuteronomy 5:32, Deuteronomy 10:4, Romans 13:8-9,
          James 1:25, James 2:8, James 2:10-12

          <br/>
          b: Matthew 22:37-40
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Beside this law, commonly called moral, God was pleased to
          give to the people of Israel ceremonial laws, containing several
          typical ordinances, partly of worship, prefiguring Christ, his graces,
          actions, sufferings, and benefits;<sup>a</sup> and partly holding
          forth divers instructions of moral duties.<sup>b</sup> All which
          ceremonial laws being appointed only to the time of reformation, are
          by Jesus Christ the true Messiah and only lawgiver, who was furnished
          with power from the Father for that end, abrogated and taken away.
        </p>
<p>
          a: Galatians 4:1-3, Colossians 2:17, Hebrews 9, Hebrews 10:1
          <br/>
          b: 1 Corinthians 5:7, 2 Corinthians 6:17, Jude 23
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> To them also he gave sundry judicial laws, which expired
          together with the State of that people, not obliging any other, now by
          virtue of that institution, their general equity only being still of
          moral use.
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> The moral law doth forever bind all, as well justified
          persons as others, to the obedience thereof;<sup>a</sup> and that not
          only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of
          the authority of God the Creator who gave it.<sup>b</sup> Neither doth
          Christ in the gospel any way dissolve, but much strengthen, this
          obligation.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 13:8-10, Ephesians 6:2, 1 John 2:3-4, 1 John 2:7-8
          <br/>
          b: James 2:10-11
          <br/>
          c: Matthew 5:17-19, Romans 3:31, James 2:8
        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> Although true believers be not under the law as a covenant
          of works, to be thereby justified or condemned;<sup>a</sup> yet is it
          of great use to them, as well as to others; in that, as a rule of
          life, informing them of the will of God and their duty, it directs and
          binds them to walk accordingly;<sup>b</sup> discovering also the
          sinful pollutions of their nature, hearts, and lives;<sup>c</sup> so
          as, examining themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction
          of, humiliation for, and hatred against sin;<sup>d</sup> together with
          a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the perfection of
          his obedience.<sup>e</sup> It is likewise of use to the regenerate, to
          restrain their corruptions, in that it forbids sin;<sup>f</sup> and
          the threatenings of it serve to show what even their sins deserve, and
          what afflictions in this life they may expect for them, although freed
          from the curse thereof threatened in the law.<sup>g</sup> The promises
          of it, in like manner, show them God's approbation of obedience,
          and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof;<sup>h</sup>
          although not as due to them by the law as a covenant of works:<sup>i</sup>
          so as a man's doing good, and refraining from evil, because the
          law encourageth to the one, and deterreth from the other, is no
          evidence of his being under the law, and not under grace.<sup>k</sup>

          3:13, Galatians 4:4-5

          <br/>

          34:12-16
        </p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> Neither are the forementioned uses of the law contrary to
          the grace of the gospel, but do sweetly comply with it:<sup>a</sup>
          the Spirit of Christ subduing and enabling the will of man to do that
          freely and cheerfully which the will of God, revealed in the law,
          required to be done.<sup>b</sup>
