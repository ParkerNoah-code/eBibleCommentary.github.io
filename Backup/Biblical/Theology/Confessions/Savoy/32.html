          31. Of The State of Man After Death, and of the Resurrection of the
          Dead
        </h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see
          corruption;<sup>a</sup> but their souls (which neither die nor sleep),
          having an immortal subsistence,<sup>b</sup> immediately return to God
          who gave them. The souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in
          holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the
          face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of
          their bodies:<sup>c</sup> and the souls of the wicked are cast into
          hell, where they remain in torment and utter darkness, reserved to the
          judgment of the great day.<sup>d</sup> Besides these two places for
          souls separated from their bodies, the Scripture acknowledgeth none.

<b>2.</b> At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but
          be changed;<sup>a</sup> and all the dead shall be raised up with the
          self-same bodies, and none other, although with different qualities,
          which shall be united again to their souls forever.<sup>b</sup>

          and be made conformable to his own glorious body.<sup>a</sup>
