<h2>25. Of Marriage</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Marriage is to be between one man and one woman: neither is
          it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to
          have more than one husband at the same time.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Genesis 2:24, Proverbs 2:17, Matthew 19:5-6</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and
          wife;<sup>a</sup> for the increase of mankind with a legitimate issue,
          and of the Church with an holy seed;<sup>b</sup> and for preventing of
          uncleanness.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Genesis 2:18
          <br/>
          b: Malachi 2:15
          <br/>
          c: 1 Corinthians 7:2, 1 Corinthians 7:9
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry who are able
          with judgment to give their consent.<sup>a</sup> Yet it is the duty of
          Christians to marry only in the Lord.<sup>b</sup> And therefore, such
          as profess the true reformed religion should not marry with infidels,
          Papists, or other idolaters: neither should such as are godly be
          unequally yoked, by marrying with such as are notoriously wicked in
          their life, or maintain damnable heresies.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Genesis 24:57-58, 1 Corinthians 7:36-38, Hebrews 13:4, 1 Timothy
          4:3

          <br/>
          b: 1 Corinthians 7:39
          <br/>

          c: Genesis 34:14, Exodus 34:16, Deuteronomy 7:3-4, 1 Kings 11:4,
          Nehemiah 13:25-27, Malachi 2:11-12, 2 Corinthians 6:14
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of consanguinity
          or affinity forbidden in the Word;<sup>a</sup> nor can such incestuous
          marriages ever be made lawful by any law of man, or consent of
          parties, so as those persons may live together as man and wife.<sup>b</sup>
          The man may not marry any of his wife's kindred nearer in blood
          than he may of his own, nor the woman of her husband's kindred
          nearer in blood than of her own.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Leviticus 18, Amos 2:7, 1 Corinthians 5:1
          <br/>
          b: Leviticus 18:24-28, Mark 6:18
          <br/>
          c: Leviticus 20:19-21
        </p>
