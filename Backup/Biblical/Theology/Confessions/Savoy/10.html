<h2>9. Of Free-Will</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> God hath endued the will of man with that natural liberty
          and power of acting upon choice, that is neither forced nor by any
          absolute necessity of nature determined to good or evil.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Deuteronomy 30:19, Matthew 17:12, James 1:14</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom and power to
          will and to do that which is good and well-pleasing to God,<sup>a</sup>
          but yet mutably, so that he might fall from it.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Genesis 1:26, Ecclesiastes 7:29
          <br/>
          b: Genesis 2:16-17, Genesis 3:6
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all
          ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation;<sup>a</sup>
          so as a natural man, being altogether averse from that good,<sup>b</sup>
          and dead in sin,<sup>c</sup> is not able, by his own strength, to
          convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: John 15:5, Romans 5:6, Romans 8:7
          <br/>
          b: Romans 3:10, Romans 3:12
          <br/>
          c: Ephesians 2:1, Ephesians 2:5, Colossians 2:13
          <br/>

          d: John 6:44, John 6:65, 1 Corinthians 2:14, Ephesians 2:2-5, Titus
          3:3-5
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the
          state of grace, he freeth him from his natural bondage under sin,<sup>a</sup>
          and by his grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which
          is spiritually good;<sup>b</sup> yet so as that, by reason of his
          remaining corruption, he doth not perfectly, nor only, will that which
          is good, but doth also will that which is evil.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: John 8:34, John 8:36, Colossians 1:13
          <br/>
          b: Romans 6:18, Romans 6:22, Philippians 2:13
          <br/>

          c: Romans 7:15, Romans 7:18-19, Romans 7:21, Romans 7:23, Galatians
          5:17
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> The will of man is made perfectly and immutably free to good
          alone, in the state of glory only.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Ephesians 4:13, Hebrews 12:23, 1 John 3:2, Jude 24</p>
