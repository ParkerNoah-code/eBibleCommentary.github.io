<h2>29. Of Baptism</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by
          Jesus Christ,<sup>a</sup> to be unto the party baptised a sign and
          seal of the covenant of grace,<sup>c</sup> of his ingrafting into
          Christ,<sup>d</sup> of regeneration,<sup>e</sup> of remission of
          sins,<sup>f</sup> and of his giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ,
          to walk in newness of life:<sup>g</sup> which ordinance is, by
          Christ's own appointment, to be continued in his Church until the
          end of the world.<sup>h</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Matthew 28:19
          <br/>
          c: Romans 4:11, Colossians 2:11-12
          <br/>
          d: Romans 6:5, Galatians 3:27
          <br/>
          e: Titus 3:5
          <br/>
          f: Mark 1:4
          <br/>
          g: Romans 6:3-4
          <br/>
          h: Matthew 28:19-20
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> The outward element to be used in this ordinance is water,
          wherewith the party is to be baptized in the name of the Father, and
          of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, by a minister of the gospel
          lawfully called thereunto.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Matthew 3:11, Matthew 28:19-20, John 1:33</p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary; but
          baptism is rightly administered by pouring or sprinkling water upon
          the person.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Mark 7:4, Acts 2:41, Acts 16:33, Hebrews 9:10, Hebrews 9:19-22</p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Not only those that do actually profess faith in and
          obedience unto Christ,<sup>a</sup> but also the infants of one or both
          believing parents are to be baptized,<sup>b</sup> and those only.
        </p>
<p>
          a: Mark 16:15-16, Acts 8:37-38
          <br/>

          b: Genesis 17:7, Genesis 17:9, Galatians 3:9, Galatians 3:14,
          Colossians 2:11-12, Acts 2:38-39, Romans 4:11-12, Matthew 28:19, Mark
          10:13-16, Luke 18:15, 1 Corinthians 7:14
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> Although it be a great sin to contemn or neglect this
          ordinance,<sup>a</sup> yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably
          annexed unto it, as that no person can be regenerated or saved without
          it,<sup>b</sup> or that all that are baptized are undoubtedly
          regenerated.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Luke 7:30, Exodus 4:24-26
          <br/>

          b: Acts 10:2, Acts 10:4, Acts 10:22, Acts 10:31, Acts 10:45, Acts
          10:47, Romans 4:11

          <br/>
          c: Acts 8:13, Acts 8:23
        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> The efficacy of baptism is not tied to that moment of time
          wherein it is administered;<sup>a</sup> yet, notwithstanding, by the
          right use of this ordinance the grace promised is not only offered,
          but really exhibited and conferred by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether
          of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the
          counsel of God's own will, in his appointed time.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: John 3:5, John 3:8
          <br/>
          b: Acts 2:38, Acts 2:41, Galatians 3:27, Ephesians 5:25-26, Titus 3:5
        </p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> The sacrament of baptism is but once to be administered to
          any person.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Titus 3:5</p>
