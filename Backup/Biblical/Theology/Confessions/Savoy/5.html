<h2>4. Of Creation</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> It pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,<sup>a</sup>
          for the manifestation of the glory of his eternal power, wisdom, and
          goodness,<sup>b</sup> in the beginning, to create or make out of
          nothing the world, and all things therein, whether visible or
          invisible, in the space of six days, and all very good.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Genesis 1:2, Job 26:13, Job 33:4, John 1:2-3, Hebrews 1:2

        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> After God had made all other creatures, he created man, male
          and female,<sup>a</sup> with reasonable and immortal souls,<sup>b</sup>
          endued with knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness, after his own
          image,<sup>c</sup> having the law of God written in their hearts,<sup>d</sup>
          and power to fulfil it;<sup>e</sup> and yet under a possibility of
          transgressing, being left to the liberty of their own will, which was
          subject unto change.<sup>f</sup> Beside this law written in their
          hearts, they received a command not to eat of the tree of the
          knowledge of good and evil;<sup>g</sup> which while they kept they
          were happy in their communion with God, and had dominion over the
          creatures.<sup>h</sup>
