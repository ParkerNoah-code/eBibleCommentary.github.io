<h2>12. Of Adoption</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> All those that are justified God vouchsafeth, in and for his
          only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption;<sup>a</sup>
          by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and
          privileges of the children of God;<sup>b</sup> have his name put upon
          them;<sup>c</sup> receive the Spirit of adoption;<sup>d</sup> have
          access to the throne of grace with boldness;<sup>e</sup> are enabled
          to cry, Abba, Father;<sup>f</sup> are pitied,<sup>g</sup>
          protected,<sup>h</sup> provided for,<sup>i</sup> and chastened by him
          as by a father;<sup>k</sup> yet never cast off,<sup>l</sup> but sealed
          to the day of redemption,<sup>m</sup> and inherit the promises,<sup>n</sup>
          as heirs of everlasting salvation.<sup>o</sup>
