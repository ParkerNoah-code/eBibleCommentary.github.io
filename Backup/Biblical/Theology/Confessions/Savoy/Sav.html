    <h2>A Preface</h2>
    <p>
      Confession of the Faith that is in us, when justly called for, is so
      indispensable a due all owe to the Glory of the Sovereign GOD, that it is
      ranked among the Duties of the first Commandment, such as Prayer is; and
      therefore by Paul yoked with Faith itself, as necessary to salvation: with
      the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession
      is made unto salvation. Our Lord Christ himself, when he was accused of
      his Doctrine, considered simply as a matter of fact by Preaching, refused
      to answer; because, as such, it lay upon evidence, and a matter of
      testimony of others; unto whom therefore he refers himself: But when both
      the High-Priest and Pilate expostulate his Faith, and what he held himself
      to be; he without any demur at all, cheerfully makes his Declaration, That
      he was the Son of God; so to the High-Priest: and that he was a King, and
      born to be a King; thus to Pilate. Though upon the uttering of it his life
      lay at stake; Which holy Profession of his is celebrated for our example,
      1 Tim. vi. 13.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confessions, when made by a company of Professors of Christianity jointly
      meeting to that end, the most genuine and natural use of such Confessions
      is, That under the same form of words, they express the substance of the
      same common salvation or unity of their faith; whereby speaking the same
      things, they show themselves perfectly joined in the same mind, and in the
      same judgment, 1 Cor i.10.
    </p>
    <p>
      And accordingly such a transaction is to be looked upon but as a meet or
      fit medium or means whereby to express that their common faith and
      salvation, and no way to be made use of as an imposition upon any:
      Whatever is of force or constraint in matters of this nature, causeth them
      to degenerate from the name and nature of Confessions, and turns them from
      being Confessions of Faith, into Exaetions and Impositions of Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      And such common Confessions of the Orthodox faith, made in simplicity of
      heart by any such body of Christians, with concord among themselves, ought
      to be entertained by all others that love the truth as it is in Jesus,
      with an answerable rejoicing: For if the unanimous opinions and assertions
      but in some few points of Religion, and that when by two Churches, namely,
      that of Jerusalem, and the Messengers of Antioch met, assisted by some of
      the Apostles, were by the Believers of those times received with so much
      joy, (as it is said, They rejoiced for the consolation) much more this is
      to be done, when the whole substance of Faith, and form of wholesome words
      shall be declared by the Messengers of a multitude of Churches, though
      wanting those advantages of Counsel and Authority of the Apostles, which
      that Assembly had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which acceptation is then more specially due, when these shall (to choose)
      utter and declare their Faith, in the same substance for matter, yea,
      words, for the most part, that other Churches and Assemblies, reputed the
      most Orthodox, have done before them: For upon such a correspondency, all
      may see that actually accomplished, which the Apostle did but exhort unto,
      and pray for, in those two more eminent Churches of the Corinthians and
      the Romans, (and so in them for all the Christians of his time) that both
      Jew and Gentile, that is, men of different persuasions, (as they were)
      might glorify GOD with one mind and with one mouth. And truly, the very
      turning of the Gentiles to the owning of the same Faith, in the substance
      of it, with the Christian Jew (though differing in greater points than we
      do from our Brethren) is presently after dignified by the Apostle with
      this style, That it is the Confession of Jesus Christ himself; not as the
      Object only, but as the Author and Maker thereof: I will confess to thee
      (saith Christ to God) among the Gentiles. So that in all such accords,
      Christ is the great and first Confessor; and we, and all our Faith uttered
      by Us, are but the Epistles, (as Paul) and Confessions (as Isaiah there)
      of their Lord and ours; He, but expressing what is written in his heart,
      through their hearts and mouths, to the glory of God the Father: And shall
      we not all rejoice herein, when as Christ himself is said to do it upon
      this occasion: as it there also follows, I will sing unto thy Name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, as the soundness and wholesomeness of the matter gives the vigor
      and life to such Confessions, so the inward freeness, willingness, and
      readiness of the Spirits of the Confessors do contribute to the beauty and
      loveliness thereunto: As it is in Prayer to God, so in Confessions made to
      men. If two or three met, do agree, it renders both, to either the more
      acceptable. The Spirit of Christ is in himself too free, great and
      generous a Spirit, to suffer himself to be used by any human arm, to whip
      men into belief; he drives not, but gently leads into all truth, and
      persuades men to dwell in the tents of like precious Faith; which would
      lose of its preciousness and value, if that sparkle of freeness shone not
      in it: The Character of his People, is to be a willing people in the day
      of his power (not Man’s) in the beauties of holiness, which are the
      Assemblings of the Saints: one glory of which Assemblings in that first
      Church, is said to have been, They met with one accord; which is there in
      that Psalm prophesied of, in the instance of that first Church, for all
      other that should succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as this great Spirit is in himself free, when, and how far, and in
      whom to work, so where and when he doth work, he carrieth it with the same
      freedom, and is said to be a free Spirit, as he both is, and works in us:
      And where this Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as to this Confession of ours, besides, that a conspicuous conjunction
      of the particulars mentioned, hath appeared therein: There are also four
      remarkable Attendants thereon, which added, might perhaps in the eyes of
      sober and indifferent Spirits, give the whole of this Transaction a room
      and rank amongst other many good and memorable things of this Age; at
      least all set together, do cast as clear a gleam and manifestation of
      God’s Power and Presence, as hath appeared in any such kind of
      Confessions, made by so numerous a company these later years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first, is the Temper (or distemper rather) of the Times, during which,
      these Churches have been gathering, and which they have run through. All
      do (out of a general sense) complain that these times have been perilous,
      or difficult times (as the Apostle foretold); and that in respect to
      danger from seducing spirits, more perilous than the hottest seasons of
      Persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have failed through an Aestuatio, Fluxes and Refluxes of great
      varieties of Spirits, Doctrines, Opinions and Occurrences, and especially
      in the matter of Opinions, which have been accompanied in their several
      seasons, with powerful persuasions and temptations, to seduce those of our
      way. It is known, men have taken the freedom (notwithstanding what
      Authority hath interposed to the contrary) to vent and vend their own vain
      and accursed imaginations, contrary to the great and fixed Truths of the
      Gospel, insomuch, as to take the whole Round and Circle of Delusions, the
      Devil hath in this small time, ran; it will be found, that every Truth, of
      greater or lesser weight, hath by one or the other hand, at one time or
      another, been questioned and called to the Bar amongst us, yea, and
      impleaded, under the pretext (which hath some degree of Justice in it)
      that all should not be bound up to the Traditions of former times, nor
      take Religion upon trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whence it hath come to pass, that many of the soundest Professors were put
      upon a new search and disquisition of such Truths, as they had taken for
      granted, and yet had lived upon the comfort of: to the end they might be
      able to convince others, and establish their own hearts against that
      darkness and unbelief, that is ready to close with error, or at least to
      doubt of the truth, when error is speciously presented. And hereupon we do
      professedly account it one of the greatest advantages gained out of the
      Temptations of these Times, yea the honor of the Saints and Ministers of
      these Nations, That after they had sweetly been exercised in, and had
      improved practical and experimental Truths, this should be their further
      Lot, to examine and discuss, and indeed anew to learn over every Doctrinal
      Truth, both out of the Scriptures, and also with a fresh taste thereof in
      their own hearts; which is no other than what the Apostle exhorts to, Try
      all things, hold fast that which is good. Conversion unto God at first,
      what is it else than a savory and affectionate application, and the
      bringing home to the heart with spiritual light and life, all truths that
      are necessary to salvation, together with other lesser Truths? All which
      we had afore conversion taken in but notionally from common Education and
      Tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that after this first gust those who have been thus converted should
      be put upon a new probation and search out the Scriptures, not only of all
      principles explicitly ingredients to Conversion; (unto which the Apostle
      referreth the Galatians when they had diverted from them) but of all other
      superstructures as well as fundamentals; and together therewith, anew to
      experiment the power and sweetness of all these in their own souls: What
      is this but tried Faith indeed? And equivalent to a new conversion unto
      the truth? An Anchor that is proved to be sure and steadfast, that will
      certainly hold in all contrary storms. This was the eminent seal and
      commendation which those holy Apostles that lived and wrote last (Peter,
      John and Jude in their Epistles) did set and give to the Christians of the
      latter part of those primitive times. And besides, it is clear and evident
      by all the other Epistles, from first to last, that it cost the Apostles
      as much, and far more care and pains to preserve them they had converted,
      in the truth, than they had taken to turn them thereunto at first: And it
      is in itself as great a work and instance of the power of God, that keeps,
      yea, guards us through faith unto salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, let this be added (or superadded rather) to give full weight and
      measure, even to running over, that we have all along this season, held
      forth (though quarreled with for it by our brethren) this great principle
      of these times, That amongst all Christian States and Churches, there
      ought to be vouchsafed a forbearance and mutual indulgence unto Saints of
      all persuasions, that keep unto, and hold fast the necessary foundations
      of faith and holiness, in all other matters extra fundamental, whether of
      Faith or Order.
    </p>
    <p>
      This to have been our constant principle, we are not ashamed to confess to
      the whole Christian world. Wherein yet we desire we may be understood, not
      as if in the abstract we stood indifferent to falsehood or truth, or were
      careless whether faith or error, in any Truths but fundamental, did obtain
      or not, so we had our liberty in our petty and smaller differences; or as
      if to make sure of that, we had cut out this wide cloak for it: No, we
      profess that the whole, and every particle of that Faith delivered to the
      Saints (the substance of which we have according to our light here
      professed) is, as to the propagation and furtherance of it by all Gospel
      means, as precious to us as our lives; or what can be supposed dear to us;
      and in our sphere we have endeavored to promote them accordingly: But yet
      withal, we have and do contend for this, That in the concrete, the persons
      of all such gracious Saints, they and their errors, as they are in them,
      when they are but such errors as do and may stand with communion with
      Christ, though they should not repent of them, as not being convinced of
      them to the end of their days; that those, with their errors (that are
      purely spiritual, and intrench and overthrow not civil societies,) as
      concrete with their persons, should for Christ’s sake be borne withal by
      all Christians in the world; and they notwithstanding be permitted to
      enjoy all Ordinances and spiritual Privileges according to their light, as
      freely as any other of their brethren that pretend to the greatest
      Orthodoxy; as having as equal, and as fair a right in and unto Christ, and
      all the holy things of Christ, that any other can challenge to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this doth afford a full and invincible testimony on our behalf, in
      that whiles we have so earnestly contended for this just liberty of Saints
      in all the Churches of Christ, we ourselves have no need of it: that is,
      as to the matter of the profession of Faith which we have maintained
      together with others: and of this, this subsequent Confession of Faith
      gives sufficient evidence. So as we have the confidence in Christ, to
      utter in the words of those two great Apostles, That we have stood fast in
      the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free (in the behalf of others,
      rather than ourselves) and having been free, have not made use of our
      liberty for a cloak of error or maliciousness in ourselves. And yet, lo,
      whereas from the beginning of the rearing of these Churches, that of the
      Apostle hath been (by some) prophesied of us, and applied to us, That
      while we promised (unto others) liberty, we ourselves would become
      servants of corruption, and be brought in bondage to all sorts of fancies
      and imaginations, yet the whole world may now see after the experience of
      many years ran through (and it is manifest by this Confession) that the
      great and gracious God hath not only kept us in that common unity of the
      Faith and Knowledge of the Son of God, which the whole Community of Saints
      have and shall in their Generations come unto, but also in the same
      Truths, both small and great, that are built thereupon, that any other of
      the best and more pure Reformed Churches in their best times (which were
      their first times) have arrived unto: This Confession withal holding forth
      a professed opposition unto the common errors and heresies of these times.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two considerations have been taken from the seasons we have gone
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, let the space of time itself, or days, wherein from first to last
      the whole of this Confession was framed and consented to by the whole of
      us, be duly considered by sober and ingenious spirits: the whole of days
      in which we had meetings about it (set aside the two Lord’s days, and the
      first day’s meeting, in which we considered and debated what to pitch
      upon) were but 11 days, part of which also was spent by some of us in
      Prayer, others in consulting; and in the end all agreeing. We mention this
      small circumstance but to this end (which still adds unto the former) That
      it gives demonstration, not of our freeness and willingness only, but of
      our readiness and preparedness unto so great a work; which otherwise, and
      in other Assemblies, hath ordinarily taken up long and great debates, as
      in such a variety of matters of such concernment, may well be supposed to
      fall out. And this is no other than what the Apostle Peter exhorts unto,
      Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason,
      or account of the hope that is in you. The Apostle Paul saith of the
      spiritual Truths of the Gospel, That God hath prepared them for those that
      love him. The inward and innate constitution of the new Creature being in
      itself such as is suited to all those Truths, as congenial thereunto: But
      although there be this mutual adaptness between these two, yet such is the
      mixture of ignorance, darkness and unbelief, carnal reason, pre-occupation
      of judgment, interest of parties, wantonness in opinion, proud adhering to
      our own persuasions, and perverse oppositions and averseness to agree with
      others, and a multitude of such like distempers common to believing man:
      All which are not only mixed with, but at times (especially in such times
      as have passed over our heads) are ready to overcloud our judgments, and
      to cause our eyes to be double, and sometimes prevail as well as lusts,
      and do bias our wills and affections: And such is their mixture, that
      although there may be existent an habitual preparedness in men’s spirits,
      yet not always a present readiness to be found, specially not in such a
      various multitude of men, to make a solemn and deliberate profession of
      all truths, it being as great a work to find the spirits of the just
      (perhaps the best of Saints) ready for every truth, as to be prepared to
      every good work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is therefore to be looked at, as a great and special work of the Holy
      Ghost, that so numerous a company of Ministers, and other principal
      brethren, should so readily, speedily, and jointly give up themselves unto
      such a whole Body of Truths that are after godliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This argues that they had not their faith to seek; but, as is said of
      Ezra, that they were ready Scribes, and (as Christ) instructed unto the
      Kingdom of Heaven, being as the good householders of so many families of
      Christ, bringing forth of their store and treasury New and Old. It shows
      these truths had been familiar to them, and they acquainted with them, as
      with their daily food and provision (as Christ’s allusion there
      insinuates): In a word, that so they had preached, and that so their
      people had believed, as the Apostle speaks upon one like particular
      occasion. And the Apostle Paul considers (in cases of this nature) the
      suddenness or length of time, either one way or the other; whether it were
      in men’s forsaking of learning of the truth. Thus the suddenness in the
      Galatians’ case in leaving the truth, he makes a wonder of it: I marvel
      that you are SO SOON (that is, in so short a time) removed from the true
      Gospel unto another. Again on the contrary, in the Hebrews he aggravates
      their backwardness, That when for the first time you ought to be Teachers,
      you had need that one teach you the very first principles of the Oracles
      of God. The Parallel contrary to both these having fallen out in this
      transaction, may have some ingredient and weight with ingenious spirits in
      its kind, according to the proportion is put upon either of these
      forementioned in their adverse kind, and obtain the like special
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This accord of ours hath fallen out without having held any correspondency
      together, or prepared consultation, by which we might come to be advised
      of one another’s minds. We allege this not as a matter of commendation in
      us; no, we acknowledge it to have been a great neglect: And accordingly
      one of the first proposals for union amongst us was, That there might be a
      constant correspondence held among the Churches for counsel and mutual
      edification, so for time to come to present the like omission.
    </p>
    <p>
      We confess that from the first, every [one], or at least the generality of
      our Churches, have been in a manner like so many Ships (though holding
      forth the same general colors) launched singly, and sailing apart and
      alone on the vast Ocean of these tumultuating times, and they exposed to
      every wind of Doctrine, under no other conduct than the Word and Spirit,
      and their particular Elders and principal Brethren, without Associations
      among ourselves, or so much as holding out common lights to others,
      whereby to know where we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      But yet whilst we thus confess to our own shame this neglect, let all
      acknowledge, that God hath ordered it for his high and greater glory, in
      that his singular care and power should have watched over each of these,
      as that all should be found to have steered their course by the same
      Chart, and to have been bound for one and the same Port, and that upon
      this general search now made, that the same holy and blessed truths of all
      sorts, which are current and warrantable amongst all the other Churches of
      Christ in the world, should be found to be our Lading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole, and every [one] of these things when put together, do cause us
      (whatever men of prejudiced and opposite spirits may find out to slight
      them) with a holy admiration, to say, That this is no other than the
      Lord’s doing; and which we with thanksgiving do take from his hand as a
      special token upon us for good, and doth show that God is faithful and
      upright towards those that are planted in his house: And that as the Faith
      was but once for all, and intentionally first delivered unto the Saints;
      so the Saints, when not abiding scattered, but gathered under their
      respective Pastors according to God’s heart into an house, and Churches
      unto the living God, such together are, as Paul forspake it, the most
      steady and firm pillar and seat of Truth that God hath any where appointed
      to himself on earth, where his truth is best conserved, and publicly held
      forth; there being in such Assemblies weekly a rich dwelling of the Word
      amongst them, that is, a daily open house kept by the means of those good
      Householders, their Teachers and other Instructors respectively
      appropriated to them, whom Christ in the virtue of his Ascension,
      continues to give as gifts to his people, himself dwelling amongst them;
      to the end that by this, as the most sure standing permanent means, the
      Saints might be perfected, till we all (even all the Saints in present and
      future ages) do come by this constant and daily Ordinance of his unto the
      unity of the Faith and Knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man,
      unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (which though
      growing on by parts and piecemeal, will yet appear complete, when that
      great and general Assembly shall be gathered, then when this world is
      ended, and these dispensations have had their fullness and period) and so
      that from henceforth (such a provision being made for us) we be no more
      children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, this doth give a fresh and recent demonstration, that the
      great Apostle and High-priest of our profession is indeed ascended into
      heaven, and continues there with power and care, faithful as a son over
      his own house, whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the
      rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end: and shows that he will, as he
      hath promised, be with his own Institutions to the end of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, that many sad miscarriages, and divisions, breeches, fallings
      off from holy Ordinances of God, have along this time of tentation
      (especially in the beginning of it) been found in some of our Churches;
      and no wonder, if what hath been said be fully considered: Many reasons
      might further be given hereof, that would be a sufficient Apology, without
      the help of a retortion upon other Churches (that promised themselves
      peace) how that more destroying ruptures have befallen them, and that in a
      wider sphere and compass; which though it should not justify us, yet may
      serve to stop others’ mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let Rome glory of the peace in, and obedience of her Children, against the
      Reformed Churches for their divisions which occurred (especially in the
      first rearing of them) whilst we all know the causes of their dull and
      stupid peace to have been carnal interests, worldly correspondencies, and
      coalitions, strengthened by gratifications of all sorts of men by that
      Religion, the principles of blind Devotion, Traditional Faith,
      Ecclesiastical Tyranny, by which she keeps her Children in bondage to this
      day. We are also certain, that the very same prejudices that from hence
      they would cast upon the Reformed (if they were just) do lie as fully
      against those pure Churches raised up by the Apostles themselves in those
      first times: for as we have heard of their patience, sufferings,
      consolations, and the transcending gifts poured out, and graces shining in
      them, so we have heard complaints of their divisions too, of the
      forsakings of their Assemblies, as the custom or manner of SOME was (which
      later were in that respect felo de se, and needed no other delivering up
      to Satan as their punishment, than what they executed upon themselves). We
      read of the shipwreck also of Faith and a good Conscience, and
      overthrowings of the faith of some; and still but of some not all, nor the
      most: which is one piece of an Apology the Apostle again and again inserts
      to future ages, and through mercy we have the same to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      And truly we take the confidence professedly to say, that these tentations
      common to the purest Churches of Saints separated from the mixture of the
      world, though they grieve us (for who is offended, and we burn not?), yet
      they do not at all stumble us, as to the truth of our way, had they been
      many more: We say it again, these stumble us no more (as to that point)
      than it doth offend us against the power of Religion itself, to have seen,
      and to see daily in particular persons called out and separated from the
      world by an effectual work of conversion, that they for a while do suffer
      under disquietments, vexations, turmoils, unsettlements of spirit, that
      they are tossed with tempests and horrid tentations, such as they had not
      in their former estate, whilst they walked according to the course of this
      world: For Peter hath sufficiently instructed us whose business it is to
      raise such storms, even the Devil’s; and also whose design it is, that
      after they have suffered a while, thereby they shall be settled,
      perfected, established, that have so suffered, even the God of all Grace.
      And look what course of dispensation God holds to Saints personally, he
      doth the like to bodies of Saints in Churches and the Devil the same for
      his part too: And that consolatory Maxim of the Apostle, God shall tread
      down Satan under your feet shortly, which Paul uttereth concerning the
      Church of Rome, shows how both God and Satan have this very hand therein;
      for he speaks that very thing in reference unto their divisions, as the
      coherence clearly manifests; and so you have both designs expressed at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yea, we are not a little induced to think, that the divisions, breaches,
      etc., of those primitive Churches would not have been so frequent among
      the people themselves, and not the Elders only, had not the freedom,
      liberties, and rights of Members (the Brethren, we mean) been stated and
      exercised in those Churches, the same which we maintain and contend for to
      be in ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yea (which perhaps may seem more strange to many) had not those Churches
      been constituted of members enlightened further than with notional and
      traditional knowledge, by a new and more powerful light of the Holy Ghost,
      wherein they had been made partakers of the Holy ghost and the heavenly
      gift, and their hearts had tasted the good Word of God, and the Powers of
      the world to come, and of such Members at lowest, there had not fallen out
      those kinds of divisions among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Experience hath shown, that the common sort of mere Doctrinal
      Professors (such as the most are nowadays), whose highest education is but
      freedom from moral scandal, joined with devotion to Christ through mere
      Education, such as in many Turks is found towards Mohammed, that these
      finding and feeling themselves not much concerned in the active part of
      Religion, so they may have the honor (especially upon a Reformation of a
      new Refinement) that themselves are approved Members, admitted to the
      Lord’s Supper, and their Children to the Ordinance of Baptism; they regard
      not other matters (as Gallio did not), but do easily and readily give up
      themselves unto their Guides, being like dead fishes carried with the
      common stream; whereas those that have a further renewed Light by a work
      of the Holy Ghost, whether saving or temporary, are upon the quite
      contrary grounds apt to be busy about, and inquisitive into, what they are
      to receive and practice, or wherein their Consciences are professedly
      concerned and involved: And thereupon they take the freedom to examine and
      try the spirits, whether of God or no: And from hence are more apt to
      dissatisfaction, and from thence to run into division, and many of such
      proving to be enlightened but with a temporary, not saving Faith (who have
      such a work of the Spirit upon them, and profession in them, as will and
      doth approve itself to the judgment of the Saints, and ought to be so
      judged, until they be otherwise discovered) who at long-run, prove
      hypocrites, through indulgence unto Lusts, and then out of their Lusts
      persist to hold up these divisions unto breach of, or departings from,
      Churches, and the Ordinances of God, and God is even with them for it,
      they waxing worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived; and even many
      of those that are sincere, through a mixture of darkness and erroneousness
      in their Judgments, are for a season apt out of Conscience to be led away
      with the error of others, which lie in wait to deceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insomuch as the Apostle upon the example of those first times, forseeing
      also the like events in following generations upon the causes, hath been
      bold to set this down as a ruled Case, that likewise in other Churches so
      constituted and de facto emprivileged as that of the Church of Corinth was
      (which single Church, in the Sacred Records about it, is the completest
      Mirror of Church Constitution, Order, and Government, and Events thereupon
      ensuing, of any one Church whatever that we have a story of), his Maxim
      is, There must be also divisions amongst you; he setly inserts an [ALSO]
      in the case, as that which had been his own observation, and that which
      would be epi to polu the fate of the other Churches like thereunto, so
      prophesieth he: And he speaks this as peremptorily, as he doth elsewhere
      in that other, We must through tribulations enter into the Kingdom of
      Heaven: Yea, and that all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall
      suffer persecution: There is a [MUST] upon both alike; and we bless God,
      that we have run through both, and do say, and we say no more, That as it
      was then, so it is now, in both respects.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, such hath been the powerful hand of God’s providence in these,
      which have been the worst of our Trials, That out of an approved
      Experience and Observation of the Issue, we are able to add that other
      part of the Apostle’s Prediction, That therefore such rents must be, that
      they which are approved may be made manifest among you; which holy issue
      God (as having aimed at it therein) doth frequently and certainly bring
      about in Churches, as he doth bring upon them that other fate of division,
      Let them therefore look unto it, that are the Authors of such
      disturbances, as the Apostle warneth, Gal. V. 10. The experiment is this,
      That we have seen, and do daily see, that multitudes of holy and precious
      souls, and (in the Holy Ghost ‘s word) approved Saints, have been, and are
      the more rooted and grounded by means of these shakings, and do continue
      to cleave the faster to Christ, and the purity of his Ordinances, and
      value them the more by this cost God hath put them to for the enjoying of
      them, Who having been planted in the House of the Lord, have flourished in
      the Courts of our God, in these evil times, to show that the Lord is
      upright. And this experimented event from out of such divisions, hath more
      confirmed us, and is a louder Apology for us, than all that our opposites
      are able from our breaches to allege to prejudice us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will add a few words for conclusion, and give a more particular account
      of this our Declaration. In drawing up this Confession of Faith, we have
      had before us the Articles of Religion, approved and passed by both Houses
      of Parliament, after advice had with an Assembly of Divines, called
      together by them for that purpose. To which Confession, for the substance
      of it, we fully assent, as do our Brethren of New England, and the
      Churches also of Scotland, as each in their general Synods have testified.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few things we have added for obviating some erroneous Opinions, that
      have been more broadly and boldly here of late maintained by the
      Asserters, than in former times; and made other additions and alterations
      in method, here and there, and some clearer Explanations, as we found
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have endeavored throughout, to hold such Truths in this our Confession,
      as are more properly termed matters of Faith; and what is of Church-order,
      we dispose in certain Propositions by itself. To this course we are led by
      the Example of the Honorable Houses of Parliament, observing what was
      established, and what omitted by them in that Confession the Assembly
      presented to them. Who thought it is not convenient to have matters of
      Discipline and Church Government put into a Confession of Faith,
      especially the particulars thereof, as then were, and still are
      controverted and under dispute by men Orthodox and found in Faith. The
      30th chap. Therefore of that Confession, as it was presented to them by
      the Assembly, which is of Church Censures, their Use, Kinds, and in whom
      placed: As also chap. 31, of Synods and Councils, by whom to be called, of
      what force in their Decrees and Determinations. And the 4th Paragr. of the
      20th chap., which determines what Opinions and Practices disturb the peace
      of the Church, and how such Disturbers ought to be proceeded against by
      the Censures of the Church, and punished by the Civil Magistrate. Also a
      great part of the 24th chap. of Marriage and Divorce. These were such
      doubtful assertions, and so unsuitable to a Confession of Faith, as the
      Honorable Houses in their great Wisdom thought fit to lay them aside:
      There being nothing that tends more to heighten Dissensions among
      Brethren, than to determine and adopt the manner of their difference,
      under so high a Title, as to be an Article of our Faith: So that there are
      two whole Chapters, and some Paragraphs in other Chapters in their
      Confession, that we have upon this account omitted; and the rather do we
      give this notice, because that Copy of the Parl. followed by us, is in few
      men’s hands; the other as it came from the Assembly, being approved of in
      Scotland, was printed and hastened into the world, before the Parl. had
      declared their Resolutions about it; which was not till June 20, 1648, and
      yet had been, and continueth to be the Copy (ordinarily) only sold,
      printed, and reprinted for these 11 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the 19th chap. of the Law, we have added a cap. of the Gospel, it
      being a Title that may not well be omitted in a Confession of Faith: In
      which Chapter, what is dispersed, and by intimation in the Assemblies’
      Confession, with some little addition, is here brought together, and more
      fully, under one head.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there are not Scriptures annexed, as in some Confessions (though in
      divers others it’s otherwise), we give the same account as did the
      Reverend Assembly in the same case; which was this: ‘The Confession being
      large, and so framed, as to meet with the common errors, if the Scriptures
      should have been alleged with any clearness, and by showing where the
      strength of the proof lieth, it would have required a Volume.’
    </p>
    <p>
      We say further, it being our utmost end in this (as it is indeed of a
      Confession) humbly to give an account what we hold and assert in these
      matters; that others, especially the Churches of Christ may judge of us
      accordingly: This we aimed at, and not so much to instruct others, or
      convince gainsayers. These are the proper works of other Institutions of
      Christ, and are to be done in the strength of express Scripture. A
      Confession is an Ordinance of another nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we have laid down and asserted about Churches and their Government,
      we humbly conceive to be the Order which Christ himself hath appointed to
      be observed, we have endeavored to follow Scripture light; and those also
      that went before us according to that Rule, desirous of nearest uniformity
      with Reforming Churches, as with our Brethren in New England, so with
      others, that differ from them and us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Models and Platforms of this subject laid down by learned men, and
      practiced by Churches, are various: We do not judge it brotherly, or
      grateful, to insist upon comparisons, as some have done; but this
      Experience teacheth, That the variety, and possibly the Disputes and
      Emulations arising thence, have much strengthened, if not fixed, this
      unhappy persuasion in the minds of some learned and good men, namely, That
      there is no settled Order laid down in Scripture; but it’s left to the
      Prudence of the Christian Magistrate, to compose or make a choice of such
      a Form as is most suitable and consistent with their Civil Government.
      Where this Opinion is entertained in the persuasion of Governors, there,
      Churches asserting their Power and Order to be jure divino, and the
      appointment of Jesus Christ, can have no better nor more honorable
      Entertainment, than a Toleration or Permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet herein there is this remarkable advantage to all parties that differ,
      about what is in Government is of Christ’s appointment; in that such
      Magistrates have a far greater latitude in conscience, to tolerate and
      permit the several forms of each so bound up in their persuasion, than
      they have to submit unto what the Magistrate shall impose: And thereupon
      the Magistrate exercising and indulgency and forbearance, with protection
      and encouragement to the people of God, so differing from him, and amongst
      themselves: Doth therein discharge as great a faithfulness to Christ, and
      love to his people, as can any way be supposed and expected from any
      Christian Magistrate, of what persuasion soever he is. And where this
      clemency from Governors is shown to any sort of persons, or Churches of
      Christ, upon such a principle, it will in equity produce this just effect,
      That all that so differ from him, and amongst themselves, standing in
      equal and alike difference from the principle of such a Magistrate, he is
      equally free to give alike liberty to them, one as well as the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This faithfulness in our Governors we do with thankfulness to God
      acknowledge, and to their everlasting honor, which appeared much in the
      late Reformation. The Hierarchy, Common Prayer-Book, and all other things
      grievous to God’s People, being removed, they made choice of an Assembly
      of learned men, to advise what Government and Order is meet to be
      established in the room of these things; and because it was known there
      were different opinions (as always hath been among godly men) about forms
      of Church Government, there was by the Ordinance first sent forth to call
      an Assembly, not only a choice made of persons of several persuasions, to
      sit as Members there, but liberty given, to a lesser number, if
      dissenting, to report their Judgments and Reasons, as well and as freely
      as the major part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon the Honorable House of Commons (an Indulgence we hope will never
      be forgotten) finding by Papers received from them, that the Members of
      the Assembly were not like to compose differences among themselves, so as
      to join in the same Rule for Church Government, did order further as
      followeth: That a Committee of Lords and Commons, etc., do take into
      consideration the differences of the Opinions in the Assembly of Divines
      in point of Church government, and to endeavor a union if it be possible;
      and in case that cannot be done, to endeavor the finding out some way, how
      far tender consciences, who can not in all things submit to the same Rule
      which that be established, may be born according to the Word, and as may
      stand with the Public Peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      By all which it is evident, the Parliament purposed not to establish the
      Rule of Church Government with such rigor, as might not permit and bear
      with a practice different from what they had established: In persons and
      Churches of different principles, if occasion were. And this Christian
      Clemency and indulgence in our Governors, hath been the foundation of that
      Freedom and Liberty, in the managing of Church affairs, which our
      Brethren, as well as WE, that differ from them, do now, and have many
      years enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Houses by several Ordinances of Parliament after much
      consultation, having settled Rules for Church Government, and such an
      Ecclesiastical Order as they judged would best joint with the Laws and
      Government of the Kingdom, did publish them, requiring the practice hereof
      throughout the Nation; and in particular, by the Min. of the Pr. of Lon.
      But (upon the former reason, or the like charitable consideration) these
      Rules were not imposed by them under any Penalty, or rigorous enforcement,
      though frequently urged thereunto by some.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Reverend Brethren of the Province of London, having considered of
      these Ordinances, and the Church Government laid down in them, declared
      their Opinions to be, That there is not a complete Rule in those
      Ordinances; also that there are many necessary things not yet established,
      and some things wherein their consciences are not so fully satisfied.
      These Brethren, in the same Paper, have published also their joint
      Resolution to practice in all things according to the Rule of the Word,
      and according to these Ordinances, so far as they conceive them [to]
      correspond to it, and in so doing, they trust they shall not grieve the
      Spirit of the truly godly, nor give any just occasion to them that are
      contrary minded, to blame their proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We humbly conceive that (WE being dissatisfied in these things as our
      Brethren) the like liberty was intended by the Honorable Houses, and may
      be taken by us of the Congregational way (without blame or grief to the
      spirits of those Brethren at least), to resolve, or rather to continue in
      the same Resolution and Practice in these matters, which indeed were our
      practices in times of greatest opposition, and before this Reformation was
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as our Brethren the Ministers of London, drew up and published their
      opinions and apprehensions about Church Government into an entire System;
      so we now give the like public account of our Consciences, and the Rules
      by which we have constantly practiced hitherto; which we have here drawn
      up, and do present. Whereby it will appear how much or how little we
      differ in these things from our Presbyterian Brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we trust there is no just cause by which any man, either for our
      differing from the present settlement, it being out of Conscience, and not
      out of contempt, or our differences one from another, being not willful,
      should charge either of us with that odious reproach of Schism. And
      indeed, if not for our differing from the State settlement, much less
      because we differ from our Brethren, our differences being in some lesser
      things, and circumstances only, as themselves acknowledge. And let it be
      further considered, that we have not broken from them or their Order by
      these differences (but rather they from us), and in that respect we less
      deserve their censure; our practice being no other than what it was in our
      breaking from Episcopacy, and long before Presbytery, or any such form as
      now they are in, was taken up by them; and we will not say how probable it
      is, that the yoke of Episcopacy had been upon our neck to this day, if
      some such way (as formerly, and now is, and hath been termed Schism) had
      not with much suffering been then practiced, and since continued in.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Novelty wherewith we are likewise both charged by the Enemies of both,
      it is true, in respect of the public and open Profession, either of
      Presbytery or Independency, this Nation hath been a stranger to each way,
      it ‘s possible, ever since it hath been Christian; though for ourselves we
      are able to trace the footsteps of an Independent Congregational way in
      the ancientest customs of the Churches; as also in the Writings of our
      soundest Protestant Divines, and (that which we are much satisfied in) a
      full concurrence throughout all in the substantial parts of Church
      Government, with our Reverend Brethren in the old Puritan Non-conformists,
      who being instant in Prayer and much sufferings, prevailed in the Lord,
      and we reap with joy what they sowed in tears. Our Brethren also that are
      for Presbyterial Subordinations, profess what is of weight against Novelty
      for their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now therefore seeing the Lord, in whose hand is the heart of Princes,
      hath put into the hearts of our Governors, to tolerate and permit (as they
      have done many years) persons of each persuasion, to enjoy their
      Consciences, though neither come up to the Rule established by Authority:
      And that which is more, to give us both Protection, and the same
      encouragement, that the most devoted Conformists in those former
      Superstitious Times enjoyed; yea, and by a public Law to establish this
      Liberty for time to come; and yet further, in the midst of our fears, to
      set over us a Prince that owns this Establishment, and cordially resolves
      to secure our Churches in the enjoyment of these Liberties, if we abuse
      them not to the disturbance of the Civil Peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      This should be a very great engagement upon the hearts of all, though of
      different persuasions, to endeavor our utmost, jointly to promote the
      honor and prosperity of such a Government and Governors by whatsoever
      means, which in our Callings as Ministers of the Gospel, and as Churches
      of Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace, we are any way able to do; as also to
      be peaceably disposed one towards another, and with mutual toleration to
      love as brethren, notwithstanding such differences: remembering, as it’s
      very equal we should, the differences that are between Presbyterians and
      Independents being differences between fellow-servants, and neither of
      them having authority given from God or Man, to impose their Opinions, one
      more than the other. That our Governors after so solemn an establishment,
      should thus bear with us both, in our greater differences from their Rule:
      and after this, for any of us to take a fellow-servant by the throat, upon
      the account of a lesser reckoning, and nothing due to him upon it, is to
      forget, at least not to exercise, that compassion and tenderness we have
      found, where we had less ground to challenge or expect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our prayer unto God is, That whereto we have already attained, we all may
      walk by the same rule, and that wherein we are otherwise minded, God would
      reveal it to us in his due time.

      believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or
      church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof; and
      therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.<sup>a</sup>

      <b>5.</b> We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church to an
      high and reverent esteem of the holy Scripture;<sup>a</sup> and the
      heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of
      the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is
      to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of
      man&#x27;s salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the
      entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly
      evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet, notwithstanding, our full
      persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority
      thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by
      and with the Word in our hearts.<sup>b</sup>

      <b>6.</b> The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary for
      his own glory, man&#x27;s salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly
      set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced
      from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by
      new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.<sup>a</sup>
      Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God
      to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are
      revealed in the Word;<sup>b</sup> and that there are some circumstances
      concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church, common to
      human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of
      nature and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word,
      which are always to be observed.<sup>c</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.</b> All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor
      alike clear unto all;<sup>a</sup> yet those things which are necessary to
      be known, believed, and observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded
      and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned,
      but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a
      sufficient understanding of them.<sup>b</sup>

      b: Psalm 119:105, Psalm 119:130
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>8.</b> The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of
      the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the
      time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being
      immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept
      pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;<sup>a</sup> so as in all
      controversies of religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them.<sup
        >b</sup
      >
      But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God
      who have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in
      the fear of God, to read and search them,<sup>c</sup> therefore they are
      to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they
      come,<sup>d</sup> that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they
      may worship him in an acceptable manner,<sup>e</sup> and, through patience
      and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.<sup>f</sup>

      <b>9.</b> The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the
      Scripture itself; and therefore, when there is a question about the true
      and full sense of any scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must
      be searched and known by other places that speak more clearly.<sup>a</sup>

      to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient
      writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in
      whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the holy Scripture
      delivered by the Spirit; into which Scripture so delivered, our faith is

    <h2>15. Of Repentance unto Life and Salvation</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> Such of the elect as are converted at riper years, having
      sometime lived in the state of nature, and therein served divers lusts and
      pleasures, God in their effectual calling giveth them repentance unto
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> Whereas there is none that doth good and sinneth not, and the
      best of men may, through the power and deceitfulness of their corruption
      dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall into great sins
      and provocations; God hath, in the covenant of grace, mercifully provided
      that believers so sinning and falling be renewed through repentance unto
      salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b> This saving repentance is an evangelical grace, whereby a
      person, being by the Holy Spirit made sensible of the manifold evils of
      his sin, doth, by faith in Christ, humble himself for it with godly
      sorrow, detestation of it, and self-abhorrency, praying for pardon and
      strength of grace, with a purpose and endeavour, by supplies of the
      Spirit, to walk before God unto all well-pleasing in all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4.</b> As repentance is to be continued through the whole course of our
      lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the motions thereof, so
      it is every man&#x27;s duty to repent of his particular known sins
      particularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5.</b> Such is the provision which God hath made through Christ in the
      covenant of grace for the preservation of believers unto salvation; that
      although there is no sin so small but it deserves damnation; yet there is
      no sin so great that it shall bring damnation on them that repent; which

    <h2>16. Of Good Works</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> Good works are only such as God hath commanded in his holy
      Word,<sup>a</sup> and not such as, without the warrant thereof, are
      devised by men out of blind zeal, or upon any pretense of good
      intention.<sup>b</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      a: Micah 6:8, Romans 12:2, Hebrews 13:21
      <br />

      b: 1 Samuel 15:21-23, Isaiah 29:13, Matthew 15:9, John 16:2, Romans 10:2,
      1 Peter 1:18
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> These good works, done in obedience to God&#x27;s commandments,
      are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith;<sup>a</sup> and
      by them believers manifest their thankfulness,<sup>b</sup> strengthen
      their assurance,<sup>c</sup> edify their brethren,<sup>d</sup> adorn the
      profession of the gospel,<sup>e</sup> stop the mouths of the
      adversaries,<sup>f</sup> and glorify God,<sup>g</sup> whose workmanship
      they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto,<sup>h</sup> that, having
      their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end, eternal life.<sup

      <b>3.</b> Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves, but
      wholly from the Spirit of Christ.<sup>a</sup> And that they may be enabled
      thereunto, besides the graces they have already received, there is
      required an actual influence of the same Holy Spirit to work in them to
      will and to do of his good pleasure;<sup>b</sup> yet are they not hereupon
      to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty unless
      upon a special motion of the Spirit; but they ought to be diligent in
      stirring up the grace of God that is in them.<sup>c</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4.</b> They who in their obedience attain to the greatest height which
      is possible in this life, are so far from being able to supererogate and
      to do more than God requires, as that they fall short of much which in
      duty they are bound to do.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a: Nehemiah 13:22, Job 9:2-3, Luke 17:10, Galatians 5:17</p>
    <p>
      <b>5.</b> We cannot, by our best works, merit pardon of sin, or eternal
      life at the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is
      between them and the glory to come, and the infinite distance that is
      between us and God, whom by them we can neither profit nor satisfy for the
      debt of our former sins;<sup>a</sup> but when we have done all we can, we
      have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants;<sup>b</sup> and
      because, as they are good, they proceed from his Spirit;<sup>c</sup> and
      as they are wrought by us, they are defiled and mixed with so much
      weakness and imperfection that they cannot endure the severity of
      God&#x27;s judgment.<sup>d</sup>

      Galatians 5:17
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6.</b> Yet notwithstanding, the persons of believers being accepted
      through Christ, their good works also are accepted in him,<sup>a</sup> not
      as though they were in this life wholly unblamable and unreprovable in
      God&#x27;s sight;<sup>b</sup> but that he, looking upon them in his Son,
      is pleased to accept and reward that which is sincere, although
      accompanied with many weaknesses and imperfections.<sup>c</sup>

      13:20-21

    <p>
      <b>7.</b> Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter of them
      they may be things which God commands, and of good use both to themselves
      and others;<sup>a</sup> yet because they proceed not from a heart purified
      by faith,<sup>b</sup> nor are done in a right manner, according to the
      Word,<sup>c</sup> nor to a right end, the glory of God;<sup>d</sup> they
      are therefore sinful, and cannot please God, or make a man meet to receive
      grace from God.<sup>e</sup> And yet their neglect of them is more sinful
      and displeasing unto God.<sup>f</sup>

      <b>2.</b> This perseverance of the saints depends, not upon their own free

      the free and unchangeable love of God the Father;<sup>a</sup> upon the
      efficacy of the merit and intercession of Jesus Christ, and union with
      him; the oath of God;<sup>b</sup> the abiding of the Spirit and of the

      <b>1.</b> Although temporary believers and other unregenerate men may

      being in the favour of God and estate of salvation,<sup>a</sup> which hope

    <p>
      <b>2.</b> This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable
      persuasion, grounded upon a fallible hope;<sup>a</sup> but an infallible
      assurance of faith, founded upon the divine truth of the promises of
      salvation,<sup>b</sup> the inward evidence of those graces unto which
      these promises are made,<sup>c</sup> the testimony of the Spirit of
      adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God:<sup

      may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of ordinary means,

      give all diligence to make his calling and election sure;<sup>c</sup> that
      thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, in
      love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the

      knowledge of good and evil, as a covenant of works, by which he bound him

      promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of

      to the people of Israel ceremonial laws, containing several typical
      ordinances, partly of worship, prefiguring Christ, his graces, actions,
      sufferings, and benefits;<sup>a</sup> and partly holding forth divers
      instructions of moral duties.<sup>b</sup> All which ceremonial laws being
      appointed only to the time of reformation, are by Jesus Christ the true

      of God the Creator who gave it.<sup>b</sup> Neither doth Christ in the

      great use to them, as well as to others; in that, as a rule of life,
      informing them of the will of God and their duty, it directs and binds
      them to walk accordingly;<sup>b</sup> discovering also the sinful
      pollutions of their nature, hearts, and lives;<sup>c</sup> so as,

      humiliation for, and hatred against sin;<sup>d</sup> together with a
      clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the perfection of his
      obedience.<sup>e</sup> It is likewise of use to the regenerate, to
      restrain their corruptions, in that it forbids sin;<sup>f</sup> and the
      threatenings of it serve to show what even their sins deserve, and what
      afflictions in this life they may expect for them, although freed from the
      curse thereof threatened in the law.<sup>g</sup> The promises of it, in
      like manner, show them God&#x27;s approbation of obedience, and what
      blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof;<sup>h</sup>
      although not as due to them by the law as a covenant of works:<sup>i</sup>
      so as a man&#x27;s doing good, and refraining from evil, because the law

    <h2>20. Of the Gospel, and of the Extent of the Grace Thereof</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> The covenant of works being broken by sin, and made unprofitable
      unto life, God was pleased to give unto the elect the promise of Christ,
      the seed of the woman, as the means of calling them, and begetting in them
      faith and repentance: in this promise the gospel, as to the substance of
      it, was revealed, and was therein effectual for the conversion and
      salvation of sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> This promise of Christ, and salvation by him, is revealed only
      in and by the Word of God; neither do the works of creation or providence,
      with the light of nature, make discovery of Christ, or of grace by him, so
      much as in a general or obscure way; much less that men destitute of the
      revelation of him by the promise or gospel, should be enabled thereby to
      attain saving faith or repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b> The revelation of the gospel unto sinners, made in divers times,
      and by sundry parts, with the addition of promises and precepts for the
      obedience required therein, as to the nations and persons to whom it is
      granted, is merely of the sovereign will and good pleasure of God, not
      being annexed by virtue of any promise to the due improvement of
      men&#x27;s natural abilities, by virtue of common light received without
      it, which none ever did make or can so do. And therefore in all ages the
      preaching of the gospel hath been granted unto persons and nations, as to
      the extent or straitening of it, in great variety, according to the
      counsel of the will of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4.</b> Although the gospel be the only outward means of revealing
      Christ and saving grace, and is as such abundantly sufficient thereunto;
      yet that men who are dead in trespasses, may be born again, quickened or
      regenerated, there is moreover necessary an effectual, irresistible work
      of the Holy Ghost upon the whole soul, for the producing in them a new
      spiritual life, without which no other means are sufficient for their
      conversion unto God.

      <b>1.</b> The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under the

      as also in their free access to God,<sup>d</sup> and their yielding
      obedience unto him, not out of slavish fear, but a child-like love and
      willing mind.<sup>e</sup> All which were common also to believers under
      the law for the substance of them;<sup>f</sup> but under the New Testament
      the liberty of Christians is further enlarged in their freedom from the
      yoke of the ceremonial law, the whole legal administration of the covenant
      of grace, to which the Jewish Church was subjected;<sup>g</sup> and in
      greater boldness of access to the throne of grace,<sup>h</sup> and in

      of the gospel and obedience unto God by Christ according to it, not
      destroying their own profession by any errors everting the foundation, or
      unholiness of conversation, are, and may be called the visible catholic
      church of Christ; although as such it is not entrusted with the
      administration of any ordinances, or have any officers to rule or govern
      in, or over the whole body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b> The purest churches under heaven are subject both to mixture and
      error, and some have so degenerated as to become no churches of Christ,
      but synagogues of Satan: nevertheless Christ always hath had, and ever
      shall have, a visible kingdom in this world, to the end thereof, of such
      as believe in him, and make profession of his name.

    <p>
      <b>4.</b> There is no other Head of the Church but the Lord Jesus Christ;
      nor can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof; but is that
      antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalteth himself
      in the Church against Christ, and all that is called God, whom the Lord
      shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5.</b> As the Lord in his care and love towards his Church, hath in his
      infinite wise providence exercised it with great variety in all ages, for
      the good of them that love him, and his own glory; so according to his
      promise, we expect that in the latter days, antichrist being destroyed,
      the Jews called, and the adversaries of the kingdom of his dear Son
      broken, the churches of Christ being enlarged, and edified through a free
      and plentiful communication of light and grace, shall enjoy in this world
      a more quiet, peaceable and glorious condition than they have enjoyed.

    <h2>32. Of The Last Judgment</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in
      righteousness by Jesus Christ,<sup>a</sup> to whom all power and judgment
      is given of the Father.<sup>b</sup> In which day, not only the apostate
      angels shall be judged,<sup>c</sup> but likewise all persons, that have
      lived upon earth, shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an
      account of their thoughts, words, and deeds; and to receive according to
      what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.<sup>d</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      a: Acts 17:31
      <br />
      b: John 5:22
      <br />
      c: 1 Corinthians 6:3, 2 Peter 2:4, Jude 6

      14:12, 2 Corinthians 5:12
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> The end of God&#x27;s appointing this day, is for the
      manifestation of the glory of his mercy in the eternal salvation of the
      elect;<sup>a</sup> and of his justice in the damnation of the reprobate,
      who are wicked and disobedient.<sup>b</sup> For then shall the righteous
      go into everlasting life, and receive that fulness of joy glory, with
      everlasting reward in the presence of the Lord:<sup>c</sup> but the
      wicked, who know not God, and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall
      be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with everlasting
      destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his
      power.<sup>d</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b> As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there
      shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin, and for the
      greater consolation of the godly in their adversity:<sup>a</sup> so will
      he have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal
      security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour the
      Lord will come; and may be ever prepared to say, Come, Lord Jesus, come
      quickly. Amen.<sup>b</sup>
