      <p><em>The WEAPONS of the Religious Reformer</em></p>
      <p>
        &quot;For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God
        for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high
        thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every
        thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ!&quot; 2 Corinthians
        10:4-5
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since the introduction of sin into the world, there has been an
        unremitting conflict between truth and error. The earth has become a
        vast battle-ground—the theater of a mighty moral warfare. Truth and
        error are necessarily opposed to each other, and whenever they come in
        contact, a fierce contest ensues, which ends only when error is
        destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This conflict is not, however, one of a material kind; nor should
        physical force be used in carrying it on. It is a moral warfare; and
        ultimate success can be sensed only by the use of corresponding weapons.
        The advocates of error may press into their service carnal weapons, as
        indeed they are always forced to do, in their vain efforts to sustain
        themselves and oppose the truth; but thus they only acknowledge their
        own weakness, and betray the defects of their cause, and insure in the
        end their own defeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The disciple of the truth needs no such weapons. He knows that they can
        yield him no advantage, and secure no permanent benefit; and he sees
        that they would only encumber and embarrass him in the conflict, and
        retard the cause he seeks to advance. He feels that in order to be
        successful, he must use only those means which God has appointed, and
        which He can bless. He therefore appropriately adopts the language of
        the text: &quot;For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty
        in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every
        high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing
        every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        In conducting any enterprise, or effecting any work, instruments are
        necessary implements adapted to the end designed. The work of the
        reformer is, in a great measure, a work of destruction. He goes forth to
        demolish all that is opposed to truth—all that prevents its free and
        rapid advance. He is the pioneer, who is accounted &quot;famous
        according as he lifts up the axe upon the thick trees.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>Error is rather negative than positive.</p>
      <p>
        Truth was intended to enlighten man; error, like a cloud, intervenes to
        shut out its brilliant rays.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truth was intended to make man happy; error infuses poison, and
        introduces the ingredients of misery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truth was intended to make man free; error rears her fortress and
        strongholds, and makes him a captive in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the work of the reformer is to dissipate this cloud—to extract this
        poison—to pull down these strongholds. The work of Christ, the Great
        Reformer, was eminently a work of destruction. He was manifested that He
        might &quot;destroy the works of the devil.&quot; Let us notice,
      </p>
      <p>
        I. The STRONGHOLDS which the religious reformer is called on to
        demolish.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Ignorance. All religious error is the offspring of ignorance and
        mistake. God is true, and His Word is true. No religious error can find
        any support there. Yet we know that error does exist to a vast extent.
        How mighty, then, is this fortress! and how strong! Look at the
        ignorance of heathen nations. See the ignorance of those who are under
        the dominion of the Papacy. Behold the lamentable ignorance of a vast
        majority of Protestants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the reformer meets this stronghold wherever he undertakes to labor.
        He beholds willful ignorance of plainly revealed truths. He beholds one
        body of men willfully ignorant of the views and practices of another
        body which they condemn. He finds himself misrepresented, misunderstood,
        and opposed—because men are entrenched in this stronghold of ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle Paul once found himself a victim of misrepresentation which
        had gained currency simply through the inexcusable and willful ignorance
        of those who believed them. &quot;Are not you that Egyptian,&quot; he
        was asked, &quot;which, before these days made an uproar, and led out
        into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        The religious reformer is frequently assailed with questions as absurd,
        betraying the willful ignorance of those who oppose him in his work.
        This ignorance he labors to remove.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Prejudice. Prejudices are generally in favor of that to which men are
        accustomed, and opposed to that which appears new to them. If men have
        been accustomed to error, they love it on account of its antiquity; and
        the inquiry too frequently is not: What is truth? But,
      </p>
      <p>Is it in accordance with our traditions?</p>
      <p>Is it what our fathers practiced?</p>
      <p>Is it what they taught us?</p>
      <p>
        Men speak of time-honored customs; they forget that, while errors may be
        time-honored, truth is eternal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prejudice is a mighty stronghold. Its walls are of adamantine strength
        and of almost impenetrable thickness. Entrenched in this fortress, men
        are unapproachable. The soundest logic, the strongest arguments, the
        most convincing proofs, the fairest reasonings—all fail, all are
        powerless, while prejudice holds the mind within her grasp.
      </p>
      <p>
        The very work of the religious reformer brings him in direct contact
        with those customs which appeal most powerfully to men&#x27;s
        prejudices. He aims to remove old errors; but, in order to do this, he
        must first demolish the stronghold in which they are entrenched. He aims
        to convince men that it is better to be the willing subjects of reason,
        than the blind slaves of prejudice!
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Self-interest. Many go with the crowd, merely because it is to their
        present interest. After they are enlightened by truth, and after their
        old prejudices are overcome—still, selfishness prevails; and instead of
        doing that which they know to be right, and laboring to advance the
        truth, they prefer to act contrary to their own convictions. They
        perceive that the truth is unpopular—that its advocacy will necessitate
        self-denial and sacrifice—that their temporal interests will suffer, and
        their names be cast out as evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the religions reformer aims to make men benevolent; he labors to
        make them willing to deny themselves and cheerfully suffer for the good
        of others and the sake of the truth. Selfishness must be demolished,
        this mighty stronghold must be pulled down, before the reformer can
        succeed in his work. Thus, the victims of error must be driven from
        every refuge, and their hiding-places must be destroyed, before they
        will be made free by the reception of the truth. Notice:
      </p>
      <p>
        II. The MEANS by which this is accomplished. These are stated in the
        text negatively. &quot;The weapons of our warfare are not carnal.&quot;
        The religious reformer does not invoke:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. The Civil Power. He does not seek to force men by legal enactments to
        embrace his views, or profess attachment to his cause. He does not seek
        to unite the Church with the State, or enforce his teachings at the edge
        of the sword and the point of the bayonet. He does not use persecution
        or oppression of any kind. He does not use authority of office, either
        civil or ecclesiastical. He does not use the authority growing out of
        the domestic relations to force the consciences of those who are subject
        to him, or compel them to adopt his views of truth. He utterly renounces
        compulsion of every kind. The gibbet, the rack, and the stake, are all
        discarded by him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here was one radical defect of the Reformation of the sixteenth century.
        The civil arm was invoked, the State was united with the Church, a
        political element was infused, and carnal weapons were used as freely by
        the Reformed Churches in enforcing their dogmas, as by the Papacy in
        maintaining its heresies. The thorough religious reformer uses no such
        weapons. Neither does he employ,
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Calumny and Misrepresentation. In order successfully to combat the
        opinions and practices of an opponent, individuals sometimes distort and
        falsify his views. They present an absurd doctrine, which is
        inconsistent both with reason and revelation, falsely charge it on those
        whom they oppose—and then eloquently declaim against it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or they mistake the arguments used by their opponents to sustain their
        views, and endeavor to make the impression that they are but weak
        fanatics, or men laboring under mental imbecility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, they openly slander and vilify them, and injure their reputation.
        And thus they labor to bring into disrepute both the views and practices
        they oppose, and the persons who advocate them.
      </p>
      <p>
        All who persecute, love to have some pretext; they therefore first
        slander their victim—and then put him to death! Thus it was with Jesus;
        false witnesses rose against him; and though their testimony carried its
        refutation on its very face, it was made the pretext for his
        crucifixion.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the thorough religious reformer, having no desire to persecute,
        needs no pretext for it; he therefore discards calumny and
        misrepresentation. Neither does he resort to,
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Flattery and Deceitful Artifices. He appeals not to sinful passions,
        such as pride, ambition, self-indulgence and a desire for worldly honor.
        This is often done in order to advance a sect or party. &quot;Our
        denomination,&quot; it is urged, &quot;is the most popular—it numbers
        more than any other—it has more wealth.&quot; &quot;Our church is the
        most respectable—it embraces the most learned and talented men;
        therefore we are right.&quot; &quot;It will be to your interest to join
        our church, because it is THE church of whole region.&quot; Now all such
        motives as these must be classed among the carnal weapons. They appeal
        to selfishness. The true reformer makes no such appeals, urges no such
        motives, wields no such weapons: &quot;For the weapons of his warfare
        are not carnal.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Such weapons are impotent, and worse than useless, in seeking to advance
        the truth. If a man becomes an honest and faithful follower of the
        truth, it must be for the truth&#x27;s sake—and not to avoid
        persecution, or reproach, or unpopularity. Such weapons can never pull
        down the strongholds of error, but rather render them more impregnable.
        Persecution will never enlighten the mind of the ignorant.
        Misrepresentation will never remove prejudice. Flattery will never
        demolish selfishness.
      </p>
      <p>
        And further, such weapons only recoil on the heads of those who use
        them. It is an immutable decree of Jehovah, that &quot;those who take
        the sword shall perish with the sword.&quot; We have a striking
        illustration of this in the burning of Cranmer and Rogers. We have been
        taught to sympathize with them in their martyr-deaths at the stake; and
        that sympathy we would not check, for they were cruelly persecuted. But
        we would at the same time recognize in their sufferings a, fulfillment
        of Christ&#x27;s words, &quot;For in the same way you judge others, you
        will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to
        you.&quot; Matthew 7:2.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hands of both of them had been stained with the blood of Joan
        Boucher, a noble-minded and pious lady, who, in the reign of the
        youthful Edward, was committed to the flames for the sin of being a
        Baptist. &quot;Cranmer is said by Fox in his Book of Martyrs, to have
        been most urgent with the young king to sign to the cruel document. The
        youthful king hesitated. Cranmer argued from the law of Moses, by which
        blasphemers were to be stoned to death. With tears but unconvinced, the
        royal signature was appended. Rogers also thought that she ought to be
        put to death, and when urged with the cruelty of the deed, replied,
        &#x27;that burning alive was no cruel death, but easy
        enough!&#x27;&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        God has shown, in an unmistakable manner, his disapprobation of carnal
        weapons. While the reformer deprecates the use of these means, there are
        weapons employed by him which are &quot;mighty, through God, to the
        pulling down of strongholds.&quot; Among these we notice:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. The Word of God. This is the double-edged sword of the Spirit. This
        is the grand weapon which is to cut its way through all error. It always
        has been successful, and always will be. Those only have been successful
        reformers, who have used this as their great weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at the Great Reformer; when he went forth to encounter, in the
        wilderness, the arch adversary of truth, how did he vanquish him? Though
        all the hosts of Heaven were ready to do his bidding, and drag Satan
        back to his prison, He disdained to exert physical force. He used this
        great weapon; and every assault of the Tempter was repelled by the calm
        reply, &quot;It is written—it is written—IT IS WRITTEN!
      </p>
      <p>
        When the apostles went forth, the Word of God was the instrument with
        which they overcame the opposition of Judaism.
      </p>
      <p>
        What gave rise to the reformation in the sixteenth century? Why, a poor
        monk found a Bible, and in his cell made it his study. Happy would it
        have been for the world, if the reformers of that age had been guided
        exclusively by its holy precepts. Discarding tradition, and every human
        invention—the thorough religious reformer makes the Bible both his
        text-book and test-book.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Candor and Affection. He takes pains to ascertain accurately the
        views of those whose errors he would correct, giving them credit for the
        truth they hold, and acknowledging their excellencies wherever they
        exist. His work is not to destroy their lives, their liberties, or their
        reputations, but their errors. He therefore speaks the truth in love,
        and seeks not theirs but them. His great wish is to benefit them; and,
        like the blessed Redeemer, who could mingle His tears of compassion with
        his denunciations against sin—the reformer boldly and sternly denounces
        error, yet cherishes ardent affection for those who are &quot;out of the
        way.&quot; He also employs,
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Sound Reason. He appeals not to passion or prejudice, but to the
        understanding. He is able to give a reason for everything he attempts.
        He shows the fitness of things, and their propriety; he invites the
        exercise of the judgment of those whom he addresses. Instead of
        regarding men as brutes, who are to be driven by force, he recognizes
        them as rational, intelligent beings, who are to be convinced, and
        persuaded, and moved by mental and moral power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ and the apostles were great reasoners; especially is this true of
        the apostle Paul. Who can read the epistles to the early churches,
        without being struck with the force of his reasoning? The advocates of
        error cannot stand before the reformer who is well skilled in the use of
        this weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Earnest, believing, importunate prayer. &quot;Mighty through
        God.&quot; He must give success in the use of the weapons. The religious
        reformer, therefore, while he wields the &quot;sword of the Spirit&quot;
        and exhibits in his own life the power of the truth he holds, depends
        only on God for success in his work. He pleads for men with God, while
        he pleads with men for the truth. Every successful religious reformer
        has been a man of prayer. Earnestness in the pulpit, has not
        accomplished so much as earnestness in the closet. With a deep
        conviction that it is God&#x27;s work he is endeavoring to advance, he
        confidently looks up for God&#x27;s aid and blessing in prosecuting it,
        and feels assured that while his weapons are not carnal, they are yet
        &quot;mighty through God&quot; to the pulling down of strongholds.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the weapons of the reformer. With these he goes forth to
        attack the strongholds of sin, and raze to the ground the giant fabric
        of error. To be successful even in advancing the truth, we must use only
        the divinely appointed means; for wherever the opposite course has been
        pursued, the most disastrous results have followed. Truth is only
        trammeled and retarded by the use of any but the heaven-approved
        weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
        These weapons, only, have been used by Baptists. They have never figured
        on the historic page as persecutors. Though the subjects of bitter
        oppression and cruel persecutions themselves, it has been their glory
        always to exclaim, &quot;The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but
        mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds!&quot;
