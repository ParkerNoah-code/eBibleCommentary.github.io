        <em>The RECEPTION Which Should Be Given to the Religious Reformer</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the
        Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and
        examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was
        true.&quot; Acts 17:11
      </p>
      <p>
        Infidelity and error have always delighted to taunt the disciples of
        Christ and the friends of truth with ignorant credulity, and the
        reception of unfounded and absurd dogmas, without due forethought and
        investigation. They have arrogated to themselves all the freedom of
        thought and independence of mind there is in the world, and profess to
        have calmly investigated the truths which they reject. The taunt on the
        one hand, and the assumption on the other, are both false; for it is a
        significant fact, that a pure Christianity has advanced just in
        proportion as the right of free and independent investigation has been
        enjoyed and exercised. Moreover, it is the glory of Christianity, that
        it courts the test of candid examination, and commends such a course
        whenever adopted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a striking illustration of this in the text and its connection.
        The apostle Paul, having been driven from Thessalonica by an infuriated
        mob, excited to deeds of violence by bigoted and interested partisans,
        fled to Berea. Here he pursued a course similar to that which he had
        adopted in Thessalonica. He entered the Jewish synagogue and taught in
        the name of Jesus. The community in this place was composed of men of
        more independent minds, and nobler spirit than the Thessalonians; and,
        consequently, they gave the apostle a far different reception from that
        which he experienced in their city. They were not afraid to discuss,
        examine, and fairly investigate the new doctrine which he introduced to
        them, and after bringing it to the proper test, to let it stand or fall
        on its own merits.
      </p>
      <p>
        This conduct was truly noble; and as such, it is endorsed by the Holy
        Spirit in the inspired words of the text: &quot;Now the Bereans were of
        more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the
        message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to
        see if what Paul said was true.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Though the apostle appeared among them as a reformer, they did not
        consider him an intruder, or treat him as an revolutionist; but they
        acted like rational, intelligent beings; they acted like men; they acted
        as all should act under like circumstances. Our theme on the present
        occasion will be, &quot;The Reception That Should Be Given to the
        Religious Reformer.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        In illustrating this theme, I shall invite your attention to the conduct
        of the Bereans, and their treatment of Paul and Silas, as the divinely
        approved example. This example will appear to better advantage, if we
        follow the phraseology of the text, and notice,
      </p>
      <p>
        1. the Comparison Instituted. &quot;Now the Bereans were of more noble
        character than the Thessalonians.&quot; The Thessalonian Jews had
        exhibited a spirit of gross intolerance. They were destitute of that
        spirit which truly ennobles man. They had power and influence, and they
        used these to crush the weak. They were filled with envy and jealousy,
        and they gave vent to their feelings in acts of violence and oppression.
        Refusing to be convinced themselves, they determined to prevent all
        others from being convinced. They appealed to passion, and prejudice,
        rather than to judgment and reason. They made old opinions, and popular
        usages, the standard and test by which they tried the apostles&#x27;
        teaching, instead of the Word of God. They falsely accused them of
        disturbing the peace of society; and, by a willful misconstruction of
        their words, they even charged them with treasonable designs against the
        government: &quot;These,&quot; said they, &quot;all do contrary to the
        decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one called
        Jesus.&quot; They drove them entirely away from their city, and then
        persecuted those who had hospitably entertained them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor was this all. They followed them to Berea, and stirred up the people
        there, so that Paul was compelled to leave that place. Now, in contrast
        with this course, notice,
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The Reception of the Apostles by the Bereans. &quot;They received the
        message with great eagerness.&quot; They were wedded to the same rites
        as were the Jews in Thessalonica. Their prejudices were in favor of
        Judaism and arrayed against Christianity. Hence, the teaching of the
        apostle was as much opposed to their views, as to those of the
        Thessalonians; but notwithstanding all this, &quot;they received the
        message with great eagerness.&quot; This implies that they received it,
      </p>
      <p>
        1. This implies that they received te word RESPECTFULLY. It is too
        frequently the case, that when the truth is presented to those who have
        long cherished religions error—they treat it with ridicule, especially
        where it comes in contact with their preconceived opinions. Thus the
        Athenians treated Paul, when he broached the doctrine of the
        resurrection, &quot;When they heard about the resurrection of the dead,
        some of them sneered; but others said: We want to hear you again on this
        subject.&quot; (Acts 17:32)
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus it is, often, in our day. The curling lip, and the sneer of
        contempt, and the expression of ridicule, are seen and heard as soon as
        a favorite dogma is touched, no matter how kindly. Not so with the
        Bereans. However novel the doctrines of the apostle appeared, however
        opposite to what they had been taught, or however different from their
        previously formed opinions—they listened to what he presented with
        respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. They received the word with OPENNESS. They were disposed to be frank
        and fair. They were open to conviction—honest and sincere in their
        conclusions. They kept their minds free from an undue bias, and let
        every argument have its full weight. They were disposed to think and
        judge according to truth and justice. They were willing to admit every
        reasonable and logical conclusion. They banished prejudice, and examined
        the subject impartially.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the proper way to arrive at the truth. God gave us our reason to
        be exercised in religious matters, as well as in worldly affairs. These
        Bereans neither exhibited bigotry on the one hand, nor credulity on the
        other. They were willing to hear, and then they judged for themselves,
        and formed their own conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is all that can be demanded. This course was honorable to
        themselves, and would make even those respect them who differed from
        them. And this is true of any man, or body of men. Let them be open,
        fair and frank, and they will win the respect of those who arrive at, a
        different conclusion from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. They received the word PATIENTLY. They did not get angry with the
        apostle, or exhibit signs of irritation, or cherish feelings of malice
        toward him—because he sought to convert them from Judaism. Though it was
        the religion of their fathers—though they had been brought up in
        it—though their prejudices were strongly wedded to its rites and
        ceremonies—still, they calmly listened to the reasons urged by the
        apostle why they should abandon it, and connect themselves with that
        sect which was &quot;everywhere spoken against.&quot; They were not
        offended at Paul&#x27;s zeal; their minds were unruffled, and day after
        day they came to patiently hear him through.
      </p>
      <p>
        How different is this from the conduct of most persons. Just touch their
        peculiar doctrines, or hint that the rites which they observe are
        unscriptural, and without waiting to hear the reasons for such an
        opinion, they at once become agitated, and impatiently desire to leave
        the place and inwardly determine that they will not again enter it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Not so with the noble Bereans. They wished to find the truth, though it
        might lie in a different direction from that in which they had been
        accustomed to seek it. They desired to follow the truth, though it might
        lead to the abandonment of time-honored customs and the breaking up of
        old and pleasant associations. Therefore, &quot;they received the
        message with great eagerness.&quot; Such a course might offend
        interested partisans, but God commends it as noble. We notice,
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The Test by Which They Tried the Teaching of the Apostles. &quot;They
        examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was
        true.&quot; This is the divine standard of appeal. God gave it as our
        guide, and we are commanded to search it. Scripture is to be the test of
        all religious teaching; and the conduct of the Bereans in making it the
        test of Paul&#x27;s preaching is honored by its divine Author; for let
        it not be forgotten that it is Jehovah who speaks in the text.
      </p>
      <p>
        They did not appeal to Tradition. They might have done this. Rumor said
        that Christ was an impostor; Paul affirmed that He was the Messiah. How
        were they to decide? Simply by appealing to the Scriptures. They did not
        appeal to their priests and rabbis. They had told them to oppose
        Christianity, and seek to exterminate it. But they knew their priests
        were fallible men, and that if they obeyed them, they might possibly be
        &quot;found fighting against God.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        They did not appeal to their own preference, and interest, and
        convenience. These would have prompted them to reject the investigation
        of the doctrine, and decide at once in accordance with tradition and
        popular customs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abandoning all these false and uncertain standards, they appealed to the
        Scriptures, to settle the differences between their views and those of
        their reformers.
      </p>
      <p>
        They &quot;searched&quot; the Scriptures; as one who seeks for something
        that is lost. Many persons read the Bible only to find support for what
        they already believe, and search the Scriptures to prove that what is
        new to them is not so. But these Bereans exhibited the same openness in
        testing the word, that they did in its reception. If the Scriptures
        sustained the apostle, they adopted his views; if not, they rejected
        them. Thus they honored God, and exempted themselves from the charge of
        willful ignorance, intolerance, and superstition.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the reception that should always be given to those who aim to
        reform a community, whether that reformation is universal, or whether it
        have reference only to a single doctrine or ordinance. Such a reception
        is all we ask for these Lectures. Such a reception is all Baptists ask
        anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who hold the truth have nothing to fear from such a course.
        Respectful, candid, and patient attention, will enable them the more
        readily to detect sophistry and specious reasoning, and the study of the
        Bible will always expose what is unscriptural and erroneous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, this course has the sanction of Jehovah, however much it may
        offend men. The Bible should be the test of all preaching. That man who
        desires to make himself the umpire and final standard of appeal to his
        congregation, involves himself in a fearful responsibility, and
        virtually claims for himself infallibility. Yet some ministers appear
        offended if their authority is questioned, or if their preaching is
        tested by the Word of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul did not do so. Though inspired, he commended the course of those,
        who, instead of taking his word for it, examined the Scriptures for
        themselves, to see whether those things which he taught them were so. To
        adopt a contrary course, and blindly follow a minister or priest, is
        downright Romanism! And, if pursued universally, this would . . .
      </p>
      <p>arrest the progress of the Gospel,</p>
      <p>and clog the wheels of truth,</p>
      <p>and stamp error with immutability.</p>
      <p>
        What if the Hindu, the Burman, and the Chinese follow their priests, and
        universally determine never to examine Christianity? What if the
        Mohammedan, Romanist and Greek, follow their teachers? What if the
        Universalist, Infidel, and Atheist, follow their champions! These have
        as much warrant to do this, as the Presbyterian, Methodist, or Baptist.
        No, my brethren, your minister is not to be the umpire or standard.
        There is but one who could say, &quot;Follow Me!&quot; and that was
        Christ. We point you to Him. We direct you to His Word as the standard
        of your beliefs, and to His example as the pattern of your lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, in these Lectures, we say anything that conflicts with these, reject
        it; but if you God, on examination, that these things which we preach
        are so, remember, the whole responsibility of rejecting, not us, but the
        Word of God, and the meek and lowly Savior, rests at your own door.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the conduct of the Bereans were universally imitated, what happy
        events would follow! How soon would infidelity, and error, and
        superstition vanish before the influence of sound reason and Scripture
        truth. What courtesy, and forbearance, and love, would be manifested
        among brethren who differ. How much more diligently would the Bible be
        studied, and how soon would the multitude of sects and parties
        disappear, and the Savior&#x27;s prayer that they all might be one would
        be answered!
      </p>
      <p>
        The contrary course can benefit no one. If a man is in an error, no
        matter how trivial—it can do him no good to continue in that error.
        Especially, it can do him no good to dwarf his mind, and stunt his
        intellectual powers—in order that he may continue in it unmolested. Yet
        this is the effect of refusing a candid investigation of the truth.
        Further, if a man has the truth, he will not fear investigation, but
        rather court it, &quot;He who does the truth comes to the light, that
        his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        If a pretended reformer appears, there is no surer way of exposing the
        imposition, than the adoption of the example of the Bereans. But if a
        contrary course is pursued, it frequently leads to the exercise of a
        morbid sympathy toward those who hold injurious error.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Baptists appear before the world as those who aim at a complete
        reform. They, appeal . . .
      </p>
      <p>not to the sympathies, but to the consciences of men;</p>
      <p>not to prejudice, but to reason;</p>
      <p>not to tradition but to the Scriptures.</p>
      <p>
        They simply ask for the reception which the Bereans gave to those who
        sought to convert them from Judaism to Christianity.
