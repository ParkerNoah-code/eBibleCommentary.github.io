          >The Third Feature of the Reform at Which Baptists Aim: The
          Propagation of Religious Liberty and the Rights of Conscience.</em

      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and we forbade
        him, because he follows not with us. And Jesus said, Forbid him
        not.&quot; Luke 9:49, 50
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel of Christ not only differs from all other systems of religion
        in the superior excellence of the truths it reveals, but also in the
        directions it gives for the propagation of its doctrines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other systems seek to advance themselves by invoking the aid of the
        secular power, and by forcing men, against their convictions, to accept
        a theory repugnant to their views. They have thus succeeded in thronging
        their temples with hypocritical worshipers, bound to their altars
        through fear and slavish dread. These systems, in order to maintain
        themselves, find it necessary to proscribe and persecute all who differ
        from them, either in their articles of belief or mode of worship.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Gospel of Christ, though it is the infallible truth of God,
        expressly prohibits a resort to any such measures for its advancement.
        It not only teaches its adherents to utterly abandon the use of carnal
        weapons for its propagation, but it also charges them not to proscribe
        to those who may differ in their views or mode of worship. This
        principle is directly expressed in the text and its connection. The
        teaching of the Savior has been violated, however, even by his professed
        followers; and, in the name of the meek and lowly Jesus, men have gone
        forth with proscription, oppression, and persecution, to advance their
        own opinions, and crush out that liberty of thought, and those rights of
        conscience given to man by his Maker, and the free exercise of which is
        alone compatible with his personal accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        One body of Christians has always shunned this mode of procedure; and in
        seeking to advance the truth, they have never engaged in persecution of
        any kind, though they have been themselves more bitterly persecuted than
        any others. I propose to prove that Baptists have always been the
        pioneers in the Propagation of Religious Liberty and the Rights of
        Conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shall endeavor here to define what religious liberty is. The views of
        many Protestants, even in this land of liberty, are exceedingly
        imperfect, and in some instances surprisingly erroneous, on this
        subject. Many consider toleration as synonymous with religious liberty;
        but a moment&#x27;s consideration will exhibit the vast difference
        between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        Toleration is the allowance of that which is not wholly approved. As
        applied to religion, the term is objectionable; because it presupposes
        the existence of some mere human authority, which has power to grant to,
        or withhold from man the exercise of freedom in matters of religion—and
        this is Popery. Our Creator, however, has nowhere delegated such
        authority to king, or priest, or any human organization whatever; on the
        contrary, he has shown, by the very nature of the soul of man, and the
        Revelation given to him, that it is his inalienable right to exercise
        his judgment without restraint in religious matters, and give
        expression, freely and fully, to his religious convictions, without
        human coercion or interference.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is manifest, that if the right to tolerate exists in man, the right
        to prohibit, and to dictate to the conscience, must also exist with it;
        and thus toleration becomes merely another name for oppression.
        Toleration, therefore, is not religious liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Religious freedom recognizes in no human organization the right or the
        power to tolerate. It does not stoop—either to magistrate or minister,
        pope or priest—to humbly beg permission to speak freely, or act out its
        convictions; but it speaks and acts, because, in the exercise of its own
        right, it chooses to do so. It simply asks, with Paul, &quot;Lord, what
        will you have me to do?&quot; and having ascertained God&#x27;s will, it
        goes forth to do it, though a host of priests, or a thousand
        executioners, stand ready to execrate and slay it. It acknowledges no
        human authority competent to come between the conscience and its Maker
        in reference to his will and its duty. Religious liberty does not exist
        where there is no recognition and acknowledgment of this right—the right
        of every individual of the human race, to think, and choose, and act for
        himself in religious matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptists have always strenuously contended for the acknowledgment of
        this principle, and have labored to propagate it. Nowhere, on the page
        of history, can an instance be found of Baptists depriving others of
        their religious liberties, or aiming to do so; but, wherever they are
        found, even in the darkest ages of intolerance and persecution, they
        appear to be far in advance of those who surround them on this important
        subject. This is simply owing to their adherence to the Gospel of Christ
        in its purity. Here religious liberty is taught in its fullest extent;
        and it was only when the Christian church departed from God&#x27;s Word,
        that she sought to crush the rights of conscience; and only when she
        fully returns to it again, will she cease to nourish a desire to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Reformation which took place in the sixteenth century, while it
        aimed to remove many of the abuses of Popery, still did not recognize
        religions liberty. &quot;There is not a confession of faith, nor a
        creed,&quot; says Underhill, &quot;framed by any of the Reformers, which
        does not give to the magistrate a coercive power in religion, and almost
        every one, at the same time, curses the resisting Baptist.&quot;
        &quot;It was the crime of this persecuted people, that they rejected
        secular interference in the church of God; it was the boast and aim of
        the Reformers everywhere to employ it. The natural fruit of the one was
        persecution—of the other, liberty.&quot; (&quot;Struggles and Triumphs
        of Religious Liberty,&quot; page 86.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Baptists stood entirely alone, as the defenders of the rights of
        conscience. All the Reformed communities agreed that it was right for
        the magistrate to punish those who did not worship according to the
        prescribed rule of their churches; and it was for opposition to this
        feature of religious oppression, in connection with their adherence to
        believer&#x27;s baptism, that brought upon the Baptists those severe
        persecutions which they were called to endure. They contended for
        religious liberty; the Reformed churches opposed it, and committed
        themselves to a course fatal to the rights of conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I again quote from Underhill: &quot;Honor, ease, and wealth flowed in
        upon the opposers of religious liberty, but tribulation unto death was
        the portion of those who ventured to advocate it. Most affectingly does
        the eminent Simmon Menno refer to this contrast: &#x27;For eighteen
        years, with my poor feeble wife and little children, has it behooved me
        to bear great and various sufferings, griefs, afflictions, miseries, and
        persecutions, and in every place to find a bare existence, in fear and
        danger of my life. While some preachers are reclining on their soft bed
        and downy pillows—we are often hidden in the caves of the earth. While
        they are celebrating the nuptial or natal days of their children, and
        rejoicing with the timbrel and the harp—we are looking anxiously about,
        fearing lest persecutors should be suddenly at the door earth. While
        they are saluted by all around as doctors, masters, lords, we are
        compelled to hear ourselves called Anabaptists, ale-house preachers,
        seducers, heretics, and to be hailed in the devil&#x27;s name. In a
        word, while they for their ministry are remunerated with annual
        stipends, our wages are the fire, the sword, the death.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, why was this? Did these Baptists deserve such treatment at the
        hands of their persecutors? Let a Catholic historian (Cardinal Hosius,
        President of the Council of Trent) reply: &quot;If you behold their
        cheerfulness in suffering persecution, the Anabaptists run before all
        the heretics. If you have regard to the number, it is like that in
        multitude they would swarm above all others, if they were not grievously
        plagued and cut off with the knife of persecution. If you have an eye to
        the outward appearance of godliness, both the Lutherans and Zwinglians
        must needs grant that they far pass them. If you will be moved by the
        boasting of the Word of God, these be no less bold than Calvin to
        preach, and their doctrine must stand aloft above all the glory of the
        world, must stand invincible above all power, because it is not their
        word, but the Word of the living God.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        It is evident, then, that the Baptists suffered merely because they
        maintained that they ought &quot;to obey God rather than man.&quot; They
        found no direction in the Bible for the baptism of infants, and
        therefore they refused to observe the rite. The Reformed or Protestant
        churches sought to force them to do it, in opposition to their
        convictions. They maintained that this was also contrary to the spirit
        of the Gospel, and thus, in defense of the Bible, and the rights of
        conscience, they died.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a proof of this let me give you one among very many other instances
        which might be produced. Balthazar Hubmeyer of Friedburgh, Switzerland,
        who with his wife, suffered martyrdom in 1598, at the hands of the
        Protestant Reformers, for the sin of being a Baptist—was originally a
        learned and eloquent Roman Catholic preacher, and while among them was
        called a Doctor of the Holy Scriptures. By the illumination of the Holy
        Spirit he was so convinced of the abominations of Popery, that following
        the counsel of God, he separated himself from it. He afterward rejected,
        among other Popish errors, infant baptism, and taught with all possible
        zeal, the immersion of believers according to the command of Christ. In
        company with one hundred and ten others, he was baptized by William
        Roubli, one of the earliest Swiss Baptists, and for some time a pastor
        at Basle. He himself baptized some three hundred persons in the few
        following months. He published a work on baptism, which brought, in the
        autumn, a virulent reply from Zwingle, the great Protestant Swiss
        Reformer. Some of the Baptists were cast into prison, and so cruel were
        the proceedings, that even the populace complained that injustice was
        done to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hubmeyer published a tract, in which he complains of Zwingle and his
        followers: That they had proceeded at one time so far as to throw into a
        dark and miserable tower, twenty persons, both men and pregnant women,
        widows and young females, and to pronounce this sentence upon them—that
        thenceforward they should see neither sun nor moon for the remainder of
        their lives, and be fed until their days were ended with bread and
        water, and that they should remain in the dark tower together, both the
        living and the dead, surrounded with filth and putrefaction, until not a
        single survivor of the whole remained.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Oh, God!&quot; writes this good man, &quot;what a hard, severe,
        cruel sentence upon pious Christian people, of whom no one could speak
        evil, only that they had received water baptism in obedience to the
        command of Christ.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Hubmeyer courageously went to the stake, and was burned to death on the
        10th of March, 1528. His wife was also the partner of his sufferings.
        She was condemned to death by drowning, and in the river Danube found a
        watery grave.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter whether Romanists or Protestants gained the ascendancy—the
        Baptists were persecuted by both alike. The reason of this was, that
        they claimed for the church of Christ, and the consciences of men,
        freedom from all human control. This was their distinguishing trait; and
        it was the assertion of this principle that brought them into collision
        with every form and ceremony of human invention in the worship of God,
        and every effort to bind the conscience to observe them. To worship God
        aright, the spirit must be free; for true worship is voluntary, and can
        only come from a willing heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        From what I have submitted, it will be seen that the Baptists stood
        alone, as the defenders of religious liberty, during the progress of the
        Reformation, and for many years after. It will also be seen, that their
        idea of the church, composed of none but believers, immersed on the
        profession of their faith, was the grand cause of the separation of the
        Baptists, as individuals and communities, from all the ecclesiastical
        organizations supported by the Reformers and their successors. From the
        very nature of the case, there could be no union between them; from the
        first they were opposites, and so they remained. The Baptists occupied
        an independent and original position; they were neither Romanists nor
        Protestants, but thorough religious reformers, elevating their standard
        of religious liberty far above the most exalted ideas of Protestant
        toleration.
      </p>
      <p>
        And thus it continued to be, until the establishment of the American
        Republic. Other denominations contended for toleration; Baptists
        demanded for themselves, and all others, religious liberty—the right of
        every one to worship God as he might choose. Even the Puritans, who fled
        from persecution in England, had no idea of religious liberty. They came
        here to establish their own faith, and to exclude all others! Hence they
        were more rigidly intolerant than the countries whence they had fled
        from persecution! &quot;Intolerance was a necessary condition of their
        enterprise. They feared and hated religious liberty.&quot; (Dr. Ellis,
        Lecture before the New England Historical Society, March 11, 1860.)
      </p>
      <p>
        All who did not conform to their views, were fined and imprisoned, and
        whipped and banished. And, as Baptists were especially opposed to
        religious oppression, the heaviest persecutions fell upon them. Hence,
        in 1644, a law was passed in Massachusetts against the Baptists, by
        which it was &quot;ordered and agreed, that if any person or persons
        within this jurisdiction shall either openly condemn or oppose the
        baptism of infants, or seduce others to do so, or leave the congregation
        during the administration of the rite—he shall be sentenced to
        banishment.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        The same year we accordingly find that a poor man was tied up and
        whipped for refusing to have his child sprinkled. On July 30, 1651,
        Obadiah Holmes, John Clark, and John Crandall, Baptist ministers, were
        arrested near Lynn, Massachusetts, while preaching on the Lord&#x27;s
        day, taken to the parish church in the afternoon, sent to the Boston
        jail, and subsequently fined. The fines of Clark and Crandall were,
        after a while, paid, but Mr. Holmes was kept in Boston jail until
        September, when he was tied to the whipping-post and publicly whipped.
        His clothes were stripped off, and thirty lashes sunk into his naked
        flesh, which was so torn and cut that for weeks afterward he could only
        rest upon his hands and knees even in bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This same spirit of persecution was manifested against Roger Williams.
        In 1639, he became a Baptist, and in 1643 went to England from New York,
        because he had been banished from Boston. In March, 1644, he obtained
        the charter for the colony of Rhode Island, with power for the colony to
        make its own laws; and in September, 1644, under that charter was
        established the first government on earth that granted full religious
        liberty. It was the first spot the sun had ever shone upon where the
        rights of conscience were fully acknowledged, and it was founded by a
        Baptist. It is considered the germ of that religious liberty which all
        American citizens now enjoy, for up to the very dawning of the American
        Revolution, and even after that period, Baptists continued to struggle
        and suffer heroically for religious liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Virginia, where the first permanent colony in America was
        established, the charter bearing date 1606, fourteen years before the
        Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, Baptists were bitterly persecuted. By law,
        a fine of two thousand pounds of tobacco was imposed on &quot;those who
        neglected to have their infants baptized.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptist ministers were arrested and imprisoned as vagrants; some were
        pulled down from the stand as they were preaching, insulted and whipped,
        and many were imprisoned for preaching the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elders John Waller, Lewis Craig, and James Childs were seized at a
        meeting, June 4, 1768, dragged before the magistrate, and imprisoned for
        forty-three days in Fredericksburg. Mr. Wofford was severely scourged,
        and carried the scars to his grave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Hawks, historian of the Episcopal Church of Virginia, says: &quot;No
        dissenters in Virginia experienced harsher treatment than did the
        Baptists. They were beaten and imprisoned, and cruelty taxed its
        ingenuity to devise new modes of punishment and annoyance.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Baptists struggled on. On September 5, 1774, a Congress elected
        by the people of twelve colonies met at Philadelphia to consult for the
        general interests. The Warren Baptist Association of Rhode Island sent
        an agent—Rev. Isaac Backus, who with his mother, brother, and uncle, had
        suffered imprisonment for being Baptists—to Philadelphia, to join with
        the Philadelphia Baptist Association in presenting a memorial to
        Congress to secure religious liberty. But they met opposition; some even
        accusing the Baptists of trying to break up the Union, when they merely
        advocated universal religious liberty!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress
        in Philadelphia, July 4, 1776. But the Declaration of Independence did
        not remove oppressive laws from colonial or State statute-books. In
        Virginia, for four years after the Declaration of Independence,
        marriages performed by Baptists were unlawful, their children declared
        illegitimate, and their inheritances were confiscated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not until 1785, was religious liberty fully established by law in
        Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, whose father was a Baptist, being the author
        of the bill. In 1809, writing to the members of the Baptist Church at
        Buck Mountain, whom he acknowledged as his coadjutors in the work, he
        says: &quot;We have acted together from the origin to the end of a
        memorable revolution, and we have contributed, each in the line allotted
        us, our endeavors to render its issues a permanent blessing to our
        country.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        A National Constitution for the United States was adopted in 1787. Its
        provisions were satisfactory as far as they went, but religious liberty
        was not sufficiently guarded. The Baptist General Committee of Virginia,
        in 1788, expressed their disapproval of this important omission, and,
        after consultation with James Madison, this committee, in August, 1789,
        wrote to General Washington, then President of the United States, saying
        that they feared that liberty of conscience, dearer to them than
        property or life, was not sufficiently guarded. Washington gave them a
        kind and encouraging reply, in which occurs the following language:
        &quot;While I recollect with satisfaction that the religious society of
        which you are members have been, throughout America, uniformly, and
        almost unanimously, the firm friends of civil liberty, and the
        persevering promoters of our glorious Revolution, I cannot hesitate to
        believe that they will be the faithful supporters of a free yet
        efficient general government.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next month that immortal First Amendment to the Constitution was
        adopted by Congress: &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an
        establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or
        abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the
        people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a redress
        of grievances.&quot; Thus were Baptists the propagators of our religious
        liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptists have not changed since the Reformation, or the days of
        Washington. Their principles are still the same; and these principles
        bind them to the propagation of religious liberty. The very constitution
        of a Baptist church is compatible only with enjoyment of such liberty.
        It is composed of those who have exercised an intelligent choice, and
        who, in the possession of liberty to go elsewhere unmolested, have
        preferred to unite with it. Like true philanthropists they desire that
        all other&#x27;s may enjoy equal freedom with themselves. They would use
        their liberty in endeavoring to liberate others. Infant baptism they
        regard as one great source of the destruction of religious liberty; in
        laboring therefore to lead its adherents to abandon it, they are seeking
        to effect a reform which will leave the conscience free to act according
        to its own convictions of God&#x27;s requirements, which Paedobaptism
        prevents it from doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is sometimes said that these persecutions of Baptists by Protestants,
        must be attributed to the age in which they lived. How then are we to
        account for Baptists being so much in advance of the age? In contrast
        with the spirit of Zwingle, mark the sentiments expressed by Jeronimus
        Segerson, who with his wife suffered martyrdom in September, 1551, one
        by burning, and the other by drowning, for the sin of being Baptists.
        They were both in prison at the time, separated from each other.
      </p>

        &quot;We must likewise wrestle with enemies; that is, we must wrestle
        here in this world with emperors, with the powers and princes of this
        world. We must in this world suffer, for Paul has said, &#x27;that all
        who will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution.&#x27; We
        must completely conquer the world, sin, death, and the devil, not with
        material swords and spears, but with the sword of the Spirit, which is
        the Word of God, and with the shield of faith, with which we must quench
        all sharp and fiery darts, and place on our heads the helmet of
        salvation, with the armor of righteousness, and our feet be shod with
        the preparation of the Gospel. Being thus strengthened with these
        weapons, we shall oppose and overcome all our enemies.&quot;

        The same spirit has ever been manifested by Baptists. While others
        clamored for liberty and toleration when they were oppressed, and then,
        as soon as they came into power, began to oppress others—Baptists have
        claimed religious liberty for all, and have heroically suffered that all
        men might be free. Not in the age, but in the error of infant baptism,
        lies the root of state churches and religious persecutions; and only as
        Baptist influence keeps these in check, will Paedobaptism be prevented
        from bringing forth its legitimate fruit in the destruction of religious
        liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wherever Paedobaptism has had the opportunity to develop itself, it has
        always produced oppression and persecution, both in Romish and
        Protestant communities. Its direct tendency is to crush religious
        liberty, and destroy the rights of conscience. This is capable of proof,
        not merely from history, but from the very nature of the thing itself.
        Let me demonstrate this.
      </p>
      <p>
        By infant baptism a person is committed, while unconscious, to a certain
        church—he is made a member of that church. Now, unless that church is
        infallible, it has no right to make a person a member without his
        consent; for, it may commit him to an alliance with error, and to the
        defense of it. But all churches are fallible, they may err; a person who
        is made a member of such a church in infancy, may discover an error in
        that church when he arrives at maturity. Without his own consent, he has
        been committed to that error; he was not left free to choose, where it
        is evident, from the nature of things, a choice might have been
        exercised. Paedobaptism is therefore inconsistent with liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will more fully appear from the following: All Paedobaptists agree
        that there is more than one mode of baptism. They all teach, also, that
        baptism is to be administered but once to the same individual. It is
        evident, then, from their own admission, that a choice may be exercised
        as to the mode; but they administer baptism to a child, while in a state
        of unconsciousness, and, according to their own teaching that person is
        never to be baptized again, however much he may prefer another
        mode—which they all admit to be equally valid—when he is converted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multitudes find themselves thus embarrassed on arriving at maturity, and
        on experiencing conversion. They feel that their liberty has been taken
        away; and that, according to the teaching of their church, they cannot
        exercise a choice, where that very church admits that a choice might be
        made, if they were free. In order to enjoy liberty, they must of
        necessity go to the Baptists.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any should strenuously contend for only one mode of baptism, it
        should be Paedobaptists; for, they administer baptism when the subject
        knows nothing about it, and then maintain that it must not be repeated.
        They ought to be able, when the baptized child comes to years of
        understanding, to prove from the Word of God, beyond the possibility of
        a doubt, that the mode adopted by them was the only correct one.
      </p>
      <p>
        These remarks apply with equal force to the subjects of baptism. Suppose
        a Paedobaptist child is conscientiously convinced that he should be
        baptized after repentance and faith? He must either leave the church of
        which he is a member, or continue with it while he violates its
        teachings, or give up his religious liberty, and neglect his known duty.
        Numerous instances might be given to prove this. I will relate one,
        which illustrates this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. C., of Wethersfield, Connecticut, was sprinkled in infancy (neither
        of her parents being at the time professors of religion), by Rev. Dr.
        Chapin, pastor of a Paedobaptist church in that place. On arriving at
        maturity she experienced conversion, and desired to be re-sprinkled, but
        was refused. She then asked for her letter, which was also refused.
        After a long effort to persuade her to relinquish her purpose, she at
        length obtained her letter, and united with a Baptist church five miles
        away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, Paedobaptism tends to crush religious liberty, because it leads
        parents to do violence to the consciences of their children. Baptized
        children, when they are converted, frequently become Baptists in
        sentiment; but they are often forced to unite with Paedobaptist churches
        against their choice, or remain without a public profession of faith, or
        join the church of their choice at great sacrifice, and with much
        opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Roman Catholics are far more consistent in this matter than
        Protestants who pursue such a course. They are taught that to leave the
        Romish church involves the certain loss of their soul; they are
        therefore bound, in order, as they suppose, to save their children from
        perdition, to keep them from becoming Protestants. But Protestants,
        generally, admit Baptists to be correct in all that is essential to
        salvation; if they oppose the union of their children with the Baptists,
        they exhibit more bigotry than the Romanist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, religious liberty involves the right to think, examine,
        decide, and choose for ourselves in all matters between the conscience
        and its Maker. This, Baptists seek to propagate; and to this,
        Paedobaptism, both in the Romish and Protestant bodies, is opposed. In
        contending, then, for the baptism of believers only, we contend for
        man&#x27;s dearest rights—the rights of conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let Baptist principles prevail, and there will be no forcing the
        conscience, no forestalling the judgment; but man, free to act
        intelligently and understandingly, according to the light he possesses,
        will render to God voluntary obedience, none desiring to &quot;molest
        him or make him afraid.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        It was thus with the author of these Lectures. He was sprinkled in
        infancy, and made a member of the Presbyterian Church. On arriving at
        &quot;years of discretion,&quot; and on experiencing conversion, his
        mind was led to the investigation of the subjects and mode of baptism.
        He came to the conclusion that believers were the only subjects, and
        immersion the only mode. But he found that, on account of his infant
        baptism, he could not be immersed, as a believer, in the Presbyterian
        Church. For, their Confession of Faith teaches that baptism is not to be
        repeated to the same subject, and he could not ask any minister of that
        church as to deliberately violate his ordination vows, which bind him to
        sustain that Confession of Faith; neither would he have accepted
        immersion at the hands of such a one, had it been offered. But he saw at
        once that his liberty had been taken away. He looked at the children of
        Baptists, who, while they had been instructed just as religiously as
        himself, were not trammeled by an act done for them when they could make
        no choice. He saw that they were free to act as their consciences,
        enlightened by the Word of God, might dictate. He therefore acted
        consistently, and united with that sect which is &quot;everywhere spoken
        against.&quot; And the opposition of relatives, all of whom were
        Paedobaptists, only quickened his steps toward the platform of religious
        liberty—a Baptist church.
