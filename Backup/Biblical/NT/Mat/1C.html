      1. Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the
      king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying,
      Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in
      the east, and are come to worship him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King is born and now He must be acknowledged. At the same moment He
      will be assailed. His birth was in the days of another king, of Edomite
      stock, who had usurped the throne of David. The world’s kingdom is opposed
      to that of our Lord. Where Jesus is born there is sure to be a Herod in
      power. It is a marvelous thing that Magi from afar should know that a
      great king was born and should come from so great a distance to do Him
      homage, for the world’s wise men are not often found bowing at the feet of
      Jesus. When wise men seek our King, they are wise indeed. These were
      devout men to whom the stars spoke of God. An unusual luminary was
      understood by them to indicate the birth of the Coming Man for whom many
      in all lands were looking. Stars might guide us if we were willing to be
      led. Lord Jesus, make everything speak to me concerning Thee and may I be
      truly led till I find Thee!
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise men were not content with having “seen his star,” they must see
      Himself and seeing, they must adore. These were not in doubt as to His
      Godhead. They said, “We are come to worship him.” Lord, I pray Thee, make
      all the wise men to worship Thee!
    </p>
    <p>
      3. When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all
      Jerusalem with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herod is expressly called, “Herod the king.” In that capacity, he is the
      enemy of our King. They are in a sad state to whom the Savior is a
      trouble. Some, like Herod, are troubled because they fear that they shall
      lose position and honor if true religion makes progress and many have an
      undefined dread that the presence of Jesus will deprive them of pleasure
      or call them to make unwilling sacrifices. O Thou who art the King of
      heaven, Thou dost not trouble me. Thou art my joy!
    </p>
    <p>
      See the influence of one man. Herod’s trouble infects “all Jerusalem.”
      Well it might, for this cruel prince delighted in shedding blood and the
      darkness of his brow meant death to many. Unhappy Jerusalem, to be
      troubled by the birth of the Savior! Unhappy people, to whom true
      godliness is a weariness!
    </p>
    <p>
      4. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
      people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the earth-king dabbles in theology, it bodes no good to truth. Herod,
      among priests and scribes, is Herod still. Some men may become
      well-instructed in their Bibles and yet be all the worse for what they
      have discovered. Like Herod, they make ill use of what they learn or like
      these scribes, they may know much about the Lord Jesus and yet have no
      heart towards Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      5, 6. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is
      written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not
      the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a
      Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were right in their conclusion, though somewhat cloudy in their
      quotation. Jesus was to be born in the city of David, in Bethlehem, which
      is, being interpreted, “the house of bread.” Though the city was but a
      little one, His birth therein made it famous. Jesus ennobles all that He
      touches. These scribes knew where to find the text about the Savior’s
      birth and they could put their finger upon the spot in the map where He
      should be born, and yet they knew not the King, neither cared to seek Him
      out. May it never be my case, to be a master of Scriptural geography,
      prophecy, and theology, and yet to miss HIM of whom the Scripture speaks!
    </p>
    <p>
      With joy would we note the name of Governor, here given to Jesus. We are
      of the spiritual Israel if He rules us. Oh, that the day may soon come
      when the literal Israel shall behold the government laid upon His
      shoulder!
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them
      diligently what time the star appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      We delight in anxious inquirers, but here was one of a very evil sort.
      Many pry into holy things that they may ridicule or otherwise oppose them.
      What an evil diligence is this! When very private inquiries are made, we
      may suspect that something is wrong and yet it is not always so.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, truth fears not the light. Whether men inquire privily or not, we
      are ready to give them information about our Lord and about everything
      which concerns Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for
      the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I
      may come and worship him also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artful wretch! Murder was in his heart, but pious pretenses were on his
      tongue. May none of us be Herodians in hypocrisy! To promise to worship,
      and to intend to destroy, is a piece of trickery very usual in our own
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark, that the wise men never promised to return to Herod. They probably
      guessed that all this eager zeal was not quite so pure as it seemed to be
      and their silence did not mean consent. We must not believe everybody who
      makes loud professions, nor do all that they ask of us, lest we aid them
      in some evil design.
    </p>
    <p>
      9, 10. When they had heard the king they departed; and, lo, the star,
      which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over
      where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with
      exceeding great joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, “they departed,” and were wise to get out of Herod’s vile company.
      They made no compact with him. They heard his false professions and they
      went their way. The star appeared when the tyrant disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The star was probably a meteor or moving light, which having shone long
      enough in the western heavens to guide them to Judea, then ceased to be
      visible, but shone forth again as they quitted Jerusalem. We must not
      always expect to have visible signs to cheer us, but we are very glad of
      them when the Lord grants them to us. We seek not the star of inward
      feelings or outward signs, but Jesus Himself. Yet have we great joy when
      heavenly comfort shines into our souls. Lord, show me a token for good.
      This will make me glad. Show me Thyself and I will rejoice with exceeding
      great joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      See how the stars above as well as men below pay their obeisances to the
      Newborn King! My soul, be not slow to adore thy Savior! The star moved
      “till it came and stood over where the young child was.” So will my heart
      never rest till it finds out the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with
      Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had
      opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and
      frankincense, and myrrh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who look for Jesus will see Him. Those who truly see Him will
      worship Him. Those who worship Him will consecrate their substance to Him.
      The gold and spices were presented, not to Mary, but “unto him.” The wise
      men kept their caskets closed till they saw Jesus and then they opened
      their treasures. Let us keep our love and our holy service for our Lord’s
      eye and never wish to expose them to the world’s gaze. The wise men’s
      gifts were royal, with a touch of the priestly in them, “gold, and
      frankincense, and myrrh.” These choice offerings, especially the gold,
      would help Joseph and Mary to provide for the Royal Child, who was so soon
      to be exiled. God brought providers from the far East to supply the needs
      of His Son. “Remember that Omnipotence has servants everywhere.” Before
      the babe starts for Egypt, Oriental sages must pay His charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord, thou shalt have my worship and my gifts, for Thou art the sole
      Monarch of my soul and I will aid Thy missionary cause that when Thou
      goest into Africa with Thy Gospel, my gifts may go with Thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
      Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably, they half suspected Herod already and the Lord by a dream led
      their thoughts further in the same direction. Wise men need to be “warned
      of God.” When they are so, they alter their minds at once. Though they had
      planned to return by one route, they took another. They did not linger,
      but “departed into their own country another way.” Oh, that I may never be
      disobedient to a hint from the throne! “Thou shalt guide me with thy
      counsel.”
