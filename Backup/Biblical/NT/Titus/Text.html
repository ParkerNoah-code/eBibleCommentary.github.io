        1.1-4. Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according
        to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth which
        is according to godliness, in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t
        lie, promised before time began; but in his own time revealed his word
        in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment
        of God our Savior, to Titus, my true child according to a common faith:
        Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
        our Savior.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.5-9. I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order
        the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I
        directed you— if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having
        children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.
        For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing,
        not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for
        dishonest gain; but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded,
        fair, holy, self-controlled, holding to the faithful word which is
        according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound
        doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.10-16. For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers,
        especially those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped: men
        who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for
        dishonest gain’s sake. One of them, a prophet of their own, said,
        “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.” This
        testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may
        be sound in the faith, not paying attention to Jewish fables and
        commandments of men who turn away from the truth. To the pure, all
        things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing
        is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. They
        profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being
        abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.1-5. But say the things which fit sound doctrine, that older men
        should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love,
        and in perseverance, and that older women likewise be reverent in
        behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that
        which is good, that they may train the young wives to love their
        husbands, to love their children, to be sober minded, chaste, workers at
        home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word
        may not be blasphemed.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.6-8. Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded. In all
        things show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show
        integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, and soundness of speech that
        can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no
        evil thing to say about us.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.9-14. Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to
        be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, not stealing, but
        showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our
        Savior, in all things. For the grace of God has appeared, bringing
        salvation to all men, instructing us to the intent that, denying
        ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and
        godly in this present age; looking for the blessed hope and appearing of
        the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself
        for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself
        a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.15. Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no
        one despise you.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.1-7. Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to
        be obedient, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one,
        not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all
        men. For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving
        various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and
        hating one another. But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love
        toward mankind appeared, not by works of righteousness which we did
        ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing
        of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on
        us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior; that being justified by his
        grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.8-11. This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire
        that you insist confidently, so that those who have believed God may be
        careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to
        men; but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes
        about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. Avoid a factious man
        after a first and second warning, knowing that such a one is perverted
        and sinful, being self-condemned.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.12-14. When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to
        me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. Send Zenas the
        lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be
        lacking for them. Let our people also learn to maintain good works to
        meet necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.15. All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith.
      </p>
      <p>Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
