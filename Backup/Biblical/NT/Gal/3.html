    <p>
      Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before
      whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you as crucified? I
      just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works
      of the law, or by hearing of faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun in
      the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh? Did you suffer so many
      things in vain, if it is indeed in vain? He therefore who supplies the
      Spirit to you and does miracles among you, does he do it by the works of
      the law, or by hearing of faith? Even so, Abraham “believed God, and it
      was counted to him for righteousness.” Know therefore that those who are
      of faith are children of Abraham. The Scripture, foreseeing that God would
      justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to
      Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.” So then, those
      who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.
    </p>
    <p>
      For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is
      written, “Cursed is everyone who doesn’t continue in all things that are
      written in the book of the law, to do them.” Now that no man is justified
      by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”
      The law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for
      us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,” that the
      blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, that
      we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet
      when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void or adds to it. Now the
      promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. He doesn’t say, “To
      descendants”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”, which is
      Christ. Now I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ,
      the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as
      to make the promise of no effect. For if the inheritance is of the law, it
      is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then why is there the law? It was added because of transgressions, until
      the offspring should come to whom the promise has been made. It was
      ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator is not
      between one, but God is one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there
      had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness
      would have been of the law. But the Scripture imprisoned all things under
      sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for
      the faith which should afterwards be revealed. So that the law has become
      our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But
      now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. For you are all
      children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were
      baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek,
      there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for
      you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you are Christ’s, then you are
      Abraham’s offspring and heirs according to promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a
      bondservant, though he is lord of all, but is under guardians and stewards
      until the day appointed by the father. So we also, when we were children,
      were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world. But when
      the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born
      under the law, that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we
      might receive the adoption as children. And because you are children, God
      sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”
      So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir
      of God through Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by
      nature are not gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather to
      be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable
      elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?
      You observe days, months, seasons, and years. I am afraid for you, that I
      might have wasted my labor for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are.
      You did me no wrong, but you know that because of weakness in the flesh I
      preached the Good News to you the first time. That which was a temptation
      to you in my flesh, you didn’t despise nor reject; but you received me as
      an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible,
      you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. So then, have I
      become your enemy by telling you the truth? They zealously seek you in no
      good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them. But it
      is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am
      present with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed
      in you— but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my
      tone, for I am perplexed about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don’t you listen to the law?
      For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant, and one
      by the free woman. However, the son by the servant was born according to
      the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise. These
      things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount
      Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar. For this Hagar is
      Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for
      she is in bondage with her children. But the Jerusalem that is above is
      free, which is the mother of us all. For it is written,
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rejoice, you barren who don’t bear. Break out and shout, you who don’t
      travail. For the desolate women have more children than her who has a
      husband.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise. But as then, he
      who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according
      to the Spirit, so also it is now. However, what does the Scripture say?
      “Throw out the servant and her son, for the son of the servant will not
      inherit with the son of the free woman.” So then, brothers, we are not
      children of a servant, but of the free woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and
      don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will
      profit you nothing. Yes, I testify again to every man who receives
      circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law. You are alienated
      from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen
      away from grace. For we through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of
      righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
      amounts to anything, but faith working through love.
    </p>
    <p>
      You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey
      the truth? This persuasion is not from him who calls you. A little yeast
      grows through the whole lump. I have confidence toward you in the Lord
      that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his
      judgment, whoever he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still
      persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed. I wish
      that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.
