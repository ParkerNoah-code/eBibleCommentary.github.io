      1. When we make application to God for any especial grace or mercy, it is
      our duty to direct and fix our faith on such names, titles, or properties
      of God, as whereunto that grace doth particularly relate, and from whence
      it doth immediately proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. If this be the title of God, if this be his glory, that he is the God
      of peace, how excellent and glorious is that peace from whence he is so
      denominated, â€” which is principally the peace which we have with himself
      by Jesus Christ!
    </p>
    <p>
      3. As every thing that is evil to mankind, within them and amongst them,
      both with reference to things temporal and eternal, proceeds from our
      original loss of peace with God by sin, and by the enmity which ensued
      thereon; so peace, on the other side, is comprehensive of all kinds of
      good, both here and hereafter: and God being styled the God of peace
      declares him to be the only fountain and cause of all that is good to us
      in every kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. All the work of God towards Jesus Christ respected him as the head of
      the church, as our Lord and Savior.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The safety, security, and consolation of the church much depend on this
      greatness of its Shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. On this relation of Christ to the church it lives and is preserved in
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The bringing back of our Lord Jesus Christ, as the Shepherd of the
      sheep, from the state of the dead, through the blood of the covenant, is
      the great pledge and assurance of peace with God, or the effecting of that
      peace which the God of peace had designed for the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The reduction of Christ from the dead by the God of peace, is the
      spring and foundation of all dispensations and communications of grace to
      the church, or of all the effects of the atonement and purchase made by
      his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. All legal sacrifices issued in blood and death; there was no recovery
      of any of them from that state.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. There is, then, a blessed foundation laid of the communication of
      grace and mercy to the church, to the eternal glory of God.
