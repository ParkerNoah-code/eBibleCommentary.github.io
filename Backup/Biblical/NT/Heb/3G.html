    <h2>G. Redemption by Christ's Blood (9:11-14)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 11.
      <em
        >But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things,
        through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
        that is to say, not of this creation,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The bringing forth and accomplishing the glorious effects of the hidden
      wisdom of God, were the true and real good things intended for and
      promised to the church from the beginning of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. These things alone are absolutely good to the church, all other things
      are good or evil as they are used or abused.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. So excellent are these good things, that the performance and procuring
      of them were the cause of the coming of the Son of God, with his
      susception and discharge of his sacerdotal office.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Such a price and value did God put on these things, so good are they in
      his eyes, that he made them the subject of his promises to the church from
      the foundation of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The human nature of Christ, wherein he discharged the duties of his
      sacerdotal office, in making atonement for sin, is the greatest, the most
      perfect, and excellent ordinance of God, far excelling those that were
      most excellent under the old testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The Son of God undertaking to be the high priest of the church, it was
      of necessity that he should come by or have a tabernacle wherein to
      discharge that office.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. God is so far from being obliged unto any means tot the effecting of
      the holy counsels of his will, that he can when he pleaseth exceed the
      whole order and course of the first creation of all things, and his
      providence in the rule thereof.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 12.
      <em
        >nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own
        blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained
        eternal redemption.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The entrance of our Lord Jesus Christ as our high priest into heaven,
      to appear in the presence of God for us, and to save us thereby to the
      uttermost, was a thing so great and glorious as could not be accomplished
      but by his own blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Whatever difficulties lay in the way of Christ, as unto the
      accomplishment and perfection of the work of our redemption, he would not
      decline them, nor desist from his undertaking, whatever it cost him.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There was a holy place meet to receive the Lord Christ after the
      sacrifice of himself, and a suitable reception for such a person after so
      glorious a performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. If the Lord Christ entered not into the holy place until he had
      finished his work, we may not expect an entrance thereinto until we have
      finished ours.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 13-14.
      <em
        >For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer
        sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the
        flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
        Spirit offered himself without defect to God, cleanse your conscience
        from dead works to serve the living God?</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There is such an evidence of wisdom and righteousness, unto a spiritual
      eye, in the whole mystery of our redemption, sanctification, and salvation
      by Christ, as gives an immovable foundation unto faith to rest upon in its
      receiving of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The efficacy of all the offices of Christ towards the church depends on
      the dignity of his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There is nothing more destructive to the whole faith of the gospel than
      by any means to evacuate the immediate efficacy of the blood of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Christ’s offering himself was the greatest expression of his
      inexpressible love.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is evident how vain and insufficient are all other ways of the
      expiation of sin with the purging of our consciences before God.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Faith hath ground of triumph in the certain efficacy of the blood of
      Christ for the expiation of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Nothing could expiate sin and free conscience from dead works but the
      blood of Christ alone, and that in the offering himself to God through the
      eternal Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It was God, as the supreme ruler and lawgiver, with whom atonement for
      sin was to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The souls and consciences of men are wholly polluted before they are
      purged by the blood of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Even the best works of men, antecedently to the purging of their
      consciences by the blood of Christ, are but dead works.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Justification and sanctification are inseparably conjoined in the
      design of God’s grace by the blood of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Gospel worship is such, in its spirituality and holiness, as becometh
      the living God.
