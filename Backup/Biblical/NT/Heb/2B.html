    <h2>B. Take Heed lest you Fall (3:12-19)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 12.
      <em
        >Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there might be in any one of you an evil
        heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;</em
      >

    <p>
      1. There is a need of great care, heedfulness, watchfulness, and
      circumspection, for a due continuance in our profession, to the glory of
      God and advantage of our own souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Godly jealousy concerning, and watchfulness over the whole body, that
      no beginnings of backslidings from Christ and the gospel be found amongst
      them, is the duty of all churches, of all believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is the duty of every individual believer to be intent on all
      occasions, lest at any time, or by any means, there should be found in him
      an evil heart of unbelief. Unbelief rejects the peculiar doctrines of the
      gospel; such as,
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) That Jesus of Nazareth, poor and despised as he was in the world, was
      the Son of God, the Savior of the world, and is both Lord and Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) That by the obedience, death, and blood-shedding of this same Jesus,
      who was crucified and slain, are redemption, forgiveness of sins,
      deliverance from the wrath to come, righteousness, and acceptation with
      God, to be obtained, and by him only.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) That the way and means whereby forgiveness of sin, righteousness, and
      acceptance with God for sinners, is obtained by this Jesus Christ, is,
      that by the sacrifice of himself, his death, and blood-shedding, with the
      punishment for sin which he voluntarily underwent, God was atoned, his
      justice satisfied, and his law fulfilled; and that because he had ordered,
      in his infinite wisdom and sovereignty, with the will and consent of
      Christ himself, to charge all the sin of the all the elect upon him, and
      to accept of his obedience for them, he undertaking to be their Surety and
      Redeemer.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The root of all backsliding, of all apostasy, whether it be notional or
      practical, partial or total, lies in unbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The malignity and venom of sin is apt to hide itself under many, under
      any shades and pretences.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The best way to antidote the soul against sin, is to represent it unto
      the mind in its true nature and tendency.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Whoever departs from the observance of the gospel and the insitutions
      thereof, doth in so doing depart from the living God.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. When a heart is made evil by unbelief, it is engaged in a course of
      sinful defection, of revolt from the living God.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 13.
      <em
        >but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”,
        lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Sedulous mutual exhortation is an eminent means to obviate and prevent
      the design of the deceitfulness of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Gospel duties have an effectual efficacy attending them in their
      special seasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. We have but an uncertain season for the due performance of most certain
      duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The deceit which is in sin, and which is inseparable from it, tends
      continually to the hardening of the heart.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 14.
      <em
        >For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our
        confidence firm to the end,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Union with Christ is the principle and measure of all spiritual
      enjoyments and expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Constancy and steadfastness in believing is the great touchstone,
      trial, and evidence of union with Christ, or a participation of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) There are many appearing evidences of union with Christ that may and
      do fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) There may be certain and undeceiving evidences of a present
      participation of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) No grace, no sign or mark, will any longer or any further be an
      evidence or testimony in this matter, but only as the soul is effectually
      influenced unto perseverance thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Perseverance is an evidence of union in that it is an effect of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Whatever profession hath been made by any, whatever fruits of it have
      been brought forth, whatever continuance in it there hath been, if it fail
      totally, it is sufficient evidence that those who have made it were never
      partakers of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Persistency in our subsistence in Christ unto the end is a matter of
      great endeavor and diligence, and that unto all believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Not only our profession and existence in Christ, but the gracious
      beginnings of it also, are to be secured with great spiritual care and
      industry.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 15.
      <em
        >while it is said, “Today if you will hear his voice, don’t harden your
        hearts, as in the rebellion.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. That every circumstance of the Scripture is instructive.</p>
    <p>2. God hath filled the Scripture with truth.</p>
    <h2>
      Ver 16.
      <em
        >For who, when they heard, rebelled? Wasn’t it all those who came out of
        Egypt led by Moses?</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Many hear the word or voice of God to no advantage, but only to
      aggravate their sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In the most general and visible apostasies of the church, God still
      preserves a remnant unto himself, to bear witness unto him and for him by
      their faith and obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. God lays a few, ofttimes a very few, of his secret ones in the balance
      against the greatest multitude of rebels and transgressors.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 17.
      <em
        >With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who
        sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. God is not displeased with any thing in his people but sin.</p>
    <p>2. Public sins, sins in societies, are great provocations of God.</p>
    <p>
      3. God sometimes will make men who have been wickedly exemplary in sin
      righteously examplary in their punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Great destructions in a way of judgment and vengeance are institute
      representations of the judgment and vengeance to come.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 18.
      <em
        >To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to
        those who were disobedient?</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. All unbelief is accompanied with contumacy and rebellion.</p>
    <p>
      2. Unbelief not only justifies but glorifies the greatest severities of
      God against them in whom it prevails.
    </p>
    <p>3. The oath of God is engaged against no sins but unbelief.</p>
    <h2>
      Ver 19.
      <em>We see that they weren’t able to enter in because of unbelief.</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Whatever we consider in sin, God principally considers the root and
      spring of it in unbelief, as that which maketh the most direct and
      immediate opposition unto himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Unbelief is the most direct and immediate root and cause of all
      provoking sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. To disbelieve God with respect unto any special design of glorifying
      himself, is the greatest and highest provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Unbelief deprives men of all interest in or right unto the promises of
      God.
    </p>
    <p>5. No unbeliever shall ever enter into the rest of God.</p>
