    <h2>A. Disciplined and Holy (12:4-17)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em>You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The proportioning the degrees of sufferings, and the disposal of them
      as unto times and seasons, is in the hand of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is highly dishonorable to faint in the cause of Christ and the
      gospel under lesser sufferings, when we know there are greater to be
      undergone by ourselves and others on the same account.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Signal diligence and watchfulness is required in our profession of the
      gospel, considering what enemy we have to conflict withal.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is an honorable warfare, to be engaged against such an enemy as sin
      is.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Though the world cannot, or will not, yet Christians can distinguish
      between resisting the authority of men, whereof they are unjustly accused,
      and the resistance of sin, under a pretense of that authority, by refusing
      a compliance with it.
    </p>
    <p>6. There is no room for sloth or negligence in this conflict.</p>
    <p>
      7. They do but deceive themselves who hope to preserve their faith, in
      times of trial, without the utmost watchful diligence against the assaults
      and impressions of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The vigor of our minds, in the constant exercise of spiritual strength,
      is required hereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Without this we shall be surprised, wounded, and at last destroyed by
      our enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. They that would abide faithful in their profession in times of trial
      ought constantly to bear in mind and be armed against the worst of evils
      that they may be called unto on the account thereof.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em
        >You have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with
        children, “My son, don’t take lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor
        faint when you are reproved by him;</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. This is a blessed effect of divine wisdom, that the sufferings which we
      undergo from men for the profession of the gospel shall be also
      chastisements of love from God, to our spiritual advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The gospel never requires our suffering, but if we examine ourselves we
      shall find that we stand in need of the divine chastisement in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. When, by the wisdom of God, we can discern that what we suffer on the
      one hand is for the glory of God and the gospel, and on the other is
      necessary to our own sanctification, we shall be prevailed with to
      patience and perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Where there is sincerity in faith and obedience, let not men despond if
      they find themselves called to suffer for the gospel when they seem to be
      unfit and unprepared for it, seeing it is the design of God by those
      sufferings, whereunto they are called on a public account, to purify and
      cleanse them from their present evil frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The want of a diligent consideration of the provision that God hath
      made in the Scripture for our encouragement to duty and comfort under
      difficulties is a sinful forgetfulness, and is of dangerous consequence to
      our souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Usually God gives to believers the most evident pledges of their
      adoption when they are in their sufferings and under their afflictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It is a tender case to be under troubles and afflictions, which
      requires our utmost diligence, watchfulness, and care about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. When God’s chastisements in our troubles and afflictions are reproofs
      also, when he gives us a sense in them of his displeasure against our
      sins, and we are reproved by him, yet even then he requires of us that we
      should not faint nor despond, but cheerfully apply ourselves unto his mind
      and calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. A sense of God’s displeasure against our sins, and of his reproving us
      for them, is consistent with an evidence of our adoption, yea, may be an
      evidence of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. A due consideration of this sacred truth, namely, that all our
      troubles, persecutions, and afflictions, are divine chastisements and
      reproofs, whereby God evidenceth unto us our adoption, and that he
      instructs us for our advantage, is an effectual means to preserve us in
      patience and perseverance unto the end of our trials.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6.
      <em
        >for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and chastises every son whom
        he receives.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. In all our afflictions, the resignation of ourselves unto the sovereign
      pleasure, infinite wisdom, and goodness of God, is the only means or way
      of preserving us from fainting, weariness, or neglect of duty.
    </p>
    <p>2. Love is antecedent unto chastening.</p>
    <p>3. Chastising is an effect of his love.</p>
    <p>
      4. Unto chastisement is required that the person chastised be in a state
      wherein there is sin, or that he be a sinner.
    </p>
    <p>5. Divine love and chastening are inseparable.</p>
    <p>
      6. Where chastisement evidenceth itself (as it doth many ways, with
      respect unto God the author of it, and those that are chastised) not to be
      penal, it is a broad seal set to the patent of our adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. This being the way and manner of God’s dealing with his children, there
      is all the reason in the world why we should acquiesce in his sovereign
      wisdom therein, and not faint under his chastisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. No particular person hath any reason to complain of his portion in
      chastisement, seeing this is the way of God’s dealing with all his
      children.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with
        children, for what son is there whom his father doesn’t discipline?</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Afflictions or chastisements are no pledges of our adoption, but when
      and where they are endured with patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is the internal frame of heart and mind under chastisements that
      lets in and receives a sense of God’s design and intention towards us in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. This way of dealing becomes the relation between God and believers, as
      father and children, — namely, that he should chastise, and they should
      bear it patiently.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 8.
      <em
        >But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made
        partakers, then you are illegitimate, and not children.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There are no sons of God, no real partakers of adoption, that are
      without some crosses or chastisements in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is an act of spiritual wisdom, in all our troubles to find out and
      discern divine paternal chastisements; without which we shall never behave
      ourselves well under them, nor obtain any advantage by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There are in the visible church, or among professors, some that have no
      right unto the heavenly inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The joyous state of freedom from affliction is such as we ought always
      to watch over with great jealousy, lest it should be a leaving of us out
      of the discipline of the family of God.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 9-10.
      <em
        >Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid
        them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of
        spirits and live? For they indeed for a few days disciplined us as
        seemed good to them, but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of
        his holiness.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is the duty of parents to chastise their children, if need be, and
      of children to submit thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is good for us to have had the experience of a reverential
      submission unto paternal chastisements, as from thence we may be convinced
      of the equity and necessity of submission unto God in all our afflictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. No man can understand the benefit of divine chastisement who
      understands not the excellency of a participation of God’s holiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. If under chastisements we find not an increase of holiness in some
      especial instances or degrees, they are utterly lost; we have nothing but
      the trouble and sorrow of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. There can be no greater pledge nor evidence of divine love in
      afflictions than this, that God designs by them to make us partakers of
      his holiness, to bring us nearer to him, and make us more like him.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 11.
      <em
        >All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet
        afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who
        have been trained by it.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. When God designeth any thing as a chastisement, it is in vain to
      endeavor to keep off a sense of it; it shall be a matter of sorrow to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Not to take in a sense of sorrow in affliction is, through stout-
      heartedness, to despise the chastening of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The sorrow which accompanies chastisement is that which the apostle
      terms κατὰ λύπη, 2 Cor 7:9-10.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The nature and end of afflictions are not to be measured by our present
      sense of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. All the trouble of afflictions is but for the present, at most but for
      the little while which we are to continue in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Those who cannot see an excellency in the abounding of the fruits of
      righteousness can never apprehend that there is either good or benefit in
      chastisements.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. We can never find any benefit in chastisements unless we are exercised
      by them; that is, unless all our graces are stirred up by them to a
      constant holy exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It is the fruit of righteousness alone that will bring in peace to us,
      that will give us a sense of peace with God, peace in ourselves and with
      others, so far as is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Grace in afflictions will at length prevail quietly to compose the mind
      under the storm raised by them, and give rest with peace to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Herein lies the wisdom of faith in this matter, not to pass a judgment
      on chastisements from the present sense we have of what is evil and
      dolorous in them, but from their end and use, which are blessed and
      glorious.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 12-13.
      <em
        >Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees, and
        make straight paths for your feet, so what is lame may not be
        dislocated, but rather be healed.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is the duty of all faithful ministers of the gospel to consider
      diligently what failures or temptations their flocks are liable or exposed
      to, so as to apply suitable means for their preservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Despondency is the great evil which, in all our sufferings and
      afflictions, we are with all intension of mind to watch against.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. We do well to pity men who are weary and fainting in their courage and
      under their burdens; but we are to be no way gentle towards ourselves in
      our spiritual weariness and decays, because we have continued supplies of
      strength ready for us, if we use them in a due manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. This exhortation is given us in a peculiar manner, namely, that we
      ought to confirm our minds against all discouragements and despondencies
      under our sufferings and afflictions by the consideration of God’s design
      in them, and the blessed success which he will give to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The recovery of this frame, or the restoration of our spiritual hands
      and knees to their former vigor, is by stirring up all grace to its due
      exercise, which is torpid and desponding under sloth in this frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is our duty not only to be found in the ways of God in general, but
      to take care that we walk carefully, circumspectly, uprightly, and
      diligently in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. To make halts or baulks in our way of profession, or crooked paths, in
      neglect of duty, or by compliances with the world in times of trial and
      persecution, is an evidence of an evil frame of heart, and of a dangerous
      state or condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. A hesitation or doubtfulness in or about important doctrines of truth
      will make men lame, weak, and infirm in their profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Those who are so are disposed to a total defection from the truth, and
      are ready on all occasions to go out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Every vicious habit of mind, every defect in light or neglect of duty,
      every want of stirring up grace unto exercise, will make men lame and halt
      in profession, and easy to be turned aside with difficulties and
      oppositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. When we see persons in such a state, it is our duty to be very careful
      so to behave ourselves as not to give any occasion to their further
      miscarriages, but rather to endeavor their healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The best way whereby this may be done, is by making visible and plain
      to them our own faith, resolution, courage, and constancy, in a way of
      obedience becoming the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The negligent walking of those professors who are sound in the faith,
      their weakness and pusillanimity in times of trial, their want of making
      straight paths to their feet in visible holiness, is a great means of
      turning aside those that are lame, weak, and halting.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. It is good to deal with and endeavor the healing of such lame halters,
      whilst they are yet in the way.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 14.
      <em
        >Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which
        no man will see the Lord,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. A frame and disposition of seeking peace with all men is eminently
      suited unto the doctrine and grace of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. They are much mistaken in the Lord Christ, who hope to see him
      hereafter in glory, and who yet live and die here in an unholy state.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. If this doctrine be true, that “without holiness no man shall see the
      Lord,” the case will be hard at last with a multitude of popes, cardinals,
      and prelates, who pretend that they have the opening of the door into his
      presence committed unto them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. We may follow peace with men, and not attain it; but if we follow
      holiness, we shall as assuredly see the Lord as without it we shall come
      short of this enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The same means is to be used for the securing of our present
      perseverance and of our future blessedness, namely, holiness.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 15.
      <em
        >looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of
        God, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and many be
        defiled by it,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The grace, love, and good-will of God, in the adoption, justification,
      sanctification, and glorification of believers, is proposed unto all in
      the gospel, as that which may infallibly be attained in the due use of the
      means thereunto appointed, namely, sincere faith in Christ Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The outward profession of the gospel, with the performance of the
      duties and enjoyment of the privileges thereunto belonging, will not of
      themselves instate any man in the grace of God, or in an assured interest
      therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There is no man who, under the profession of the gospel, comes short of
      obtaining the grace and favor of God, but it is by reason of himself and
      his own sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Negligence and sloth, missing of opportunities, and love of sin, all
      proceeding from unbelief, are the only causes why men, under the
      profession of the gospel, do fail of the grace of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The root of apostasy from God and the profession of the gospel may
      abide invisibly in professing churches.
    </p>
    <p>6. Spiritual evils in churches are progressive.</p>
    <p>
      7. It is the duty of churches, what in them lies, to prevent their own
      trouble as well as the ruin of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. There is a latent disposition in negligent professors to receive
      infection by spiritual defilements, if they are not watched against.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Church inspection is a blessed ordinance and duty, which is designed by
      Christ himself as a means to prevent these contagious evils in churches.

      1. That church which tolerates in its communion men living in such gross
      sins as fornication has utterly, as unto its discipline, departed from the
      rule of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>2. Apostatizing professors are prone to sins of uncleanness.</p>
    <p>
      3. Evil examples proposed in Scripture light, divested of all colors and
      pretences, laid open in their roots and causes, are efficacious warnings
      unto believers to abstain from all occasions leading unto the like evils,
      and much more from the evils themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Where there is in any a latent predominant principle of profaneness, a
      sudden temptation or trial will let it out unto the greatest evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. This principle of profaneness, in preferring the morsels of this world
      before the birthright privileges of the church, is that which at this day
      threatens the present ruin of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The example of Esau cuts off all hopes from outward privileges, where
      there is an inward profaneness of heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Profane apostates have a limited season only wherein the recovery of
      the blessing is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The severity of God in dealing with apostates is a blessed ordinance
      for the preservation of them that believe, and the edification of the
      whole church.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Sin may be the occasion of great sorrow, where there is no sorrow for
      sin, as it was with Esau.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. No man knows whereunto a deliberate sin may lead him, nor what will be
      the event of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Profaneness and despising spiritual privileges is a sin that God at
      one time or other will testify his severity against.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Steadfastness in faith, with submission unto the will of God, will
      establish the soul in those duties which are most irksome unto flesh and
      blood.
