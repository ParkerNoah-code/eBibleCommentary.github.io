    <h2>G. Faith: Seeking a Homeland (11:13-16)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 13.
      <em
        >These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having
        seen them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they
        were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</em

    <p>
      1. It is the glory of true faith that it will not leave them in whom it
      is, that it will not cease its actings for their support and comfort in
      their dying, when the hope of the hypocrite doth perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The life of faith doth eminently manifest itself in death, when all
      other reliefs and supports do fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That is the crowning act of faith, the great trial of its vigor and
      wisdom, namely, in what it doth in our dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Hence it is that many of the saints, both of old and of late, have
      evidenced the most triumphant actings of faith in the approach of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The due understanding of the whole old testament, with the nature of
      the faith and obedience of all the saints under it, depends on this one
      truth, that they believed things that were not yet actually exhibited nor
      enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. God would have the church, from the beginning of the world, to live on
      promises not actually accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. We may receive the promises, as to the comfort and benefit of them,
      when we do not actually receive the things promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. As our privileges in the enjoyment of the promises are above theirs
      under the old testament, so our faith, thankfulness, and obedience, ought
      to excel theirs also.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. No distance of time or place can weaken faith as unto the
      accomplishment of divine promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Quiet waiting for the accomplishment of promises at a great distance,
      and which most probably will not be in our days, is an eminent fruit of
      faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. This firm persuasion of the truth of God in the accomplishment of his
      promises unto us, upon a discovery of their worth and excellency, is the
      second act of faith, wherein the life of it doth principally consist.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. This avowed renunciation of all other things beside Christ in the
      promise, and the good-will of God in him, as to the repose of any trust or
      confidence in them for our rest and satisfaction, is an eminent act of
      that faith whereby we walk with God.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 14.
      <em
        >For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a
        country of their own.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is the genuine and proper way of interpreting the Scripture, when
      from the words themselves, considered with relation unto the persons
      speaking them, and to all their circumstances, we declare what was their
      determinate mind and sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. It is in the nature of faith to mortify not only corrupt and sinful
      lusts, but our natural affections, and their most vehement inclinations,
      though in themselves innocent, if they are any way uncompliant with duty
      of obedience to the commands of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. When the hearts and minds of believers are fixed on things spiritual
      and heavenly, it will take them off from inordinate cleaving to things
      otherwise greatly desirable.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 15.
      <em
        >If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went

      >

      Ver 16.
      <em
        >But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one.
        Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has

      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. To avow openly in the world, by our ways, walking, and living, with a
      constant public profession, that our portion and inheritance is not in it,
      but in things invisible, in heaven above, is an illustrious act and fruit
      of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Faith looks on heaven as the country of believers, a glorious country,
      an eternal rest and habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. In all the groans of burdened souls under their present trials, there
      is included a fervent desire after heaven, and the enjoyment of God
      therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. This is the greatest privilege, honor, advantage, and security that any
      can be made partakers of, that God will bear the name and title of their
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Godâ€™s owning of believers as his, and of himself to be their God, is an
      abundant recompense for all the hardships which they undergo in their
      pilgrimage.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Divine wisdom hath so ordered the relation between God and the church,
      that that which is in itself an infinite condescension in God, and a
      reproach unto him in the wicked, idolatrous world, should also be his
      glory and honor, wherein he is well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Where God, in a way of sovereign grace, so infinitely condescends as to
      take any into covenant with himself, so as that he may be justly styled
      their God, he will make them to be such as shall be a glory to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. We may see the woful condition of them who are ashamed to be called his
      people, and make that name a term of reproach unto others.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Eternal rest and glory are made sure for all believers in the eternal
      purpose of the will of God, and his actual preparation of them by grace.
