    <p>
      1. Every circumstance in suffering shall add to the glory of the sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. We are to serve God with the best that we have, the best that is in our
      power, with the best of our spiritual abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. God gives no consequential approbation of any duties of believers, but
      where the principle of a living faith goes previously in their
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Our persons must be first justified, before our works of obedience can
      be accepted with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. They whom God approves must expect that the world will disapprove them,
      and ruin them if it can.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Where there is a difference within, in the hearts of men, on the
      account of faith or the want of it, there will for the most part be
      unavoidable differences about outward worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. God’s approbation is an abundant recompense for the loss of our lives
    </p>
    <p>8. There is a voice in all innocent blood shed by violence.</p>
    <p>
      9. Whatever troubles faith may engage us into in the profession of it,
      with obedience according to the mind of God, it will bring us safely off
      from them all at last (yea, though we should die in the cause), unto our
      eternal salvation and honor.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em
        >By faith Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn’t see death, and he
        was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony
        given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to
        God.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Whatever be the outward different events of faith in believers in this
      world, they are all alike accepted with God, approved by him, and shall
      all equally enjoy the eternal inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. God can and doth put a great difference, as unto outward things,
      between such as are equally accepted before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There is no such acceptable service unto God, none that he hath set
      such signal pledges of his favor upon, as zealously to contend against the
      world in giving witness to his ways, his worship, and his kingdom, or the
      rule of Christ over all.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is a part of our testimony to declare and witness that vengeance is
      prepared for ungodly persecutors, and all sorts of impenitent sinners,
      however they are and may be provoked thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The principal part of this testimony consists in our own personal
      obedience, or visible walking with God in holy obedience, according to the
      tenor of the covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. As it is an effect of the wisdom of God to dispose the works of his
      providence and the accomplishment of his promises according to an ordinary
      established rule, declared in his word, which is the only guide of faith,
      so sometimes it pleases him to give extraordinary instances in each kind,
      both in a way of judgment and in a way of grace and favor. 7. Faith in God
      through Christ hath an efficacy in the procuring of such grace, mercy, and
      favor in particular, as it hath no ground in particular to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. They must walk with God here who design to live with him hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. That faith which can translate a man out of this world, can carry him
      through the difficulties which he may meet withal in the profession of
      faith and obedience in this world.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6.
      <em
        >Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who
        comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of
        those who seek him.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Where God hath put an impossibility upon any thing, it is in vain for
      men to attempt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is of the highest importance to examine well into the sincerity of
      our faith, whether it be of the true kind or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. God himself in his self-sufficiency and his all-sufficiency, meet to
      act towards poor sinners in a way of bounty, is the first motive or
      encouragement unto, and the last object of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. They who seek God only according to the light of nature do but feel
      after him in the dark, and they shall never find him as a rewarder.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. They who seek him according to the law of works, and by the best of
      their obedience thereunto, shall never find him as a rewarder, nor attain
      that which they seek after.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is the most proper act of faith to come and cleave to God as a
      rewarder in the way of grace and bounty, as proposing himself for our
      reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. That faith is vain which doth not put men on a diligent inquiry after
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The whole issue of our finding of God when we seek him depends on the
      way and rule which we take and use in our so doing.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >By faith Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly
        fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he
        condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is
        according to faith.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is a high commendation to faith, to believe things on the word of
      God that in themselves and all second causes are invisible, and seem
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. No obstacle can stand in the way of faith, when it fixeth itself on the
      almighty power of God and his infinite veracity.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is a great encouragement and strengthening unto faith, when the
      things which it believes as promised or threatened are suitable unto the
      properties of the divine nature, his righteousness, holiness, goodness,
      and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The destruction of the world, when it was filled with wickedness and
      violence, is a pledge of the certain accomplishment of all divine
      threatenings against ungodly sinners and enemies of the church, though the
      time of it may be yet far distant, and the means of it may not be evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. A reverential fear of God, as threatening vengeance unto impenitent
      sinners, is a fruit of saving faith and acceptable unto God.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is one thing to fear God as threatening, with a holy reverence,
      another to be afraid of the evil threatened, merely as it is penal and
      destructive.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Faith produceth various effects in the minds of believers, according to
      the variety of objects that it is fixed on; sometimes joy and confidence,
      sometimes fear and reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Then is fear a fruit of faith, when it engageth us into diligence in
      our duty.
    </p>
    <p>9. Many things tend to the commendation of the faith of Noah.</p>
    <p>
      10. In the destruction of the old world we have an eminent figure of the
      state of impenitent sinners, and of God’s dealing with them, in all ages,
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The visible professing church shall never fall into such an apostasy,
      nor be so totally destroyed, but that God will preserve a remnant for a
      seed to future generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Those whom God calleth unto, fitteth for, and employeth in any work,
      are therein συνεργοί θεοῦ, — “co-workers with God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Let those that are employed in the declaration of God’s promises and
      threatenings take heed unto themselves to answer the will of him by whom
      they are employed, whose work it is wherein they are engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. It ought to be a motive unto diligence in exemplary obedience, that
      therein we bear testimony for God against the impenitent world, which he
      will judge and punish.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. All right unto spiritual privileges and mercies is by gratuitous
      adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. The righteousness of faith is the best inheritance, for thereby we
      become heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ.
