    <p>
      1. No divine truth ought in its delivery to be passed by, without
      manifesting its use, and endeavoring its improvement unto holiness and
      obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In times of temptations and trials, arguments and exhortations unto
      watchfulness against sin, and constancy in obedience, are to be multiplied
      in number, and pressed with wisdom, earnestness, and diligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Exhortations unto duty ought to be built on a stable foundation, and to
      be resolved into an authority which may influence the consciences of them
      to whom they do belong.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. What was given by inspiration from the Holy Ghost, and is recorded in
      the Scripture for the use of the church, is of all our obedience consists
      in its relation to the voice or authority of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Every thing in the commands of God, relating unto the manner of their
      giving out and communicating unto us, is to be retained in our minds, and
      considered as present unto us.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Consideration and choice are a stable and permanent foundation of
      obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Such is the nature, efficacy, and power of the voice or word of God,
      that men cannot withstand or resist it without a sinful hardening of
      themselves against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Many previous sins make way for the great sin of finally rejecting the
      voice or word of God.
    </p>
    <p>10. Old Testament examples are New Testament instructions.</p>
    <p>
      11. Especial seasons of grace and obedience are in an especial manner to
      be observed and improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. That the examples of our forefathers are of use unto us, and objects
      of our deepest consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. It is a dangerous condition, for children to boast of the privileges
      of their fathers, and to imitate their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. A multitude joining in any sin gives it thereby a great aggravation.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. The sinful actings of men against those who deal with them in the name
      of God, and about the works or will of God, are principally against God
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Unbelief manifesting itself in a time of trial is a most provoking
      sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. There is commonly a day, a time, wherein unbelief riseth to its height
      in provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. To distrust God, to disbelieve his promises, whilst a way of duty lies
      before us, after we have had experience of his goodness, power, and
      wisdom, in his dealing with us, is a tempting of God, and a great,
      provoking sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. No place, no retiredness, no solitary wilderness, will secure men from
      sin or suffering, provocation or punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. Great works of providence are a great means of instruction; and
      neglect of them, as to their instructive end, is a great aggravation of
      the sin of those who live when and where they are performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) To profit by these, it is required that we consider and be well
      acquainted with our own condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) That we consider what peculiar impressions of his will God puts upon
      any of his works.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. The greater evidence that God gives of his power and goodness in any
      of his works, the louder is his voice in them, and the greater is the sin
      of them that neglect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. The end of all God’s works, of his mighty works of providence, towards
      a person, a church, or a nation, is to bring to faith and dependence.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. God is pleased ofttimes to grant great outward means to those in whom
      he will not work effectually by his grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      24. No privilege, no outward means of grace, no other advantages whatever,
      will secure men in a course of sinning from the wrath and justice of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      25. There are determinate bounds fixed unto God’s patience and forbearance
      towards obstinate sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      26. The heart of God is greatly concerned in the sins of men, especially
      of those who on any account are his people, and so esteemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      27. In all the sins of men, God principally regards the principle, that is
      the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      28. The error of the heart in preferring the ways of sin before obedience,
      with its promises and rewards, is the root of all great provoking sins and
      rebellions against God.
    </p>
    <p>
      29. A constant persisting in a course of sin, is the utmost, highest, and
      last aggravation of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      30. None despise or desert the ways of God but those that know them not.
    </p>
    <p>
      31. When God expresseth great indignation in himself against sin, it is to
      teach men the greatness of sin in themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      32. God gives the same firmitude and stability unto his threatenings that
      he doth unto his promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      33. When men have provoked God by their impenitency to decree their
      punishment irrevocably, they will find severity in the execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      34. It is the presence of God alone that renders any place or condition
      good or desirable.
