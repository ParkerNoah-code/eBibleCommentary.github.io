    <h2>
      Ver 19-23.
      <em
        >Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by
        the blood of Jesus, by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and

    <p>
      1. It is not every mistake, every error, though it be in things of great
      importance, while it overthrows not the foundation, that can divest men of
      a fraternal interest with others in the heavenly calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. This is the great fundamental privilege of the gospel, that believers,
      in all their holy worship, have liberty, boldness, and confidence, to
      enter with it and by it into the gracious presence of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Nothing but the blood of Jesus could have given this boldness, nothing
      that stood in the way of it could otherwise have been removed, nothing
      else could have set our souls at liberty from that bondage that was come
      upon them by sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Rightly esteem and duly improve the blessed privilege which was
      purchased for us at so dear a rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Confidence in an access unto God not built on, not resolved into the
      blood of Christ, is but a daring presumption, which God abhors.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The way of our entrance into the holiest is solemnly dedicated and
      consecrated for us, so as that with boldness we may make use of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. All the privileges we have by Christ are great, glorious, and
      efficacious, all tending and leading unto life.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The Lord Christ doth peculiarly preside over all the persons, duties,
      and worship, of believers in the church of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The heart is that which God principally respects in our access unto
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Universal, internal sincerity of heart is required of all those that
      draw nigh unto God in his holy worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The actual exercise of faith is required in all our approaches unto
      God, in every particular duty of his worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. It is faith in Christ alone that gives us boldness of access unto God.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The person and office of Christ are to be rested in with full
      assurance in all our accesses to the throne of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Although that worship whereby we draw nigh unto God be wrought with
      respect to institution and rule, yet without internal sanctification of
      heart we are not accepted in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Due preparation, by fresh applications of our souls unto the efficacy
      of the blood of Christ for the purification of our hearts, that we may be
      meet to draw nigh to God, is required of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Universal sanctification upon our whole persons, and the mortification
      in an especial manner of outward sins, are required of us in our drawing
      nigh unto God.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. These are the ornaments wherewith we are to prepare our souls for it,
      and not the gaiety of outward apparel.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. It is a great work, to draw nigh unto God so as to worship him in
      spirit and in truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. There is an internal principle of saving faith required unto our
      profession of the doctrine of the gospel, without which it will not avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. All that believe ought solemnly to give themselves up unto Christ and
      his rule, in an express profession of the faith that is in them and
      required of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. There will great difficulties arise in, and opposition be made unto, a
      sincere profession of the faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. Firmness and constancy of mind, with our utmost diligent endeavors,
      are required unto an acceptable continuance in the profession of the
      faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. Uncertainty and wavering of mind as to the truth and doctrine we
      profess, or neglect of the duties wherein it doth consist, or compliance
      with errors for fear of persecution and sufferings, do overthrow our
      profession and render it useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      25. As we ought not on any account to decline our profession, so to abate
      of the degrees of fervency of spirits therein is dangerous unto our souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      26. The faithfulness of God in his promises is the great encouragement and
      supportment, under our continual profession of our faith, against all
      oppositions.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 24.
      <em>Let’s consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The mutual watch of Christians, in the particular societies whereof
      they are members, is a duty necessary unto the preservation of the
      profession of the faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. A due consideration of the circumstances, abilities, temptations, and
      opportunities for duties in one another, is required hereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Diligence, or mutual exhortation unto gospel duties, that men on all
      grounds of reason and example may be provoked unto them, is required of
      us, and is a most excellent duty, which in an especial manner we ought to
      attend unto.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 25.
      <em
        >not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is,
        but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day
        approaching.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Great diligence is required of us in a due attendance unto the
      assemblies of the church, for the ends of them, as they are instituted and
      appointed by Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The neglect of the authority and love of Christ in the appointment of
      the means of our edification, will always tend to great and ruinous evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. No church order, no outward profession, can secure men from apostasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Perfection, freedom from offense, scandal, and ruinous evils, are not
      to be expected in any church in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Men that begin to decline from their duty in church relations ought to
      be marked, and their ways avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Forsaking of church assemblies is usually an entrance into apostasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. When especial warnings do not excite us unto renewed diligence in known
      duties, our condition is dangerous as unto the continuance of the presence
      of Christ amongst us.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Approaching judgments ought to influence unto especial diligence in all
      evangelical duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. If men will shut their eyes against evident signs and tokens of
      approaching judgments, they will never stir up themselves nor engage into
      the due performance of present duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. In the approach of great and final judgments, God, by his word and
      providence, gives such intimations of their coming as that wise men may
      discern them.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. To see evidently such a day approaching, and not to be sedulous and
      diligent in the duties of divine worship, is a token of a backsliding
      frame, tending unto final apostasy.
