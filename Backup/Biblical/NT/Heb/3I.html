    <h2>I. Sacrifice: Once for All Time (9:23-28)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 23.
      <em
        >It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens
        should be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with
        better sacrifices than these.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The glory and efficacy of all ordinances of divine worship which
      consist in outward observances (as it is with the sacraments of the
      gospel) consist in this, that they represent and exhibit heavenly things
      unto us.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. We ought to have a due consideration to the holiness of God in his
      worship and service.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The one sacrifice of Christ, with what ensued thereon, was the only
      means to render effectual all the counsels of God concerning the
      redemption and salvation of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Neither could heavenly things have been made meet for us or our use,
      nor we have been meet for their enjoyment, had they not been dedicated and
      we been purged by the sacrifice of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Every eternal mercy, every spiritual privilege, is both purchased for
      us and sprinkled unto us by the blood of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. There is such an uncleanness in our natures, our persons, our duties
      and worship, that unless they and we are all sprinkled with the blood of
      Christ, neither we nor they can have any acceptance with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The sacrifice of Christ is the one only everlasting fountain and spring
      of all sanctification and sacred dedication.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 24.
      <em
        >For Christ hasn’t entered into holy places made with hands, which are
        representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in
        the presence of God for us;</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The distinct offices of Christ give direction and encouragement to
      faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Christ accepted of God on our behalf, is the spring of all spiritual
      consolation.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 25.
      <em
        >nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters
        into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Such is the absolute perfection of the one offering of Christ, that it
      stands in need of, that it will admit of, no repetition in any kind. 2.
      This one offering of Christ is always effectual unto all the ends of it,
      even no less than it was in the day and hour when it was actually offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The great call and direction of the gospel is to guide faith, and keep
      it up unto this one offering of Christ, as the spring of all grace and
      mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Whatever had the greatest glory in the old legal institutions carried
      along with it the evidence of its own imperfection, compared with the
      thing signified in Christ and his office.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 26.
      <em
        >or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world.
        But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away
        sin by the sacrifice of himself.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It was inconsistent with the wisdom, goodness, grace, and love of God,
      that Christ should often suffer in that way which was necessary to the
      offering of himself, namely, by his death and blood-shedding.
    </p>
    <p>2. It was impossible, from the dignity of his person.</p>
    <p>3. It was altogether needless, and would have been useless.</p>
    <p>
      4. As the sufferings of Christ were necessary unto the expiation of sin,
      so he suffered neither more nor oftener than was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The assured salvation of the church of old, from the foundation of the
      world, by virtue of the one offering of Christ, is a strong confirmation
      of the faith of the church at present to look for and expect everlasting
      salvation thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is the prerogative of God, and the effect of his wisdom, to
      determine the times and seasons of the dispensation of himself and his
      grace to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. God had a design of infinite wisdom and grace in his sending of Christ,
      and his appearance in the world thereon, which could not be frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>8. Sin had erected a dominion, a tyranny over all men, as by a law.</p>
    <p>
      9. No power of man, of any mere creature, was able to evacuate, disannul,
      or abolish this law of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The destruction and dissolution of this law and power of sin was the
      great end of the coming of Christ for the discharge of his priestly office
      in the sacrifice of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. It is the glory of Christ, it is the safety of the church, that by his
      one offering, by the sacrifice of himself once for all, he hath abolished
      sin as to the law and condemning power of it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 27-28.
      <em
        >Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this,
        judgment, so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of
        many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to save those
        who are eagerly waiting for him.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. God hath eminently suited our relief, the means and causes of our
      spiritual deliverance, to our misery, the means and causes of it, as that
      his own wisdom and grace may be exalted and our faith established.
    </p>
    <p>2. Death in the first constitution of it was penal.</p>
    <p>3. It is still penal, eternally penal, to all unbelievers.</p>
    <p>
      4. The death of all is equally determined and certain in God’s
      constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The ground of the expiation of sin by the offering of Christ is this,
      that therein he bare the guilt and punishment due unto it.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is the great exercise of faith, to live on the invisible actings of
      Christ on the behalf of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Christ’s appearance the second time, his return from heaven to complete
      the salvation of the church, is the great fundamental principle of our
      faith and hope, the great testimony we have to give against all his and
      our adversaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Faith concerning the second coming of Christ is sufficient to support
      the souls of believers, and to give them satisfactory consolation in all
      difficulties, trials, and distresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. All true believers do live in a waiting, longing expectation of the
      coming of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. To such alone as look for him will the Lord Christ appear unto
      salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Then will be the great distinction among mankind, when Christ shall
      appear, unto the everlasting confusion of some, and the eternal salvation
      of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. At the second appearance of Christ there will be an end of all the
      business about sin, both on his part and ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The communication of actual salvation unto all believers, unto the
      glory of God, is the final end of the office of Christ.
