      <em>The truth</em> is familiarly used to signify the pure doctrine of
      Christianity, which in its principal design aims at correspondent
      practice. That his <em>children</em>, i.e. such as had been converted to
      Christ by his ministry, of whom it appears Gaius was one, did
      <em>walk in the truth</em> (an apt expression of such correspondent
      practice).

    <h2>
      4.
      <em
        >I have no greater joy than this: to hear about my children walking in
        truth.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      This was a great matter of joy to this holy apostle, especially when the
      godly lives of such, to whose conversion he had been instrumental, were so
      observable, as to gain them a testimony from all others that knew them, as
      it was in the present instance (see 1 Cor 4:15).
