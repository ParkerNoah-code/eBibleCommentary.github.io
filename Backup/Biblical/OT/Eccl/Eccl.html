  <h1>Ecclesiastes</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Book of Ecclesiastes is a unique and thought-provoking work of wisdom
    literature, traditionally attributed to King Solomon. The book's title in
    Hebrew, "Qohelet," is a term that refers to one who gathers or assembles,
    often translated as "Preacher" or "Teacher."
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the book, the Qohelet reflects on the meaning and purpose of
    life, often expressing a sense of deep disillusionment and frustration with
    the apparent futility of human existence. He observes that all human
    endeavors—wisdom, pleasure, wealth, and work—are ultimately "vanity,"
    "fleeting," or "perishable," like chasing after the wind.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Qohelet's reflections touch on a wide range of topics, including the
    cycles of nature, the injustices of life, the inevitability of death, and
    the importance of enjoying the simple pleasures of life. He grapples with
    the apparent randomness of fate and the limitations of human wisdom,
    acknowledging that God's ways are often inscrutable to human understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite the book's often pessimistic tone, the Qohelet does offer some
    positive insights and practical advice. He encourages readers to fear God,
    to enjoy the good things in life as gifts from God, and to make the most of
    their fleeting time on earth. He also emphasizes the importance of wisdom,
    though he recognizes its limitations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Book of Ecclesiastes concludes with a call to remember one's Creator in
    the days of youth, before the difficulties of old age set in. The Qohelet's
    final message is to fear God and keep His commandments, recognizing that
    this is the whole duty of humanity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ecclesiastes challenges readers to confront the deeper questions of life and
    to find meaning and purpose in a world that often seems chaotic and absurd.
    Its insights continue to resonate with readers across the ages, inviting
    reflection on the nature of wisdom, the human condition, and the role of
    faith in the face of life's mysteries.

      >The Gospel in the Book of Ecclesiastes</a
    >, JETS 56/4 (2013), 697-706: "Qohelet does not speak about life without
    God, but of life of both sinner and saint under the sun, and God's strange
    manner of ordering (or, perhaps better, 'frustrating') our lives." He
    defends this understanding of Ecclesiastes and explains its implications for
    the Gospel message.
