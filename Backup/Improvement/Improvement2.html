          It is essential for Christians to take care of our bodies. I'm calling
          this <b>external work</b>. It includes sleep, diet, and fitness.

          It is essential for Christians to improve our minds. I'm calling this
          <b>internal work</b>. It includes character, communication, and
          learning.

        <li>
          It is essential for Christians to work on relationships. I'm calling
          this <b>outside work</b>. It includes friendship, romance, and family.

        Good sleep is a skill that can be developed. What we do during the day
        will determine what time we fall asleep, how fast we fall asleep, how
        well we stay asleep, and how restful that sleep is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quality sleep is essential for physical recovery, cognitive function,
        and emotional regulation, supporting muscle growth, memory
        consolidation, and mood stability. It boosts the immune system by
        promoting cytokine production, which helps fight infections and
        inflammation, while sleep deprivation weakens immunity. Sleeping also
        regulates appetite hormones, affecting metabolic health, with poor sleep
        linked to weight gain and an increased risk of metabolic disorders like
        diabetes.
      </p>

        Levels of cortisol rise in the morning to help promote wakefulness and
        decrease throughout the day. They are typically highest around 30-45
        minutes after waking, a phenomenon known as the "cortisol awakening
        response" (CAR). This peak helps promote wakefulness and prepare the
        body for the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prolonged stress can lead to consistently elevated cortisol levels,
        which may disrupt sleep by making it harder to fall or stay asleep.
        Elevated cortisol levels, particularly at night, are often found in
        individuals with insomnia. High nighttime cortisol can interfere with
        the deep sleep stages, leading to poor sleep quality and increased
        fatigue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stress management techniques such as such as mindfulness meditation and
        regular exercise can help lower cortisol levels and improve sleep
        quality. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, consuming
        a balanced diet with adequate nutrients, and reducing caffeine and
        nicotine intake in the early afternoon and evening also supports adrenal
        health and cortisol regulation, improving sleep quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adenosine promotes feelings of drowsiness and the need for sleep. After
        a long and restful sleeping period, adenosine levels will be very low.
        However, adenosine levels gradually increase in the brain during
        wakefulness as a byproduct of cellular metabolism, particularly ATP
        (adenosine triphosphate) breakdown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caffeine works against adenosine by binding to adenosine receptors and
        taking their place, blocking the sleeping signal. A safe guideline is to
        not drink caffeine after 4 pm to avoid trouble falling asleep.

        Light is the most powerful external cue (zeitgeber) that synchronizes
        the circadian rhythm with the external environment. The bodies central
        biological clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The
        SCN coordinates the timing of the circadian rhythm by receiving direct
        input from the eyes about light levels. Special photoreceptor cells in
        the retina contain melanopsin, which detects changes in ambient light
        and sends signals to the SCN to adjust the timing of the circadian
        rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meal timing, work schedules, environmental temperature fluctuations, and
        social interactions can also act as zeitgebers, influencing the body's
        internal clock, albeit less significantly than light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exposure to light suppresses the production of melatonin and promotes
        wakefulness through increased alertness and cognitive function. Getting
        anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes of sunlight (depending on how cloudy
        the day is) relatively soon after waking positively informs your
        circadian rhythm and enhances wakefulness.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the absence of light, melatonin production increases, promoting
        sleepiness and preparing the body for rest. Being outside as the sun is
        setting is another way to inform your body that it is time to go to
        sleep. Limit screen usage and bright lights in the evening and night
        times to support this process. Your bodies natural melatonin can wear
        off if you stay awake through the tiredness, which can make it hard to
        fall asleep afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Body temperature follows a circadian pattern, peaking during the day and
        reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours, coinciding with
        the propensity for sleep. A cold bedroom for sleeping can positively
        impact ones ability to fall asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traveling across time zones can desynchronize the internal clock from
        the external environment, leading to symptoms like fatigue, insomnia,
        and digestive issues. It typically takes several days for the circadian
        rhythm to realign with the new time zone. Use the external factors
        mentioned above to help reset your bodies internal clock.
