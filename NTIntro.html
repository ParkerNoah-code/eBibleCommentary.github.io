        <h1>Prolegomena</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          Many scholars are of the opinion that it is the final purpose of
          Introduction to determine in a historico-critical way what part of the
          Biblical writings are credible and therefore really constitute the
          Word of God. Human reason is placed as an arbiter over the divine
          Revelation. This, of course, cannot be the position of those who
          believe that the Bible is the Word of God. This belief is our starting
          point and not our goal in the study of Introduction. Thus we begin
          with a theological postulate, and our aim is to set forth the true
          character of Scripture, in order to explain, why the Church universal
          honors it as the Word of God; to strengthen the faith of believers;
          and to vindicate the claims of the canonical books over against the
          assaults of Rationalism.
        </p>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          A New Testament Introduction designates a conglomeration of rhetorical
          archaeological, geographical and historical matter such as might be
          helpful in the interpretation of Scripture. The study of the Bible
          must investigate the questions of the authorship, the composition, the
          history, the purpose and the canonicity of the different books of the
          Bible.
        </p>

        <p>
          A difference obtains with reference to the question, whether it is
          only the human or also the divine side of the canonical books that
          should be the object of study. It is perfectly obvious that, if the
          discipline be regarded as a purely historical one, the divine factor
          that operated in the composition of the books of the Bible and that
          gives them their permanent canonical significance, cannot come in
          consideration. The Word of God must then be treated like all purely
          human compositions. This is the stand taken by nearly all writers on
          Introduction. It appears to us, however, that this is impossible, and
          with Kuyper we hold that we should not only study the human, but
          should also have regard to the divine side of the Biblical books,
          notably to their inspiration and canonical significance.
        </p>

        <h2>Leading Principles</h2>
        <p>
          There are certain fundamental principles that guide us in our
          investigation, which it is desirable to state at the outset, in order
          that our position may be perfectly clear. For the sake of brevity we
          do not seek to establish them argumentatively.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. For us the Bible as a whole and in all its parts is the very Word
          of God, written by men indeed, but organically inspired by the Holy
          Spirit; and not the natural product of the religious development of
          men, not merely the expression of the subjective religious
          consciousness of believers. Resting, as it ultimately does, on the
          testimony of the Holy Spirit, no amount of historical investigation
          can shake this conviction.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This being our position, we unflinchingly accept all that the
          various books of the Bible tell us concerning their authorship,
          destination, composition, inspiration, etc. Only in cases where the
          text is evidently corrupt, will we hesitate to accept their dicta as
          final. This applies equally to all parts of the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Since we do not believe that the Bible is the result of a purely
          natural development, but regard it as the product of supernatural
          revelation, a revelation that often looks beyond the immediate
          present, we cannot allow the so-called zeitgeschichtliche arguments
          the force which they are often supposed to have.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. While it is the prevailing habit of many New Testament scholars to
          discredit what the early Church fathers say respecting the books of
          the Bible, because of the uncritical character of their work, we
          accept those early traditions as trustworthy until they are clearly
          proven unreliable. The character of those first witnesses warrants
          this position.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We regard the use of working-hypotheses as perfectly legitimate
          within certain limits. They may render good service, when historical
          evidence fails, but even then may not go contrary to the data at hand,
          and the problematic character of the results to which they lead must
          always be borne in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. It is not assumed that the problems of New Testament Introduction
          are insignificant, and that all the difficulties that present
          themselves can easily be cleared up. Whatever our standpoint, whatever
          our method of procedure in studying these problems, we shall sometimes
          have to admit our ignorance, and often find reason to confess that we
          know but in part.
