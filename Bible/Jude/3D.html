    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>About these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam</em>. This was Enoch the
      son of Jared; his name signifies one "instructed", or "trained up"; as he
      doubtless was by his father, in the true religion, in the nurture and
      admonition of the Lord; and was one that had much communion with God; he
      walked with him, and was translated by him, body and soul, to heaven, and
      did not see death; Genesis 5:18; he is said to be "the seventh from Adam";
      not the seventh man from him that was born into the world, for there were
      no doubt thousands born before him; but he was, as the Jews express it f,
      דור שביעי, "the seventh generation" from him; and they have an observation
      g, that all sevenths are always beloved by God; the seventh in lands, and
      the seventh in generations; Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared,
      Enoch, as it is written, Genesis 5:24; and this is said partly to
      distinguish him from others of the same name, and particularly from Enoch
      the son of Cain, the third: from Adam in his line, as this was the seventh
      from Adam in the line of Seth; and partly to observe the antiquity of the
      following prophecy of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Prophesied, saying,</em>. Of these false teachers, and such as they;
      what would be their sad state and condition at the second coming of Christ
      to judgment: that he had a spirit of prophecy is evident from the name he
      gave to his son Methuselah, which signifies, "when he dies is the
      emission", or the sending out of the waters of the flood, which came to
      pass the very year he did die. The Arabic writers h call him Edris the
      prophet; and the Jews say i, that he was in a higher degree than Moses or
      Elias; they also call k him Metatron, the great scribe, a name which they
      sometimes give to the angel that went before the children of Israel in the
      wilderness, and which seems to belong to the Messiah: that Enoch wrote a
      prophecy, and left it behind him in writing, does not appear from hence,
      or elsewhere; the Jews, in some of their writings, do cite and make
      mention of the book of Enoch; and there is a fragment now which bears his
      name, but is a spurious piece, and has nothing like this prophecy in it;
      wherefore Jude took this not from a book called the "Apocalypse of Enoch",
      but from tradition; this prophecy being handed down from age to age; and
      was in full credit with the Jews, and therefore the apostle very
      appropriately produces it; or rather he had it by divine inspiration.

    <h2>
      Ver 14b-15.
      <em
        >“Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute
        judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of
        ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard
        things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones</em>. By the
      "Lord" is meant the Lord Jesus Christ, who is ordained the Judge of quick
      and dead, and for which he is richly qualified, being omniscient and
      omnipotent, and faithful and righteous, and who will certainly come again
      to judge the world in righteousness; for not of his first coming, which
      was not to judge and condemn, but to seek and save, but of his second
      coming at the last day is this to be understood; and this is expressed in
      the present tense, "cometh", in the manner of the prophets, who speak of
      things future as if they already were, as Isaiah does of the incarnation,
      sufferings, and death of Christ, and to awaken the attention of persons to
      it, as if it was near at hand, as also to signify the certainty of it: and
      when he comes, he will be attended "with ten thousand of his saints":
      meaning either the souls of glorified saints, even all of them, 1
      Thessalonians 3:13, which will come with Christ, and meet the living ones,
      and be reunited to their own bodies, which will then be raised; or else
      the holy angels, as in Deuteronomy 33:2; and so some copies and the Arabic
      version read; which will be both for the showing forth of his glory and
      majesty, and for service in gathering his elect together, as well as for
      terror to the wicked; and a "behold" is prefixed to all this, to denote
      the certainty of Christ's coming, and the importance and wonderfulness of
      it: the ends of his coming follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>To execute judgment on all</em>. Quick and dead, small and great, high
      and low, rich and poor, good and bad, righteous and wicked, sheep and
      goats; to pass the definitive sentence on each, that of absolution, life,
      and happiness, on his own people, and that of condemnation, death, and
      misery, on the wicked; which will be done in the most strict and righteous
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >And to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which
        they have done</em
      >. Those who are without God, the fear of him love to him, or faith in
      him; who have lived without the worship of him, or in a false worship; and
      particularly false teachers are here meant, the same as in Judges 1:4; who
      will then be convicted in their own consciences, by that clear evidence,
      and full light, in which things will be set.
    </p>
    <p><em>In an ungodly way</em>. Both against law and Gospel.</p>
    <p>
      <em
        >And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against
        him</em
      >. Either "against" God, as the Vulgate Latin version reads, against his
      being, his perfections, his providence, his purposes, his word, and
      worship; or rather against Jesus Christ the Lord, who will come to judge
      them, against his person and offices, his blood, righteousness, and
      sacrifice; his ministers and people, his truths and ordinances.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 16.
      <em
        >These are murmurers and complainers, walking after their lusts—and
        their mouth speaks proud things—showing respect of persons to gain
        advantage.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>These are murmurers</em>. That is, at others; secretly, inwardly, in a
      muttering way, grunting out their murmurs like swine; to which, for their
      filthiness and apostasy, false teachers may be filly compared: and their
      murmurs might be both against God and men; against God, against the being
      of God, denying, or at least wishing there was no God, and uneasy because
      there is one; against the perfections of God, particularly his sovereignty
      over all, his special goodness to some, his wisdom, justice, truth, and
      faithfulness; against his purposes and decrees, both with respect to
      things temporal, spiritual, and eternal; against the providence of God and
      his government of the world, and the unequal distribution of things in it;
      and especially against the doctrines of free grace, and the ordinances of
      the Gospel: and not only are they murmurers against God, and all divine
      things and persons, but also against men; particularly against civil
      magistrates, who restrain them, and are a terror to them; and against the
      ministers of the Gospel, whose gifts and usefulness they envy; and indeed
      against all men, their neighbours, and what they enjoy, and at everything
      that goes besides themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>And complainers</em>. Some join the above character and this together,
      and read, as the Vulgate Latin version, "complaining murmurers"; others,
      as the Syriac version, place not only a comma, but a copulative between
      them; and as the former may design secret and inward murmuring, this may
      intend outward complaining in words; not of their own sins and
      corruptions, nor of the sins of others, with any concern for the honour of
      religion; or of the decay of powerful godliness in themselves or others;
      or of the failure of the Gospel, and the decrease of the interest of
      Christ; but either of God, that he has not made them equal to others in
      the good things of life, as the Arabic version renders it, "complaining of
      their own lots"; or that he lays so much affliction upon them more than on
      others; or of men, that their salaries are not sufficient, and that they
      are not enough respected according to their merit; and indeed, as the
      Syriac version reads, "they complain of everything", and are never
      satisfied and easy.
    </p>
    <p><em>Walking after their lusts</em>. Which are carnal and worldly.</p>
    <p>
      <em>And their mouth speaks proud things</em>. Both against God and men;
      and this may point at their boast of knowledge, their great ostentation of
      learning, their vain and empty doctrines, their high flights, their
      rhetorical style, and bombast language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Showing respect of persons to gain advantage</em>. Crying up men of
      their own stamp for the advantage of the party; and giving flattering
      titles to men of wealth and riches, for the sake of their money: so the
      Ethiopic version, "they studied to please persons, to make gain of them";
      they were respecters of persons; so the phrase is used by the Septuagint
      in Deuteronomy 10:17, and in Job 22:8, and in Proverbs 18:5 and in Isaiah
      9:15.

        <p align="justify">Jude 14-15</p>
      </b></font
    >
    <p align="justify">
      "Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold,
      the Lord comes with ten thousand of his saints, to execute judgment upon
      all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly
      deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches
      which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      God has had in every age some to testify against the ungodly, and to warn
      them of the consequences of their sin at the future judgment: and though
      the faithful execution of this office meets with but ill returns from an
      ungrateful world, yet we trust there will be found, to the end of time,
      some, who will gladly suffer reproach or even death itself in the service
      of their God, and in the benevolent attempt to save their fellow-sinners
      from destruction.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      We do not indeed hear of many who were witnesses for God, before the time
      of Moses; and even his warnings and exhortations were enforced principally
      with temporal sanctions: yet the certainty of a future judgment was known
      not only by Moses, but by the antediluvian world; and was solemnly urged
      by Enoch as a motive to repentance. This prophecy is not recorded in the
      Old Testament; but, by whatever means Jude attained the knowledge of it,
      whether by tradition, or by some written memorial, or by immediate
      inspiration, we may be sure that it was delivered by Enoch; and we may be
      thankful that such a precious fragment of inspired truth has been
      preserved to us.

    >
    <p align="justify">Christ, we are assured, is coming to judge the world.</p>
    <p align="justify">
      There can be no reason to doubt that Enoch referred to Christ, even to
      that very "seed of the woman, who was to bruise the serpent's head," him
      he represents as coming to complete his victory over Satan and his agents
      by calling them to his tribunal, and by consigning them over to the
      punishment they have deserved.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The New Testament writers uniformly speak to the same effect: they declare
      that it is at the judgment seat of Christ we must stand; that it is Christ
      who is ordained to be the Judge of the living and the dead; and, that all
      judgment is therefore committed unto him, because he is the Son of man;
      or, in other words, that
      <i
        >he who died for sinners, shall, in that very nature that he assumed for
        them, be the immediate author of salvation to his followers and of
        condemnation to his enemies.</i
      >
    </p>
    <i> </i>
    <p align="justify">
      And even the manner of his appearing is here plainly predicted.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      It is not with "his saints," but with his holy ones, or holy angels, that
      he will come. The saints will not be his assessors in judgment until they
      themselves shall have received their sentence: then indeed "they shall
      judge angels;" but until then, they themselves will stand before him to be
      judged.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      But the holy angels will be his attendants in the clouds of Heaven; all
      the "myriads" of them shall descend with him from their blessed abodes, to
      increase the solemnity of that day, and to honor him to whom they owe
      their very existence. This accords with the description given by Daniel,
      by Paul, and by Christ himself.

    <p align="justify">

      changed in the twinkling of an eye, and all shall stand together at his
      tribunal. Every one shall then be tried as by fire; their actions shall
      then be weighed as in a balance; and the most secret motions of their
      hearts be brought to light. Then shall they that are approved, "have
      praise of God;" and they that are disapproved, be driven from his
      presence.

    <p align="justify">
      Nor will Jesus merely pronounce the sentence of condemnation or acquittal,
      but he will "execute" it himself, either exalting them instantly to
      thrones of glory, or casting them headlong into "the lake that burns with
      fire and brimstone!"

      Whatever endeavors be now used to show men their guilt and danger, they
      have many things to allege in their own favor; nor even "if we could speak
      with the tongues of angels," could we bring home conviction to their
      hearts. But Jesus will show them, beyond all contradiction, the futility
      of their excuses: and will prove by such unquestionable evidence "the
      <i>deeds </i>they have committed, the <i>words </i>they have spoken," and
      the <i>thoughts </i>they have entertained, that they shall be silenced and
      confounded before him. The ministers, who once labored for their
      salvation, shall then be forced to bear testimony against them. Their
      companions in sin, though to their own confusion, must also testify of
      those deeds of darkness, which they once fondly hoped would be buried in
      eternal oblivion. The very places, where their most secret iniquities were
      committed, will stand forth to accuse them, than that they should escape
      with impunity. Above all, "God himself will be a swift witness against
      them," and will so thoroughly "convince" them of all their sins, whether
      of commission or of omission, that they shall be constrained to
      acknowledge the equity of that sentence which dooms them to everlasting
      burnings! Even in Hell will they be compelled to say, "Lord God Almighty,
      true and righteous are your judgments!"

        1. How needful is it that we should instantly begin our preparation for
        that day!
      </p>
    </b>
    <p align="justify">
      Five thousand years ago the prophet spoke of Jesus as so near at hand,
      that it seemed as if he were already come; and it is in this way that all,
      whether Prophets or Apostles, have been inspired to speak. So strongly did
      Paul express himself on this subject that the Thessalonians conceived the
      judgment-day to be almost immediately at hand. In the same manner must we
      say, "The Lord is at hand!" "The Judge is at the door!" He surely is
      coming as soon as ever the events that are ordained to precede his advent
      shall have received their accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      With respect to us, it signifies little whether it is near or distant,
      since
      <i>as death leaves us, judgment will find us. </i>Is it not even madness
      then to delay our repentance, since we cannot tell but that death may come
      within the next year, or day, or hour?
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Beloved, shall your Lord come, and find you sleeping? Is he hastening
      towards you, and will you not prepare to meet him? O awake from your
      slumbers, and turn to him with your whole hearts; so that you may "have
      confidence before him at his coming."
    </p>
    <b>
      <p align="justify">
        2. How desirable is it to possess a saving interest in Christ!
      </p>
    </b>
    <p align="justify">
      It surely is not necessary to prove that we are ungodly, since
      <i
        >we have all sinned, times without number, in thought, word, and deed,
        against the Divine Majesty. </i
      >Where then shall we go for the remission of our sins? How shall we get
      our iniquities blotted out from the book of his remembrance? Our tears,
      even if we could shed rivers of tears, will never avail for this end.
      <i
        >Nothing but the blood of Jesus can ever cleanse us from the guilt of
        one sin! And, if we are not washed in that fountain, we shall die in our
        iniquities, and lie under the guilt of them forever.</i
      >
      Let us then seek a saving interest in Christ. Let us never attempt to
      substitute any repentance or reformation of our own, in the place of his
      meritorious blood and righteousness: but let it be our one desire to "be
      found in him," and to obtain from him those garments of salvation, which
      alone can "cover the nakedness" of our guilty souls.

      <p align="justify">
        3. With what confidence and comfort may believers look forward to the
        coming of their Lord!

    </b>
    <p align="justify">
      Whom will they have for their judge but the very person who bought them
      with his blood? The very person in whom they have believed; and to whom
      they cleaved with full purpose of heart? Be it so then; the catalogue of
      their sins shall be produced, a catalogue reaching, as it were, from
      Heaven to earth; and they shall not have one word to offer in arrest of
      judgment! Yet, will the Savior pass a sentence of condemnation upon them?
      Will he not himself stand forth and testify, "I saw their deep contrition;
      I treasured up their tears in my vial; I was witness to their frequent
      sighs and groans, and to their cries for mercy through my atoning blood,"
      "Deliver them from going down into the pit! I paid their ransom," they
      were mine; and they manifested that they were mine, by their obedience to
      my will, and their conformity to my image! "Come, you blessed children of
      my Father, inherit my kingdom prepared for you!"
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Fear not then, weak and trembling saints; but rather "be looking for and
      hastening to the coming of the day of Christ," you shall surely stand
      before him with joy; while they, who once justified their ungodliness, and
      thought, that to be among the godly was a fit matter for derision, shall
      bewail their folly, and confess the equity of the sentence that fixes you
      in Heaven, and themselves in Hell. Remember then with gratitude that you
      are to have Jesus for your judge; and when he says, "Behold, I come
      quickly!" let your hearts reply, "Even so, come Lord Jesus!"
