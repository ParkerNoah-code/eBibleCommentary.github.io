      This epistle is addressed to all believers in the gospel. Its design is to
      guard believers against the false teachers who had begun to creep into the
      Christian church, and to scatter dangerous tenets, by attempting to lower
      all Christianity into a merely nominal belief and outward profession of
      the gospel. Having thus denied the obligations of personal holiness, they
      taught their disciples to live in sinful courses, at the same time
      flattering them with the hope of eternal life. The vile character of these
      seducers is shown, and their sentence is denounced, and the epistle
      concludes with warnings, admonitions, and counsels to believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jude first appeals to believers to contend for the faith (ver. 3) because
      ungodly intruders had crept into the church (ver. 4).

    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >Beloved, while I was very eager to write to you about our common
        salvation, I was constrained to write to you exhorting you to contend
        earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the
        saints.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Beloved, while I was very eager to write to you</em>. He was indeed
      glad and anxious to write to them, but yet necessity urged him to do so,
      even because they were assailed (according to what follows) by the
      ungodly, and stood in need of being prepared to fight with them. Had they
      not been forewarned how necessary his exhortation was, they might have
      been slothful and negligent; but when he makes this preface, that he wrote
      on account of the necessity of their case, it was the same as though he
      had blown a trumpet to awake them from their torpor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>About our common salvation</em>. The Gospel our salvation, Jesus
      Christ our salvation, and eternal salvation are the common possesion of
      all believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gospel is sometimes called our salvation in opposition to the law,
      which is a ministration of condemnation; and because it is a declaration
      of salvation, and a means of it; and may be said to be "common," because
      preached to all, Jews and Gentiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus Christ the Saviour himself, who is also sometimes called
      "salvation," because he was called and appointed to it, and undertook it,
      and is become the author of it; and may be said to be a "common" Saviour,
      not of all men, but of all his people; of his whole body, the church, and
      every member of it, and of all sorts of men, in all nations. He is the one
      way of salvation, but that is not confined to any nation, family,
      community, or sect among men.
    </p>
    <p>
      That spiritual and eternal salvation wrought out by him, which is common,
      not to all men, for all are not saved with it, but to all the elect of
      God, and true believers in Christ; the love of God is common to them all
      alike; the choice of them to eternal salvation is the same; the covenant
      of grace, the blessings and promises of it, are equally shared by them;
      and they are bought with the same price of Christ's blood, and are
      justified by the same righteousness, and are regenerated, sanctified, and
      called by the same grace, and shall possess the same glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >I was constrained to write to you exhorting you to contend
        earnestly</em
      >. The persons to be contended with on account of it, are such who deny,
      or depreciate any of the Persons in the Godhead, the assertors of the
      purity and power of human nature, and the deniers of sovereign,
      efficacious, and persevering grace: the persons who are to contend with
      them are all the saints in general, to whom it is delivered; which they
      may do by bearing an external testimony to it, by praying for the
      continuance and success of it, by standing fast in one spirit in it, and
      by dying for it; and particularly the ministers of the Gospel, by
      preaching it boldly, openly, fully, and faithfully, by disputing for it,
      and writing in the defence of it, and by laying down their lives, when
      called for. The manner in which this is to be done, is "earnestly,"
      heartily, in good earnest, and without deceit, zealously, and constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>For the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints</em>. By
      the "faith" is meant the doctrine of faith, in which sense it is used
      whenever faith is said to be preached, obeyed, departed, or erred from, or
      denied, or made shipwreck of, or when exhortations are made to stand fast,
      and continue in it, or to strive and contend for it, as here; and which is
      sometimes called the word of faith, the faith of the Gospel, the mystery
      of faith, or most holy faith, the common faith, and, as here, faith only;
      and designs the whole scheme of evangelical truths to be believed; such as
      the doctrine of the Trinity, the deity and sonship of Christ, the divinity
      and personality of the Spirit; what regards the state and condition of man
      by nature, as the doctrines of the imputation of Adam's sin to his
      posterity, the corruption of nature, and the impotence of men to that
      which is good; what concerns the acts of grace in the Father, Son, and
      Spirit, towards, and upon the sons of men; as the doctrines of everlasting
      love, eternal election, the covenant of grace, particular redemption,
      justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ, pardon and
      reconciliation by his blood, regeneration and sanctification by the grace
      of the Spirit, final perseverance, the resurrection of the dead, and the
      future glory of the saints with Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is said to be "delivered to the saints." It was delivered by God the
      Father to Christ as Mediator, and by him to his apostles, who may more
      especially be meant by "the saints," or holy men; who were chosen to be
      holy, and to whom Christ was made sanctification, and who were sanctified
      by the Spirit of God; and this faith, being a most holy faith, is fit for
      holy men, and only proper to be delivered to them, and preached by them;
      and by them it was delivered to the churches, both by word and writing;
      and this delivery of it supposes that it is not an invention of men, that
      it is of God, and a gift of his, and given in trust in order to be kept,
      held forth, and held fast; and it was but "once" delivered, in opposition
      to the sundry times and divers manners in which the mind of God was
      formerly made known; and designs the uniformity, perfection, and
      continuance of the doctrine of faith;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no alteration to be made in it, or addition to it; no new
      revelations are to be expected, it has been delivered all at once: and
      therefore should be "earnestly contended for"; for could it be lost,
      another could not be had; and the whole of it is to be contended for; not
      only the fundamentals, but the lesser matters of faith; and not things
      essential only, but also what are circumstantial to faith and religion;
      every truth, ordinance, and duty, and particularly the purity of faith,
      and its consistency: and this contention includes a care and solicitude
      for it, to have it, own it, and hold it fast, and adorn it; and for the
      preservation of it, and for the spread of it, and that it might be
      transmitted to posterity: and it denotes a conflict, a combat, or a
      fighting for it, a striving even to an agony.

      Ver 4.
      <em
        >For there are certain men who crept in secretly, even those who were

        grace of our God into indecency, and denying our only Master, God, and
        Lord, Jesus Christ.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>For there are certain men who crept in secretly</em>. These words
      contain a reason why the doctrine of faith should be contended for,
      because of false teachers, who are described as being then upon the spot;
      the Apostles Peter and Paul had foretold that they would come, but Jude
      here speaks of them as being there; wherefore present rigour and vigilance
      were necessary to be used: their names are not mentioned, nor their
      number, only that there were "certain", or "some men"; which is done to
      stir up the saints to self-examination, whether they were in the faith; to
      diligence, in finding out these men; to vigour, in opposing them; and to
      care, to nip error and heresy in the bud.
    </p>
    <p>
      These certain men "crept in secretly" either into private houses to lead
      people astray; or into the churches, being the tares the enemy sows among
      the wheat; or into the ministry, assuming that office to themselves,
      without being called and sent of God; and so into the public assemblies of
      the saints, spreading their poisonous doctrines among them; and also into
      their affections, until discovered; and all this was done secretly,
      without any thought about them, or suspicion of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Even those who were long ago written about for this condemnation</em>.
      Meaning either judicial blindness of heart, they were given up to, in
      embracing and spreading errors and heresies; so that these fall under the
      ordination and decree of God, which does not make God the author of them,
      nor excuse the men that hold them; and they are ordained and ordered for
      many valuable ends; on the part of God, to show his power and wisdom; and
      on the part of truth, that it might be tried and appear the brighter, and
      to manifest his people and their graces: or else punishment is designed,
      even everlasting condemnation, to which some are preordained of God; for
      this act of preordination respects persons, and not mere actions and
      events; and is not a naked prescience, but a real decree, and which is
      sure, certain, and irrevocable. It is God's act, and springs from his
      sovereignty, is agreeably to his justice and holiness; nor is it contrary
      to his goodness, and is for his glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The date of this act is "of old," that is, from eternity (2 Thes 2:13);
      Reprobation is of the same date with election; if the one is from
      eternity, the other must be so too, since there cannot be one without the
      other: if some were chosen before the foundation of the world, others must
      be left or passed by; and if some were appointed unto salvation from the
      beginning, others must be foreordained to condemnation from the beginning
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words cannot be understood of any prophecy of old, in which it was
      forewritten, or prophesied of these men, that they should be condemned for
      their ungodliness; not in Matthew 24:1, in which no such persons are
      described as here, nor any mention made of their punishment or
      condemnation; nor in 2 Peter 2:1; for then the apostle would never have
      said that they were "of old", a long while ago, before written, or
      prophesied of, since according to the common calculation, that epistle of
      Peter's, and this of Jude's, were written in the same year; nor in the
      prophecy of Enoch, Judges 1:14; for Enoch's prophecy was not written, as
      we know of; and therefore these men could not be said to be before written
      in it; besides, that prophecy is spoken of as something distinct from
      these persons being before written, to condemnation; and after all, was a
      prophecy referred to, the sense would be the same, since such a prophecy
      concerning them must be founded upon an antecedent ordination and
      appointment of God; the word here used does not intend their being
      forewritten in any book of the Scriptures, but in the book of God's
      eternal purposes and decrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Ungodly men</em>. All men are by nature ungodly, some are notoriously
      so, and false teachers are generally such; here it signifies such who are
      destitute of the fear of God, and of all internal devotion, and powerful
      godliness; and who did not worship God externally, according to his
      institutions and appointments, and much less sincerely, and in a spiritual
      manner; and who even separated themselves from the true worshippers of
      God, and gave themselves up to sensuality, and therefore their
      condemnation was just.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Turning the grace of our God into indecency</em>. Not the love and
      favour of God, as in his own heart, or as shed abroad in the hearts of
      others; for that can never, be turned to such a purpose, it always working
      in a contrary way; nor the principle of grace wrought in the soul, which
      being of a spiritual nature, lusteth against the flesh, and cannot be
      turned into it; more likely the goodness of God in his providential
      dispensations, which is despised by some, and abused by others; but rather
      the doctrine of grace, which though lasciviousness is not in its nature,
      nor has it any natural tendency to it, yet wicked men turn or transfer it
      from its original nature, design, and use, to a foreign one: and they may
      be said to turn it into lasciviousness, either by asserting it to be a
      licentious doctrine, when it is not; or by treating it in a wanton and
      ludicrous manner, scoffing at it, and lampooning it; or by making the
      doctrine of grace universal, extending it equally alike to all mankind,
      and thereby harden and encourage men in sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>And denying our only Master, God, and Lord, Jesus Christ</em>. Who is
      the only sovereign Lord, both in providence and grace; and the only God,
      not to the exclusion of the Father and Spirit, but in opposition to
      nominal and fictitious deities, or Heathen gods; and he was denied by
      these men, if not in words, yet in works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denying Jesus' deity, or sonship, or humanity, or that he was the Messiah,
      or the alone Saviour, or his sacrifice, satisfaction, and righteousness;
      with respect to either of which he may be said to be denied doctrinally,
      as he is also practically, when men do not walk worthy of their profession
      of him; and both might be true of these men, and therefore their
      condemnation was righteous.

        >A Christian Directory</a
      >, Pt 1, Ch 2:
    </p>
    <p>
      Jude calls believers "to contend earnestly for the faith which was once
      for all delivered to the saints." It is to the Old and New Testaments that
      we must continually go to for guidance and for the content of our faith:
      <em
        >Take heed lest the novelty or the reputation of truth and godliness
        take you with it, rather than the solid evidence of their excellency and
        scriptural support, and leave your religion to wither away and consume
        you when the novelty and reputation are gone</em
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said of John the Baptist and the Jews by Christ, &quot;He was a
      burning and a shining light, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice
      in his light&quot; (John 5:35). All men are affected most with things that
      seem new and strange to them. It is not only the infirmity of children,
      that are pleased with new clothes, and new toys and games; but even to
      graver, wiser persons, new things are most affecting, and commonness and
      custom dulls delight. Our habitations, and possessions, and honours, are
      most pleasing to us at the first; and every condition of life doth most
      affect us at the first: if nature were not much for novelty, the
      publishing of news-books would not have been so gainful a trade so long,
      unless the matter had been truer and more desirable. Hence it is that
      changes are so welcome to the world, though they prove ordinarily to their
      cost. No wonder then, if religion be the more acceptable, when it comes
      with this advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When men first hear the doctrine of godliness, and the tidings of another
      world, by a powerful preacher opened and set home, no wonder if things of
      so great moment affect them for a time: it is said of them that received
      the seed of God&#x27;s word as into stony ground, that &quot;forthwith it
      sprung up,&quot; and they &quot;anon with joy received it&quot; (Matt.
      13:5,20); but it quickly withered for want of rooting. These kind of
      hearers can no more delight still in one preacher, or one profession, or
      way, than a glutton in one dish, or an adulterer in one harlot: for it is
      but a kind of sensual or natural pleasure that they have in the highest
      truths; and all such delight must be fed with novelty and variety of
      objects. The Athenians were inquisitive after Paul&#x27;s doctrine as
      novelty, though after they rejected it, as seeming to them incredible:
      &quot;`May we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is? For
      thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore
      what these things mean.&#x27; For all the Athenians and strangers which
      were there, spent their time in nothing else, but to tell or hear some new
      thing&quot; (Acts 17:19-21).
    </p>
    <p>
      To this kind of professor, the greatest truths grow out of fashion, and
      they grow weary of them, as of dull and ordinary things; they must have
      some new light, or new way of religion that lately came in fashion; their
      souls are weary of that manna that at first was acceptable to them, as
      angels&#x27; food. Old things seem low, and new things high to them; and
      to entertain some novelty in religion, is to grow up to more maturity: and
      too many such at last so far overthrive their old apparel, that the old
      Christ and old gospel are left behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of the gospel is speedilier communicated, than the heat; and
      this first part being most acceptable to them, is soon received; and
      religion seemeth best to them at first. At first they have the light of
      knowledge alone; and then they have the warmth of a new and prosperous
      profession: there must be some time for the operating of the heat, before
      it burneth them; and then they have enough, and cast it away in as much
      haste as they took it up. If preachers would only lighten, and shoot no
      thunderbolts, even a Herod himself would hear them gladly, and do many
      things after them; but when their Herodias is meddled with, they cannot
      bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If preachers would speak only to men&#x27;s fancies or understandings, and
      not meddle too smartly with their hearts, and lives, and carnal interests,
      the world would bear them, and hear them as they do stageplayers, or at
      least as lecturers in philosophy or physic. A sermon that hath nothing but
      some general toothless notions in a handsome dress of words, doth seldom
      procure offence or persecution: it is rare that such men&#x27;s preaching
      is distasted by carnal hearers, or their persons hated for it. &quot;It is
      a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun&quot; (Eccl. 11:7); but
      not to be scorched by its heat. Christ Himself at a distance as promised,
      was greatly desired by the Jews; but when He came, they could not bear
      Him; His doctrine and life were so contrary to their expectations:
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come into His temple, even
      the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, He shall come,
      saith the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the day of His coming? and who
      shall stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner&#x27;s fire, and
      like fullers&#x27; soap&quot; (Mal. 3:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Many when they come first (by profession) to Christ, do little think that
      He would cast them into the fire, and refine them, and purge away their
      dross, and cast them anew into the mould of the gospel (see Rom. 6:17).
      Many will play a while by the light, that will not endure to be melted by
      the fire. When the preacher cometh once to this, he is harsh and
      intolerable, and loseth all the praise which he had won before, and the
      pleasing novelty of religion is over with them. The gospel is sent to make
      such work in the soul and life, as these tender persons will not endure;
      it must captivate every thought to Christ, and kill every lust and
      pleasure which is against His will, and put a new and heavenly life into
      the soul; it must possess men with deep and lively apprehensions of the
      great things of eternity; it is not wavering dull opinions, that will
      raise and carry on the soul to such vigorous, constant, victorious action,
      as is necessary to salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the gospel cometh to the heart, to do this great prevailing work,
      then these men are impatient of the search and smart, and presently have
      done with it. They are like children, that love the book for the gilding
      and fineness of the cover, and take it up as soon as any; but it is to
      play with, and not to learn; they are weary of it when it comes to that.
      At first many come to Christ with wonder, and will needs be His servants
      for something in it that seemeth fine; till they hear that the Son of man
      hath not the accommodation of the birds or foxes; and that His doctrine
      and way hath an enmity to their worldly, fleshly interest, and then they
      are gone. They first entertained Christ in compliment, thinking that He
      would please them, or not much contradict them; but when they find that
      they have received a guest that will rule them, and not be ruled by them,
      that will not suffer them to take their pleasure, nor enjoy their riches,
      but hold them to a life which they cannot endure, and even undo them in
      the world, He is then no longer a guest for them. Whereas if Christ had
      been received as Christ, and truth and godliness deliberately entertained
      for their well-discerned excellency and necessity, the deep rooting would
      have prevented this apostasy, and cured such hypocrisy.

      But, alas! poor ministers find by sad experience, that all prove not
      saints that flock to hear them, and make up the crowd; nor &quot;that for
      a season rejoice in their light,&quot; and magnify them, and take their
      parts. The blossom hath its beauty and sweetness; but all that blossometh
      or appeareth in the bud, doth not come to perfect fruit: some will be
      blasted, and some blown down; some nipped with frosts, some eaten by
      worms; some quickly fall, and some hang on till the strongest blasts do
      cast them down; some are deceived and poisoned by false teachers; some by
      worldly cares, and the deceitfulness of riches, become unfruitful and are
      turned aside; the lusts of some had deeper rooting than the word; and the
      friends of some had greater interest in them than Christ, and therefore
      they forsake Him to satisfy their importunity; some are corrupted by the
      hopes of preferment, or the favour of man; some feared from Christ by
      their threats and frowns, and choose to venture on damnation to escape
      persecution; and some are so worldly wise, that they can see reason to
      remit their zeal, and can save their souls and bodies too; and prove that
      to be their duty, which other men call sin (if the end will but answer
      their expectations); and some grow weary of truth and duty, as a dull and
      common thing, being supplied with that variety which might still continue
      the delights of novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet mistake not what I have said, as if all the affection furthered by
      novelty, and abated by commonness and use, were a sign that the person is
      but a hypocrite. I know that there is something in the nature of man,
      remaining in the best, which disposeth us to be much more passionately
      affected with things when they seem new to us, and are first apprehended,
      than when they are old, and we have known or used them long. There is not,
      I believe, one man of a thousand, but is much more delighted in the light
      of truth, when it first appeareth to him, than when it is trite and
      familiarly known; and is much more affected with a powerful minister at
      first, than when he hath long sat under him. The same sermon that even
      transported them at the first hearing, would affect them less, if they had
      heard it preached a hundred times. The same books which greatly affected
      us at the first or second reading, will affect us less when we have read
      them over twenty times. The same words of prayer that take much with us
      when seldom used, do less move our affections when they are daily used all
      the year. At our first conversion, we have more passionate sorrow for our
      sin, and love to the godly, than we can afterwards retain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this is the case of learned and unlearned, the sound and unsound,
      though not of all alike. Even heaven itself is spoken of by Christ, as if
      it did participate of this, when He saith, that &quot;joy shall be in
      heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
      persons, that need no repentance&quot; (Luke 15:7,10). And I know it is
      the duty of ministers to take notice of this disposition in their hearers,
      and not to dull them with giving them still the same, but to profit them
      by a pleasant and profitable variety: not by preaching to them another
      Christ, or a new gospel: it is the same God, and Christ, and Spirit, and
      Scripture, and the same heaven, the same church, the same faith, and hope,
      and repentance, and obedience, that we must preach to them as long as we
      live; though they say, we have heard this a hundred times, let them hear
      it still, and bring them not a new creed. If they hear so oft of God, and
      Christ, and heaven, till by faith, and love, and fruition, they attain
      them as their end, they have heard well. But yet there is a grateful
      variety of subordinate particulars, and of words, and methods, and
      seasonable applications, necessary to the right performance of our
      ministry, and to the profiting of the flocks: though the physician use the
      same apothecary&#x27;s shop, and dispensatory, and drugs, yet how great a
      variety must he use of compositions, and times, and manner of
      administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for all this, though the best are affected most with things that seem
      new, and are dulled with the long and frequent use of the same
      expressions, yet they are never weary of the substance of their religion,
      so as to desire a change. And though they are not so passionately affected
      with the same sermons, and books, or with the thoughts or mention of the
      same substantial matters of religion, as at first they were; yet do their
      judgments more solidly and tenaciously embrace them, and esteem them, and
      their wills as resolvedly adhere to them, and use them, and in their lives
      they practise them, better than before. Whereas, they that take up their
      religion but for novelty, will lay it down when it ceaseth to be new to
      them, and must either change for a newer, or have none at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as unsound are they that are religious, only because their education,
      or their friends, or the laws or judgment of their rulers, or the custom
      of the country, hath made it necessary to their reputation: these are
      hypocrites at the first setting out, and therefore cannot be saved by
      continuance in such a carnal religiousness as this. I know law, and
      custom, and education, and friends, when they side with godliness, are a
      great advantage to it, by affording helps, and removing those impediments
      that might stick much with carnal minds. But truth is not your own, till
      it be received in its proper evidence; nor your faith divine, till you
      believe what you believe, because God is true who doth reveal it; nor are
      you the children of God, till you love Him for Himself; nor are you truly
      religious, till the truth and goodness of religion itself be the principal
      thing that maketh you religious.
    </p>
    <p>
      It helpeth much to discover a man&#x27;s sincerity, when he is not only
      religious among the religious, but among the profane, and the enemies, and
      scorners, and persecutors of religion; and when a man doth not pray only
      in a praying family, but among the prayerless, and the deriders of fervent
      constant prayer; and when a man is heavenly among them that are earthly,
      and temperate among the intemperate and riotous, and holdeth the truth
      among those that reproach it and that hold the contrary; when a man is not
      carried only by a stream of company, or outward advantages, to his
      religion, nor avoideth sin for want of a temptation, but is religious
      though against the stream, and innocent when cast (unwillingly) upon
      temptations; and is godly where godliness is accounted singularity,
      hypocrisy, faction, humour, disobedience, or heresy; and will rather let
      go the reputation of his honesty, than his honesty itself.
