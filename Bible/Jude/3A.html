    <p>
      <em>Now I desire to remind you, though you already know this</em>. They
      had known it once for all; they had been perfectly acquainted with it;
      which is said, lest the apostle should be thought to write to persons
      ignorant, and rude in knowledge, and to show that he wrote nothing new and
      unheard of, and so should have the more weight and influence upon them;
      and he thought fit to remind them of it, though they had known it: it is
      one part of the work of the ministers of the word to put people in mind of
      what they have known; which is necessary, because of the inattentiveness
      of hearers, their forgetfulness, and loss of knowledge, and the weakness
      of some capacities to take in, and retain things; and if the judgment is
      not more informed hereby, yet the affections may be afresh raised, and
      grace be drawn out into exercise, and the mind be established and
      confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>That Jesus, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt</em>. That
      is, the people of Israel, who were the chosen people of God, a special
      people, above all others, and had peculiar privileges; these the Lord
      brought out of the land of Egypt, with an high hand, and a mighty arm, and
      saved them out of their bondage, and delivered out of their oppressions
      and afflictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Afterward destroyed those who didn’t believe</em>. Their carcasses
      fell in the wilderness by one judgment or another upon them; so that of
      all that came out of Egypt, but two entered into the land of Canaan: this
      shows the evil nature of unbelief; and that God will not suffer sin to go
      unobserved in any; no outward privileges and profession will screen any
      from divine vengeance; God sometimes makes severe examples of mere nominal
      professors; nor must false teachers, deniers of Christ, and perverters of
      his Gospel, expect to go free: moreover, it may be observed, that God may
      do great things for persons, and yet after all destroy them; great riches
      and honours may be conferred on some, great natural gifts on others; some
      may seem as if they had the grace of God, and were brought out of
      spiritual Egypt, and enjoy great mercies and favours, and have many
      deliverances wrought for them, and yet at last perish.

    <h2>
      Ver 6.
      <em
        >Angels who didn’t keep their first domain, but deserted their own
        dwelling place, he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the
        judgment of the great day.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Angels who didn’t keep their first domain</em>. Or "principality";
      that holy, honourable, and happy condition, in which they were created;
      for they were created in perfect holiness and righteousness, stood in the
      relation of sons to God, and were, for the lustre of their nature,
      comparable to the morning stars; they were among the thrones, dominions,
      principalities, and powers; were a superior rank of creatures to men, and
      who beheld the face, and enjoyed the presence of God; but this estate they
      kept not, for being mutable creatures, one of them first sinning, the rest
      were drawn into it by him, and so were not what they were before, nor in
      the same estate, or place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>But deserted their own dwelling place</em>. By attempting to rise
      higher; or by quitting their station and posts of honour, being unwilling
      to be subject to God, and especially to the Son of God, who was to assume
      human nature, and in it be above them, which they could not bear; and by
      gathering together in a body, in another place, with Satan at the head of
      them; though this may be considered as a part of their punishment, and
      they may be said to do what they were forced to; for they were drove out
      of their native habitation, heaven; they were turned out of it, and cast
      down to hell; see 2 Peter 2:4. And this their habitation, which they left,
      or fell from, or they were cast out of, is by the Jews frequently called
      the place of their holiness, or their holy place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>He has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness</em>. By these
      "everlasting chains" may be meant the power and providence of God over
      them, which always abide upon them; or their sins, and the guilt of them
      upon their consciences, under which they are continually held; or the
      decrees and purposes of God concerning their final punishment and
      destruction, which are immutable and irreversible, and from which there is
      no freeing themselves:, the phrase, under darkness, may refer to the
      chains, as in 2 Peter 2:4; where they are called "chains of darkness";
      either because the power, providence, and purposes of God are invisible;
      so the Syriac version reads, "in unknown chains"; or because horror and
      black despair are the effects of sin, and its guilt, with which their
      consciences are continually filled: or it may denote the place and state
      where they are, either in the darkness of the air, or in the dark parts of
      the earth, or in hell, where is utter darkness, even blackness of
      darkness; or that they are under the power of sin, which is darkness, and
      without the light of God's countenance, or any spiritual knowledge, or
      comfort: and they are "reserved" in these chains, and under this darkness;
      or "in prison", as the Arabic version renders it; which denotes the
      custody of them, and their continuance in it, in which they are kept by
      Jesus Christ, who can bind and loose Satan at his pleasure; and it shows
      that they are not as yet in full torment, but are like malefactors that
      are kept in prison, until the assize comes: so these are laid in chains,
      and kept in custody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>For the judgment of the great day</em>. That is, the future and last
      "judgment" of men and devils, which is certain, and will be universal, and
      executed with the strictest justice: this is called "a day", which is
      fixed by God, though unknown to men and angels; and because of the
      evidence and quick dispatch of things, the matters judged will be as clear
      as the day, and finished at once; and a great one, for the Judge will
      appear in great glory; great things will be done, the dead will be raised,
      and all nations will be gathered together, and the process will be with
      great solemnity; the thrones will be set, the books opened, the several
      sentences pronounced, and, all punctually executed; the judgment of the
      great day is the same the Jews call יום דינא רבא, "the day of the great
      judgment" h. This account shows the imprisoned state of the devils, that
      they are not their own lords, and cannot do as they would; they are under
      restraints, and in chains, and not to be feared; which must be a great
      mortification to their proud and malicious spirits: and since this is the
      case of fallen angels, what severity may be expected from God against the
      opposers of the truths of the Gospel?

    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, having in the
        same way as these given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone
        after strange flesh, are shown as an example, suffering the punishment
        of eternal fire.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them</em>. Admah and
      Zeboiim, for Zoar was spared. This is a third instance of God's vengeance
      on sinners; and which, like that of the Israelites, and of the angels, was
      after great favours had been enjoyed: these places were delightfully
      situated, and very fruitful, as the garden of God; they were under a form
      of government, had kings over them, and had lately had a very great
      deliverance from the kings that carried them captive, being rescued by
      Abraham; they had a righteous Lot among them, who was a reprover in the
      gate, and Abraham made intercession for them with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >Having in the same way as these given themselves over to sexual
        immorality</em
      >. Not as the angels, who are not capable of sinning in such a manner;
      though the Jews make this to be a sin of theirs, and so interpret Genesis
      6:2 i, but rather the Israelites, among whom this sin prevailed, 1
      Corinthians 10:8; though it seems best of all to refer it to the false
      teachers that turned the grace of God into lasciviousness, and were very
      criminal this way; and then the sense is, that in like manner as they, the
      inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, gave themselves over to the sin of
      fornication; wherefore these men might expect the same judgments that fell
      upon them, since their sin was alike; which sin is a work of the flesh,
      contrary to the law of God, is against the body, and attended with many
      evils; exposes to judgment here and hereafter, and unfits for the
      communion of the saints, and for the kingdom of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>And gone after strange flesh</em>. Or "other flesh"; meaning not other
      women besides their own wives, but men; and designs that detestable and
      unnatural sin, which, from these people, is called sodomy to this day; and
      which is an exceeding great sin, contrary to the light of nature and law
      of God, dishonourable to human nature, and scandalous to a nation and
      people, and commonly prevails where idolatry and infidelity do, as among
      the Papists and Mahometans; and arose from idleness and fulness of bread
      in Sodom, and was committed in the sight of God, with great impudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Are shown as an example</em>. Being destroyed by fire from heaven, and
      their cities turned into a sulphurous lake, which continues to this day,
      as a monument of God's vengeance, and an example to all such who commit
      the same sins, and who may expect the same equitable punishment; and to
      all who live ungodly lives, though they may not be guilty of the same
      crimes; and to all that slight and reject the Gospel revelation, with whom
      it will be more intolerable than for Sodom and Gomorrah; and to
      antichrist, who bears the same name, and spiritually is called Sodom and
      Egypt; and particularly to all false teachers, who besides their strange
      doctrines, go after strange flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Suffering the punishment of eternal fire</em>. Which may be understood
      of that fire, with which those cities, and the inhabitants of it, were
      consumed; which, Philo the k Jew says, burnt till his time, and must be
      burning when Jude wrote this epistle. The effects of which still
      continues, the land being now brimstone, salt, and burning; and is an
      emblem and representation of hell fire, between which there is a great
      likeness; as in the matter of them, both being fire; in the efficient
      cause of them, both from the Lord; and in the instruments thereof, the
      angels, who, as then, will hereafter be employed in the delivery of the
      righteous, and in the burning of the wicked; and in the circumstance
      attending both, suddenly, at an unawares, when not thought of, and
      expected; and in the nature of them, being a destruction total,
      irreparable, and everlasting: and this agrees with the sentiments of the
      Jews, who say l, that "the men of Sodom have no part or portion in the
      world to come, and shall not see the world to come."
