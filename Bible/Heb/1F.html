      <em>Commentary on Hebrews</em></a

  </p>
  <h2>Verse 1</h2>
  <p>
    Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the
    Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the considerations which he had suggested, the Apostle urges the
    Hebrews to fix their attention upon Christ Jesus, under the character of the
    Apostle and High Priest of our profession. The considerations alluded to are
    His superiority not only to the prophets but also to the angels, inasmuch as
    He was &quot;over all, God blessed for ever.&quot; Romans 9:5. By Him the
    Gospel was first promulgated. He ruled the new dispensation in the character
    of the Son of 1 Peter 1:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; and as sanctified through
    the truth, John 17:17. In one sense they are at once all equally and
    completely sanctified, they are all washed in the blood of Christ, all
    partakers of His Spirit, and all are of the truth which dwelleth in them,
    which they have of God. Hence Christ is said not only to be made of God unto
    them righteousness, but sanctification. Every believer, from the first
    moment of his new life in Christ, has thus the germ of perfect holiness,
    although sanctification is also represented as a growth in holiness, and
    advancement in conformity to God, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4; 1 Thessalonians
    5:23.
  </p>
  <p>
    Believers are called to follow after holiness, Hebrews 12:14; to mortify
    their members which are upon the earth, engrossed with earthly objects,
    Colossians 3:15; and we are assured that all shall be judged according to
    their works, Revelation 20:12; Galatians 6:7-8; 2 Corinthians 5:10. So that,
    while all boasting is excluded, Christ&#x27;s doctrine is manifestly
    according to godliness.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are also represented as partakers of the heavenly calling. The
    privileges of the Sinai covenant were peculiar to Israel, Amos 3:2; but the
    Gentiles were fellow-heirs, Ephesians 3:6; and therefore the Hebrew
    believers are described as partakers of the heavenly calling. It was not
    exclusively directed to them. In giving of the law God spoke on earth, but
    He now speaketh from heaven. Hebrews 12:25. Believers are frequently
    described as called, Romans 8:28; Romans 16:7; 1 Corinthians 1:24; and here
    described as partakers of the heavenly calling, for it is a call to His
    kingdom and glory, 1 Thessalonians 2:12.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are exhorted to consider Jesus Christ under the character of the
    Apostle and High Priest of our profession. Christ is eminently the sent of
    God. John 6:29; John 6:40; John 17:18. Hence He is termed the Apostle of our
    profession, and is thus contrasted with Moses, whom God sent to deliver
    Israel. Exodus 3:10. While Moses was in an eminent degree the Apostle of God
    to Israel, Aaron was the High Priest; but both these high offices were
    united in Christ, and the Hebrews are here exhorted to consider the Lord
    Jesus as uniting the offices both of an Apostle and a Priest.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 2</h2>
  <p>
    Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in
    all his house.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apostle was far from intending by the contrast to lower the character of
    Moses; on the contrary, he quotes the most honorable testimony borne to him
    in the Scripture, that he was faithful in all his house. He was not only the
    lawgiver of Israel, but the laws were executed under his direction; such was
    the confidence with which the God of Israel was pleased to treat his
    illustrious servant. Aaron and his sister Miriam spoke slightingly of Moses,
    specially condemning his marriage with a woman who was not of the daughters
    of Israel. It is to be observed that this marriage was solemnized before the
    middle wall of partition was set up between Israel and other nations; and
    probably it was a prophetic intimation of the Gentiles by union with Christ
    being admitted into the Church of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the extraordinary meekness of Moses, which is mentioned in connexion
    with their speaking against him, it is probable that he was disposed to pass
    over their presumption; but the Lord was pleased at once to rebuke any
    appearance of rivalry. He suddenly commanded them to stand before the
    tabernacle, and, coming down in the pillar of the cloud, informed them that
    He would communicate His will to the prophets by a vision or a dream. Not so
    with His servant Moses; with him He would speak mouth to mouth, and that he
    should even behold the similitude of the Lord. Probably there is here a
    reference to the manifestation made to Moses on the occasion of the molten
    calf. Exodus 33:11; Exodus 33:21; Exodus 33:23. When this took place, no man
    was to be with him, nor was any to be seen throughout the mount. In the
    close of Deuteronomy we are informed that there arose not a prophet since in
    Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face. Deuteronomy 34:10.
    He was the only lawgiver in Israel; but at length a prophet was raised up
    unto him of their brethren, like unto Moses. Deuteronomy 16:15.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 3</h2>
  <p>
    For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who
    hath builded the house hath more honor than the house.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apostle, in contrasting the old and new dispensations, while he admits
    the glory of the old, observes that it had no glory in comparison of the
    new, 2 Corinthians 3:10; and here he illustrates the inferiority of Moses,
    as constituting a part of that house in the government of which he
    celebrates his faithfulness. Now a house may be very glorious, but it is
    evident that the builder has more honor than the house. It owes its
    magnificence to his skill.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 4</h2>
  <p>
    For every house is builded by some man: but he that built all things is God.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every house is builded by some man; it owes its existence to the skill of
    the architect; while God is the great architect of the universe, and the
    greater the glory of creation the greater the glory of the Creator. Perhaps
    there is here a reference to chap , and10:12 , in order to establish more
    fully the glory of the Son of God, as being the Creator and Proprietor of
    the house over which He presided. This is confirmed by Psalm 115:5-6. He is
    the great Shepherd, who feeds and nourishes His sheep.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 5</h2>
  <p>
    And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a
    testimony of those things which were to be spoken after.
  </p>
  <p>
    And according to the testimony which he had quoted, Moses was faithful in
    all his house, &quot;as a servant,&quot; as had been specifically noticed in
    the testimony borne to his faithfulness.
  </p>
  <p>
    &quot;My servant Moses is not Numbers 12:7. But the house in which Moses was
    &quot;a faithful and wise servant&quot; was erected for the purpose of
    bearing testimony to those things which were afterwards to be spoken.
    &quot;For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope
    did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.&quot; Chap7:19. It was a
    scaffolding for the erection of a building.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Jewish dispensation was a &quot; shadow of good things to come,&quot; of
    the spiritual kingdom which God was afterwards to establish. &quot; he law
    and the prophets,&quot; says Jesus, &quot; were until John: since that time
    the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.&quot; Luke
    16:16. &quot;For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he
    wrote of me.&quot; John 5:46. Moses and the Apostle taught precisely the
    same thing; only Moses taught with a vail on his face, and the Apostle used
    great plainness of speech.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 6</h2>
  <p>
    But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast
    the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    While Moses was faithful as a servant in the house of God, Christ was
    faithful as a Son over His own house. It was erected by His power. He is
    heir of all things, Colossians 1:16; Hebrews 1:2; He is Lord of all. Acts
    10:36. &quot; The Father loveth the John 3:35. &quot;For the Father judgeth
    no John 5:22. All things, without exception, are put under Him, chap2:8 ,
    whose house are we.
  </p>
  <p>
    The house over which He rules is a spiritual house, composed of living
    stones, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, He Himself
    being the chief corner-stone. Christ is the fountain of life to all His
    people, and this life is communicated through faith; in other words, by
    resting on Him, as the stones of a building rest on the foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The loadstone communicates its properties to iron; had it pleased God, it
    might have done so to stone; and we might conceive of a loadstone so
    powerful as to impart its qualities to every stone in the building erected
    upon it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The supposition is realized in the house of God; it rests upon Christ; and,
    by faith, Christ dwells in every heart. &quot;Now,&quot; says one Apostle,
    &quot; we are His house, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of
    the hope firm unto the end.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    Faith, or confidence, and hope are inseparably connected, and, indeed, may
    be used interchangeably. Believers are &quot; begotten again to a lively
    hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,&quot; 1 Peter 1:3;
    and this hope is founded on the immutable promise of God, confirmed by His
    oath. Hebrews 6:17-18.
  </p>
  <p>
    &quot; This is the promise that He hath promised us (believers), even
    eternal life.&quot; 1 John 2:25. &quot;This is the record, that God hath
    given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.&quot; 1 John 5:11.
    Now the Apostle says, &quot; Whose house are we, if we hold fast the
    confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.&quot; As when a
    stone ceases to rest on the foundation, it is no longer a part of the
    building; Hebrews 10:38-39.
