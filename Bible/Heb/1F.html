    <h2>
      Ver 1-2.
      <em
        >Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the

    </h2>
    <p>
      1. All the doctrines of the gospel, especially those concerning the person
      and offices of Christ, are to be improved unto practice in faith and
      obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Dispensers of the gospel ought to use holy prudence in winning upon the
      minds and affections of those whom they are to instruct.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Believers are all related unto one another in the nearest and strictest
      bond of an equal relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. All true and real professors of the gospel are sanctified by the Holy
      Ghost, and made truly and really holy.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. No man comes to a useful, saving knowledge of Jesus Christ in the
      gospel, but by virtue of an effectual heavenly calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The effectual heavenly vocation of believers is their great privilege,
      wherein they have cause to rejoice, and which always ought to mind them of
      their duty unto him that hath called them.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The spiritual mysteries of the gospel, especially those which concern
      the person and offices of Christ, require deep, diligent, and attentive
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The business of God with sinners could be no way transacted but by the
      negotiation and embassy of the Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Especial privileges will not advantage men, without especial grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The Lord Christ is all in all and unto his church, the king, priest,
      and apostle or prophet of it, all in one.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. A diligent, attentive consideration of the person, offices, and work
      of Jesus Christ, is the most effectual means to free the souls of men from
      all entanglements of errors and darkness, and to keep them constant in the
      profession of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The union of believers lies in their joint of faith in the person and
      offices of Christ, upon a participation in the same heavenly calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The ordering of all things in the church depends on the sovereign
      appointment of the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. The faithfulness of the Lord Christ in the discharge of the trust
      committed unto him is the great ground of faith and assurance unto
      believers, in the worship of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. All things concerning the worship of God in the whole church or house,
      now under the gospel, are no less completely and perfectly ordered and
      ordained by the Lord Jesus Christ than they were by Moses under the law.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3-6.
      <em
        >For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who
        built the house has more honor than the house. For every house is built
        by someone; but he who built all things is God. Moses indeed was
        faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things
        which were afterward to be spoken, but Christ is faithful as a Son over
        his house. We are his house, if we hold fast our confidence and the
        glorying of our hope firm to the end.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Every one who is employed in the service of God in his house, and is
      faithful in the discharge of his work and trust therein, is worthy of
      honor. So was Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That the Lord Christ is worthy of all glory and honor upon the account
      of his thus building his church, the house of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The honor and glory of all that ever were, or all that ever shall be,
      employed in the work and service of the house of God, jointly and
      severally considered, is inferior, subordinate, and subservient to the
      glory and honor of Jesus Christ, the chief builder of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The building of the church is so great and glorious a work as that it
      could not be effected by any but him who is God.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The greatest and most honorable of the sons of men, that are employed
      in the work of God in his house, are but servants and part of the house
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The great end of all Mosaic institutions, was to present, or prefigure,
      and give testimony unto the grace of the gospel by Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It is an eminent privilege to be of the house of Christ, or a part of
      that house: “Whose house are we.”
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The greatness of this privilege requires an answerableness of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. In times of trial and persecution, freedom, boldness, and constancy in
      profession, are a good evidence unto ourselves that we are living stones
      in the house of God, and are duties acceptable unto him.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Interest in the gospel gives sufficient cause of confidence and
      rejoicing in every condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. So many and great are the interveniences and temptations that lie in
      the way of profession, so great is the number of them that decay in it or
      apostatize from it, that as unto the glory of God, and the principal
      discovery of its truth and sincerity, it is to be taken from its
      permanency unto the end.
