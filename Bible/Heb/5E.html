    <h2>E. Same Yesterday, Today, Forever (13:8-14)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 8.
      <em>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The due consideration of Jesus Christ, especially in his eternity,
      immutability, and indeficiency in his power, as he is always the same, is
      the great encouragement of believers in their whole profession of the
      faith, and in all the difficulties they may meet withal upon the account
      thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. As no changes formerly made in the institution of divine worship
      altered any thing in the faith of the church with respect unto Christ, for
      he was and is still the same; so no necessitudes we may meet withal in our
      profession, by oppression or persecution, ought in the least to shake us,
      for Christ is still the same to protect, relieve, and deliver us.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. He that can in the way of his duty on all occasions retreat to Jesus
      Christ, and unto the due consideration of his person in the discharge of
      his office, will not fail of relief, support, and consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. A steadfast cleaving unto the truth concerning the person and office of
      Christ will preserve us from hearkening to various and strange doctrines,
      perverting our souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Jesus Christ from the beginning of the world, that is, from the giving
      of the first promise, was the object of the faith of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is the immutability and eternity of Jesus Christ in his divine
      person, that renders him a meet object of the faith of the church in the
      discharge of his office.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 9.
      <em
        >Don’t be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good
        that the heart be established by grace, not by foods, through which
        those who were so occupied were not benefited.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There is a revelation of truth given to the church in the word of God,
      which is its only doctrinal foundation and rule of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. This doctrine is cognate and every way suited to the promotion of the
      grace of God in believers, and the attainment of their own salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Doctrines unsuited to this first revelation by Christ and his apostles,
      as recorded in the Scripture, did soon spring up, unto the trouble of the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Usually such doctrines as are empty of truth and substance, useless and
      foreign to the nature and genius of evangelical grace and truth, are
      imposed by their authors and abettors with a great noise and vehemence on
      those who have been instructed in the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Where such doctrines are entertained, they make men double-minded,
      unstable, turning them from the truth, and drawing them at length into
      perdition.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The ruin of the church in after ages arose from the neglect of this
      apostolical caution, in giving heed to various and strange doctrines,
      which at length overthrew and excluded the fundamental doctrines of the
      gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Herein lies the safety of all believers and of all churches, namely, to
      keep themselves precisely unto the first complete revelation of divine
      truth in the word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. They who decline in any thing from grace, as the only means to
      establish their hearts in peace with God, shall labor and exercise
      themselves in other things to the same end, whereby they shall receive no
      advantage.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 10.
      <em
        >We have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no
        right to eat.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The Lord Christ in the one sacrifice of himself is the only altar of
      the church of the new testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. This altar is every way sufficient in itself for the ends of an altar,
      namely, the sanctification of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The erection of any other altar in the church, or the introduction of
      any other sacrifice requiring a material altar, is derogatory to the
      sacrifice of Christ, and exclusive of him from being our altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Whereas the design of the apostle, in the whole of his discourse, is to
      declare the glory of the gospel and its worship above that of the law, of
      our priest above theirs, of our sacrifice above theirs, of our altar above
      theirs, it is fond to think that by “our altar” he intends such a material
      fabric as is every way inferior to that of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. When God appointed a material altar for his service, he himself
      enjoined the making of it, prescribed its form and use, with all its
      utensils, services, and ceremonies, allowing of nothing in it or about it
      but what was by himself appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Sinners under a sense of guilt have in the gospel an altar of
      atonement, whereunto they may have continual access for the expiation of
      their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. All privileges, of what nature soever, without a participation of
      Christ, as the altar and sacrifice of the church, are of no advantage to
      them that enjoy them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 11-12.
      <em
        >For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy
        place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of
        the camp. Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people
        through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The complete answering and fulfilling of all types in the person and
      office of Christ testifieth the sameness and immutability of the counsel
      of God in the whole work of the redemption and salvation of the church,
      notwithstanding all the outward changes that have been in the institutions
      of divine worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The church could no otherwise be sanctified but by the blood of Jesus,
      the Son of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Lord Jesus, out of his incomprehensible love to his people, would
      spare nothing, avoid nothing, deny nothing, that was needful to their
      sanctification, their reconciliation, and dedication to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. There was, by divine constitution, a concurrence in the same work of
      suffering and offering, that satisfaction unto the law and its curse might
      be made by it, as penal in a way of suffering and atonement, or
      reconciliation with God by the way of a sacrifice or offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The whole church is perfectly sanctified by the offering of the blood
      of Christ as to impetration; and it shall be so actually, by virtue of the
      same blood in its application.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. When the Lord Jesus carried all the sins of his own people in his own
      body unto the tree, he left the city, as a type of all unbelievers, under
      the wrath and curse of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Going out of the city as a malefactor, he bore all the reproach that
      was due to the sins of the church, which was a part of the curse.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 13-14.
      <em
        >Let’s therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his
        reproach. For we don’t have here an enduring city, but we seek that
        which is to come.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. All privileges and advantages whatever are to be foregone, parted
      withal, and renounced, which are inconsistent with an interest in Christ
      and a participation of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. If it were the duty of the Hebrews to forsake those ways of worship
      which were originally of divine institution, that they might wholly give
      up themselves unto Christ in all things pertaining unto God, much more is
      it ours to forego all such pretences unto religious worship as are of
      human invention. 3. Whereas the camp contained not only ecclesiastical but
      also political privileges, we ought to be ready to forego all civil
      accommodations also, in houses, lands, possessions, converse with men of
      the same nation, when we are called thereunto on the account of Christ and
      the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. If we will go forth to Christ as without the camp, or separated from
      all the concerns of this world, we shall assuredly meet with all sorts of
      reproaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Believers are not like to meet with any such encouraging entertainment
      in this world as to make them unready or unwilling to desert it, and go
      forth after Christ, bearing his reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. This world never did nor ever will give a state of rest and
      satisfaction to believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. In the destitution of a present satisfactory rest, God hath not left
      believers without a prospect of that which shall afford them rest and
      satisfaction to eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. As God hath prepared a city of rest for us, so it is our duty
      continually to endeavor the attainment of it in the ways of his
      appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The main business of believers in this world is diligently to seek
      after the city of God, or the attainment of eternal rest with him; and
      this is the character whereby they may be known.
