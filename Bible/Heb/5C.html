    <p>
      1. Unbelief under the preaching of the gospel is the great, and in some
      respect the only damning sin, as being accompanied with, yea, consisting
      in, the last and utmost contempt of the authority of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. There is in all sins and disobedience a rejection of the authority of
      God in giving of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. No sinner can escape divine vengeance if he be tried and judged
      according to the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is the duty of the ministers of the gospel diligently and
      effectively to declare the nature of unbelief, with the heinousness of its
      guilt above all other sins whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is the duty of ministers to declare the nature of unbelief, not only
      with respect to them who are open and avowed unbelievers, to convince them
      of the danger wherein they are, but also to all professors whatever, and
      to maintain an especial sense of it on their own minds and consciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. This is the issue whereunto things are brought between God and sinners
      wherever the gospel is preached, namely, whether they will hear the Lord
      Christ or turn away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The grace, goodness, and mercy of God, will not be more illustrious and
      glorious to all eternity in the salvation of believers by Jesus Christ,
      than his justice, holiness, and severity will be in the condemnation of
      unbelievers.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The sovereign authority and mighty power of Christ are gloriously
      manifested in that signal change and alteration which he made in the
      heavens and earth of the church, in its state and worship, by the
      promulgation of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. God was pleased to give testimony to the greatness and glory of this
      work, by the great commotions in heaven and earth wherewith it was
      accompanied.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. It was a mighty work, to introduce the gospel among the nations of the
      earth, seeing their gods and heavens were to be shaken and removed
      thereby.
    </p>

        >Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that can’t be shaken, let’s have grace,

    <p>
      1. Such is the nature and use of all divine or theological truths, that
      the teaching of them ought constantly to be applied and improved to
      practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The privileges which believers receive by the gospel are inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Believers are not to be measured by their outward state and appearance
      of things in the world, but by the interest they have in that kingdom
      which it is their Father’s pleasure to give them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is assuredly their duty in all things to behave themselves as
      becomes those who receive such privileges and dignity from God himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The obligation from hence unto the duty of serving God is evident and
      unavoidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Spiritual things and mercies do constitute the most glorious kingdom
      that is in the world, even the kingdom of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. This is the only kingdom that never shall and never can be moved,
      however hell and the world do rage against it.
    </p>
    <p>8. Without grace we cannot serve God at all.</p>
    <p>9. Without grace in actual exercise we cannot serve God acceptably.</p>
    <p>
      10. To have an increase in grace, as unto its degrees and measures, and to
      keep it in exercise in all duties of the service of God, is a duty
      required of believers by virtue of all the gospel privileges which they
      receive from God.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. This is the great apostolical canon for the due performance of divine
      worship, namely, “Let us have grace to do it;” all others are needless and
      superfluous.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. However God takes us near unto himself in covenant, whereby he is our
      God, yet he requires that we always retain due apprehensions of the
      holiness of his nature, the severity of his justice against sinners, and
      his ardent jealousy concerning his worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The consideration of these things, and the dread of being by guilt
      obnoxious unto their terrible consuming effects, ought to influence our
      minds unto reverence and godly fear, in all acts and parts of divine
      worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. We may learn how great our care and diligence about the serving of God
      ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. The holiness and jealousy of God, which are a cause of insupportable
      terror unto convinced sinners, driving them from him, have towards
      believers only a gracious influence unto that fear and reverence which
      causes them to cleave more firmly unto him.
