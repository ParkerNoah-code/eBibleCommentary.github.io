  <h2>Verse 7</h2>
  <p>Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye will hear his voice.</p>
  <p>
    Wherefore.—From the consideration of the privileges connected with keeping
    the faith, the Apostle delivers a very solemn exhortation, in a quotation
    from 1 Corinthians 2:13. The Psalm referred to was written by David, Hebrews
    4:7; but &quot; the Spirit of the Lord spake by him, and his word was in his
    tongue.&quot; 2 Samuel 23:2. To this also our Lord testifies, in the
    question which He asked the Pharisees, how David called Messiah Lord. David
    might have spoken erroneously; but David, in or by the Spirit, called Him
    Lord. He is the Spirit of truth, and therefore must here, as on every other
    occasion, have spoken truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    The words of the Holy Ghost, to which the Apostle directs the attention of
    the Jude 1:5. They are described as having tempted the Lord ten times, and
    not hearkened to His voice. Numbers 14:22. But, after they had got
    possession of the land, they are warned &quot; today&quot; to listen to the
    voice of God, which evidently implies that their entrance into Canaan did
    not supersede the necessity of the exhortation. We are taught that
    Israel&#x27;s provocations and punishment are recorded for our admonition,
    on whom the ends of the world are come. 1 Corinthians 10:11.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 8</h2>
  <p>
    Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in
    the wilderness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Men not listening to the voice of God proceeds from the hardness of their
    hearts, which, as appears from the conduct of the Israelites, will too
    frequently neither be melted by kindness nor subdued by suffering.
    Israel&#x27;s conduct in the wilderness was a tissue of provocations. The
    object which God had in view in all His dealings with them was to humble
    them and to prove them, and to know what was in their hearts, whether they
    would keep his commandments or no. Deuteronomy 8:3. Now the Apostle warns
    the Hebrew believers by their example not to harden their hearts and provoke
    God, as their fathers had done in the wilderness, in the day of temptation.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 9</h2>
  <p>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</p>
  <p>
    We have seen that God&#x27;s object in his dealings with Israel was to prove
    them, and bring out the hidden evil of their heart; but we are warned
    against tempting the Lord. Israel had many proofs of the long-suffering of
    God; but, instead of its leading them to repentance, it emboldened them in
    sin. Presuming upon His long-suffering, they seemed to be trying how far it
    would extend. Now we are particularly cautioned against tempting the Lord.
    We are to cherish the most entire conviction of His perfection, and to place
    the most unlimited confidence in Him, which necessarily implies our being
    guided in all things by His wisdom. The day of temptation may refer to the
    whole period of their sojourning in the wilderness. During that period God
    was proving them, bringing out what was in their heart, while by their
    rebellion they constantly provoked Him.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 10</h2>
  <p>
    Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err
    in their heart; and they have not known my ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here we have the result of Israel&#x27;s provocations and temptations of
    God. He &quot; was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always
    err in their heart, and have not known my ways.&quot; They were so blinded
    by their love of sin, that they always erred in heart, and refused to be
    guided by Him. It is the character of the wicked that they know not God; and
    such was the case with the generation whose carcases fell in the wilderness.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 11</h2>
  <p>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</p>
  <p>
    So I sware in my wrath...—In consequence of which, God sware in His wrath
    that they should not enter into His rest. We have a full account of what God
    said on this occasion, Numbers 14:28-35. The expression here is elliptical,
    &quot;If they shall enter into my rest.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    Our translators have given the meaning correctly. It is an oath; God swears
    by Himself. &quot;I am not God if they shall enter into my rest.&quot;
