        Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em
        >to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by
        interpretation, “king of righteousness”, and then also “king of Salem”,
        which means “king of peace”,</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither
        beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God),
        remains a priest continually.</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em
        >Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham the patriarch
        gave a tenth out of the best plunder.</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em
        >They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have a
        commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that
        is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of
        Abraham,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6.
      <em

        from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.</em
      >

    <h2>
      Ver 7.

    <h2>
      Ver 9-10.
      <em
        >We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has
        paid tithes, for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek
        met him.</em
