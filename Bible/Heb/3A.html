    <h2>A. Melchizedek and Abraham (7:1-10)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 1-3.
      <em
        >For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met
        Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, to
        whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by

    <p>
      1. When truths in themselves mysterious, and of great importance unto the
      church, are asserted or declared, it is very necessary that clear evidence
      and demonstration be given unto them, that the minds of men be left
      neither in the dark about their meaning, nor in suspense about their
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. God can raise the greatest light in the midst of the greatest darkness,
      as Mat 4:16.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. He can raise up instruments for his service and unto his glory, when,
      where, and how he pleaseth.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The signal prefiguration of Christ in the nations of the world, at the
      same time when Abraham received the promises for himself and his
      posterity, gave a pledge, and assurance of the certain future call of the
      Gentiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Lord Christ, as king of the church, is plentifully stored with all
      spiritual provisions, for the relief, support, and refreshment of all
      believers in and under their duties, and will give it out unto them as
      their occasions do require.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Those who go to Christ merely on the account of his priestly office and
      the benefits thereof, shall also receive the blessings of his kingly
      power, in abundant supplies of mercy and grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. God in his sovereign pleasure gives various intervals unto places, as
      to the enjoyment of his worship and ordinances.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Acts of munificence and bounty are memorable and praiseworthy, though
      they no way belong unto things sacred by virtue of divine institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. It is acceptable with God, that those who have labored in any work or
      service of his should receive refreshments and encouragements from men.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Every one is that in the church, and nothing else, which God is
      pleased to make him so to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Where God calleth any one unto a singular honor and office in his
      church, it is in him a mere act of his sovereign grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. A divine call is a sufficient warrant for the acting of them according
      unto it who are so called, and for the obedience of others unto them in
      their work or office.
    </p>
    <p>13. The first personal instituted type of Christ was a priest.</p>
    <p>
      14. To keep up and preserve a due reverence of God in our minds and words,
      we should think of and use those holy titles which are given to him and
      whereby he is described in the Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. It is good at all times to fix our faith on that in God which is meet
      to encourage our obedience and dependence upon him in our present
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. It is a matter of inestimable satisfaction that he whom we serve is
      the most high God, the sovereign possessor of heaven and earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. Public profession in all ages is to be suited and pointed against the
      opposition that is made unto the truth, or apostasy from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. All the commotions and concussions that are among the nations of the
      world do lie in, or shall be brought into, a subserviency unto the
      interest of Christ and his church.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. Whatever be the interest, duty, and office of any to act in the name
      of others toward God, in any sacred administrations, the same
      proportionately is their interest, power, and duty to act towards them in
      the name of God in the blessing of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. He who hath received the greatest mercies and privileges in this world
      may yet need their ministerial confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. In the blessing of Abraham by Melchisedec, all believers are virtually
      blessed by Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. It is God’s institution that makes all our administrations effectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. Whatsoever we receive signally from God in a way of mercy, we ought to
      return a portion of it unto him in a way of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      24. The church never did in any age, nor ever shall, want that instruction
      by divine revelation which is needful to its edification in faith and
      obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      25. It is a great honor to serve in the church, by doing or suffering, for
      the use and service of future generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      26. The Scripture is so absolutely the rule, measure, and boundary of our
      faith and knowledge in spiritual things, as that what it conceals is
      instructive, as well as what it expresseth.
    </p>
    <p>
      27. When any were of old designed to be types of Christ, there was a
      necessity that things more excellent and glorious should be spoken of them
      than did properly belong unto them.
    </p>
    <p>
      28. All that might be spoken, so as to have any probable application in
      any sense unto things and persons typically, coming short of what was to
      be fulfilled in Christ, the Holy Ghost in his infinite wisdom supplied
      that defect, by ordering the account which he gives of them so as more
      might be apprehended and learned from them than could be expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      29. That Christ abiding a priest for ever, hath no more a vicar, or
      successor, or substitute in his office, or any deriving a real priesthood
      from him, than had Melchisedec.
    </p>
    <p>
      30. The whole mystery of divine wisdom, expressing all inconceivable
      perfections, centered in the person of Christ, to make him a meet,
      glorious, and most excellent priest unto God in the behalf of the church.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 4-5.
      <em
        >Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham the patriarch
        gave a tenth out of the best plunder. They indeed of the sons of Levi
        who receive the priest’s office have a commandment to take tithes from
        the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though
        these have come out of the body of Abraham,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It will be fruitless, and to no advantage, to propose or declare the
      most important truths of the gospel, if those to whom they are proposed do
      not diligently inquire into them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The sovereign will, pleasure, and grace of God, is that alone which
      puts a difference among men, especially in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Whereas even Abraham himself gave the tenth of all to Melchisedec, the
      highest privilege exempts not any from the obligation unto and performance
      of the meanest duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Opportunities for duty which render it beautiful ought diligently to be
      embraced.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. When the instituted use of consecrated things ceaseth, the things
      themselves cease to be sacred or of esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Rule, institution, and command, without regard to unrequired humility,
      or pleas of greater zeal and self-denial, unless in evident and cogent
      circumstances, are the best preservatives of order and duty in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It is the duty of those who are employed in sacred ministrations to
      receive what the Lord Christ hath appointed for their supportment, and in
      the way of his appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It is God’s prerogative to give dignity and pre-eminence in the church
      among them which are otherwise equal, and this must be acquiesced in.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. No privilege can exempt persons from subjection unto any of God’s
      institutions, though they were of the loins of Abraham.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6-8.
      <em
        >but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes
        from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises. But without any
        dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. Here people who die
        receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified
        that he lives.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. We can be made partakers of no such grace, mercy, or privilege in this
      world, but that God can, when he pleaseth, make an addition thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is the blessing of Christ, typified in and by that of Melchisedec,
      that makes promises and mercies effectual unto us.
    </p>
    <p>3. Free and sovereign grace is the only foundation of all privileges.</p>
    <p>
      4. It is a great mercy and privilege, when God will make use of any in the
      blessing of others with spiritual mercies.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Those who are appointed to bless others in the name of God, and thereby
      exalted unto a pre-eminence above those that are blessed by his
      appointment, ought to be accordingly regarded by all that are so blessed
      by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Let those who are so appointed take heed that, by their miscarriage,
      they prove not a curse to them whom they ought to bless.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. In the outward administration of his worship, God is pleased to make
      use of poor, frail, mortal, dying men.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The life of the church depends on the everlasting life of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. They who receives tithes of others, for their work in holy
      administrations, are thereby proved to be superior to them of whom they do
      receive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. It is of great concern to us what covenant we do belong to, as being
      esteemed to do therein what is done by our representative in our name.
