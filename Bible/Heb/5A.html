    <h1>A. Disciplined and Holy (12:4-17)</h1>
    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em>You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.</em>
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em
        >You have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with
        children, “My son, don’t take lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor
        faint when you are reproved by him;</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6.
      <em
        >for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and chastises every son whom
        he receives.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with
        children, for what son is there whom his father doesn’t discipline?</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 8.
      <em
        >But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made
        partakers, then you are illegitimate, and not children.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 9.
      <em
        >Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid
        them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of
        spirits and live?</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 10.
      <em
        >For they indeed for a few days disciplined us as seemed good to them,
        but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 11.
      <em
        >All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet
        afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who
        have been trained by it.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 12-13.
      <em
        >Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees, and
        make straight paths for your feet, so what is lame may not be
        dislocated, but rather be healed.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 14.
      <em
        >Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which
        no man will see the Lord,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 15.
      <em
        >looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of
        God, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and many be
        defiled by it,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 16.
      <em

        who sold his birthright for one meal.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 17.
      <em
        >For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the
        blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind
        though he sought it diligently with tears.</em
