      1. It is the way of the Spirit of God, to excite us unto especial duties,
      by proposing unto us and reminding us of such properties of God as the
      consideration whereof may in an especial manner incline us unto them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The life and power of Christ are continually exercised about the
      concerns of the souls of professors.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The power of Christ in his word is irresistible, as to whatever effects
      he doth design in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Though men may close and hide things from themselves and others, yet
      they cannot exclude the power of Christ in his word from piercing into
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Lord Christ discerneth all inward and spiritual things, in order to
      his present and future judgment of those things, and the persons in whom
      they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is no trouble or labor to the Word of God to discern all creatures,
      and all that is of them and in them, seeing that there is nothing but is
      evidently apparent, open, and naked, under his all-seeing eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It is a great and difficult matter really and practically to convince
      professors of the practical judging omniscience of Jesus Christ in the
      word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. That the beginnings or entrances into declensions in profession, or
      backslidings from Christ and the gospel, are secret, deep, and hardly
      discoverable.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. A due and holy consideration at all times of the all-seeing eye of
      Jesus Christ is a great preservative against blackslidings or declensions
      in profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. A due and holy consideration of the omnisciency of Christ is a great
      encouragement unto the meanest and weakest believers, who are upright and
      sincere in their faith and obedience.
