  <h2>Verse 13</h2>
  <p>
    Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all
    things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apostle had been treating of the Word of God, but here he passes to God
    himself, and declares that all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of
    Him with whom we have to do; or, as some render it, to whom we must give
    account.
