    <h2>Author</h2>
    <p>
      The author of the epistle does not mention his name. Many suppositions
      have been made as to who the author might have been: Paul, Luke, Barnabas
      (so says Tertullian), Apollos (so says Martin Luther), Silas or even
      Aquila and Priscilla have been suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the modern scientists refuse to accept Paul as the author because
      the contents, structure and language of the epistle are not typical for
      him. And yet the old Alexandrian tradition ascribes this epistle to the
      apostle Paul. The fact that the author knew Timothy well (Heb 13:23) and
      that Peter who also wrote to Jewish Christians mentions an epistle of Paul
      to them (2 Pet 3:15) speak for the Alexandrian tradition. However, the
      addressees of the epistle were Jewish Christians in Palestine whereas
      Peter wrote to the scattered strangers (1 Pet 1:1) who lived outside
      Palestine. If Paul was the author one reason for not mentioning his name
      might be that he was an apostle to the nations whereas Peter was an
      apostle to the Jews (Gal 2:7-8).
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, the author of the epistle remains unknown. The Holy
      Spirit who inspired this epistle deliberately wanted to introduce the Lord
      Jesus only as apostle and high priest of our profession (Heb 3:1). The
      church father Origen (around 185 to 254 AD) appropriately wrote: Only God
      knows in truth who the author is.
    </p>
    <h2>Date</h2>
    <p>
      The opinions regarding the time of writing differ as much as they do in
      respect to the authorship of the epistle. It is certain though that a
      writing of Clement of Rome (around 95 AD) shows many references from the
      epistle to the Hebrews. From Hebrews itself we see that the Old Testament
      service of offerings in the temple was still in existence (Heb 9:6-7;
      10:11). The temple and the city of Jerusalem were destroyed by the Roman
      general and later emperor Titus in the year 70 AD. Many who refuse Paul's
      authorship conclude for reason of Hebrews 2:3 and 13:7 that the epistle
      must not have been written for some time after the apostles' death. Saying
      this, they obviously overlook the fact that the apostle Paul himself did
      not belong to the apostles who had seen and heard the Lord Jesus during
      His ministry.
    </p>
    <h2>Audience, Occasion, and Background</h2>
    <p>
      The epistle starts off as a written sermon and closes in the form of an
      epistle. Neither author nor addressee is mentioned in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The title "to the Hebrews" only appears in the 2nd century with Clemens of
      Alexandria (around 150 - 215 AD). As there is no other name known for the
      epistle it probably goes back to a very old tradition. But who were these
      Hebrews, and where did they live?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hebrews" is a name for the Israelites and for the descendants of Abraham
      (cf Gen 14:13; Phil 3:5). And yet the epistle cannot have received its
      name for the fact only that there are so many references to the OT in it.
      The addressees must not only have been very familiar with the OT, but they
      are also frequently addressed as originating from the people of Israel. To
      this fact such expressions as "the fathers", "the prophets" (Heb 1:1),
      "the elders" (Heb 11:2) would point. Also, the mention of Moses, Joshua,
      and Aaron, who all belonged to the chosen people of God, confirm the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      The addressees however had concluded that God's way of salvation was not
      the divine service of the OT but faith in the Lord Jesus Christ (Heb
      2:1-4; 3:1; 3:6; 4:1-2; 4:14-16; 6:1-3; 10:13-25). The apostle Paul calls
      such Christians "a remnant according to the election of grace" (Rom
      11:1-5). These Christians however were partially in danger to withdraw
      from Christendom and to go back to Judaism because of the heavy outward
      pressure of persecution (Heb 6:4-8; 10:26-31). Those who were to fall away
      had professed to be Christians but had no true faith in the Savior Jesus
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast to "the scattered strangers" that are the converted Jews of
      the Diaspora (see 1 Pet 1:1) the addressees of the epistle to the Hebrews
      lived in Palestine (Heb 10:11; 10:34; cf Acts 8:1). They were taught,
      admonished, and encouraged by this epistle.
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
    <p>
      This, in a word, was to instruct Jewish believers that Judaism had been
      superseded by Christianity. Unlike the Gentiles, who, for long centuries
      past, had lost knowledge of the true God, and, in consequence, worshipped
      idols, the Jews had a Divine religion, and a Divinely appointed place of
      worship. To be called upon to forsake these, which had been venerated by
      their fathers for over a thousand years, was to make a big demand upon
      them. It was natural that even those among them who had savingly believed
      on Christ should want to retain the forms and ceremonies amid which they
      had been brought up; the more so, seeing that the Temple still stood, and
      the Levitical priesthood still functioned. An endeavor had been made to
      link Christianity on to Judaism, and as Acts 21:20 tells us there were
      many thousands of the early Jewish Christians who were "zealous of the
      law"—as the next verses clearly show, the ceremonial law.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to their natural prejudices, the temporal circumstances of the
      believing Jews became increasingly discouraging, yea, presented a sore
      temptation for them to abandon the profession of Christianity. We can
      scarcely realize the piercing sword which thus wounded their inmost heart.
      That by clinging to the Messiah they were to be severed from Messiah's
      people, was, indeed, a great and perplexing trial; that for the hope of
      Israel's glory they were banished from the place which God had chosen, and
      where the divine Presence was revealed, and the symbols and ordinances had
      been the joy and strength of their fathers; that they were to be no longer
      children of the covenant and of the house, but worse than Gentiles,
      excluded from the outer court, cut off from the commonwealth of Israel.
      This was indeed a sore and mysterious trial. Cleaving to the promises made
      unto their fathers, cherishing the hope in constant prayer that their
      nation would yet accept the Messiah, it was the severest test to which
      their faith could be put, when their loyalty to Jesus involved separation
      from all the sacred rights and privileges of Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the need for an authoritative, lucid, and systematic setting forth of
      the real relation of Christianity to Judaism was a pressing one. Satan
      would not miss the opportunity of seeking to persuade these Hebrews that
      their faith in Jesus of Nazareth was a mistake, a delusion, a sin. Were
      they right, while the vast majority of their brethren, according to the
      flesh, among whom were almost all the respected members of the Sanhedrim
      and the priesthood, wrong? Had God prospered them since they had become
      followers of the crucified One? or, did not their temporal circumstances
      evidence that He was most displeased with them? Their situation was
      critical, and there was an urgent need that their faith should be
      strengthened, their understanding enlightened, and a fuller explanation be
      given them of Christianity in the light of the Old Testament. It was to
      meet this need that God, in His tender mercy, moved His servant to write
      this Epistle to them.
    </p>
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
      In several noticeable respects Hebrews differs from all the other Epistles
      of the New Testament. The name of the writer is omitted, there is no
      opening salutation, the ones to whom it was first specifically and locally
      sent are not mentioned. On the positive side we may note, that the typical
      teachings of the Old Testament are expounded here at greater length than
      elsewhere; the priesthood of Christ is opened up, fully, only in this
      Epistle; the warnings against apostasy are more frequent and more solemn,
      and the calls to steadfastness and perseverance are more emphatic and
      numerous than in any other New Testament book. All of these things are
      accounted for by the fleshly nationality of those addressed, and the
      circumstances they were then in. Unless we keep these features steadily in
      mind, not a little in this Epistle will necessarily remain obscure and
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the language used, the figures employed, the references made, are
      only intelligible in the light of the Old Testament Scriptures, on which
      Judaism was based. Except this be kept before us, such expressions as
      "purged our sins" (Heb 1:3), "there remaineth therefore a Sabbath-keeping
      to the people of God" (Heb 4:9), "leaving the principles of the doctrine
      of Christ, let us go on unto perfection" (Heb 6:1), "our bodies washed
      with pure water" (Heb 10:22), "we have an altar" (Heb 13:10), etc., will
      remain unintelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time that Christ is referred to in this Epistle it is as seated
      at "the right hand of the Majesty on high" (Heb 1:3), for it is with a
      heavenly Christ that Christianity has to do: note the other reference in
      this Epistle to the same fact—Hebrews 1:13, 8:1, 10:12, 12:2. In perfect
      accord with Hebrews 1:3, which strikes the keynote of the Epistle, in
      addition to the heavenly Christ, reference is made to "the heavenly
      calling" (Heb 3:1), to "the heavenly gift" (Heb 6:4), to "heavenly things"
      (Heb 8:5), to "the heavenly Country" (Heb 11:16), to the "heavenly
      Jerusalem" (Heb 12:22), and to "the church of the Firstborn, whose names
      are written in Heaven" (Heb 12:23). This emphasis is easily understood
      when we remember that our Epistle is addressed to those whose inheritance,
      religious relationships, and hopes, had been all earthly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Hebrews 13:22 there is a striking word which defines the character of
      this Epistle: "And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of
      exhortation, for I have written a letter unto you in few words." Upon this
      verse Saphir has well said, "The central idea of the Epistle is the glory
      of the New Covenant, contrasted with and excelling the glory of the old
      covenant; and while this idea is developed in a systematic manner, yet the
      aim of the writer throughout is eminently and directly practical.
      Everywhere his object is exhortation. He never loses sight of the dangers
      and wants of his brethren. The application to conscience and life is never
      forgotten. It is rather a sermon than an exposition... In all his
      arguments, in every doctrine, in every illustration, the central aim of
      the Epistle is kept prominent—the exhortation to steadfastness."
    </p>
    <p>
      What has just been said above accounts for what we find in Hebrews 11.
      Nowhere else in the Bible do we find such a lengthy and complete
      description of the life of faith. But here a whole chapter, the longest in
      the Epistle, is devoted to it. The reason for this is not far to seek.
      Brought up in a system with an elaborate ritual, whose worship was
      primarily a matter of outward symbols and ceremonies; tempted as few ever
      have been to walk by sight, there was a special and most pressing need for
      a clear and detailed analysis and description of what it means to "walk by
      faith." Inasmuch as "example is better than precept," better because more
      easily grasped and because making a more powerful appeal to the heart, the
      Holy Spirit saw well to develop this important theme by an appeal to the
      history of saints recorded in the Scriptures of the Hebrews.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Themes</h2>
    <p>
      Faith: Throughout Scripture faith means more than trust in Jesus for
      personal safety. This is the central point, but we must take care that we
      understand it in a true and deep manner. Faith, as the apostle explains in
      the Epistle to the Corinthians, is looking at the things which are not
      seen and temporal: it is preferring spiritual and eternal realities to the
      things of time, sense, and sin; it is leaning on God and realizing His
      Word; it is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
      seen. Thus, every doctrine and illustration of this Epistle goes straight
      to the heart and conscience, appeals to life, addresses itself to faith.
      It is one continued and sustained fervent and intense appeal to cleave to
      Jesus, the High Priest; to the substantial, true, and real worship. A most
      urgent and loving exhortation to be steadfast, patient, hopeful, in the
      presence of God, in the love and sympathy of the Lord Jesus, in the
      fellowship of the great cloud of witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warnings against apostacy: Throughout this Epistle there are repeated
      warnings against apostasy. The most solemn and searching exhortations
      against the danger of falling away to be found anywhere in Holy Writ were
      given to these, Hebrews 2:1-3, most of chapters 3 and 4, Hebrews 6:4-6,
      10:26-29, 12:15-17. The disappointing of the hopes the Hebrews had
      cherished, the persecutions they were then enduring, and the Divine
      judgment which was on the very eve of falling on Jerusalem in AD 70 made
      them imperative.
