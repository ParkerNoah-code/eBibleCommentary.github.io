      Ver 4.
      <em
        >By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,
        through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God
        testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead,
        still speaks.</em

    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em
        >By faith Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldnâ€™t see death, and he
        was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony
        given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to
        God.</em

      Ver 6.
      <em
        >Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who
        comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of
        those who seek him.</em

        condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is
        according to faith.</em
