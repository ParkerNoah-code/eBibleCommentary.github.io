    <p>
      1. No faith will carry us through the difficulties of our profession from
      oppositions within and without, giving us constancy and perseverance
      therein unto the end, but that only which gives the good things hoped for
      a real subsistence in our minds and souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The peculiar specifical nature of faith, whereby it is differenced from
      all other powers, acts, and graces in the mind, lies in this, that it
      makes a life on things invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The glory of our religion is, that it depends on and is resolved into
      invisible things.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Great objections are apt to lie against invisible things when they are
      externally revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is faith alone that takes believers out of this world while they are
      in it, that exalts them above it while they are under its rage, and
      enables them to live upon things future and invisible.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em>For by this, the elders obtained approval.</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Instances or examples are the most powerful confirmations of practical
      truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. They who have a good testimony from God shall never want reproaches
      from the world. 3. It is faith alone which, from the beginning of the
      world (or from the giving of the first promise), was the means and way of
      obtaining acceptance with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The faith of true believers from the beginning of the world was fixed
      on things future, hoped for, and invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. That faith whereby men please God acts itself in a fixed contemplation
      on things future and invisible, from whence it derives encouragement and
      strength to endure and abide firm in profession against all oppositions
      and persecutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. However men may be despised, vilified, and reproached in the world, yet
      if they have faith, if they are true believers, they are accepted with
      God, and he will give them a good report.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of

        visible.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. They who firmly assent unto divine revelation do understand the
      creation of the world, as to its truth, its season, its cause, its manner,
      and end.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Faith puts forth its power in our minds in a due manner, when it gives
      us clear and distinct apprehensions of the things we do believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. As Godâ€™s first work was perfect, so all his works shall be perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The aid of reason, with the due consideration of the nature, use, and
      end of all things, ought to be admitted of, to confirm our minds in the
      persuasion of the original creation of all things.
