    <h2>
      Ver 8-9.
      <em
        >But of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The
        scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom. You have loved
        righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed
        you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.”</em

        >And, “You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth.
        The heavens are the works of your hands. They will perish, but you
        continue. They all will grow old like a garment does. You will roll them
        up like a mantle, and they will be changed; but you are the same. Your
        years won’t fail.”</em
