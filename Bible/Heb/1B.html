    <p>1. Every thing in Scripture is instructive.</p>
    <p>
      2. It is lawful to draw consequence from the assertions of Scripture; and
      such consequences, rightly deduced, are infallibly true and de fide.

    <p>
      1. That the authority of God speaking in the Scripture is that alone which
      divine faith rests upon, and is to be resolved into.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That for the begetting, increasing, and strengthening of faith, it is
      useful to have important fundamental truths confirmed by many testimonies
      of Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The whole creation of God hath a great concern in God’s bringing forth
      Christ into the world, and in his exaltation in his kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The command of God is the ground and reason of all religious worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. That the Mediator of the new covenant is in his own person God, blessed
      for ever, to whom divine or religious worship is due from the angels
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The Father, upon the account of the work of Christ in the world, and
      his kingdom that ensued on it, gives new commandment unto the angels to
      worship him, his glory being greatly concerned therein.

      worshipped by all the angels in heaven.
    </p>

      regulated by the Scripture.

    <p>
      4. All the laws, and the whole administration of the kingdom of Christ by
      his word and Spirit, are equal, righteous, and holy: “His scepter is a

    <p>
      7. The collation of the Spirit on the Lord Christ, and his glorious
      exaltation, are the peculiar works of God the Father: “God, thy God, hath
      anointed thee.”
    </p>
    <p>8. The Lord Jesus Christ is singular in this unction.</p>
    <p>
      9. All that serve God in the work of building the church, according to his

    </h2>
    <p>
      1. All the properties of God, considered in the person of his Son, the
      head of the church, are suited to give relief, consolation, and support
      unto believers in all their distresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The properties of God are those whereby God makes known himself to
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) God oftentimes declares and proposeth these properties of his nature
      to us, for our support, consolation, and relief in our troubles, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) That since the entrance of sin, these properties of God, absolutely
      considered, will not yield that relief and satisfaction unto the souls of
      men which they would have done, and did, whilst man continued obedient
      unto God, according to the law of his creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) These properties of the divine nature are in every person of the
      Trinity entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The person of the Word, or the eternal Son of God, may be considered
      either absolutely as such, or as designed in the counsel, wisdom, and will
      of the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The whole old creation, even the most glorious parts of it, hastening
      to its period, at least of our present interest in it and use of it, calls
      upon us not to fix our hearts on the small perishing shares which we have
      therein, especially since we have Him who is omnipotent and eternal for
      our inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Lord Christ, the mediator, the head and spouse of the church, is
      infinitely exalted above all creatures whatever, in that he is God over
      all, omnipotent and eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The whole world, the heavens and earth, being made by the Lord Christ,
      and being to be dissolved by him, is wholly at his disposal, to be ordered
      for the good of them that do believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. There is no just cause of fear unto believer from any thing in heaven
      or earth, seeing they are all of the making and at the disposal of Jesus
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Whatever our changes may be, inward or outward, yet, Christ changing
      not, our eternal condition is secured, and relief provided against all
      present troubles and miseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Such is the frailty of the nature of man, and such the perishing nature
      of all created things, that none can ever obtain the least stable
      consolation but what ariseth from an interest in the omnipotency,
      sovereignty, and eternity of the Lord Christ.
    </p>

        >But which of the angels has he told at any time, “Sit at my right hand,
        until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The authority of God the Father in the exaltation of Jesus Christ as
      the head and mediator of the church, is greatly to be regarded by
      believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The exaltation of Christ is the great pledge of the acceptance of the
      work of mediation performed in the behalf of the church.
    </p>
    <p>3. Christ hath many enemies to his kingdom.</p>
    <p>
      4. The kingdom and rule of Christ is perpetual and abiding,
      notwithstanding all the opposition that is made against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The end whereunto the Lord Jesus Christ will assuredly bring all his
      enemies, let them bluster whilst they please, shall be unto them miserable
      and shameful, to the saints joyful, to himself victorious and triumphant.

      1. The highest honor of the most glorious spirits in heaven, is to
      minister unto the Lord in the service whereunto he appoints them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Unto what ends and purposes doth God make use of the ministry of
      angels, for the good of them that do believer.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Socratical fancy of one single guardian angel attending every one,
      as it is, if admitted, a real impeachment unto superstition and idolatry.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Believers obtain heaven by inheritance and free gifts of their Father,
      and not by merit of their own.

      <em>Commentary on Hebrews</em></a
    >.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 5</h2>
  <p>The Apostle adds another testimony to the Sonship of Christ.</p>
  <p>
    And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son.—It is
    evident that this passage refers primarily to 2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles
    17:12, who was a remarkable type of Christ, but we learn from the Apostle
    that a greater than Solomon is here. Indeed, this is evident from the
    passage quoted, for God promises to establish His kingdom for ever. The Lord
    Jesus is frequently described both as David and the Son of David. David was
    a man after God&#x27;s own heart, which denotes his zeal for the worship of
    God; but it has its full accomplishment in Christ, who is in all respects a
    man after God&#x27;s own heart, for He always did those things which pleased
    His Father. He now sits on the throne of His father David, and is indeed the
    King of Israel. John 1:49.
  </p>
  <p>
    We repeatedly find a double type in consequence of the different aspects in
    which Christ is presented to our view. He was in the form of a servant,
    engaged in a work committed to Him by His Father, which required Him to be a
    man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs, a stranger and pilgrim, a
    houseless wanderer in this world, and finally to be made a curse by hanging
    on a tree, thus becoming obedient to the death of the cross. Again, we
    behold Him a resistless conqueror triumphing over death, His foot on the
    neck of Satan, and invested with all power in heaven and on earth. Hence a
    double type was necessary to denote His sufferings and glory. The former was
    typified by &quot;David and all his afflictions,&quot; the latter, by
    Hebrews 13:10.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moses, the Mediator of the old covenant, was a remarkable type of our great
    Mediator, and in correspondence with the antitype, Israel could not enter
    Canaan till after his death. When the people sinned in the matter of the
    golden calf, and Moses had broken the tables in token of the covenant being
    broken, he said to the people, &quot;Ye have sinned a great sin, and now I
    will go up unto the Lord, peradventure I shall make an atonement for your
    sin.&quot; Exodus 32:30. He accordingly returned to the Lord, and said,
    &quot;Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of
    gold. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray
    thee, out of the book which thou hast written.&quot; Exodus 32:31-32. Thus
    he offered his life to atone for the sin of Israel. We know that God spoke
    to Moses mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches. Num.
    xii8. There is therefore reason to suppose that Moses communicated to Israel
    in parables what he had heard plainly in the mount. Israel was a carnal,
    stiff-necked people, and could not have home the truth of the Son of God
    dying, and reviving, and rising. The doctrine of Christ was a
    stumbling-block to their children, after they had received all the
    additional instructions contained in the Scriptures of the prophets, had
    seen His own mighty works, and heard Him declared to be the Son of God by a
    voice from heaven,—notwithstanding all this, they crucified Him as a
    blasphemer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, it is not improbable that Moses concealed in parables what he had
    been taught in the mount, and that this was intimated by the veil which he
    put upon his face while speaking to the people, and which he took off when
    he went in before the Lord. Exodus 34:33-34. If this were the case, Moses
    knew that Christ was to die for His people, and as the mediator of the old
    covenant he offered to expiate by death the sin of which Israel had been
    guilty. But Moses, however eminent, was but a sinful Leviticus 22:21. But,
    although the death of Moses could not be accepted as an expiation for the
    sin of Israel, it was necessary for the correspondence of the type and the
    antitype, that the mediator should die before Israel could enter Canaan.
    Hence it is written, &quot;Moses, my servant, is dead; now, therefore,
    arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people, unto the land which I
    do give to them, even to the children of Israel.&quot; Joshua 1:2. Thus
    Moses and Joshua were each a type of Christ, who, having by His death
    expiated the sins of His people, rose from the dead as the Captain of their
    salvation, and puts them in possession of the eternal inheritance.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 6</h2>
  <p>
    And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the world, he saith,
    And let all the angels of God worship him.
  </p>
  <p>
    And again...—There is a great difference of opinion with respect to the
    construction of the word rendered &quot;again.&quot; It may be understood
    either as an additional proof of what had been asserted in verse5 , or it
    may refer to Christ being brought again into the world by His resurrection.
    The quotation is taken from Psalm 97:7 is rendered &quot;Worship him all ye
    gods;&quot; but the expression is elliptical, and may be rendered &quot;All
    ye angels of God.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus is here termed the firstborn, or first- begotten, while personally
    distinct He is one with the Father. The firstborn had various privileges,—he
    had authority over his brethren. Hence the Lord said to Cain, after
    testifying his approbation of his brother&#x27;s sacrifice, &quot;Unto thee
    shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.&quot; Genesis 4:7.
    God&#x27;s accepting Abel&#x27;s offering was not to interfere with
    Cain&#x27;s superiority as the firstborn. Again, Jacob describes Reuben, his
    firstborn, as the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power. Genesis
    49:3. This privilege was forfeited and transferred to Judah, of whom came
    the &quot;chief ruler.&quot; Ephesians 1:21.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 7</h2>
  <p>
    And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers
    a flame of fire.
  </p>
  <p>
    And of the angels...—The angels are here described as spirits, and as a
    flame of fire. The word &quot;spirits&quot; also signifies
    &quot;winds,&quot; and some, therefore, understand the passage as teaching
    us that the Lord makes winds His messengers and flaming fire His ministers;
    but the Apostle does not here teach us the nature of winds and of
    lightnings, but the nature of angels. The best interpretation seems to be,
    that the angels when sent by the Lord to perform His will, do so in the form
    of winds and fire. When Elijah was taken up into heaven, &quot;there
    appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire.&quot; &quot; Elijah went up
    by a whirlwind into heaven.&quot; This seems to be a work performed by the
    ministry of angels, the chariot and the horses of fire appear to have been
    angels. We also read, that when Elisha was surrounded by the Syrian army,
    the mountain was full of horses of fire round about the prophet. That these
    were persons is evident from what Elisha said to his servant, &quot;Fear
    not, for there be more with us than with them.&quot; This interpretation
    both suits the phraseology and presents the angels in a very humble
    situation. Or, perhaps the meaning may be that the angels serve their Maker
    with the rapidity of the winds and the resistless power of the lightnings.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 8</h2>
  <p>
    But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a
    sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom,
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ is described, Psalmxlv6 , from which this is a quotation, as God
    sitting on His eternal throne, holding a sceptre of righteousness. This is
    eminently the characteristic of the Mediator&#x27;s government, which is
    conducted on principles of the most perfect justice. While He has taken his
    redeemed from the fearful pit and the miry clay, He has magnified and made
    honorable the law which they had broken, they are clothed with a robe of
    unsullied righteousness. His Gospel, which proclaims God to be just while He
    justifies the ungodly, is the revelation of this righteousness, Romans 1:17;
    and when He has reduced the creation to order and harmony, He will deliver
    up the kingdom to His Father, and for ever remain the glorious Head of that
    Church which He hath purchased with His own blood, as well as of all
    principality and power. The kingdom here spoken of is that kingdom upon the
    throne of which the King sits who reigns in righteousness, Isaiah 32:1, and
    on which He sat down after having finished transgression, made an end of
    sin, made reconciliation for iniquities, and brought in everlasting
    righteousness. Daniel 9:24.
  </p>
  <p>
    That the forty-fifth Psalm refers to Christ is evident, not only from the
    authority of the Apostle in this passage, but from the whole tenor of the
    Psalm. God promised David respecting him, &quot;I will establish the throne
    of his kingdom for ever;&quot; and when Gabriel announced his birth to Mary,
    he said, &quot;And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
    a Luke 1:31-33. In the Psalm He is described as riding forth in majesty,
    vanquishing His enemies, and placing on his right hand the
    &quot;Queen,&quot; the mother of a numerous offspring.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is evident that the Apostle here speaks of Jesus in the character of
    Mediator, the Son of man. In this character alone could any comparison be
    instituted between Him and the highest of created beings.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 9</h2>
  <p>
    Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy
    God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity. —This refers to the
    character of Jesus while in this world, not, as some have supposed, after
    His government is over. It was the perfection of the character of Jesus that
    He loved righteousness and hated iniquity. In the days of His flesh He
    always did the things which pleased His Father; the law was within His
    heart. His language was, &quot; O how love I thy law! it is my meditation
    all the day.&quot; He challenges His enemies to convict Him of sin. Indeed
    one flaw in His character would prove the Gospel a fable, for He is God
    manifest in the flesh, and therefore must have been absolutely perfect.
    Again, He received the Holy Spirit without measure, which was inconsistent
    with the slightest deviation from the path of righteousness. The character
    of Jesus is in itself a demonstration of the truth of the Gospel. Man could
    not have imagined such a character; and, we may say with the infidel
    Rousseau, that to suppose the four Gospels a forgery is more incredible than
    the admission of its truth. [Why then did Rousseau remain an infidel?
    Because, as he tells us, the Gospel contains many things to which his reason
    could not assent. What a comment on 1 Corinthians 2:14, &quot;But the
    natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
    foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
    discerned.&quot;]
  </p>
  <p>
    Such was the Lord&#x27;s love of righteousness, that He gave Himself for His
    people to deliver them from all iniquity, that He might purify unto Himself
    a peculiar people, zealous of good works. He walked in the perfect law of
    liberty. His undertaking was entirely voluntary; hence He said, &quot;Lo I
    come, to do thy will, O my God!&quot; Amidst all the discouragements He met
    with, He never swerved by a hair&#x27;s breadth from the path of rectitude.
    Amidst all the shame and reproach which He encountered He set his face as a
    flint, nor did He fail or become discouraged till He set judgment on the
    earth. He had only to will it, and legions of angels were ready to vindicate
    His glory; but He endured the cross, despising the shame, and thus was His
    mediatorial throne established in righteousness. All His subjects are
    righteous, without spot and blemish.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore—on this account.—The anointing was the reward of Christ&#x27;s
    love of righteousness and hatred of iniquity while on earth. Some suppose
    that the anointing takes place subsequently to His government, but it is not
    connected with His government, which is spoken of before. The eighth verse
    speaks of Him as a king, and the ninth verse shows why the kingdom was given
    Him, consequently it was not the reward of His administration of the
    kingdom. This would imply that Christ has not yet received the anointing,
    for the mediatorial kingdom will not cease till He hath put all enemies
    under His feet.
  </p>
  <p>
    God, even thy God.—Some render this &quot;therefore, O God thy God.&quot;
    The difference is not material. Owen observes, that the phrase is generally
    translated as in our version.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hath anointed thee.—What is the anointing here meant? Is it that by which He
    was consecrated to the kingly office? or, has it reference to the anointing
    which was usual in cases of festivity and joy? The latter appears to be the
    meaning. Christ was anointed to all His offices after His baptism, when He
    received the Holy Ghost without measure. The anointing here spoken of took
    place after the manifestation of His love of righteousness and hatred of
    iniquity while in this world. It was that happiness and glory which He
    received as Mediator after his ascension.
  </p>
  <p>
    Above thy fellows.—Some suppose that &quot;by his fellows&quot; is meant the
    angels, because the Apostle is here proving His superiority to angels, but
    He never assumed the nature of angels. In this respect He never had
    fellowship with them. Others think that &quot;by his fellows&quot; we are to
    understand the prophets, priests, and kings who were anointed with oil to
    their respective offices, which were all concentrated in Him while He was
    anointed with the Holy Ghost. It appears, however, rather to mean His
    people, whom He is not ashamed to call brethren. He took part with them in
    flesh and blood. He is the connecting link by which the whole family in
    heaven and in earth is united to God. The closeness and perpetuity of this
    union is exhibited in His person as God- man. Hence he says, &quot;I ascend
    to my Father and to your Father, to my God and your God.&quot; His fellows,
    then, are those with whom, by His incarnation, He has fellowship; and so
    close is this fellowship, that both He that sanctifieth and they that are
    sanctified are all of one— children of one family. But in all things He hath
    the preeminence; all their well-springs are in Him. He is anointed with the
    oil of gladness above His fellows, He received the Holy Spirit without
    measure, of which no creature was capable, which is therefore a conclusive
    proof of His Divinity. The Jewish prophets, priests, and kings were anointed
    with oil, which was the emblem of the Spirit; they were types of Him who is
    the Christ, or Anointed One, and His people are called Christians because
    they have all an unction from the Holy One. As the precious oil, poured on
    the head of Aaron, ran down to the skirts of his garments, so the Spirit,
    poured on the great Head of the Church, is conveyed from Him to all His
    people, and thus they are one spirit with Him, 1 Corinthians 6:17; they are
    all baptized by one Spirit into one body, 1 Corinthians 12:13; and we are
    taught, that if any man have not the Spirit, he is none of His.

  <h2>Verse 10</h2>
  <p>
    And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and
    the heavens are the works of thine hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    And, thou, Lord.—The102Psalm, from which this quotation is taken describes,
    in an address to His Father, the sufferings of Christ and the depth of His
    humiliation. Ver1-11. The sweet Psalmist of Israel then contemplates Jehovah
    arising in His might to favor Sion, and anticipates the universal spread of
    the Gospel. Ver16-22. He then adverts to His own suffering and death, ver23
    , and describes the supplications which He offered to Him who was able to
    save Him from death. Ver24. The concluding verses contain the answer to the
    prayer. Had the Psalm not been quoted by the Apostle, we should, probably,
    have understood the conclusion of the Psalm as the continuance of the
    prayer, but we learn from the Apostle that it is the answer which Christ
    received. In the depth of His humiliation He is acknowledged as the Creator
    of heaven and earth. John 1:3. The Apostle had previously stated that God
    had made the worlds by His Psalm 102:25-27. It had been given to the Son to
    have life in Himself, although in connexion with his humanity He had
    received a commandment to lay it down, that He might take it again; and not
    only John 14:19.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 11</h2>
  <p>
    They shall perish; but thou remainest: and they all shall wax old as doth a
    garment.
  </p>
  <p>
    They shall perish.—However glorious the work of creation, the heavens and
    earth shall perish. They are, so to speak, the scaffolding for the erection
    of a more glorious fabric.
  </p>
  <p>
    2 Peter 3:10-13. Here we may apply the Apostle&#x27;s
    reasoning,—&quot;Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that
    which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.&quot; 1 Corinthians
    15:46. So the visible heavens and earth are intended to introduce the new
    creation,—&quot;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven
    and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John
    saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven,
    prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out
    of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will
    dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with
    them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;
    and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
    there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that
    sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto
    me, &quot;Write: for these words are true and faithful.&quot; Revelation
    21:1-5. The heavens and the earth shall be changed; but Psalm 102:24-27 to
    Christ, we might have been led to it by the last verse: &quot;The children
    of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before
    thee.&quot; Applying the Psalm from verse24to Christ, all is plain and easy.
    In the depth of His humiliation He is acknowledged as the great Creator, and
    assured that the children of His servants should continue, and their seed be
    established before Him. This is very beautiful and consoling as applied to
    Christ, and exactly corresponds with many promises made to the Lord Jesus.
    Psalm 22:30-31; Psalm 45:16; Psalm 69:36. Isaiah 53:10; Isaiah 59:21.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this quotation we have another most explicit testimony to the supreme
    Divinity of Christ. He is not only declared to be superior to angels, but to
    be &quot;over all, God blessed for ever.&quot; Romans 9:5. This is shown by
    His being represented as seated on His eternal throne, Hebrews 1:8; and not
    only having in His character of mediator the preeminence over all those with
    whom he had condescended to unite himself, but as the Creator of all things.
    Amidst all the changes which he would effect on the works of His hands, in
    order to adapt them to His infinitely wise purposes, He remains for ever the
    same, and with Him there is no variableness or shadow of turning. James
    1:17.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 13</h2>
  <p>
    But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until
    I make thine enemies thy footstool?
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apostle here returns to his argument to prove the superiority of the
    Lord Jesus to angels, of which, indeed, he had never lost sight; but had
    soared so high in describing the Divinity of the Son of God, as to leave
    every created being far beneath Him. The honor of sitting at the right hand
    of God is such, that it never was given to any of the angels. They are
    described as round about the throne; but Christ, in the character of
    mediator, sits upon the throne at the Father&#x27;s right hand. Thus Christ
    is distinguished from all angels of every order, from the highest to the
    lowest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sit on my right hand, is a quotation from Psalm 110:1; Psalm 110:5; it was
    quoted by our Lord in the days of His flesh, as having been written by David
    under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in reference to Christ. The great
    mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh, was hid from the scribes
    and pharisees, although plainly declared in the Scriptures; but, like many
    other predictions, was not understood till its fulfilment.
  </p>
  <p>The reference to Isaiah 60:12. Psalm 72:9.</p>
  <p>
    Enemies.—The devil and his angels are in a state of rebellion against God;
    and it would appear that their rebellion arose from the intimation of the
    exaltation of Christ, and that our Lord refers to this when He said,
    &quot;He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth&quot;
    John 8:44. It was God&#x27;s eternal purpose to make known by the Church to
    the principalities and powers in heavenly places His manifold wisdom.
    Ephesians 3:10. In furtherance of this design He seems to have revealed to
    the heavenly hosts His determination to put all things under the Son of
    Genesis 1:28-29, but he lost his inheritance. The second Adam is appointed
    heir of all things, and the inheritance is secured by his love and power to
    all the children of promise. Those who are saved inherit glory, therefore
    salvation includes, not only deliverance from misery, but also the
    possession of glory. Here it signifies whatever the people of God shall
    enjoy throughout eternity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shall be.—Hence it appears that the ministering of the angels belongs to the
    heirs of salvation from the earliest period of their existence. It is said
    of Jeremiah 1:5. The Lord separated Paul from his mother&#x27;s womb, and no
    doubt the angels were employed in ministering to him while breathing out
    slaughter and threatening against the disciples of Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    Such is the introduction of this most instructive epistle. The Apostle
    begins by referring to the revelations which God had given by that
    succession of prophets who were raised up from the beginning. He had now
    spoken by His Son, whom He had constituted heir of all things. By Him and
    for Him all the worlds were made. He is the image of the invisible God, and
    has revealed Him to us, clearly exhibiting his glorious perfections. Having,
    by offering the body which had been prepared for Him, cast the sins of His
    people into the depths of the sea, so that they should be no more
    remembered, He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, denoting
    His absolute and universal dominion. He is the Judge of the quick and the
    dead, to whom every knee shall bow and every tongue confess. The name which
    He inherited, and which in its proper sense exclusively belongs to Him, was
    far more glorious than the name given to the angels. To none of them had God
    said,
  </p>
  <p>
    Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. He had described none of
    them as standing to Him in the relation of a Son. On the contrary, when He
    foretold the appearance of the first-begotten, the Lord and heir of all, He
    commanded all the angels of God to worship Him.
  </p>
  <p>
    The angels are described as executing His will with the rapidity of winds
    and the resistless power of the lightnings; but the Son is addressed as God
    sitting on his eternal throne, and as a King reigning in righteousness. He
    humbled himself, so that, although he was truly God, the Father stood to Him
    in the relation of His God; and, lest this should derogate from His innate
    dignity, He is described as the Creator of all things, who, amidst all their
    mutations, abideth ever the same. Once more, which of the angels was ever
    invited to sit at God&#x27;s right hand until their enemies were made their
    footstool? So far from their being thus honored, they are all only
    ministering spirits, sent forth by their glorious Head to minister to the
    heirs of salvation.
