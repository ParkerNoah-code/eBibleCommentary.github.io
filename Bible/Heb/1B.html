    </h2>
    <p>1. Every thing in Scripture is instructive.</p>
    <p>
      2. It is lawful to draw consequence from the assertions of Scripture; and
      such consequences, rightly deduced, are infallibly true and de fide.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The declaration of Christ to be the Son of God is the care and work of
      the Father.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6.
      <em
        >When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says, “Let all
        the angels of God worship him.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. That the authority of God speaking in the Scripture is that alone which
      divine faith rests upon, and is to be resolved into.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That for the begetting, increasing, and strengthening of faith, it is
      useful to have important fundamental truths confirmed by many testimonies
      of Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The whole creation of God hath a great concern in God’s bringing forth
      Christ into the world, and in his exaltation in his kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The command of God is the ground and reason of all religious worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. That the Mediator of the new covenant is in his own person God, blessed
      for ever, to whom divine or religious worship is due from the angels
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The Father, upon the account of the work of Christ in the world, and
      his kingdom that ensued on it, gives new commandment unto the angels to
      worship him, his glory being greatly concerned therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Great is the church’s security and honor, when the Head of it is
      worshipped by all the angels in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It can be no duty of the saints of the new testament to worship angels,
      who are their fellow-servants in the worship of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >Of the angels he says, “He makes his angels winds, and his servants a
        flame of fire.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Our conception of the angels, their nature, office, and work, is to be
      regulated by the Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That the glory, honor, and exaltation of the angels, lie in their
      subserviency to the providence of God.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 8-9.
      <em
        >But of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The
        scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom. You have loved
        righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed
        you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The conferring and comparing of Scriptures is an excellent means of
      coming to an acquaintance with the mind and will of God in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is the duty of all believers to rejoice in the glory, honor, and
      dominion of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is the divine nature of the Lord Christ that gives eternity,
      stability, and unchangeableness to his throne and kingdom: “Thy throne, O
      God, is for ever.”
    </p>
    <p>
      4. All the laws, and the whole administration of the kingdom of Christ by
      his word and Spirit, are equal, righteous, and holy: “His scepter is a
      scepter of righteousness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The righteous administrations of the Lord Christ in his government
      proceed all from his own habitual righteousness and love thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. God is a God in especial covenant with the Lord Christ, as he is the
      mediator: “God, thy God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The collation of the Spirit on the Lord Christ, and his glorious
      exaltation, are the peculiar works of God the Father: “God, thy God, hath
      anointed thee.”
    </p>
    <p>8. The Lord Jesus Christ is singular in this unction.</p>
    <p>
      9. All that serve God in the work of building the church, according to his
      appointment, are anointed by his Spirit, and shall be rewarded by his
      power, Dan_12:3.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The disciples of Christ, especially those who serve him in his church
      faithfully, are his companions in all his grace and glory.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 10-12.
      <em
        >And, “You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth.
        The heavens are the works of your hands. They will perish, but you
        continue. They all will grow old like a garment does. You will roll them
        up like a mantle, and they will be changed; but you are the same. Your
        years won’t fail.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. All the properties of God, considered in the person of his Son, the
      head of the church, are suited to give relief, consolation, and support
      unto believers in all their distresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The properties of God are those whereby God makes known himself to
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) God oftentimes declares and proposeth these properties of his nature
      to us, for our support, consolation, and relief in our troubles, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) That since the entrance of sin, these properties of God, absolutely
      considered, will not yield that relief and satisfaction unto the souls of
      men which they would have done, and did, whilst man continued obedient
      unto God, according to the law of his creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) These properties of the divine nature are in every person of the
      Trinity entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The person of the Word, or the eternal Son of God, may be considered
      either absolutely as such, or as designed in the counsel, wisdom, and will
      of the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The whole old creation, even the most glorious parts of it, hastening
      to its period, at least of our present interest in it and use of it, calls
      upon us not to fix our hearts on the small perishing shares which we have
      therein, especially since we have Him who is omnipotent and eternal for
      our inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Lord Christ, the mediator, the head and spouse of the church, is
      infinitely exalted above all creatures whatever, in that he is God over
      all, omnipotent and eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The whole world, the heavens and earth, being made by the Lord Christ,
      and being to be dissolved by him, is wholly at his disposal, to be ordered
      for the good of them that do believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. There is no just cause of fear unto believer from any thing in heaven
      or earth, seeing they are all of the making and at the disposal of Jesus
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Whatever our changes may be, inward or outward, yet, Christ changing
      not, our eternal condition is secured, and relief provided against all
      present troubles and miseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Such is the frailty of the nature of man, and such the perishing nature
      of all created things, that none can ever obtain the least stable
      consolation but what ariseth from an interest in the omnipotency,
      sovereignty, and eternity of the Lord Christ.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 13.
      <em
        >But which of the angels has he told at any time, “Sit at my right hand,
        until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The authority of God the Father in the exaltation of Jesus Christ as
      the head and mediator of the church, is greatly to be regarded by
      believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The exaltation of Christ is the great pledge of the acceptance of the
      work of mediation performed in the behalf of the church.
    </p>
    <p>3. Christ hath many enemies to his kingdom.</p>
    <p>
      4. The kingdom and rule of Christ is perpetual and abiding,
      notwithstanding all the opposition that is made against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The end whereunto the Lord Jesus Christ will assuredly bring all his
      enemies, let them bluster whilst they please, shall be unto them miserable
      and shameful, to the saints joyful, to himself victorious and triumphant.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 14.
      <em
        >Aren’t they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of
        those who will inherit salvation?</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The highest honor of the most glorious spirits in heaven, is to
      minister unto the Lord in the service whereunto he appoints them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Unto what ends and purposes doth God make use of the ministry of
      angels, for the good of them that do believer.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Socratical fancy of one single guardian angel attending every one,
      as it is, if admitted, a real impeachment unto superstition and idolatry.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Believers obtain heaven by inheritance and free gifts of their Father,
      and not by merit of their own.
