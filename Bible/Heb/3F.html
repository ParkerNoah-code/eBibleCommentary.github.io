    <h2>F. The Earthly Sanctuary (9:1-10)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 1.
      <em
        >Now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service and
        an earthly sanctuary.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. Every covenant of God had its proper privileges and advantages.</p>
    <p>
      2. There was never any covenant between God and man but it had some
      ordinances or arbitrary institutions of external divine worship annexed
      unto it.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is a hard and rare thing to have the minds of men kept upright with
      God in the observance of the institutions of divine worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Divine institution alone is that which renders any thing acceptable
      unto God.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. God can animate outward, carnal things with a hidden, invisible spring
      of glory and efficacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. All divine service or worship must be resolved into divine ordination
      or institution.
    </p>
    <p>7. A worldly sanctuary is enough for them whose service is worldly.</p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em
        >For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the lamp stand,
        the table, and the show bread, which is called the Holy Place.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Every part of God’s house and the place wherein he will dwell is filled
      and adorned with pledge of his presence and means of communicating his
      grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The communication of sacred light from Christ, in the gifts of the
      Spirit, is absolutely necessary unto the due and acceptable performance of
      all holy offices and duties of worship in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. No man, by his utmost endeavors in the use of outward means, can obtain
      the least beam of saving light, unless it be communicated unto him by
      Christ, who is the only fountain and cause of it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3-5.
      <em
        >After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of
        Holies, having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant
        overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the
        manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; and
        above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things
        we can’t speak now in detail.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The more of Christ, by the way of representation or exhibition, any
      institutions of divine worship do contain or express, the more sacred and
      holy are they in their use and exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is Christ alone who in himself is really the Most Holy, the spring
      and fountain of all holiness unto the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The time of the burning of the incense was after the sacrifice of the
      sin- offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The incense was kindled with fire taken from the altar when the blood
      of the sacrifices was newly offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The mediatory intercession of Jesus Christ was a sweet savor unto God,
      and efficacious for the salvation of the church.
    </p>
    <p>6. The efficacy of Christ’s intercession dependeth on his oblation.</p>
    <p>
      7. The glory of these types did no way answer the glory of the antitype,
      or that which was represented by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. We are always to reckon that the efficacy and prevalency of all our
      prayers depends on the incense which is in the hand of our merciful high
      priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Although the sovereign will and pleasure of God be the only reason and
      original cause of all institute worship, yet there is, and ever was, in
      all his institutions, such an evidence of divine wisdom and goodness as
      gives them beauty, desirableness, and usefulness unto their proper end.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. All the counsels of God concerning his worship in this world, and his
      eternal glory in the salvation of the church, do center in the person and
      mediation of Christ.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6-7.
      <em
        >Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in
        continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services, but
        into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without
        blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      A continual application unto God by Christ, and a continual application of
      the benefits of the mediation of Christ by faith, are the springs of the
      light, life, and comfort of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. A spiritual illumination of the mind is indispensably necessary unto
      our walking with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Those who would be preserved from sin must take care that spiritual
      light do always bear sway in their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. They ought constantly to watch against the prevalency of corrupt
      prejudices and affections in their mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. When the light of the mind is solicited by temptations to suspend its
      conduct and determination on present circumstances, to know that sin lies
      at the door, this is its last address for admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. If error grow strong in the heart through the love of sin, truth will
      grow weak in the mind as to the preservation of the soul from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Nothing ought to influence the soul more unto repentance, sorrow, and
      humiliation for sin, than a due apprehension of the shameful error and
      mistake that is in it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 8.
      <em
        >The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place
        wasn’t yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The divine ordinances and institutions of worship are filled with
      wisdom sufficient for the instruction of the church in all the mysteries
      of faith and obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is our duty, with all humble diligence, to inquire into the mind of
      the Holy Ghost in all ordinances and institutions of divine worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Although the Lord Christ was not actually exhibited in the flesh under
      the old testament, nor had actually offered himself unto God for us, yet
      had believers then an actual access into the grace and favor of God,
      though the way, the cause, and means of it were not manifestly declared
      unto them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The design of the Holy Ghost in the tabernacle, and in all its
      ordinances and institutions of worship, was to direct the faith of
      believers unto what was signified by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Typical institutions, attended diligently unto, were sufficient to
      direct the faith of the church unto the expectation of the real expiation
      of sin, and acceptance with God thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Though the standing of the first tabernacle was a great mercy and
      privilege, yet the removal of it was a greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The divine wisdom in the economy and disposal of the revelation of the
      way into the holiest, or of grace and acceptance with himself, is a
      blessed object of our contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The clear manifestation of the way of redemption, of the expiation of
      sin, and peace with God thereon, is the great privilege of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. There is no access into the gracious presence of God but by the
      sacrifice of Christ alone.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 9.
      <em
        >This is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are
        offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the
        worshiper perfect,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There is a state of perfect peace with God to be attained under
      imperfect obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Nothing can give perfect peace of conscience with God but what can make
      atonement for sin.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 10.
      <em>
        being only (with foods and drinks and various washings) fleshly
        ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There is nothing in its own nature so mean and abject but the will and
      authority of God can render it of sacred use and sacred efficacy, when he
      is pleased to ordain and appoint it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The fixing of times and seasons for the state of things in the church
      is solely in the hand of God, and at his sovereign disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is a great part of the blessed liberty which the Lord Christ brought
      into the church, — namely, its freedom and liberty from legal impositions,
      and every thing of the like nature in the worship of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The time of the coming of Christ was the time of the final general
      reformation of the worship of God, wherein all things were unchangeably
      directed unto their proper use.
