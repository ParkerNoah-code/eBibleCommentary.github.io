      Ver 2.

    <h2>
      Ver 3-4.
      <em
        >After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of
        Holies, having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant
        overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the
        manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;</em

    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.

        >This is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are
        offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the
        worshiper perfect, being only (with foods and drinks and various
        washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.</em
