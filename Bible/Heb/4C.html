    <h2>C. Endurance: In a Little While (10:32-39)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 32-34.
      <em
        >But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you
        endured a great struggle with sufferings: partly, being exposed to both
        reproaches and oppressions, and partly, becoming partakers with those

        heavens.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. A wise management of former experiences is a great direction and
      encouragement unto future obedience.
    </p>
    <p>2. All men by nature are darkness and in darkness.</p>
    <p>3. Saving illumination is the first-fruit of effectual vocation.</p>
    <p>
      4. Spiritual light, in its first communication, puts the soul on the
      diligent exercise of all graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is suited unto the wisdom and goodness of God to suffer persons, on
      their first conversion, to fall into manifold trials and temptations.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. All temporary sufferings, in all their aggravating circumstances, in
      their most dreadful preparation, dress, and appearance, are but light
      things in comparison of the gospel and the promises thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. There is not any thing in the whole nature of temporary sufferings, or
      any circumstance of them, that we can claim an exemption from, after we
      have undertaken the profession of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It is reserved unto the sovereign pleasure of God to measure out unto
      all professors of the gospel their especial lot and portion as unto trials
      and sufferings, so as that none ought to complain, none to envy one
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Of what sort or kind the sufferings of any that God employs in the
      ministry of the gospel shall be, is in his sovereign disposal alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Faith, giving an experience of the excellency of the love of God in
      Christ, and the grace received thereby, with its incomparable preference
      above all outward, perishing things, will give joy and satisfaction in the
      loss of all our substance, upon the account of an interest in these better
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. It is the glory of the gospel that it will, on a just account, from a
      sense of and interest in it, give satisfaction and joy unto the souls of
      men in the worst of sufferings for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. It is our duty to take care that we be not surprised with outward
      sufferings when we are in the dark as unto our interest in these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Internal evidences of the beginnings of glory in grace, a sense of
      God’s love, and assured pledges of our adoption, will give insuperable joy
      to the minds of men under the greatest outward sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. It is our interest in this world, as well as with respect unto
      eternity, to preserve our evidences for heaven clear and unstained.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. There is a substance in spiritual and eternal things whereunto faith
      gives a subsistence in the souls of believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. There is no rule of proportion between eternal and temporal things.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 35-36.
      <em
        >Therefore don’t throw away your boldness, which has a great reward. For
        you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive
        the promise.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. In the times of suffering, and in the approaches of them, it is the
      duty of believers to look on the glory of heaven under the notion of a
      refreshing, all-sufficient reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. He that would abide faithful in difficult seasons, must fortify his
      soul with an unconquerable patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The glory of heaven is an abundant recompense for all we shall undergo
      in our way towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Believers ought to sustain themselves in their sufferings with the
      promise of future glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The future blessedness is given unto us by the promise, and is
      therefore free and undeserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The consideration of eternal life as the free effect of the grace of
      God in Christ, and as proposed in a gracious promise, is a thousand times
      more full of spiritual refreshment unto a believer than if he should
      conceive of it or look upon it merely as a reward proposed unto our own
      doings or merits.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 37-39.
      <em
        >“In a very little while, he who comes will come and will not wait. But
        the righteous one will live by faith. If he shrinks back, my soul has no
        pleasure in him.” But we are not of those who shrink back to
        destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The delay of the accomplishment of promises is a great exercise of
      faith and patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is essential unto faith to be acted on the promised coming of
      Christ, to all that look for his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There is a promise of the coming of Christ suited unto the state and
      condition of the church in all ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The apparent delay of the accomplishment of any of these promises
      requires an exercise of the faith and patience, of the saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Every such coming of Christ hath its appointed season, beyond which it
      shall not tarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. This divine disposition of things gives a necessity unto the continual
      exercise of faith, prayer, and patience, about the coming of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Although we may not know the especial dispensations and moments of time
      that are passing over us, yet all believers may know the state in general
      of the church under which they are, and what coming of Christ they are to
      look for and expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Faith in any church satisfies the souls of men with what is the good
      and deliverance of that state, although a man do know and is persuaded
      that personally he shall not see it himself nor enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Under despondencies as to peculiar appearances or comings of Christ, it
      is the duty of believers to fix and exercise their faith on his
      illustrious appearance at the last day.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Every particular coming of Christ, in a way suited unto the present
      deliverance of the church, is an infallible pledge of his coming at the
      last unto judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Every promised coming of Christ is certain, and shall not be delayed
      beyond its appointed season, when no difficulties shall be able to stand
      before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. There are especial qualifications of grace required unto steadfastness
      in profession in times of persecution and long-continued trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Many things are required to secure the success of our profession in
      times of difficulties and trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. The continuance of the spiritual life and eternal salvation of true
      believers is secured from all oppositions whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. No persons whatever ought to be, on any consideration, secure against
      those sins which present circumstances give an efficacy unto.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. It is an effect of spiritual wisdom to discern what is the dangerous
      and prevailing temptation of any season, and vigorously to set ourselves
      in opposition unto it.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. It is much to be feared that in great trials some will draw back from
      that profession of the gospel wherein they are engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. This defection is commonly durable, continued by various pretences.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. It is our great duty to look diligently that we are of that holy frame
      of mind, and attend to that due exercise of faith, that the soul of God
      may take pleasure in us.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. Though there appear as yet no outward tokens or evidences of the anger
      and displeasure of God against our ways, yet if we are in that state
      wherein God hath no pleasure in us, we are entering into certain ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. Backsliders from the gospel are in a peculiar manner the abhorrence of
      the soul of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. When the soul of God is not delighted in any, nothing can preserve
      them from utter destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. The Scripture everywhere testifieth that in the visible church there
      is a certain number of false hypocrites.
    </p>
    <p>
      24. It is our duty to evidence unto our own consciences, and give evidence
      unto others, that we are not of this sort of number.
    </p>
    <p>25. Nothing can free apostates from eternal ruin.</p>
    <p>
      26. Sincere faith will carry men through all difficulties, hazards, and
      troubles, unto the certain enjoyment of eternal blessedness.
