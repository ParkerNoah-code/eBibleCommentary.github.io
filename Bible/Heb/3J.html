    <h2>
      Ver 1.

        the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they
        offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.</em

    <h2>
      Ver 2.

        worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more
        consciousness of sins?</em

      Ver 5.
