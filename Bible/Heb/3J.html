    <h2>J. Sacrifices: Reminder of Sin (10:1-10)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 1.
      <em
        >For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of
        the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they
        offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Whatever there may be in any religious institutions and the diligent
      observance of them, if they come short of exhibiting Christ himself unto
      believers, with the benefits of his mediation, they cannot make us
      perfect, nor give us acceptance with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Whatever hath the least representation of Christ or relation unto him,
      the obscurest way of teaching the things concerning his person and grace,
      whilst it is in force, hath a glory in it,
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Christ and his grace were the only good things that were absolutely so
      from the foundation of the world, or the giving of the first promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. There is a great difference between the shadow of good things to come
      and the good things themselves, actually exhibited and granted unto the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The principal interest and design of them that come to God, is to have
      assured evidence of the perfect expiation of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. What cannot be effected for the expiation of sin at once, by any duty
      or sacrifice, cannot be effected by its reiteration or repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The repetition of the same sacrifices doth of itself demonstrate their
      insufficiency to the ends sought after.
    </p>
    <p>8. God alone limiteth the ends and efficacy of his own institutions.</p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2-3.
      <em
        >Or else wouldn’t they have ceased to be offered, because the
        worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more
        consciousness of sins? But in those sacrifices there is a yearly
        reminder of sins.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The discharge of conscience from its condemning right and power, by
      virtue of the sacrifice of Christ, is the foundation of all the other
      privileges which we receive by the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. All peace with God is resolved into a purging atonement made for sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is by a principle of gospel light alone that conscience is directed
      to condemn all sin, and yet to acquit all sinners that are purged.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. An obligation unto such ordinances of worship as could not expiate sin,
      nor testify that it was perfectly expiated, was part of the bondage of the
      church under the old testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It belongs unto the light and wisdom of faith so to remember sin and
      make confession of it as not therein or thereby to seek after a new
      atonement for it, which is made once for all.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em
        >For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away
        sins.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is possible that things may usefully represent what it is impossible
      that, in and by themselves, they should effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. There may be great and eminent uses of divine ordinances and
      institutions, although it be impossible that by themselves, in their most
      exact and diligent use, they should work out our acceptance with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It was utterly impossible that sin should be taken away before God, and
      from the conscience of the sinner, but by the blood of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The declaration of the insufficiency of all other ways for the
      expiation of sin, is an evidence of the holiness, righteousness, and
      severity of God against sin, with the unavoidable ruin of all unbelievers.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Herein also consists the great demonstration of the love, grace, and
      mercy of God, with an encouragement to faith, in that, when the old
      sacrifices neither would nor could perfectly expiate sin, he would not
      suffer the work itself to fail, but provided a way that should be
      infallibly effective of it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5-10.
      <em
        >Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, “You didn’t desire
        sacrifice and offering, but you prepared a body for me. You had no
        pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin. Then I said,
        ‘Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to
        do your will, O God.’ ” Previously saying, “Sacrifices and offerings and
        whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn’t desire, neither
        had pleasure in them” (those which are offered according to the law),
        then he has said, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He takes away
        the first, that he may establish the second, by which will we have been
        sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for
        all.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. We have the solemn word of Christ, in the declaration he made of his
      readiness and willingness to undertake the work of the expiation of sin,
      proposed unto our faith, and engaged as a sure anchor of our souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The Lord Christ had an infinite prospect of all that he was to do and
      suffer in the world in the discharge of his office and undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. No sacrifices of the law, not all of them together, were a means for
      the expiation of sin, suited to the glory of God or necessities of the
      souls of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Our utmost diligence, with the most sedulous improvement of the light
      and wisdom of faith, is necessary in our search into and inquiry after the
      mind and will of God in the revelation he makes of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The constant use of sacrifices, to signify those things which they
      could not effect or really exhibit to the worshippers, was a great part of
      the bondage that the church was kept in under the old testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. God may, in his wisdom, appoint and accept of ordinances and duties to
      one end which he will refuse and reject when they are applied to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The supreme contrivance of the salvation of the church is in a peculiar
      manner ascribed unto the person of the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The furniture of the Lord Christ (though he was the Son, and in his
      divine person the Lord of all) for the discharge of his work of mediation,
      was the peculiar act of the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Whatever God designs, appoints, and calls any unto, he will provide for
      them all that is needful unto the duties of obedience whereunto they are
      so appointed and called.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Not only the love and grace of God in sending his Son are continually
      to be admired and glorified, but the acting of this infinite wisdom, in
      fitting and preparing his human nature, so as to render it every way meet
      unto the work which it was designed for, ought to be the especial object
      of our holy contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The ineffable but yet distinct operation of the Father, Son, and
      Spirit, in, about, and towards the human nature assumed by the Son, are,
      as an uncontrollable evidence of their distinct subsistence in the same
      individual divine essence, so a guidance unto faith as unto all their
      distinct actings towards us in the application of the work of redemption
      unto our souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. It is the will of God that the church should take especial notice of
      this sacred truth, that nothing can expiate or take away sin but the blood
      of Christ alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Whatever may be the use or efficacy of any ordinances of worship, yet
      if they are employed or trusted unto for such ends as God hath not
      designed them unto, he accepts not of our persons in them, nor approves of
      the things themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. The foundation of the whole glorious work of the salvation of the
      church was laid in the sovereign will, pleasure, and grace of God, even
      the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. The coming of Christ in the flesh was, in the wisdom, righteousness,
      and holiness of God, necessary for to fulfill his will, that we might be
      saved unto his glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. The fundamental motive unto the Lord Christ, in his undertaking the
      work of mediation, was the will and glory of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. God’s records in the roll of his book are the foundation and warrant
      of the faith of the church, in the head and members.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. The Lord Christ, in all that he did and suffered, had continual
      respect unto what was written of him.
    </p>
    <p>19. In the record of these words, “Lo, I come,” etc., —</p>
    <p>(1.) God was glorified in his truth and faithfulness;</p>
    <p>(2.) Christ was secured in his work and the undertaking of it;</p>
    <p>(3.) A testimony was given unto his person and office;</p>
    <p>
      (4.) Direction is given unto the church, in all wherein they have to do
      with God, what they should attend unto, namely, what is written;
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The things which concern Christ the mediator are the head of what is
      contained in the same records.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. Whereas the apostle doth plainly distinguish and distribute all
      sacrifices and offerings, into those on the one side which were offered by
      the law, and that one offering of the body of Christ on the other side,
      the pretended sacrifice of the mass is utterly rejected from any place in
      the worship of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. God, as the sovereign lawgiver, had always power and authority to make
      what alteration he pleased in the orders and institutions of his worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. Sovereign authority is that alone which our faith and obedience
      respect in all ordinances of worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. As all things from the beginning made way for the coming of Christ in
      the minds of them that did believe, so every thing was to be removed out
      of the way that would hinder his coming and the discharge of the work he
      had undertaken: law, temple, sacrifices, must all be removed, to give way
      unto his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      24. Truth is never so effectually declared as when it is confirmed by the
      experience of its power in them that believe it and make profession of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      25. It is a holy glorying in God, and no unlawful boasting, for men openly
      to profess what they are made partakers of by the grace of God and blood
      of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      26. It is the best security, in differences in and about religion (such as
      these wherein the apostle is engaged, the greatest and highest that ever
      were), when men have an internal experience of the truth which they do
      profess.
    </p>
    <p>
      27. The sovereign will and pleasure of God, acting itself in infinite
      wisdom and grace, is the sole, supreme, original cause of the salvation of
      the church.
