    <h2>E. A New Covenant (8:7-13)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have
        been sought for a second.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Whatever God had done before for the church, yet he ceased not, in his
      wisdom and grace until he had made it partaker of the best and most
      blessed condition whereof in this world it is capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Let those unto whom the terms of the new covenant are proposed in the
      gospel take heed to themselves that they sincerely embrace and improve
      them, for there is neither promise nor hope of any further or fuller
      administration of grace.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 8.
      <em
        >For finding fault with them, he said, “Behold, the days are coming”,
        says the Lord, “that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel
        and with the house of Judah;</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. God hath ofttimes just cause to complain of his people, when yet he
      will not utterly cast them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is the duty of the church to take deep notice of God’s complaints of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>3. God often surpriseth the church with promises of grace and mercy.</p>
    <p>
      4. “He saith,” that is, נְאֻםאּיְהָֹוה, “saith the Lord,” is the formal
      object of our faith and obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Where God placeth a note of observation and attention, we should
      carefully fix our faith and consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The things and concerns of the new covenant are all of them objects of
      the best of our consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. There is a time limited and fixed for the accomplishment of all the
      promises of God, and all the purpose of his grace towards the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The new covenant, as collecting into one all the promises of grace
      given from the foundation of the world, accomplished in the actual
      exhibition of Christ, and confirmed in his death and by the shedding of
      his blood, and thereby becoming the sole rule of new spiritual ordinances
      of worship suited thereunto, was the great object of the faith of the
      saints in the old Testament, and is the great foundation of all our
      present mercies.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. All the efficacy and glory of the new covenant do originally rise from,
      and are resolved into, the author and supreme cause of it, which is God
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The covenant of grace in Christ is made only with the Israel of God,
      the church of the elect.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Those who are first and most advanced as to outward privileges are
      oftentimes last and least advantaged by the grace and mercy of them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 9.
      <em
        >not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
        that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for
        they didn’t continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them,” says the
        Lord.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The grace and glory of the new covenant are much set off and manifested
      by the comparing of it with the old.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. All God’s works are equally good and holy in themselves, but as unto
      the use and advantage of the church, he is pleased to make some of them
      means of communicating more grace than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Though God makes an alteration in any of his works, ordinances of
      worship, or institutions, yet he never changeth his intention or the
      purpose of his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The disposal of mercies and privileges, as unto times, persons,
      seasons, is wholly in the hand and power of God.
    </p>
    <p>5. Sins have their aggravations from mercies received.</p>
    <p>
      6. Nothing but effectual grace will secure our covenant-obedience one
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. No covenant between God and man ever was or ever could be stable and
      effectual, as unto the ends of it, that was not made and confirmed in
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. No external administration of a covenant of God’s own making, no
      obligation of mercy on the minds of men, can enable them unto
      steadfastness in covenant-obedience, without an effectual influence of
      grace from and by Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. God, in making a covenant with any, in proposing the terms of it,
      retains his right and authority to deal with persons according to their
      deportment in and towards that covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. God’s casting men out of his special care, upon the breach of his
      covenant, is the highest judgment that in this world can fall on any
      persons.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 10-12.
      <em
        >“For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
        after those days,” says the Lord: “I will put my laws into their mind; I
        will also write them on their heart. I will be their God, and they will
        be my people. They will not teach every man his fellow citizen and every
        man his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for all will know me, from
        their least to their greatest. For I will be merciful to their
        unrighteousness. I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no
        more.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The covenant of grace, as reduced into the form of a testament,
      confirmed by the blood of Christ, doth not depend on any condition or
      qualification in our persons, but on a free grant and donation to God, and
      so do all the good things prepared in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The precepts of the old covenant are all turned into promises under the
      new.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. All things in the new covenant being proposed unto us by the way of
      promise, it is by faith alone that we may attain a participation of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Sense of the loss of an interest in and participation of the benefits
      of the old covenant, is the best preparation for receiving the mercies of
      the new.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. God himself, in and by his own sovereign wisdom, grace, goodness, all
      sufficiency, and power, is to be considered as the only cause and author
      of the new covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in the new covenant, in its being,
      existence, and healing efficacy, is as large and extensive to repair our
      natures, as sin is in its residence and power to deprave them.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. All the beginnings and entrances into the saving knowledge of God, and
      thereon of obedience unto him, are effects of the grace of the covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The work of grace in the new covenant passeth on the whole soul, in all
      its faculties, powers, and affections, unto their change and renovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. To take away the necessity and efficacy of renewing, changing,
      sanctifying grace, consisting in an internal, efficacious operation of the
      principles, habits, and acts of internal grace and obedience, is plainly
      to overthrow and reject the new covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. We bring nothing to the new covenant but our hearts, as tables to be
      written on, with the sense of the insufficiency of the precepts and
      promises of the law, with respect to our own ability to comply with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The Lord Christ, God and man, undertaking to be the mediator between
      God and man and a surety on our behalf, is the spring and head of the new
      covenant, which is made and established with us in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. As nothing less than God becoming our God could relieve, help, and
      save us, so nothing more can be required thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The efficacy, security, and glory of this covenant, depend originally
      on the nature of God, immediately and actually on the mediation of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. It is from the engagement of the properties of the divine nature that
      this covenant is ordered in all things and sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. As the grace of this covenant is inexpressible, so are the obligations
      it puts upon us unto obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. God doth as well undertake for our being his people as he doth for his
      being our God.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. Those whom God makes a covenant withal are his in a peculiar manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. The instructive ministry of the old testament, as it was such, and as
      it had respect to the carnal rites thereof, was a ministry of the letter,
      and not of the spirit, which did not really effect in the hearts of men
      the things which it taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. There is a duty incumbent on every man to instruct others, according
      to his ability and opportunity, in the knowledge of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. It is the Spirit of grace alone, as promised in the new covenant,
      which frees the church from a laborious but ineffectual way of teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. There was a hidden treasure of divine wisdom, of the knowledge of God,
      laid up in the mystical revelations and institutions of the old testament,
      which the people were not then able to look into nor to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. The whole knowledge of God in Christ is both plainly revealed and
      savingly communicated, by virtue of the new covenant, unto them who do
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. There are, and ever were, different degrees of persons in the church,
      as unto the saving knowledge of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      24. Where there is not some degree of saving knowledge, there no interest
      in the new covenant can be pretended.
    </p>
    <p>
      25. The full and clear declaration of God, as he is to be known of us in
      this life, is a privilege reserved for and belonging unto the days of the
      new testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      26. To know God as he is revealed in Christ, is the highest privilege
      whereof in this life we can be made partakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      27. Persons destitute of this saving knowledge are utter strangers unto
      the covenant of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      28. Free, sovereign, and undeserved grace in the pardon of sin, is the
      original spring and foundation of all covenant mercies and blessings.
    </p>
    <p>
      29. The new covenant is made only with them who effectually and eventually
      are made partakers of the grace of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      30. The aggravations of sin are great and many, which the consciences of
      convinced sinners ought to have regard unto 31. There is grace and mercy
      in the new covenant provided for all sorts of sins and all aggravations of
      them, if this grace and mercy be received in a due manner.
    </p>
    <p>32. Aggravations of sin do glorify grace in pardon.</p>
    <p>
      33. We cannot understand aright the glory and excellency of pardoning
      mercy, unless we are convinced of the greatness and vileness of our sins
      in all their aggravations.
