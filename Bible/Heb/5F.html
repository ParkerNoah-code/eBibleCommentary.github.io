    <h2>

    <p>
      1. Every act of grace in God or love in Christ towards us is in its own
      nature obligatory to thankful obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The religious worship of any creature, under what pretense soever, hath
      no place in our Christian profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Every act and duty of faith hath in it the nature of a sacrifice to
      God, wherewith he is well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The great, yea, the only encouragement which we have to bring our
      sacrifices to God with expectation of acceptance lieth herein, that we are
      to offer them by him who can and will make them acceptable in his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Whatever we tender to God, and not by Christ, it hath no other
      acceptance with him than the sacrifice of Cain.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. To abide and abound in solemn praise to God for Jesus Christ, and for
      his mediation and sacrifice, is the constant duty of the church, and the
      best character of sincere believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. A constant solemn acknowledgment of the glory of God, and of the holy
      excellencies of his nature (that is, his name) in the work of the
      redemption of the church by the suffering and offering of Christ, is the
      principal duty of it, and the animating soul and principle of all other
      duties whatever.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 16.
      <em
        >But don’t forget to be doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices
        God is well pleased.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is dangerous unto the souls of men, when an attention unto one duty
      is abused to countenance the neglect of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The world itself, even in those that believe not, doth receive great
      advantage by the grace administered from the death of Christ and its
      fruits, whereof the apostle treats.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That religion hath no relation unto the cross of Christ which doth not
      incline and dispose men unto benignity and the exercise of loving-kindness
      towards all.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Much less hath that religion any relation to the cross of Christ which
      guides and disposeth its professors unto rage, cruelty, and oppression of
      others, on the account of an interest of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. We ought always to admire the glory of divine wisdom, which hath so
      disposed the state of the church in this world, that there should be
      continual occasion for the exercise of every grace mutually among
      ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Beneficence and communication are the only outward evidences and
      demonstrations of the renovation of the image of God in us.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. God hath laid up provision for the poor in the grace and duty of the
      rich, not in their coffers and their barns, wherein they have no interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The will of God revealed concerning his acceptance of any duties, is
      the most effectual motive unto our diligence in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The works and duties which are peculiarly useful unto men are
      peculiarly acceptable to God.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 17.
      <em
        >Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch on behalf of your
        souls, as those who will give account, that they may do this with joy
        and not with groaning, for that would be unprofitable for you.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The due obedience of the church in all its members unto the rulers of
      it, in the discharge of their office and duty, is the best means of its
      edification, and the chief cause of order and peace in the whole body.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. An assumption of right and power by any to rule over the church,
      without evidencing their design and work to be a watching for the good of
      their souls, is pernicious unto themselves and ruinous unto the church
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. They who do attend with conscience and diligence unto the discharge of
      the work of the ministry towards their flocks, committed in an especial
      manner unto their charge, have no greater joy or sorrow in this world than
      what accompanies the daily account which they give unto Christ of the
      discharge of their duty amongst them, as their success falls out to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Much of the life of the ministry and benefit of the church depend on
      the continual account given unto Christ, by prayer and thanksgiving, of
      the state of the church and success of the word therein.
