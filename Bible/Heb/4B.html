    <h2>B. Judgment: Vengeance is Mine (10:26-31)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 26-27.
      <em
        >For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the
        truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful

    </h2>
    <p>
      1. If a voluntary relinquishment of the profession of the gospel and the
      duties of it be the highest sin, and be attended with the height of wrath
      and punishment, we ought earnestly to watch against every thing that
      inclineth or disposeth us thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Every declension in or from the profession of the gospel hath a
      proportion of the guilt of this great sin, according unto the proportion
      that it bears unto the sin itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There are sins and times wherein God doth absolutely refuse to hear any
      more from men in order unto their salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The loss of an interest in the sacrifice of Christ, on what account or
      by what means soever it fall out, is absolutely ruinous unto the souls of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. There is an inseparable concatenation between apostasy and eternal
      ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. God oftentimes visits the minds of cursed apostates with dreadful
      expectations of approaching wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. When men have hardened themselves in sin, no fear of punishment will
      either rouse or stir them up to seek after relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. A dreadful expectation of future wrath, without hope of relief, is an
      open entrance into hell itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The expectation of future judgment in guilty persons is, and will be at
      one time or another, dreadful and tremendous.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. There is a determinate time for the accomplishment of all divine
      threatenings and the infliction of the severest judgments, which no man
      can abide or avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The certain determination of divine vengeance on the enemies of the
      gospel is a motive unto holiness, a supportment under sufferings in them
      that believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The highest aggravation of the greatest sins, is when men, out of a
      contrary principle of superstition and error, do set themselves
      maliciously to oppose the doctrine and truth of the gospel, with respect
      unto themselves and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. There is a time when God will make demonstrations of his wrath and
      displeasure against all such adversaries of the gospel as shall be pledges
      of his eternal indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. The dread and terror of God’s final judgments against the enemies of
      the gospel is in itself inconceivable, and only shadowed out by things of
      the greatest dread and terror in the world.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 28-29.
      <em
        >A man who disregards Moses’ law dies without compassion on the word of
        two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment do you think he will
        be judged worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has
        counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy
        thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is the contempt of God and his authority in his law that is the gall
      and poison of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. When the God of mercies will have men show no mercy as to the temporal
      punishment, he can and will, upon repentance, show mercy as to eternal
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Though there may be sometimes an appearance of great severity in God’s
      judgments against sinners, yet when the nature of their sins and the
      aggravation of them shall be discovered, they will be manifested to have
      been righteous and within due measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. We ought to take heed of every neglect of the person of Christ or of
      his authority, lest we enter into some degree or other of the guilt of
      this great offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The sins of men can really reach neither the person nor authority of
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Every thing that takes off from a high and glorious esteem of the blood
      of Christ as the blood of the covenant, is a dangerous entrance into
      apostasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. However men may esteem of any of the mediatory actings of Christ, yet
      are they in themselves glorious and excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. There are no such cursed pernicious enemies unto religion as apostates.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The inevitable certainty of the eternal punishment of gospel despisers
      depends on the essential holiness and righteousness of God, as the ruler
      and judge of all.
    </p>
    <p>10. It is a righteous thing with God thus to deal with men.</p>
    <p>
      11. God hath allotted different degrees of punishment unto the different
      degrees and aggravations of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The apostasy from the gospel here described, being the absolute height
      of all sin and impiety that the nature of man is capable of, renders them
      unto eternity obnoxious unto all punishment that the same nature is
      capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. It is our duty diligently to inquire into the nature of sin, lest we
      be overtaken in the great offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Sinning against the testimony given by the Holy Ghost unto the truth
      and power of the gospel, whereof men have had experience, is the most
      dangerous symptom of a perishing condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Threatenings of future eternal judgments unto gospel despisers belong
      unto the preaching and declaration of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. The equity and righteousness of the most severe judgments of God, in
      eternal punishments against gospel despisers, is so evident that it may be
      referred to the judgment of men not obstinate in their blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. It is our duty to justify and bear witness unto God in the
      righteousness of his judgments against gospel despisers.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 30-31.
      <em
        >For we know him who said, “Vengeance belongs to me. I will repay,” says
        the Lord. Again, “The Lord will judge his people.” It is a fearful thing
        to fall into the hands of the living God.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There can be no right judgment made of the nature and demerit of sin,
      without a due consideration of the nature and holiness of God, against
      whom it is committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Nothing will state our thoughts aright concerning the guilt and demerit
      of sin, but a deep consideration of the infinite greatness, holiness,
      righteousness, and power of God, against whom it is committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Under apprehensions of great severities of divine judgments, the
      consideration of God, the author of them, will both relieve our faith and
      quiet our hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. A due consideration of the nature of God, his office, that he is the
      Judge of all, especially of his people, and that enclosure he hath made of
      vengeance unto himself, under an irrevocable purpose for its execution,
      gives indubitable assurance of the certain, unavoidable destruction of all
      wilful apostates.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Although those who are the people of God do stand in many relations
      unto him that are full of refreshment and comfort, yet it is their duty
      constantly to remember that he is the holy and righteous Judge, even
      towards his own people.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The knowledge of God in some good measure, both what he is in himself
      and what he hath taken on himself to do, is necessary, to render either
      his promises or threatenings effectual unto the minds of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The name of the living God is full of terror or comfort unto the souls
      of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. There is an apprehension of the terror of the Lord in the final
      judgment, which is of great use to the souls of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. When there is nothing left but judgment, nothing remains but the
      expectation of it, its fore-apprehension will be filled with dread and
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The dread of the final judgment, where there shall be no mixture of
      ease, is altogether inexpressible.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. That man is lost for ever who hath nothing in God that he can appeal
      unto.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Those properties of God which are the principal delight of believers,
      the chief object of their faith, hope, and trust, are an eternal spring of
      dread and terror unto all impenitent sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The glory and horror of the future state of blessedness and misery are
      inconceivable, either to believers or sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. The fear and dread of God, in the description of his wrath, ought
      continually to be in the hearts of all who profess the gospel.
