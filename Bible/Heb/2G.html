    <h2>G. Moving on to Maturity (5:11-6:3)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 11.
      <em
        >About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you
        have become dull of hearing.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There are revealed in the Scripture sundry deep and mysterious truths,
      which require a peculiar diligence in our attendance unto their
      declaration, that we rightly understand them or receive them in a due
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is necessary for the ministers of the gospel sometimes to insist on
      the most abstruse and difficult truths that are revealed for our
      edification.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There is a glorious light and evidence in all divine truths, but by
      reason of our darkness and weakness, we are not always able to comprehend
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Many who receive the word at first with some readiness, do yet
      afterwards make but slow progress either in knowledge or grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is men’s slothfulness in hearing that is the sole cause of their not
      improving the means of grace, or not thriving under the dispensation of
      the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is a grievous matter to the dispersers of the gospel, to find their
      hearers unapt to learn and thrive under their ministry, through their
      negligence and sloth.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 12.
      <em
        >For although by this time you should be teachers, you again need to
        have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the
        revelations of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The time wherein we enjoy the great mercy and privilege of the
      dispensation of the gospel, is a matter which must in particular be
      accounted for.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Churches are the schools of Christ, wherein his disciples are trained
      up unto perfection, every one according to the measure appointed for him,
      and usefulness in the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is the duty of ministers of the gospel to endeavor to promote the
      increase of their hearers in knowledge, until they also are able to
      instruct others, according to their calls and opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The holy Scriptures are to be looked on, consulted, and submitted unto,
      as the oracles of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. God hath, in infinite love and wisdom, so disposed of his word as that
      there are first principles, plain and necessary, laid down in it, to
      facilitate the instruction he intends thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. They who live under the preaching of the gospel are obnoxious to great
      and provoking sins, if they diligently watch not against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. There will be a time when false and unprofitable professors will be
      made manifest and discovered, either to their present conviction or their
      eternal confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Men do ofttimes secretly wax worse and worse under profession and means
      of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. There are provisions of truth in the Scripture, suitable to the
      spiritual instruction and edification of all sorts of persons that belong
      to Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 13.
      <em
        >For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of
        righteousness, for he is a baby.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. The gospel is the only word of righteousness, in itself and to us.</p>
    <p>
      2. It is a great aggravation of the negligence of persons under the
      dispensation of the gospel, that it is a word of righteousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That God requires, of all those who live under the dispensation of the
      gospel, that they should be skilful in the word of righteousness.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 14.
      <em
        >But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use
        have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The word of the gospel, in the dispensation of it, is food provided for
      the souls of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Whereas the word is food, it is evident that it will not profit our
      souls until it be eaten and digested.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is an evidence of a thriving and healthy state of soul, to have an
      appetite unto the deepest mysteries of the gospel, its most solid
      doctrines of truth, and to be able profitably to digest them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The assiduous exercise of our minds about spiritual things, in a
      spiritual manner, is the only means to make us profit in the hearing of
      the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The spiritual sense of believers, well exercised in the word, is the
      best and most undeceiving help in judging of what is good or evil, what is
      true or false, that is proposed unto them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 1a.
      <em
        >Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let’s
        press on to perfection—</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is the duty of ministers of the gospel to take care, not only that
      the doctrine which they preach be true, but also that it be seasonable
      with respect to the state and condition of their hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Some important doctrines of truth may, in the preaching of the gospel,
      be omitted for a season, but none must ever be forgotten or neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is a necessary duty of the dispensers of the gospel to excite their
      hearers, by all pressing considerations, to make a progress in the
      knowledge of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The case of that people is deplorable and dangerous whose teachers are
      not able to carry them on in the knowledge of the mysteries of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. In our progress towards an increase in knowledge, we ought to go on
      with diligence and the full bent of our wills and affections.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 1b-2.
      <em
        >not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith
        toward God, of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of
        resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There is no full interest in Christ or Christian religious to be
      obtained without repentance from dead works, nor any orderly entrance into
      a gospel church-state without a credible profession thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Faith in God, as to the accomplishing of the great promise in sending
      his Son Jesus Christ to save us from our sins, is the great fundamental
      principle of our interest in and profession of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The consideration of the accomplishment of this promise is a great
      encouragement and support to faith with respect to all other promises of
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The doctrine of the resurrection is a fundamental principle of the
      gospel, the faith whereof is indispensably necessary unto the obedience
      and consolation of all that profess it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Ministers of the gospel ought to dwell greatly on the consideration of
      this principle, as it is represented in its terror and glory, that they
      may be excited and stirred up to deal effectually with the souls of men,
      that they fall not under the vengeance of that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Persons to be admitted into the church, and unto a participation of all
      the holy ordinances thereof, had need to be well instructed in the
      important principles of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It is not the outward sign, but the inward grace, that is principally
      to be considered in those ordinances or observances of the church which
      visibly consist in rites and ceremonies, or have them accompanying them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em>This will we do, if God permits.</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. No discouragements should deter the ministers of the gospel, to whom
      the dispensation of the mysteries of Christ is committed, from proceeding
      in the declaration of these, when they are called thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. As it is our duty to submit ourselves in all our undertakings unto the
      will of God, so especially in those wherein his glory is immediately
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Let them who are intrusted with means of light, knowledge, and grace,
      improve them with diligence, lest, upon their knowledge, God suffer not
      his ministers further to instruct them.
