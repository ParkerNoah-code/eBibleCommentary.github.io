  <h2>Verse 13</h2>
  <p>
    For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for
    he is a babe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every one that feeds on milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for
    he is a babe. The Apostle uses similar language to the Corinthians. 1
    Corinthians 3:1-2. They are thus characterized on account of their
    disposition to follow different leaders. Sometimes the term babes, or little
    children, is used in a good sense. We are commanded, as new-born babes, to
    desire the sincere milk of the word. In malice we are to be children, but in
    understanding to be men. If we do not receive the kingdom of heaven as
    little children we cannot enter therein. Our high imaginations must be cast
    down and our thoughts brought into subjection to Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    But here the word babes is not used in a good sense. The Apostle charges the
    Hebrews with being weak in the faith, babes in understanding. There
    Galatians 4:3, weak and beggarly elements.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 14</h2>
  <p>
    But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by
    reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
  </p>
  <p>
    As grown up persons do not feed upon milk, but are able to digest strong
    meat; so those who are perfect, [The word rendered &quot;of full age&quot;
    Philippians 3:15, where it has probably a reference to those who were
    initiated in the heathen mysteries. They were termed perfect.] well
    instructed, who have their senses exercised to discern good and evil, view
    the ordinances of the Mosaic dispensation in their true light, as what they
    really are: shadows; as shadows of good things to come, chap10:1 , and thus
    discern the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God
    ordained before the world unto our glory. 1 Corinthians 2:7.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 1</h2>
  <p>
    Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on
    unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead
    works, and of faith toward God.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apostle had said that he had many things to say concerning Melchisedec,
    which were hard to be uttered, in consequence of the Hebrews being dull of
    hearing. As it is difficult to speak to a deaf Hebrews 9:10, signifying the
    necessity of repentance. In like manner, the laying on of hands on the
    sacrifice about to be offered, represents faith. The worshipper, by laying
    his hands on the victim, confessing his sins, expressed his faith of
    remission through the shedding of blood. Hebrews 9:22. [The baptisms here
    spoken of cannot refer to the ordinance of Christ, for there is but one
    Christian baptism. Ephesians 4:5. The resurrection of the dead, which is a
    most prominent part of the doctrine of Christ, was plainly taught by Moses
    and the prophets, and generally believed by the Jews. Acts 24:15; John
    11:24; Acts 23:6; Mark 12:23; Mark 12:27; while the Sadducees denied it.
    Acts 23:8. The faith of the resurrection implied the future judgment. Indeed
    the future judgment was implied by mankind after the fall being divided into
    two classes, while all were to return to the dust. The separation must be
    made after death, so that the resurrection and the judgment were clearly
    taught from the beginning. All go to one place whatever be their character,
    the grave receives them all; in dividing mankind into two classes after the
    fall, God clearly intimated the general judgment It is called eternal
    judgment, because its decisions will never be reversed.]
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 3</h2>
  <p>And this will we do, if God permit.</p>
  <p>
    This, therefore, was the course, which, by Divine permission, he intended to
    follow.
