    <h2>E. Perfected Salvation through Him (2:10-18)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 10.
      <em
        >For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not
        subject to him. But now we don’t yet see all things subjected to
        him.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. That the whole work of saving the sons of God, from first to last,
      their guidance and conduct through sins and sufferings unto glory, is
      committed unto the Lord Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That the Lord Jesus Christ being priest, sacrifice, and altar himself,
      the offering whereby he was consecrated unto the perfection and complement
      of his office was of necessity to be part of that work which, as our
      priests and mediator, he was to undergo and perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Lord Christ, being consecrated and perfected through sufferings,
      hath consecrated the way of sufferings, for all that follow him to pass
      through unto glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Such is the desert of sin, and such is the immutability of the justice
      of God, that there was no way possible to bring sinners unto glory but by
      the sufferings and death of the Son of God, who undertook to be the
      captain of their salvation.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 11-13.
      <em
        >For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from
        one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, “I
        will declare your name to my brothers. Among the congregation I will
        sing your praise.” Again, “I will put my trust in him.” Again, “Behold,
        here I am with the children whom God has given me.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. That all the children which are to be brought unto glory, antecedently
      unto their relation unto the Lord Christ, are polluted, defiled, separate
      from God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That the Lord Christ is the great sanctifier of the church. He, as the
      captain of salvation, sanctifies every son whom he brings to glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The agreement of Christ and the elect in one common nature is the
      foundation of his fitness to be an undertaker on their behalf, and of the
      equity of their being made partners of the benefits of his mediation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. That notwithstanding the union of nature which is between the Son of
      God incarnate, the sanctifier, and the children that are to be sanctified,
      there is, in respect of their persons, an inconceivable distance between
      them, so that it is a marvelous condescension in him to call them
      brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. That which was principally upon the heart of Christ in his sufferings,
      was to declare and manifest the love, grace, and good-will of God unto
      men, that they might come to an acquaintance with him and acceptance
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. That the Lord Christ, as the captain of our salvation, was exposed in
      the days of his flesh unto great difficulties, anxieties of mind, dangers,
      and troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The Lord Christ, in all his perplexities and troubles, betook himself
      unto the protection of God, trusting in him.
    </p>
    <p>8. He both suffered and trusted as our head and precedent.</p>
    <h2>
      Ver 14-15.
      <em
        >Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself
        in the same way partook of the same, that through death he might bring
        to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might
        deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
        subject to bondage.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. That all sinners are subject unto death as it is penal.</p>
    <p>
      2. Fear of death as it is penal is inseparable from sin, before the sinner
      is delivered by the death of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Fear of death as penal renders the minds of men obnoxious unto bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. That the Lord Christ, out of his inexpressible love, willingly
      submitted himself unto every condition of the children to be saved by him,
      and to every thing in every condition of them, sin only excepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It was only in flesh and blood, the substance and essence of human
      nature, and not in our personal infirmities, that the Lord Christ was made
      like unto us.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. That the Son of God should take part in human nature with the children,
      is the greatest and most admirable effect of divine love, wisdom, and
      grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. That the first and principal end of the Lord Christ’s assuming human
      nature, was not to reign in it, but to suffer and die in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. All the power of Satan in the world over any of the sons of men is
      founded in sin, and the guilt of death attending it.
    </p>
    <p>9. All sinners out of Christ are under the power of Satan.</p>
    <p>
      10. The death of Christ, through the wise and righteous disposal of God,
      is victorious, all-conquering, and prevalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. One principal end of the death of Christ was to destroy the power of
      Satan.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 16.
      <em
        >For most certainly, he doesn’t give help to angels, but he gives help
        to the offspring of Abraham.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. The Lord Jesus Christ is truly God and man in one person.</p>
    <p>
      2. The redemption of mankind, by the taking of our nature, was a work of
      mere sovereign grace.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 17-18.
      <em
        >Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers,
        that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things
        pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. For in
        that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who
        are tempted.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The promised Messiah was to be the great high priest of the people of
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The assumption of our nature, and his conformity unto us therein, was
      principally necessary unto the Lord Jesus on the account of his being a
      priest for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Such was the unspeakable love of Christ unto the brethren, that he
      would refuse nothing, no condition that was needful to fit him for the
      discharge of the work which he had undertaken for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The principal work of the Lord Christ as our high priest, and from
      which all other actings of his in that office do flow, was to make
      reconciliation or atonement for sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Lord Christ suffered under all his temptations, sinned in none.
    </p>
    <p>6. Temptations cast souls into danger.</p>
    <p>
      7. The great duty of tempted souls is to cry out unto the Lord Christ for
      help and relief.
