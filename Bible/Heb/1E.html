      <em>Commentary on Hebrews</em></a
    >.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 11</h2>
  <p>
    For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for
    which came he is not ashamed to call them brethren.
  </p>
  <p>
    For both he that sanctifieth and them that are sanctified.—Christ says:
    &quot;And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be
    sanctified through the truth.&quot; John 17:19. Israel were sanctified, or
    set apart, as God&#x27;s peculiar people, by the blood of the Sinai
    covenant, which could not tale away sin, but only sanctified to the
    purifying of the flesh. Christ sanctified His people with His own blood,
    Hebrews 13:12, which cleanseth them from all sin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of one.—Some explain this of one Father; others, of one nature; but it is
    evidently of one family. Christ is the seed of the woman; and all believers,
    in common with the rest of mankind, are born of a woman. It has been already
    observed, that, immediately after the fall, mankind were divided into two
    families, —the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent. Christ was
    eminently the seed of the woman, the head of the family, and all His people
    are His brethren.
  </p>
  <p>
    He is eminently the Son of the Father, 2 John 1:3; and, as the sanctifier
    and the sanctified are all of one family, He acknowledges them as His
    brethren, Mark 3:34; Luke 8:21; John 20:17; and, in virtue of their union
    with Him, they are called the sons of God, 1 John 3:1.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sanctification means separation. Christ, that He might sanctify the people
    with His own. blood, suffered without the gate. Hebrews 13:12.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the blood of sprinkling of which the Apostle speaks. Hebrews 12:24.
    The blood of the old covenant was sprinkled on the bodies of the children of
    Israel at Sinai, and thus they became externally holy. The blood of Christ
    is sprinkled upon the consciences of all His people, and gives them
    confidence in coming to God. The firstborn of the family received the Spirit
    without measure, and through Him it is communicated to the whole family.
    &quot; But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
    Galatians 4:4-7.
  </p>
  <p>
    For which cause; that Exodus 4:22, in reference to which the Apostle
    writes,— &quot;To whom pertaineth the adoption.&quot; Romans 9:4.
  </p>
  <p>
    God promised to Abraham a numerous posterity, to be a God to Him and to his
    seed after Him, and to give them the land of Canaan. These promises were all
    limited to that branch of the family from which Christ was to spring; for
    one great object which God had in view, was to manifest His faithfulness in
    the promise, that all the families of the earth should be blessed in the
    seed of Abraham. It was therefore necessary that this family should be kept
    distinct; and therefore was the middle- wall of partition set up between it
    and all other families.
  </p>
  <p>
    Isaac, as being the progenitor of Christ, was the child of promise,
    Galatians 4:23; and for the same reason Jacob was beloved and Esau hated,
    Abraham had seven sons besides Isaac, but they had no part in the covenant.
    The Apostle teaches us that the promise, &quot;I will be a God to thee and
    to thy seed,&quot; does not refer to Abraham&#x27;s posterity in general,
    but to one of his descendants, namely, Christ. Galatians 3:16.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, the Jewish dispensation was a model of the kingdom of God; and, as only
    they that are Christ&#x27;s are Abraham&#x27;s seed and heirs according to
    the promise, Galatians 3:29, so the first covenant was exclusively made with
    that branch of the family from which Christ was to spring. That family
    alone, of all the families of the earth, was acknowledged of God as His
    people. He dwelt among them. He showed His Word unto Jacob, His statutes and
    His judgments unto Israel, while He suffered all the other families of the
    earth to walk in their own ways. The carnal relation of Israel to Christ was
    a shadow of the spiritual relation of the true Israel to their glorious
    Head; and the carnal blessings in earthly places, with which Israel after
    the flesh was blessed, were a figure for the time then present of the
    spiritual blessings bestowed on the true Israel. When our Lord was informed
    that His mother and His brethren stood without desiring to speak with Him,
    He replied,— &quot;Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?&quot; He knew,
    or acknowledged no man after the flesh; but &quot;stretched forth his hand
    toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! For
    whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my
    brother, and sister, and mother.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    Matthew 12:49-50. Hence we learn, that those whom Christ is not ashamed to
    call brethren are the members of His Church. The children of the new
    covenant, who are all taught of God, have all heard and learned of the
    Father; are delivered from the power of darkness, and translated into the
    kingdom of His dear Son. These alone are the brethren of Christ whom He is
    not ashamed to acknowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thy name.—The name of God is the expression of his character. One man is
    distinguished from another by his name. Jesus declared the name of God to
    His brethren, John 17:26, by manifesting His own character. God proclaimed
    His name before Moses. Exodus 33:19. He was alone, no man was to be seen
    throughout the mount, Exodus 34:3; and when he came down, Moses wist not
    that the skin of his face shone, so that Aaron and the children of Israel
    were afraid to come nigh him. Exodus 34:30. This transaction is explained by
    the Apostle, when he says,—&quot; We all, with open face,&quot; or, perhaps
    rather, in an unveiled face, &quot; beholding as in a glass the glory of the
    Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the
    Spirit of the Lord.&quot; 2 Corinthians 3:18. A view of God&#x27;s character
    has a transforming influence. Here we see through a glass darkly; but
    hereafter we shall see Him as He Psalm 17:15. 1 John 3:2.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the midst of the Church will I sing praise unto thee.—Jesus sang praises
    to God in the midst of the great assembly in the temple, which was typical
    of the Church. He is still present in the Churches of the saints; and
    through His brethren, and in the midst of them, He still praises His Father.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 13</h2>
  <p>
    And again, I will put mg trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children
    which God hath given me.
  </p>
  <p>
    And again, I will put my trust in Him.— There are several passages of
    Scripture in which this expression occurs, Psal; 2 Samuel 22:3; and in
    Isaiah 8:17 the same sense, with a slight variation, is expressed; to
    whatever passage the reference is made, the sense in the argument is the
    same. We have here a decisive proof of Christ being made like unto His
    brethren.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the preceding verse he had been represented as saying, &quot;I will
    declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the Church will I sing
    praise unto thee;&quot; thus acknowledging them as His brethren, and His
    Church, which, we are elsewhere taught, is His body,
  </p>
  <p>
    1 Corinthians 12:27; Ephesians 1:23; like the human body it is one, although
    composed of many members. The next quotation is either from Psalm 18:2, or
    Isaiah 8:17. In the Psalm the words are the same with those used by the
    Apostle, and in Isaiah the sense exactly corresponds. That the eighteenth
    Psalm is a prediction of the humiliation and exaltation of the Lord Jesus is
    manifest. With his dying breath the Lord Jesus cried, &quot;Father, into thy
    hands I commend my spirit;&quot; and the cry came into His ears. The
    earthquake which accompanied His resurrection, and His being drawn out of
    many waters, are then described, Psalm 18:7; Psalm 18:16-17, together with
    the punishment which He inflicted on His enemies, ver37 , and His being made
    the head of the heathen, ver43. Now the quotation, &quot;I will put my trust
    in Him,&quot; ver2; or, &quot;I will wait upon the Lord, and I will look for
    him,&quot; Isaiah 8:17, proves the unity of Christ and his people. He has
    left us a perfect example of confidence in God. This is plainly exhibited in
    innumerable passages of the Book of Isaiah 8:18. In the preceding chapter
    God had given Ahaz, the idolatrous King of Judah, as a sign of the stability
    of the kingdom of Judah, viz, the birth of the virgin&#x27;s Isaiah 7:14;
    Matthew 1:22-23, at the same time informing him (Isaiah) that before his son
    Shear-jashub (whom he had been directed to take with him to meet Ahaz)
    should know to refuse the evil and choose the good, Syria and Israel should
    be forsaken of both her kings. Ahaz was warned at the same time of the
    judgments which should come upon him, although not from the quarter he
    dreaded. The birth of another son to the prophet, which he had predicted, is
    then recorded, chap8:1; and he is informed that, before the child was able
    to speak, the spoil of Damascus and Samaria should be taken away by the King
    of Assyria. Judah, however, is reminded that they should not escape the same
    scourge. They are, however, encouraged to trust in God,—to fear Him; and it
    is predicted that Christ should be the sanctuary of his people, but a
    stumbling-stone and rock of offence to both houses of Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    This passage is frequently applied in the New Testament to Christ. The
    prophecy Acts 1:8; Revelation 1:5.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 14-15</h2>
  <p>
    V:14 , 15.—Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
    he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might
    destroy him that had the power of death, that Hebrews 10:6; but He prepared
    a body for the incarnation of Jesus, who came to do His will by offering up
    Himself. The children whom God had given Him were partakers of flesh and
    blood, and He also Himself likewise took part of the same, that He might
    through death destroy Him that had the power of death, that 1 Corinthians
    10:6, and were brought to the promised land flowing with milk and honey. And
    thus God&#x27;s love and care of the true Israel, who are Christ&#x27;s and
    heirs according to the promise, Galatians 3:29, were strikingly exhibited.
    The whole plan of salvation is embodied in the history of the descendants of
    Abraham. Every doctrine of the Gospel is exhibited in God&#x27;s dealings
    with them. God&#x27;s chosen Israel sprang from an idolater; they were a
    perverse and crooked generation. They were separated from all other nations
    by the blood of their covenant;
  </p>
  <p>
    God&#x27;s Spirit remained among them. He chastened them as a man chasteneth
    his son; and, at length, wrath came upon them to the uttermost, and God cast
    them off. But they have not stumbled that they should fall; they shall be
    restored to the favor of God, and serve Him in the land He gave to their
    fathers. Such is the parable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interpretation of it is God&#x27;s unchanging love to the true Israel,
    whom He hath loved with an everlasting love, and with lovingkindness hath
    drawn unto Himself; whom He guides by His counsel, and will afterwards
    receive to glory.
  </p>
  <p>
    The wisdom of God is apparent in representing spiritual and eternal things
    in types and figures, thus bringing the truth down to our capacity. By the
    folly of mankind this has been the grand means of corrupting the Gospel and
    carnalizing the doctrine of Christ. The spiritual ordinances of the New
    Testament have been changed into a system of external observances, which
    give an utterly fallacious view of the character of the religion of Christ.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 17</h2>
  <p>
    Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren,
    that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to
    God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having taken hold of the seed of Abraham, it behoved Him to be in all things
    made like unto his brethren, in order that He might be a merciful and
    faithful high priest. Brethren are of the same family, their hearts are
    fashioned alike, Psalm 33:15; and in order to Christ being a merciful and
    faithful high priest, He must in all things be made like unto His brethren,
    and thus it was with our Lord Jesus Christ. He not only, as the Apostle had
    already stated, took part with them in flesh and blood, Hebrews 2:14, but
    was touched with a feeling of our infirmities, and was in all things tempted
    like as we are, yet without sin. Chap4:15. The prince of this world came to
    Him in all his malignity and in all his power. He attempted to prevail over
    Him through hunger, to which He was subject in common with His brethren; he
    held out to Him the prospect of admiration; he proposed to Him the
    sovereignty of the world, but by the Word of God&#x27;s lips He kept Himself
    from the paths of the destroyer. Psalm 17:4. He not only baffled the
    adversary, but, in doing Leviticus 6:30; Leviticus 16:20; Leviticus 8:15. 2
    Chronicles 29:24. Ezekiel 45:15. Daniel 9:24. Romans 5:10. 2 Corinthians
    5:19. Now, Christ, by the sacrifice of Himself, made reconciliation, or
    atonement, for the sins of His people; they are all covered by His blood,
    and, when sought for, shall not be found.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 18</h2>
  <p>
    For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour
    them that are tempted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chap. Now though Christ had no sin, yet, as we have seen, He was in all
    things tempted as we are. He was truly Psalm 88:13-18 : &quot; But unto thee
    have I cried, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee. Lord,
    why casteth thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me? I am
    afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am
    distracted. Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
    They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
    Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into
    darkness.&quot; At length He exclaimed, &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou
    forsaken me!&quot; proving that He was tasting all the bitterness of death,
    that He felt the sword of justice entering His soul; but still His
    confidence in His Father&#x27;s love was unshaken; with His dying breath He
    exclaimed, &quot;Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit;&quot; and, at
    its departure, Satan fell as lightning from heaven. His power was broken,
    whilst the resurrection and exaltation of Immanuel to the throne of the
    universe, as the supreme Judge of men and angels, showed the magnitude of
    the work which He had accomplished, and the perfection of that sacrifice
    which had finished transgression, made an end of sin, made reconciliation
    for iniquity, and brought in everlasting righteousness. Truly His glory is
    great in having accomplished this salvation. Honor and majesty are laid upon
    Him; and, because He humbled Himself, took on Him the form of a servant, and
    became obedient unto death, God hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a
    name that is above every name; &quot;that at the name of Jesus every knee
    should how, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the
    earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to
    the glory of God the Father.&quot; Philippians 2:10-11.
