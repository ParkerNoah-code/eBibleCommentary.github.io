  </p>
  <h2>Verse 1</h2>
  <p>
    For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things
    pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apostle had said that under the Gospel believers have a great High
    Priest who is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, chap; and,
    referring to the institution of the Jewish law, he says, &quot;Every high
    priest taken from among men.&quot; That reference is here made to the Jewish
    law, appears by the Apostle speaking of a high priest. This was peculiar to
    Israel. Previously to the giving of the law, the head of each family seems
    to have acted as its priest. Thus we read of Noah, Abraham, Exodus 18:2,
    offering sacrifices; but it does not appear to have been confined to them,
    for Cain and Abel both offered; and we read, &quot;And he sent young men of
    the children of Israel, which offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-
    offerings of oxen unto the Lord,&quot; Exodus 24:5, Here the young men were
    the offerers; but, after the giving of the law, Aaron and his family were
    exclusively appointed to the priesthood. They alone were permitted to enter
    the tabernacle, or house of God, and to burn incense, and sprinkle the blood
    of the sacrifices. The tabernacle was divided by a vail into two
    compartments—the holy, and holiest of all. Into the former the priests had
    daily access. The chief or high priest alone was admitted within the vail,
    and that only upon one day of the year, when he made an atonement for all
    Israel, and sprinkled with blood the mercy-seat which covered the ark, and
    which was the throne of the God of Israel, intimating that mercy could only
    flow to sinners through an atoning sacrifice.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first time the priesthood is mentioned in Scripture is in the case of
    Melchisedec, who, as the Apostle afterwards teaches us, was a remarkable
    type of Christ, who is said to be a priest for ever after the order of
    Melchisedec, for the priesthood of Aaron was but temporary. Even among the
    heathen the office of priest was known. Thus we read of the Egyptian
    priests, Genesis 47:22; and of the priest of Midian, Exodus 2:16.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Lord took Israel to be his peculiar people, and he chose Aaron and his
    sons to be His priests. The great object of the institution was that they
    might offer gifts and sacrifices, and for this purpose they were selected
    and set apart. The office of the priesthood was also an intimation that
    fallen man could have no immediate access to God, but that he required a
    daysman, an intercessor. He was to offer gifts and sacrifices; this is
    repeated, chap. Gifts, as distinguished from sacrifices for sin, were
    expressions of gratitude to God for His goodness in general, or for any
    manifestation of it on a particular occasion.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 2</h2>
  <p>
    Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the
    way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being himself a Psalm 51:16. This is one of the many proofs of the
    inferiority of the Jewish to the Christian dispensation—of the shadow to the
    substance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The man who sinned presumptuously was to be taken from God&#x27;s altar and
    put to death; of this we have an example in the case of Joab; but the blood
    of Jesus cleanseth the believer from all sin. However aggravated our guilt,
    pardon is proclaimed to us through faith in Jesus.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 3</h2>
  <p>
    And by reason hereof &quot;he ought, as for the people, so also for himself,
    to offer for sins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the high priest was himself compassed with infirmities, it was
    necessary that he should offer sacrifices not only for the people but for
    himself.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 4</h2>
  <p>
    And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as
    was Aaron.
  </p>
  <p>
    The office of the priest, more especially of the high priest, was peculiarly
    honorable; he stood between God and the people. He was, as it were, brought
    nigh to God. This was indeed the case with the whole tribe of Levi, who are
    described as brought near to God. Numbers 16:9. They alone had access to the
    Tabernacle, the royal pavilion.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were, so to speak, the household servants of the King of Israel, but
    the High Priest was the head servant, so far as the worship of God was
    concerned; he was the chief, the ruler of all God&#x27;s house, and no man
    took the honor to himself. What should we say of a man who entered the
    palace of an earthly king, and assumed authority to give directions to the
    servants? Such conduct would not be tolerated, and how much less that any
    one should assume the office of High Priest in Israel, without a special
    call similar to that given to Aaron? Exodus 28:1. His appointment to the
    office was conducted in a very solemn manner. He was distinguished by a
    peculiar dress emblematic of his office, and minute directions were given
    him as to the mode of executing his office. In causing his rod to bud, to
    bring forth blossoms, and bear almonds, God confirmed his appointment; and
    again, by consuming Korah and his company, who dared to burn incense, and
    whose censers were made broad plates for a covering of the altar. Numbers
    16:39 , 40. This was a standing memorial that no stranger, who was not of
    the seed of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the Lord.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 5</h2>
  <p>
    So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that
    said unto him, Thou art my Acts 2:34-35; and also in a previous part of this
    Epistle, Hebrews 1:13, under Melchisedec.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 7</h2>
  <p>
    Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
    supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save
    him from death, and was heard in that he feared.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the days of his fleshy during his abode in this world, John 1:14 :, he
    offered up most earnest supplications and prayers to him with whom are the
    issues from death, Psalm 68:20, with strong crying and tears, as we find in
    the Garden of Gethsemane, and was heard in that he feared; hearing prayer
    implies receiving a favorable answer. 1 John 5:16; 1 John 5:18.
  </p>
  <p>
    No man took the life of Jesus from him, he laid it down of himself. To the
    last he asserted his power to rid himself of his enemies. His death was an
    act of obedience to his Father, as indeed was every action of his life and
    every word that he spoke. John 12:49. My doctrine, says John 8:16 it is
    said, To Him that was able to save him from death. If we understand this to
    mean to prevent him from dying, the Lord&#x27;s prayer was not heard, for he
    actually tasted death. When he said, &quot;Now is my soul troubled; and what
    shall I say? Father, save me from this hour,&quot; he adds, &quot;but for
    this cause came I unto this hour.&quot; John 12:27. He knew that he came
    forth from God and was going to God, and that the Son of Man was to be
    glorified and that his death was essential to this consummation, for he
    says: &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into
    the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much
    fruit.&quot; John 12:24. When, therefore, we read of his supplications and
    tears to be delivered from death, we cannot understand him as meaning that
    he might not die, for the Father heareth him always, and had not his death
    been perfectly voluntary he would not have died; but his being saved from
    death refers to his resurrection, being brought from the fearful pit and
    miry clay. Psalm 40:2. He knew that his soul was not to be left in Hades,
    nor was the Holy One of God to see corruption. In the regions of death, the
    path of life was to be shown him, and at his Father&#x27;s right hand he was
    to enjoy pleasures for evermore.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have an account of his agony in the garden, and the supplications and
    prayers which he offered up, but these are to be found more fully in the
    Book of 1 Corinthians 12:4-6.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the subsistence of the Eternal Jehovah in three persons, who are one,
    is an unfathomable mystery, it is essential to the right understanding of
    the plan of salvation, which indeed is founded upon it. The Father chooses
    his people and gives them to the Matthew 22:43-44, the Lord Jesus applies
    the110th Psalm to Himself. In it He is described as a priest for ever after
    the order of Melchisedec. This appellation was given Him by God. It may be
    observed that in the Psalm it is said, &quot;Thou art a priest for
    ever.&quot; The Apostle gives Him the title of High Priest because, although
    all the Levitical priests were types of Christ, yet the high priest was the
    most eminent. And as there is but one priest in the kingdom of God, the Lord
    Jesus is here and in many other parts of this epistle described as a High
    Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. The Apostle afterwards
    points out the superiority of the priesthood of Melchisedec to that of
    Aaron, Here he merely quotes from 2 Thessalonians 2:15. But the false
    principle that, while in regard to the great doctrines of the Gospel we are
    bound to abide by the rule of Scripture, we are at liberty, in what are
    termed external things, to be guided by circumstances, has induced the
    generality even of Protestants to go back to the weak and beggarly elements
    of Judaism. This system will continue till the great overturning predicted
    by the Word of God, Ezekiel 21:27, shall take place. The Lord will then
    &quot;turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the
    name of the Lord, to serve Him with one consent.&quot; Zephaniah 3:9.
  </p>
  <p>
    The object of this Epistle is to preserve believers to the end of the world
    from this snare of the devil, as well as to check the apostasy which it
    appears had taken place among many of the Jews who had professed the faith
    to which the Apostle repeatedly alludes. To the misunderstanding of this
    subject the Apostle attributes the little progress which the Hebrews had
    made, and that they had become as those that had need of milk, and not of
    strong meat.
