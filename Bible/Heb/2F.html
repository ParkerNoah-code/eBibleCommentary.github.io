    </h2>

    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em
        >So also Christ didn’t glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it

    <h2>F. Our High Priest and Salvation (5:1-10)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 1.
      <em
        >For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men
        in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
        for sins.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Christ’s participation of our nature, as necessary unto him for the
      bearing and discharge of the office of a high priest on our behalf, is a
      great ground of consolation unto believers, a manifest evidence that he is
      and will be tender and compassionate towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It was the entrance of sin that made the office of the priesthood
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>3. It was of infinite grace that such an appointment was made.</p>
    <p>
      4. The priest is described by the especial discharge of his duty or
      exercise of his office, which is his “offering both gifts and sacrifice
      for sins.” 5. Where there is no proper propitiatory sacrifice, there is no
      proper priest.
    </p>
    <p>6. Jesus Christ alone is the high priest of his people.</p>
    <p>
      7. It was a great privilege which the church enjoyed of old, in the
      representation which it had, by God’s appointment, of the priesthood and
      sacrifice of Christ in their own typical priests and sacrifices.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Much more glorious is our privilege under the gospel, since our Lord
      Jesus hath taken upon him, and actually discharged, this part of his
      office, in offering an absolutely perfect and complete sacrifice for sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. What is to be done with God on the account of sin, that it may be
      expiated and pardoned, and that the people of God who have sinned may be
      accepted with him and blessed, is all actually done for them by Jesus
      Christ, their high priest, in the sacrifice for sin which he offered on
      their behalf.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em
        >The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going
        astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Compassion and forbearance with meekness in those from whom we expect
      help and relief, is the great motive and encouragement unto faith,
      affiance, and expectation of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. We live, the life of our souls is principally maintained, upon this
      compassionateness of our High Priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Though every sin hath in it the whole nature of sin, rendering sinners
      obnoxious unto the curse of the law, yet as there are several kinds of
      sins so there are several degrees of sin, some being accompanied with a
      greater guilt than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Our ignorance is both our calamity, our sin, and an occasion of many
      sins unto us.
    </p>
    <p>5. Sin is a wandering from the way.</p>
    <p>
      6. No sort of sinners is excluded from an interest in the care and love of
      our compassionate High Priest, but only those who exclude themselves by
      their unbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It is well for us, and enough for us, that the Lord Christ was
      encompassed with the sinless infirmities of our nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. God can teach a sanctified use of sinful infirmities, as he did in it
      and unto the priests under the law.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as
        well as for himself.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The absolute holiness and spotless innocence of the Lord Christ in his
      offering of himself had a signal influence into the efficacy of his
      sacrifice, and is a great encouragement unto our faith and consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Whosoever dealeth with God or man about the sins of others should look
      well, in the first place, unto his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. No dignity of person or place, no duty, no merit, can deliver sinners
      from standing in need of a sacrifice for sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It was a part of the darkness and bondage of the church under the old
      testament, that their high priests had need to offer sacrifices for
      themselves and for their own sins.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em
        >Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like
        Aaron was.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is an act of sovereignty in God to call whom he pleaseth unto his
      work and especial service, and eminently so when it is unto any place of
      honor and dignity in his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The highest excellency and utmost necessity of any work to be done for
      God in this world, will not warrant our undertaking of it or engaging in
      it, unless we are called thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The more excellent any work of God is, the more express ought our call
      unto it to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is a great dignity and honor to be duly called unto any work,
      service, or office, in the house of God.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em
        >So also Christ didn’t glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it
        was he who said to him, “You are my Son. Today I have become your
        father.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The office of the high priesthood over the church of God was an honor
      and glory to Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Relation and love are the fountain and cause of God’s committing all
      authority in and over the church to Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6.
      <em
        >As he says also in another place, “You are a priest forever, after the
        order of Melchizedek.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      That in all things wherein God hath to do with mankind, Jesus Christ
      should have an absolute pre-eminence.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions
        with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death,
        and having been heard for his godly fear,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The Lord Jesus Christ himself had a time of infirmity in this world.
    </p>
    <p>2. A life of glory may ensue after a life of infirmity.</p>
    <p>
      3. The Lord Christ is no more now in a state of weakness and temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The Lord Christ filled up every season with duty, with the proper duty
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Lord Christ, in his offering up himself for us, labored and
      travailed in soul to bring the work unto a good and holy issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The Lord Christ, in the time of his offering and suffering, considering
      God, with whom he had to do, as the sovereign Lord of life and death, as
      the supreme Rector and Judge of all, cast himself before him, with most
      fervent prayers for deliverance from the sentence of death and the curse
      of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. In all the pressures that were on the Lord Jesus Christ, in all the
      distresses he had to conflict withal in his sufferings, his faith for
      deliverance and success was firm and unconquerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The success of our Lord Jesus Christ in his trials, as our head and
      surety, is a pledge and assurance of success unto us in all our spiritual
      conflicts.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 8.
      <em>
        though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he
        suffered.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Infinite love prevailed with the Son of God to lay aside the privilege
      of his infinite dignity, that he might suffer for us and our redemption.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In his sufferings, and notwithstanding them all, the Lord Christ was
      the Son still, the Son of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. A practical experience of obedience to God in some cases will cost us
      dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Sufferings undergone according to the will of God are highly
      instructive.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. In all these things, both as to suffering and learning, or profiting
      thereby, we have a great example in our Lord Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The love of God towards any, the relation of any unto God, hinders not
      but that they may undergo great sufferings and trials.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 9.
      <em
        >Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the
        author of eternal salvation,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. All that befell the Lord Christ, all that he did or suffered, was
      necessary to this end, that he might be the cause of eternal salvation to
      believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The Lord Christ was consecrated himself in and by the sacrifice that he
      offered for us, and what he suffered in so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Lord Christ alone is the only principal cause of our eternal
      salvation, and that in every kind.
    </p>
    <p>4. Salvation is confined to believers.</p>
    <h2>
      Ver 10.
      <em>named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. God was pleased to put a signal honor upon the person and office of
      Melchisedec, that in them there should be an early and excellent
      representation made of the person and priesthood of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. As the Lord Christ received all his honor, as mediator, from God the
      Father, so the ground and measure of our glory and honor unto him as such
      depend on the revelation and declaration of it unto us.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is an evidence and testimony that the Lord Christ was able to be,
      and is, the author of eternal salvation unto all that do obey him, because
      he is a priest after the order of Melchisedec; that is, that his
      priesthood is eternal.
