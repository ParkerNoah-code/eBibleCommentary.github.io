    <h2>
      Ver 1.
      <em
        >For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men
        in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
        for sins.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em
        >The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going
        astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as
        well as for himself.</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em
        >Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like
        Aaron was.</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em
        >So also Christ didn’t glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it
        was he who said to him, “You are my Son. Today I have become your
        father.”</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6.

    <h2>
      Ver 7-8.
      <em
        >He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions
        with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death,
        and having been heard for his godly fear, though he was a Son, yet
        learned obedience by the things which he suffered.</em

        author of eternal salvation, named by God a high priest after the order
        of Melchizedek.</em
