    <h2>D. Hospitality and Holy Living (13:1-7)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 1.
      <em>Let brotherly love continue.</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The power and glory of Christian religion is exceedingly decayed and
      debased in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Where the pretense of mutual love is continued in any measure, yet its
      nature is unknown, and its effects are generally neglected. 3. We are
      especially to watch unto the preservation of those graces, and the
      performance of those duties, which in our circumstances are most exposed
      to opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Brotherly love is very apt to be impaired and decay if we do not
      endeavor continually to preserve and revive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is a part of the wisdom of faith to consider aright the ways and
      occasions of the decay of mutual love, with the means of its preservation.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em>
        Don’t forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so, some
        have entertained angels without knowing it.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Especial seasons are directions and constraining motives unto especial
      duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Our hearts are not to be trusted unto in occasional duties if we
      preserve them not in a continual disposition towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The mind ought continually to be on its watch, and in a gracious
      disposition towards such duties as are attended with difficulties and
      charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Examples of privileges annexed to duties, whereof the Scripture is
      full, are great motives and incentives to the same or the like duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Faith will make use of the highest privileges that ever were enjoyed on
      the performance of duties, to encourage unto obedience, though it expects
      not any thing of the same kind on the performance of the same duties
    </p>
    <p>
      6. When men designing that which is good do more good than they intended,
      they shall or may reap more benefit thereby than they expected.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them, and those who are
        ill-treated, since you are also in the body.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. If we be called unto suffering for the profession of the gospel, let us
      not think strange of it; it is no new thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Bonds and imprisonment for the truth were consecrated to God and made
      honorable by the bonds and imprisonment of Christ himself, and commended
      unto the church in all ages by the bonds and imprisonment of the apostles
      and primitive witnesses of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is better, more safe and honorable, to be in bonds with and for
      Christ, than to be at liberty with a brutish, raging, persecuting world.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. God is pleased to give grace and courage unto some to suffer for the
      gospel unto bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. When some are tried as unto their constancy in bonds, others are tried
      as unto their sincerity in the duties required of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Usually more fail in neglect of their duty towards sufferers, and so
      fall from their profession, than do so fail under and on the account of
      their sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Although there are peculiar duties required of us towards those who
      suffer for the gospel in an eminent manner, as unto bonds, yet are we not
      thereon discharged from the same kind of duties towards those who suffer
      in lesser degrees and in other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Not only those who are in bonds for the gospel, or suffer to a high
      degree in their persons, are under the especial care of Christ, but those
      also who suffer in any other kind whatever, though the world may take
      little notice of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Professors of the gospel are exempted from no sorts of adversity, from
      nothing that is evil and grievous unto the outward man in this world, and
      therefore ought we not to think it strange when we fall into them.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. We have no security of freedom from any sort of suffering for the
      gospel whilst we are in this body, or during the continuance of our
      natural lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. We are not only exposed unto afflictions during this life, but we
      ought to live in the continual expectation of them, so long as there are
      any in the world who do actually suffer for the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The knowledge that we ourselves are continually obnoxious unto
      sufferings, no less than they who actually suffer, ought to incline our
      minds unto a diligent consideration of them in their sufferings, so as to
      discharge all duties of love and helpfulness towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Unless it do so we can have no evidence of our present interest in the
      same mystical body with them, nor just expectation of any compassion or
      relief from others when we ourselves are called unto sufferings.

      Ver 4.
      <em
        >Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled;
        but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Divine institution is sufficient to render any state or condition of
      life honorable.
    </p>
    <p>2. The more useful any state of life is, the more honorable it is.</p>
    <p>
      3. That which is honorable by divine institution, and useful in its own
      nature, may be abused and rendered vile by the miscarriages of men, as
      marriage may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is a bold usurpation of authority over the consciences of men, and a
      contempt of the authority of God, to forbid that state unto any which God
      hath declared honorable among all.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Means for purity and chastity not ordained, blessed, or sanctified unto
      that end, will prove furtherances of impurity and uncleanness, or worse
      evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The state of marriage being honorable in the sight of God himself, it
      is the duty of them that enter thereinto duly to consider how they may
      approve their consciences unto God in what they do.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. In the state of marriage there is required of men a due consideration
      of their call unto it and of their ends in it, that they are those of
      God’s appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Conjugal duties, regulated by the bounds assigned unto them by natural
      light, with the general rules of Scripture, and subservient unto the due
      ends of marriage, are honorable, giving no cause of pollution or shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Whatever light thoughts men may have of sin, of any sin, the judgment
      of God concerning all sin, which is according to truth, must stand for
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Fornication and adultery are sins in their own nature deserving
      eternal damnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Men living and dying impenitently in these sins shall eternally
      perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The especial aggravation of these sins doth in a peculiar manner
      expose men unto a sore condemnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. All occasions of, all temptations leading unto, these sins are to be
      avoided as we take care of our souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Although the state of men may be changed, and divine wrath due to
      those sins be finally escaped by repentance, yet it may be observed, that
      of all sorts of sinners those who are habitually given up unto those lusts
      of the flesh are of all others the most rarely called and brought to
      effectual repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Many of those persons, by reason of their convictions, received in the
      light of a natural conscience, do live in a kind of seeming repentance,
      whereby they relieve themselves after some acts of uncleanness, until, by
      the power of their lust, they are hurried again into them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5-6.
      <em
        >Be free from the love of money, content with such things as you have,
        for he has said, “I will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way
        forsake you.” So that with good courage we say, “The Lord is my helper.
        I will not fear. What can man do to me?”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. All covetousness is inconsistent with a Christian conversation
      according to the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Covetousness in any degree is highly dangerous in a time of persecution
      or suffering for the gospel
    </p>
    <p>
      3. All the efficacy, power, and comfort of divine promises, arise from and
      are resolved into the excellencies of the divine nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The vehemency of the expression, by the multiplication of the negative
      particles, is an effect of divine condescension, to give the utmost
      security to the faith of believers in all their trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Divine presence and divine assistance, which are inseparable, are the
      spring and cause of suitable and sufficient relief and supplies to
      believers in every condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Especially the due consideration of them is abundantly sufficient to
      rebuke all covetous inclinations and desires, which without it will be
      prevalent in us in a time of straits and trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The cheerful profession of confidence in God, against all opposition
      and in the midst of all distresses, is that which believers have a warrant
      for in the promises that are made to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. As the use of this confidence is our duty, so it is a duty highly
      honorable to the profession of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Believers may use the same confidence that David used, seeing they have
      the same grounds of it that David had.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. All believers, in their sufferings and under their persecutions, have
      a refreshing, supporting interest in divine aid and assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. It is their duty to express with confidence and boldness, at all
      times, their assurance of the divine assistance declared in the promises,
      to their own encouragement, the edification of the church, and the terror
      of their adversaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Faith duly fixed on the power of God, as engaged for the assistance of
      believers in their sufferings, will give them a contempt of all that men
      can do to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The most effectual means to encourage our souls in all our sufferings,
      is to compare the power of God who will assist us, and that of man who
      doth oppress us.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. That which in our sufferings delivereth us from the fear of men takes
      out all that is evil in them, and secures our success.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >Remember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of God, and
        considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. This is our best, this is our only way of remembering them who have
      been our guides, leaders, and rulers in the church, whether they have been
      apostles, or evangelists, or ordinary pastors, — namely, to follow them in
      their faith and conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. This ought to be the care of the guides of the church, namely, to leave
      such an example of faith and holiness as that it may be the duty of the
      church to remember them and follow their example.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The word of God is the sole object of the faith of the church, the only
      outward means of communicating the mind and grace of God unto it.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. A due consideration of the faith of those who have been before us,
      especially of such who were constant in sufferings, and above all, of
      those who were constant to death, as the holy martyrs in former and latter
      ages, is an effectual means to stir us up to the same exercise of faith
      when we are called to it.
