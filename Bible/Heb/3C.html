    <h2>C. A Greater High Priest (7:20-28)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 20-22.
      <em
        >Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath (for
        they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath
        by him that says of him, “The Lord swore and will not change his mind,
        ‘You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.’ ” By
        so much, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The faith, comfort, honor, and safety, of the church, depend much on
      every particular mark that God hath put upon any of the offices of Christ,
      or whatever belongs thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Nothing was wanting on the part of God, that might give eminency,
      stability, glory, and efficacy, to the priesthood of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Although the decrees and purposes of God were always firm and
      immutable, yet there was no fixed state of outward dispensations, none
      confirmed with an oath, until Christ came.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Although God granted great privileges unto the church under the old
      testament, yet still in ever instance he withheld that which was the
      principal, and should have given perfection to what he did grant. He made
      them priests, but without an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. God by his oath declares the determination of his sovereign pleasure
      unto the subject of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Christ’s being made a priest by the oath of God for ever, is a solid
      foundation of peace and consolation to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. All the transactions between the Father and the Son, concerning his
      offices, undertakings, and the work of our redemption, have respect unto
      the faith of the church, and are declared for our consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. How good and glorious soever any thing may appear to be, or really be,
      in the worship of God, or as a way of our coming to him, or walking before
      him, if it be not ratified in and by the immediate suretiship of Christ,
      it must give way unto that which is better; it could be neither durable in
      itself, nor make any thing perfect in them that made use of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. All the privileges, benefits, and advantages, of the offices and
      mediation of Christ, will not avail us, unless we reduce them all unto
      faith in his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The whole undertaking of Christ, and the whole efficacy of the
      discharge of his office, depend on the appointment of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The stability of the new covenant depends on the suretiship of Christ,
      and is secured to believers nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The Lord Christ’s undertaking to be our surety gives the highest
      obligation to all duties of obedience according to the covenant.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 23-25.
      <em
        >Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from
        continuing by death. But he, because he lives forever, has his
        priesthood unchangeable. Therefore he is also able to save to the
        uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives
        forever to make intercession for them.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. God will not fail to provide instruments for his work that he hath to
      accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. There is such a necessity of the continual administration of the
      sacerdotal office in behalf of the church, that the interruption of it by
      the death of the priests was an argument of the weakness of that
      priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The perpetuity of the priesthood of Christ depends on his own perpetual
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The perpetuity of the priesthood of Christ, as unchangeably exercised
      in his own person, is a principal part of the glory of that office.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The addition of sacrificing priests as vicars of, or substitutes unto
      Christ, in the discharge of his office, destroys his priesthood as to the
      principal eminency of it above that of the Levitical priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Consideration of the person and offices of Christ ought to be improved
      unto the strengthening of the faith and increase of the consolation of the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The consideration of the office-power of Christ is of great use unto
      the faith of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It is good to secure this first ground of evangelical faith, that the
      Lord Christ, as vested with his offices, and in the exercise of them, is
      able to save us. 9. Whatever hindrances and difficulties lie in the way of
      salvation of believers, whatever oppositions do rise against it, the Lord
      Christ is able, by virtue of his sacerdotal office, and in the exercise of
      it, to carry the work through them all to eternal perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The salvation of all sincere gospel worshippers is secured by the
      actings of Christ in the discharge of his priestly office.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Attendance unto the service, the worship of God in the gospel, is
      required to interest us in the saving care and power of our high priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Those who endeavor to come unto God in any other way but by Christ, as
      by saints and angels, may do well to consider whether they have any such
      office in heaven as by virtue whereof they are able to save them to the
      uttermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. It is a matter of strong consolation to the church that Christ lives
      in heaven for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. So great and glorious is the work of saving believers unto the utmost,
      that it is necessary that the Lord Christ should lead a mediatory life in
      heaven to make intercession for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. The most glorious prospect that we can take into the things that are
      within the veil, into the remaining transactions of the work of our
      salvation in the most holy place, is in the representation that is made
      unto us of the intercession of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. The intercession of Christ is the great evidence of the continuance of
      his love and care, his pity and compassion towards his church.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 26.
      <em
        >For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled,
        separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. God, in his infinite wisdom, love and grace, gave us such a high priest
      as, in the qualifications of his person, the glory of his condition, and
      the discharge of his office, was every way suited to deliver us from the
      state of apostasy, sin, and misery, and to bring us unto himself through a
      perfect salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Although these properties of our high priest are principally to be
      considered, as rendering him meet to be our high priest, yet are they also
      to be considered as an examplar and idea of that holiness and innocency
      which we ought to be comfortable to.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Seeing all these properties were required unto Christ and in him, that
      he might be our high priest, he was all that he is here said to be for us
      and for our sakes, and benefit from them doth redound unto us.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The infinite grace and wisdom of God are always to be admired by us in
      providing such a great high priest as was every way meet for us, with
      respect unto the great end of his office as was every way meet for us,
      with respect unto the great end of his office, namely, the bringing of us
      unto himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The dignity, duty, and safety of the gospel church, depend solely on
      the nature, the qualifications, and the exaltation, of our high priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. If such a high priest became us, was needful to us, for the
      establishment of the new covenant and the communication of the grace
      thereof to the church, then all persons, Christ alone excepted, are
      absolutely excluded from all interest in this priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. If we consider aright what it is that we stand in need of, and what God
      hath provided for us that we may be brought unto him in his glory, we
      shall find it our wisdom to forego all other expectations, and to betake
      ourselves unto Christ alone.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 27-28.
      <em
        >who doesn’t need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices
        daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For
        he did this once for all, when he offered up himself. For the law
        appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the
        oath, which came after the law, appoints a Son forever who has been
        perfected.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. No sinful man was meet to offer the great expiatory sacrifice for the
      church; much less is any sinful man fit to offer Christ himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The excellency of Christ’s person and priesthood freed him in his
      offering from many things that the Levitical priesthood was obliged unto.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. No sacrifice could bring us to God, and save the church to the utmost,
      but that wherein the Son of God himself was both priest and offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It was burdensome and heavy work to attain relief against sin, and
      settled peace of conscience, under the old priesthood, attended with so
      many weaknesses and infirmities.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. There never was, nor ever can be, any more than two sorts of priests in
      the church, the one made by the law, the other by the oath of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. As the bringing in of the priesthood of Christ after the law, and the
      priesthood constituted thereby, did abrogate and disannul it; so the
      bringing in of another priesthood after his will abrogate and disannul
      that also.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Plurality of priests under the gospel overthrows the whole argument of
      the apostle in this place, and if we have yet priests that have
      infirmities, they are made by the law, and not by the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The sum of the difference between the law and the gospel is issued in
      the difference between the priests of the one and the other state, which
      is inconceivably great.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The great foundation of our faith, and the hinge whereon all our
      consolation depends, is this, that our high priest is the Son of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The everlasting continuance of the Lord Christ in his office is
      secured by the oath of God.
