    <h2>C. A Greater High Priest (7:20-28)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 20.
      <em>Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath</em>
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 21.
      <em
        >(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with
        an oath by him that says of him, “The Lord swore and will not change his
        mind, ‘You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.’
        ”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 22.
      <em>By so much, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</em>
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 23.
      <em
        >Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from
        continuing by death.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 24.
      <em
        >But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 25.
      <em
        >Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near
        to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession
        for them.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 26.
      <em
        >For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled,
        separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 27.
      <em
        >who doesn’t need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices
        daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For
        he did this once for all, when he offered up himself.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 28.
      <em
        >For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the
        word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints a Son forever who
        has been perfected.</em
