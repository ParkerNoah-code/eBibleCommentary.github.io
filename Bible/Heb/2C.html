    <h2>C. Enter into His Rest (4:1-11)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 1.
      <em
        >Let’s fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have
        come short of a promise of entering into his rest.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em
        >For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did,
        but the word they heard didn’t profit them, because it wasn’t mixed with
        faith by those who heard.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said,
        “As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest;” although the
        works were finished from the foundation of the world.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em
        >For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, “God rested on
        the seventh day from all his works;”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em>and in this place again, “They will not enter into my rest.”</em>
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6.
      <em
        >Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter into it, and they to
        whom the good news was preached before failed to enter in because of
        disobedience,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >he again defines a certain day, “today”, saying through David so long a
        time afterward (just as has been said), “Today if you will hear his
        voice, don’t harden your hearts.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 8.
      <em
        >For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward
        of another day.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 9.
      <em>There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</em>
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 10.
      <em
        >For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his
        works, as God did from his.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 11.
      <em
        >Let’s therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone
        fall after the same example of disobedience.</em
