    <h2>C. Enter into His Rest (4:1-11)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 1.
      <em
        >Let’s fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have
        come short of a promise of entering into his rest.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The gospel, in the dispensation thereof, is not only attended with
      promises and rewards, but also with threatenings and punishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Gospel comminations ought to be managed towards all sorts of professors
      promiscuously, be they true believers, temporary, or hypocrites.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Fear is the proper object of gospel comminations, which ought to be
      answerable to our several conditions and grounds of obnoxiousness unto
      those threatenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is a matter of great and tremendous consequence, to have the
      promises of God left and proposed unto us.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The failing of men through unbelief doth no way cause the promises of
      God to fail or cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The gospel state of believers is a state of assured rest and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Many to whom the promise of the gospel is proposed and preached do or
      may, through their own sins, come short of the enjoyment of the things
      promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Not only backsliding through unbelief, but all appearance of
      tergiversation in profession, and occasions of them in times of difficulty
      and trials, ought to be carefully avoided by professors.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. They who mix not the promises of the gospel with faith shall utterly
      come of entering into the rest of God.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em
        >For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did,
        but the word they heard didn’t profit them, because it wasn’t mixed with
        faith by those who heard.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. It is a signal privilege to have the gospel preached unto us.</p>
    <p>
      2. Barely to be evangelized, to have the gospel preached unto any, is a
      privilege of a dubious issue and event.
    </p>
    <p>3. The gospel is no new doctrine, no new law.</p>
    <p>
      4. God hath graciously ordered the word of the gospel to be preached unto
      men, wheron depends their welfare or their ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The sole cause of the promise being ineffectual unto salvation, in and
      towards them to whom it is preached, is in themselves and their own
      unbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. There is a failing, temporary faith with respect unto the promises of
      God, which will not advantage them in whom it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The great mystery of useful and profitable believing consists in the
      mixing and incorporating of truth and faith in the souls and minds of
      believers.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said,
        “As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest;” although the
        works were finished from the foundation of the world.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The state of believers under the gospel is a state of blessed rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is faith alone which is the only way and means of entering into this
      blessed state of rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There is a mutual inbeing of the promises and threatenings of the
      covenant, so that in our faith and consideration of them they ought not
      utterly to be separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. God hath shown us in his own example that work and labor is to precede
      our rest.
    </p>
    <p>5. All the works of God are perfect.</p>
    <p>
      6. All the works of God in the creation were wrought and ordered in a
      subserviency unto his worship and glory whereby.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em
        >For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, “God rested on
        the seventh day from all his works;”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Whatever the Scripture saith in any place, being rightly understood and
      applied, is a firm foundation for faith to rest upon, and for arguments or
      proofs in matters of God’s worship to be deduced from.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is to no purpose to press any thing in the worship of God, without
      producing the authority of God for it in his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. What the Scripture puts an especial mark upon is especially by us to be
      regarded and inquired into.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em>and in this place again, “They will not enter into my rest.”</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many important truths are not clearly delivered in any one single
      testimony or proposition in the Scripture, but the mind of God concerning
      them is to be gathered and learned by comparing of several Scriptures, in
      order and respect to one another.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6.
      <em
        >Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter into it, and they to
        whom the good news was preached before failed to enter in because of
        disobedience,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The faithfulness of God in his promises is not to be measured by faith
      or obedience of men at any one season, in any one generation; nor by their
      sins whereby they come short of them, nor by any providential
      dispensations towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The promises of God are such as belong only to the grace of the
      covenant, or such as respect also the outward administration of it in this
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Some, yea, many promises of God, may have a full accomplishment, when
      very few, or it may be none at all, know or take notice that so they are
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Some promises of God, as to their season, although they may have, and
      indeed have, their use and benefit in all seasons; and until this come
      there can be no failure charged, though they be not fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. There are many promises whose signal accomplishment God that not
      limited to any especial season, but keeps it in his own will to act
      according to them towards his church as is best suited to his wisdom and
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Some concerns of the glory of God in the world may suspend the full and
      outward accomplishment of some promises for a season.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. When the accomplishment of promises seemeth to be deferred, we are not
      to faint in our duty.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >he again defines a certain day, “today”, saying through David so long a
        time afterward (just as has been said), “Today if you will hear his
        voice, don’t harden your hearts.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. In reading and hearing the Scripture, we ought to consider God speaking
      in it and by it unto us.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Divine inspiration, or the authority of God speaking in and by the
      penmen of the Scripture, is the ground and foundation of our faith, and is
      that which gives them authority over our consciences and efficacy in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The holy Scripture is an inexhaustible treasury or repository of
      spiritual mysteries and sacred truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Many important truths lie deep and secret in the Scripture, and stand
      in need of a very diligent search and hard digging in their investigation,
      and for their finding out.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. For searching the Scriptures aright there is required a peculiar humble
      and teachable frame of spirit;
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Earnest prayer for the guidance, direction, assistance, and
      illumination, of the Holy Ghost, to enable us to find out, discern, and
      understand the deep things of God;
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Endeavor, in all inquirings into the word, to mind and aim at the same
      ends which God hath in the giving and granting of it unto us.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. They that would search the Scriptures, to find out the sacred truths
      that lie hid in them, ought to take care that they entertain no corrupt
      lusts in their hearts and minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Sedulity and constancy in this duty are a great help to a profitable
      discharge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. In our search after truth, our minds are greatly to be influence and
      guided by the analogy of faith;
    </p>
    <p>
      11. A due consideration of the nature of the discourse wherein any words
      are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The proper grammatical sense of the words themselves is duly to be
      inquired into and pondered.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 8.
      <em
        >For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward
        of another day.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There is not true rest for the souls of men but only in Jesus Christ by
      the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>2. Other things will not give rest to the souls of men.</p>
    <p>3. The gospel church-state is a state of spiritual rest in Christ.</p>
    <p>
      4. It is a great mercy and privilege to have a day of rest and worship
      given unto us.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 9.
      <em>There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Believers under the new testament have lost nothing, no privilege that
      was enjoyed by them under the old.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is the people of God alone who have a right unto all the privileges
      of the gospel, and who in a due manner can perform the duties of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The people of God, as such, have work to do, and labor incumbent on
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. God hath graciously given his people an entrance into rest during their
      state of work and labor, to sweeten it unto them, and to enable them for
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Believers may and do find assured rest in the due attendance unto and
      performance of the duties of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. There is a weekly sacred rest appointed for believers under the gospel.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 10.
      <em
        >For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his
        works, as God did from his.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The whole church, all the duties, worship, and privileges of it, are
      founded in the person, authority, and actions of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The first day of the week, the day of the resurrection of Christ, when
      he rested from his work, is appointed and determined for a day of rest or
      Sabbath unto the church, to be constantly observed in the room of the
      seventh day, appointed and observed from the foundation of the world under
      the old testament.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 11.
      <em
        >Let’s therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone
        fall after the same example of disobedience.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. That great oppositions will and do arise against men in the work of
      entering into God’s rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That as the utmost of our labors and endeavors are required to our
      obtaining an entrance into the rest of Christ, so it doth very well
      deserve that they should be laid out therin.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There is a present excellency in and a present reward attending gospel
      faith and obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Precedent judgments on others are monitory ordinances to us. 5. It is
      better to have an example than to be made an example of divine vengeance
      under the guilt of those sins which others, in a like manner guilty of,
      have not escaped.
