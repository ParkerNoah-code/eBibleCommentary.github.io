      <em>Commentary on Hebrews</em></a
    >.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 1</h2>
  <p>
    Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his
    rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fear of God is often put for the whole of religion. Proverbs 1:7. There
    are two kinds of fear; one is strongly inculcated on believers, and is
    necessarily produced by just views of the glorious majesty of God.
    &quot;Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, let him
    be your dread.&quot; Isaiah 8:13. It is opposed to hardening the heart.
    &quot;Happy is the man that feareth always: but he that hardeneth his heart
    shall fall into mischief.&quot; Proverbs 28:14. The other is condemned and
    represented as a characteristic of the wicked. The slothful servant feared
    his master, because he viewed him as an austere man. Luke 19:21. The fearful
    are classed with the unbelieving. Revelation 21:8. David on one occasion,
    under the influence of fear, abandoned his purpose of bringing up the ark. 1
    Chronicles 13:12.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here the Hebrews are enjoined to take warning from the example of their
    ancestors, and to beware lest, a promise of entering into rest being left on
    record, any of them should seem to come. short of it. Our translators have
    inserted &quot;us&quot; as a supplement, but it seems improper, as will be
    hereafter noticed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apostle had directed the attention of the Hebrews to their forefathers,
    who were excluded from Canaan through unbelief, and now he proceeds to make
    a more particular application of this circumstance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us therefore fear. Fear is used both in a good and a bad sense in the
    Word of God. The Lord promises to put His fear into His people&#x27;s
    hearts, that they may not depart from Him. The fear of God is the beginning
    of wisdom. Believers inhabit a world in rebellion against God, their hearts
    are deceitful above all things and desperately wicked; they are surrounded
    with temptation, and they have no strength to resist their numerous foes.
    The smallest temptation is sufficient to overcome them, and their only
    security is confidence in God. In this confidence there are two essential
    ingredients—a sense of our own weakness, and of the power and goodness of
    God. If destitute of a sense of weakness, we trust in ourselves; and the
    Scripture tells us, &quot;He who trusteth in his own heart is a fool.&quot;
    If we trust in God, except as sinners saved by grace, we trust in a lie. In
    Christ alone God is revealed as just, and the justifier of those who
    believe. Mercy flows in no other channel than through the atonement of
    Christ. By this the law was magnified and made honorable. He appeared as the
    substitute of His people and bore their sins in His own body upon the tree.
    With His dying breath He proclaimed that the work of expiation was finished,
    and the Father Exodus 33:14. This promise was made to the nation of Israel,
    and to the nation it was fulfilled, although that generation fell in the
    wilderness; the promise was not made to any individual, but to Moses in the
    character of mediator and representative of Israel; consequently there was
    no breach of promise in that, the carcases of those who had been numbered,
    fell in the wilderness. But all God&#x27;s dealings with Israel were a
    parable for the time then present, a pattern of heavenly things. Hence we
    might rather have expected it to be said, unto them was the Gospel preached
    as well as unto us. There could be no question of the Gospel being preached
    to us, but although it was also declared to them it was only in types and
    shadows. The Apostle&#x27;s assertion Exodus 33:14.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the promise to which the Apostle refers, . It had been left, not to
    any individual, but to Moses in the character of mediator and intercessor,
    and by him made known to Israel. So it is with the Gospel, all the promises
    of which are yea and amen in Christ. Eternal life is the promise which God
    has given to believers. This is the record that God hath given us eternal
    life, and this life is in his Deuteronomy 1:20-21; but having no confidence
    in the promise of the land which God had made them, in other words the
    promise not being mixed with faith, it did not profit them. A promise may be
    absolute altogether, independent of faith in the person to whom it is made;
    but such is not the promise of which the Apostle treats.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was a promise which could only be fulfilled by Israel judging him
    faithful who had promised, and in this confidence disregarding all the power
    of the inhabitants of the land. Such is also the case with the promise of
    the heavenly country. It can only be fulfilled by our treading in the steps
    of the great Captain of our Salvation. He endured the cross despising the
    shame, and is now set down at the right hand of God, girded with universal
    power, to bestow eternal life on all who will receive it as the gift of God
    through Christ. Nothing therefore can be more appropriate than the
    illustration of the Apostle, of the people of God entering into rest through
    faith.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 3</h2>
  <p>
    For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn
    in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were
    finished from the foundation of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    For we who have believed do enter into rest; this is apparent from the oath
    already adverted to declaring that the unbelievers should not enter into his
    rest. We have already mentioned that chap , which is rendered in our version
    &quot;They shall not enter into my rest,&quot; is in the original an
    elliptical expression, if they shall enter into my rest. Our translators
    would have done well to have retained the same rendering when the expression
    recurs, but they have here rendered it literally, If they shall enter, which
    introduces confusion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apostle, however, was proving that Israel was excluded from God&#x27;s
    rest; but it might be objected that they did enter into God&#x27;s rest, for
    the work in which God was engaged as Creator was finished from the
    foundation of the world.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 4</h2>
  <p>
    For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did
    rest the seventh day from all his works.
  </p>
  <p>
    And God rested the seventh day from all his works. Hence the seventh day
    might be considered as God&#x27;s rest, and as such was strictly enjoined on
    Israel; so that in one sense they did enter into God&#x27;s rest.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 5</h2>
  <p>And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
  <p>Yet God sware that they should not enter into his rest.</p>
  <h2>Verse 6</h2>
  <p>
    Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom
    it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief
  </p>
  <p>
    God gave not his promise in vain; the promise implied that some must enter
    it, and they to whom it was first preached did not enter through unbelief,
    as had been proved. Chap. In verse6 the Apostle only states the premises
    without drawing the conclusion, which is not mentioned till verse9 , &quot;
    there remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God.&quot; The reason of
    not drawing the conclusion was, that the Apostle intended to prove not only
    that the Sabbath was not the rest referred to by the Psalmist, but that the
    land of Canaan was not that rest. Had he drawn the conclusion at the end of
    verse6 it would have been necessary to draw it a second time, and this did
    not suit the rapidity of his ideas. But the reader may draw it for himself,
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 7</h2>
  <p>
    Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, Today, after so long a
    time; as it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
    hearts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, Today, after so long a
    time; as it is said, Today... This abundantly proves that as the observance
    of the Sabbath was not the rest from which unbelievers were excluded by the
    oath, neither was the enjoyment of Canaan. For so long a time, after
    speaking by David, he says, today, after Israel had so long dwelt in Canaan,
    which not only excludes the seventh day, but also the land of Canaan, as the
    rest referred to,
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 8</h2>
  <p>
    For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of
    another day.
  </p>
  <p>
    For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not afterward have spoken of
    another day, long after the rest had been obtained.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 9</h2>
  <p>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</p>
  <p>
    There remaineth... Here is the conclusion drawn from the premises laid down,
    which are that neither the Sabbath, on which God rested from all his works,
    nor the land of Canaan, where Israel ceased from their wanderings, was the
    rest spoken of by the Psalmist, for that was still future after Israel had
    possessed the land for so long a period.
  </p>
  <p>
    We must observe that the Apostle here changes the word he had hitherto used
    and substitutes the word Sabbatism. The reason Revelation 14:13. Into this
    rest Christ hath entered as their forerunner, having finished the work which
    the Father had given him to do; the everlasting doors were thrown open, and
    he entered as the forerunner of his people, to prepare for them those
    mansions in which they shall for ever dwell, where each shall exclaim, with
    joyful lips, &quot;Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt
    bountifully with thee.&quot;
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 11</h2>
  <p>
    Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the
    same example of unbelief
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the practical improvement of what had gone before, believers are
    exhorted to labour to enter into that rest which remaineth for the people of
    God, lest any should fall after the same example of unbelief—viz, of the
    generation of Israel which fell in the wilderness. They could not enter into
    God&#x27;s rest because of unbelief, and thus the Apostle illustrates and
    enforces the exhortation previously given to the John 12:48. It is described
    as living and abiding for ever. 1 Peter 1:23. Thy word, saith the Psalmist,
    hath quickened me, Psalm 119:50; and Christ describes His words to be spirit
    and life. John 6:63. It is powerful, mighty through God to the pulling down
    of strongholds, casting down imaginations, and every high thing that
    exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity
    every thought to the obedience of Christ. 2 Corinthians 10:5. Where the word
    of a king is there is power, this is the word of the King of kings. It is
    sharper than a two-edged sword. It pierces even to the dividing asunder of
    soul and spirit, of the joints and marrow; a sword may be so sharp as to
    sever the joints and marrow, but the Word of God is of such ethereal temper
    as to sever even soul and spirit. Man is represented as composed of soul,
    body, and spirit. 1 Thessalonians 5:23. The body was made of dust, a living
    soul was given to it in common with those animals in whom was the breath of
    life; but besides this man has an immortal spirit, which raises him above
    all the creatures, and by which in his first estate he was capable of
    knowing and holding intercourse with his Maker. Now the Word of God is
    living and powerful, and discerns and discovers the secrets of the heart. It
    is compared to a refiner&#x27;s fire and fuller&#x27;s soap.
