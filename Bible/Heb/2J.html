    <h2>J. Sure and Steadfast Anchor (6:13-20)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 13-16.
      <em
        >For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one
        greater, he swore by himself, saying, “Surely blessing I will bless you,
        and multiplying I will multiply you.” Thus, having patiently endured, he
        obtained the promise. For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in
        every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.</em

    </h2>
    <p>
      1. We have need of every thing that any way evidenceth the stability of
      God’s promises to be represented unto us, for the encouragement and
      confirmation of our faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The grant and communications of spiritual privileges is a mere act or
      effect of sovereign grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Where the promise of God is absolutely engaged, it will break through
      all difficulties to a perfect accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Although there may be privileges attending some promises that may be
      peculiarly appropriated to some certain persons, yet the grace of all
      promises is equal to all believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Whatever difficulty and opposition may lie in the way, patient
      endurance in faith and obedience will infallibly bring us unto the full
      enjoyment of the promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Faith gives such an interest unto believers in all the promises of God,
      as that they obtain even those promises,— that is the benefit and comfort
      of them,— whose actual accomplishment in this world they do not behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. There is, as we are in a state of nature, a strife and difference
      between God and us.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The promises of God are gracious proposals of the only way and means
      for the ending of that strife.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The oath of God, interposed for the confirmation of these promises, is
      every way sufficient to secure believers against all objections and
      temptations, in all straits and trials, about peace with God through Jesus
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. That the custom of using oaths, swearing, cursing, or imprecation, in
      common communication, is not only an open transgression of the third
      commandment, which God hath threatened to revenge, but it is a practical
      renunciation also of all the authority of Jesus Christ, who hath so
      expressly interdicted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Whereas swearing by the name of God in truth, righteousness, and
      judgment, is an ordinance of God for the end of strife among men, perjury
      is justly reckoned amongst the worst and highest of sins, and is that
      which reflects the greatest dishonor on God, and tendeth to the ruin of
      human society.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Readiness in some to swear on slight occasions, and the ordinary
      impositions of oaths on all sorts of persons, without a due consideration
      on either hand of the nature, ends, and properties of lawful swearing, are
      evils greatly to be lamented, and in God’s good time, among Christians
      will be reformed.

    <h2>
      Ver 17-20.
      <em
        >In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs
        of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath,
        that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie,
        we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take
        hold of the hope set before us. This hope we have as an anchor of the
        soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is
        within the veil, where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having
        become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The purpose of God for the saving of the elect by Jesus Christ is an
      act of infinite wisdom, as well as sovereign grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The life and assurance of our present comforts and future glory depends
      on the immutability of God’s counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The purpose of God concerning the salvation of the elect by Jesus
      Christ became immutable from hence, that the determination of his will was
      accompanied with infinite wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Infinite goodness, as acting itself in Christ, was not satisfied in
      providing and preparing good things for believers, but it would also show
      and declare it unto them, for their present consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is not all mankind universally, but a certain number of persons,
      under certain qualifications, to whom God designs to manifest the
      immutability of his counsel, and to communicate the effects thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. God alone knows the due measures of divine condescension, or what
      becomes the divine nature therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. So unspeakable is the weakness of our faith, that we stand in need of
      inconceivable divine condescension for its confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Fallen, sinful man stands in need of the utmost encouragement that
      divine condescension can extend unto, to prevail with him to receive the
      promise of grace and mercy by Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Sense of danger and ruin from sin is the first thing which occasions a
      soul to look out after Christ in the promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. A full conviction of sin is a great and shaking surprisal unto a
      guilty soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The revelation or discovery of the promise, or of Christ in the
      promise, is that alone which directs convinced sinners into their proper
      course and way.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Where there is the least of saving faith, upon the first discovery of
      Christ in the promise, it will stir up the whole soul to make out towards
      him and a participation of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. It is the duty and wisdom of all those unto whom Christ in the promise
      is once discovered, by an gospel means or ordinance once set before them,
      to admit of no delay of a thorough closing with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. There is a spiritual strength and vigor required unto the securing of
      our interest in the promise, κρατῆσαι, “to lay fast and firm hold upon
      it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      15. The promise is an assured refuge unto all sin-distressed souls who
      betake themselves thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Where any souls, convinced of sin by the charge of the law, and of
      their own lost condition theron, do betake themselves unto the promise for
      relief, God is abundantly willing that they should receive strong
      consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. All true believers are exposed to storms and tempests in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. These storms would prove ruinous unto the souls of believers, were
      they not indefeasibly interested by faith and hope in the promise of the
      gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. No distance of place, no interposition of difficulties, can hinder the
      hope of believers from entering into the presence of and fixing itself on
      God in Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. The strength and assurance of the faith and hope of believers is
      invisible unto the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. Hope firmly fixed on God in Christ by the promise will hold steady,
      and preserve the soul in all the storms and trials that may befall it.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. It is our wisdom at all times, but especially in times of trial, to be
      sure that our anchor have a good hold-fast in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. After the most sincere performance of the best of our duties, our
      comforts and securities are centered in Christ alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      24. As the minds of men are greatly to be prepared for the communication
      of spiritual mysteries unto them, so the best preparation is by the cure
      of their sinful and corrupt affections, with the removal of their
      barrenness under what they have before learned and been instructed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      25. This same Jesus is our Savior in every state and condition,— the same
      on the cross, and the same at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
    </p>
    <p>
      26. The Lord Jesus having entered into heaven as our forerunner, gives us
      manifold security of our entrance thither also in the appointed season.
    </p>
    <p>
      27. If the Lord Christ be entered into heaven as our forerunner, it is our
      duty to be following him with all speed we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      28. We may see whereon the security of the church doth depend, as to the
      trials and storms which it undergoes in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      29. What will he not do for us, who, in the height of his glory, is not
      ashamed to be esteemed our forerunner?
    </p>
    <p>
      30. When our hope and trust enter within the veil, it is Christ as our
      forerunner that in a peculiar manner they are to fix and fasten themselves
      upon.
