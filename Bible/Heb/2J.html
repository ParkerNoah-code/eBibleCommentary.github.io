    <h2>
      Ver 13.
      <em
        >For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one
        greater, he swore by himself,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>
      Ver 14.

        multiply you.”</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 15.
      <em>Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</em>
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 16.
      <em
        >For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs
        the oath is final for confirmation.</em
      >
    </h2>

    <h2>
      Ver 17.
      <em

        of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an
        oath,</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 18.
      <em
        >that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie,
        we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take
        hold of the hope set before us.</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 19.

        steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 20.

        forever after the order of Melchizedek.</em
