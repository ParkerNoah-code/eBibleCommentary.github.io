  <h2>Verse 16</h2>
  <p>
    For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them
    an end of all strife.
  </p>
  <p>
    Men swear by the greater, by some one superior to themselves; and, when
    other evidence cannot be obtained, an oath settles the matter. Israel were
    commanded to swear by the name of the Lord, Deuteronomy 6:13, so that the
    strife is brought to an end. The example of God, with the Apostle&#x27;s
    observation, decides the question of the lawfulness of oaths, which has been
    denied. Can we for a moment suppose that God, in His transactions with men,
    should by His own example sanction what is unlawful, and direct the Apostle
    to speak of an oath as putting an end to strife? Strife arises now as
    formerly, and an oath for confirmation is as necessary now as it was before.
    There are two passages in the New Testament which are alleged as a proof of
    the unlawfulness of oaths. In the sermon on the mount, the Lord says,
    &quot;Swear not at all;&quot; but it is more evident, from the connexion,
    that the Lord there condemns the confirmation of a vow by an oath.
    &quot;Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perforin unto the Lord thy
    vows. [There is no reference here to transactions between men.] But I say
    unto you, Swear not at all.&quot; We have an example of a vow without an
    oath in the history of Jacob at Bethel, Genesis 28:20-22. The Apostle James
    likewise forbids swearing, chap5:12; but it is evident, from the connexion,
    that he is also treating of vows. Not only were oaths regulated by the
    Jewish law, but the Lord Himself, when questioned by the high priest, gave
    no answer till, put upon His oath, He heard &quot;the voice of
    swearing.&quot; And not only Romans 4:13-17; Galatians 3:27) the fullest
    assurance of the unchangeableness of His counsel, confirmed His promise with
    an oath. Numbers 14:22; chap3:17; Isaiah 45:23.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 18</h2>
  <p>
    That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we
    might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
    the hope set before us.
  </p>
  <p>
    That by two immutable things, the promise and the oath of God, in which it
    was impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge [The word refuge
    is not in the original. It Numbers 35:11-12—has led our translators to the
    insertion of the word.] to the hope set before us might have strong
    consolation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The promise of God, which He confirmed by an oath to Abraham, Genesis 22:18.
    So that the promise was confirmed to them as well as to their father
    Abraham.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 19</h2>
  <p>
    Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and
    which entereth into that within the veil.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hope set before us is the blessing of Abraham, which has come upon the
    Gentiles (as well as Jews) through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the
    promise of the Spirit through faith, Galatians 3:14, and thus be sealed to
    the day of redemption. This hope is compared to an anchor, and the figure is
    most appropriate and beautiful. The anchor, which holds the ship, and
    prevents her from drifting with the wind and tide, is out of sight, fixed in
    the ground by its form and weight. Thus it is with the believer; the Lord
    Jesus Christ, who has entered within the vail, is his hope, 1 Timothy 1:1,
    and this keeps him steadfast and immovable, preventing his being led away by
    the lying vanities of this present evil world. When about to remove from her
    anchorage, the ship is drawn forward to the anchor, which is then weighed,
    and comes into sight. In this world we hope for what we see not, and with
    patience wait for it; but, when we receive the adoption, to wit, the
    redemption of the body, our hope will be swallowed up in enjoyment; then we
    shall see what, while on earth, we only hoped for.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides preserving a ship from drifting, the anchor is used to remove her
    from one part of a river or harbour to another; and thus, while the hope of
    the believer keeps him steadfast, it at the same time serves to draw him
    nearer to the object of his hope, till he shall no longer see through a
    glass darkly, but face to face; and shall no longer hope for eternal glory,
    but enter on the full possession of it.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 20</h2>
  <p>
    Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest
    for ever after the order of Melchisedec,
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ, the great object of our hope, has, in the character of our
    forerunner, entered within the vail, thus taking possession, as it were, on
    our behalf, of the heavenly inheritance, and giving us the assurance of
    being with Him.
  </p>
  <p>
    He is gone to prepare a place for His people, and He says, &quot;And if I go
    to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself;
    that where I John 14:3. Having offered an all-sufficient sacrifice, and
    being brought again from the dead through the blood of the everlasting
    covenant, He has entered into the most holy place with His own blood, as the
    glorious head and representative of His body the Church. He is made forever
    a high priest after the order of Melchisidec.
