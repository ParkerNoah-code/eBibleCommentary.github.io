    <h2>K. Faith: Looking to Jesus (12:1-3)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 1.
      <em
        >Therefore let’s also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of
        witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles
        us, and let’s run with perseverance the race that is set before us,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. In all examples set before us in Scripture, we are diligently to
      consider our own concern in them, and what we are instructed by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. God hath not only made provision, but plentiful provision, in the
      Scripture for the strengthening of our faith, and for our encouragement
      unto duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is an honor that God puts on his saints departed, especially such as
      suffered and died for the truth, that even after their death they shall be
      witnesses unto faith and obedience in all generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. To faint in our profession whilst we are encompassed with such a cloud
      of witnesses is a great aggravation of our sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Universal mortification of sin is the best preparative, preservative,
      and security for constancy in profession in a time of trial and
      persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Whereas the nature of indwelling sin at such seasons is to work by
      unbelief towards a departure from the living God, or to the relinquishment
      of the gospel and the profession of it, we ought to be continually on our
      watch against all its arguings and actings towards that end.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The way whereby this sin principally manifests itself, is by the clogs
      and hinderances which it puts upon us in the constant course of our
      obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The reward that is proposed at the end of this race is every way worthy
      of all the pains, diligence, and patience that are to be taken and
      exercised in the attainment of it
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em
        >looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy
        that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has
        sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The foundation of our stability in the faith and profession of the
      gospel in times of trial and suffering, is a constant looking unto Christ
      with expectation of aid and assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is a mighty encouragement unto constancy and perseverance in
      believing, that he in whom we do believe is the author and finisher of our
      faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The exercise of faith on Christ, to enable us unto perseverance under
      difficulties and persecutions, respects him as a Savior and a sufferer, as
      the author and finisher of faith itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Herein is the Lord Christ our great example, in that he was influenced
      and acted, in all that he did and suffered, by a continual respect unto
      the glory of God and the salvation of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. If we duly propose these things unto ourselves in all our sufferings,
      as they are set before us in the Scripture, we shall not faint under them,
      nor be weary of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. This blessed frame of mind in our Lord Jesus in all his sufferings is
      that which the apostle proposeth for our encouragement and unto our
      imitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. If he went so through his sufferings, and was victorious in the issue,
      we also may do so in ours, through his assistance who is the author and
      finisher of our faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. We have in this instance the highest proof that faith can conquer both
      pain and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. We should neither think strange of them, nor fear them, on the account
      of our profession of the gospel, seeing the Lord Jesus hath gone before in
      the conflict with them and conquest of them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against
        himself, that you don’t grow weary, fainting in your souls.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Such things may befall us in the way of our profession of the gospel as
      are in themselves apt to weary and burden us, so as to solicit our minds
      to a relinquishment of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. When we begin to be heartless, desponding, and weary of our sufferings,
      it is a dangerous disposition of mind, tending towards a defection from
      the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. We ought to watch against nothing more diligently than the insensible,
      gradual prevailing of such a frame in us, if we intend to be faithful to
      the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. If we design perseverance in a time of trouble and persecution, it is
      both our wisdom and our duty to keep up faith to a vigorous exercise, the
      want whereof is the fainting in our minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The malicious contradiction of wicked priests, scribes, and pharisees,
      against the truth, and those that profess it on the account thereof, is
      suited to make them faint, if not opposed by vigorous acting of faith on
      Christ, and a due consideration of his sufferings in the same kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Whoever they are who, by their contradictions unto the truth and them
      that do profess it, do stir up persecution against them, let them pretend
      what they will of righteousness, they are sinners, and that in such a
      degree as to be obnoxious to eternal death.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. If our minds grow weak, through a remission of the vigorous acting of
      faith, in a time of great contradiction unto our profession, they will
      quickly grow weary, so as to give over if not timely recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The constant consideration of Christ in his sufferings is the best
      means to keep up faith unto its due exercise in all times of trial.
