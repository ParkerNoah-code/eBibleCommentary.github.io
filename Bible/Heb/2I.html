    <p>
      1. It is the duty of the dispensers of the gospel to satisfy their hearers
      in and of their love in Jesus Christ to their souls and persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is our duty to come into the best satisfaction we may in the
      spiritual condition of them with whom we are to have spiritual communion.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. We may, as occasions require, publicly testify that good persuasion
      which we have concerning the spiritual condition of others, and that unto
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The best persuasion we can arrive unto concerning the spiritual
      condition of any leaves yet room, yea, makes way for gospel threatenings,
      warnings, exhortations, and encouragements.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Among professors of the gospel some are partakers of better things than
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. There are, according to the tenor of the covenant of grace, such things
      bestowed on some persons as salvation doth infallibly accompany and ensue
      upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It is the duty of all professors strictly to examine themselves
      concerning their participation of those better things which accompany
      salvation.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 10.
      <em
        >For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of
        love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints,
        and still do serve them.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. Faith, if it be a living faith, will be a working faith.</p>
    <p>
      2. We ought to look on obedience as our work, which will admit neither of
      sloth nor negligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is a due regard unto the name of God that gives life, spirituality,
      and acceptance, unto all the duties of love which we perform towards
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is the will and pleasure of God that many of his saints be in a
      condition, in this world, wherein they stand in need of being ministered
      unto.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The great trial of our love consists in our regard to the saints that
      are in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is the glory and honor of a church, the principal evidence of its
      spiritual life, when it is diligent and abounds in those duties of faith
      and love which are attended with the greatest difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Our perseverance in faith and obedience, though it requires our duty
      and constancy therein, yet it depends not on them absolutely, but on the
      righteousness of God in his promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Nothing shall be lost that is done for God, or in obedience unto him.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The certainty of our future reward, depending on the righteousness of
      God, is a great encouragement unto present obedience.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 11.
      <em
        >We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the
        fullness of hope even to the end,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Our profession will not be preserved, nor the work of faith and love
      carried on, unto the glory of God and our own salvation, without a
      constant studious diligence in the preservation of the one and the
      exercise of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Ministerial exhortation unto duty is needful even unto them who are
      sincere in the practice of it, that they may abide and continue therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Whereas there are degrees in spiritual saving graces and their
      operations, we ought continually to press towards the most perfect of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Hope, being improved by the due exercise of faith and love, will grow
      up into such an assurance of rest, life, immortality, and glory, as shall
      outweigh all the troubles and persecutions that in this world may befall
      us on the account of our profession or otherwise.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 12.
      <em>
        that you won’t be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and
        perseverance inherited the promises.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Spiritual sloth is ruinous of any profession, though otherwise never so
      hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Faith and patient long-suffering are the only way whereby professors of
      the gospel may attain rest with God, in the accomplishment of the
      promises.
    </p>
    <p>3. All the children of God have a right unto an inheritance.</p>
    <p>
      4. The providing of examples for us in the Scripture, which we ought to
      imitate and follow, is an effectual way of teaching, and a great fruit of
      the cure and kindness of God towards us.
