  <h2>Verse 9</h2>
  <p>
    But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that
    accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having delivered this solemn warning the Apostle proceeds to encourage his
    brethren who had stood fast in the faith. He was persuaded better things of
    them, although he thus spoke. It was necessary for him to set before them
    the awful state of those who had apostatized, but he had confidence in those
    whom he addressed. He was persuaded better things of them, even things that
    accompany salvation, although he had found it necessary to use the language
    he had done. It may be asked, What are the better things to which he refers?
    and he answers the question, Things which accompany salvation, which are the
    evidence of our union with Christ, and which are therefore far superior to
    these gifts to which he had referred, and to which apostates may attain. We
    have here an instance of the wisdom and tenderness with which the Apostle
    addressed his brethren. He had set before them the awful doom of apostates,
    and he now returns to the strongest expressions of confidence and brotherly
    love. Of this we have another instance, 2 Thessalonians 2:13. There also he
    speaks of apostates, whom in righteous judgment God gave up to strong
    delusion, that they should believe a lie, but adds: &quot; But we are bound
    to give thanks always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because
    God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification
    of the Spirit and belief of the truth.&quot; 2 Thessalonians 2:13. So also
    Ephesians 4:20. He had described the wickedness of the Gentiles, who had
    abandoned themselves to all uncleanness with greediness, but adds: &quot;
    Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
    of God, unto a perfect Ephesians 4:13.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 10</h2>
  <p>
    For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye
    have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and
    do minister.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, as elsewhere, brotherly love is described as far superior to all
    spiritual gifts, which the Apostle had shown might be possessed by
    hypocrites and apostates. &quot;Beloved,&quot; says another Apostle,
    &quot;let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth
    is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God
    is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
    sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
    Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his
    Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we
    ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love
    one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.&quot; 1
    John 4:7-12. Christ condescends to acknowledge what is done to his brethren
    as having been done to himself, Matthew 25:45, and here the Apostle says God
    is not unrighteous. He acknowledges himself as having been laid under an
    obligation by their work of faith and labour of love, which he will not
    forget, in having in time past ministered, and still continuing to minister,
    to his saints. We can have no claim upon God, we have nothing but what we
    receive from his bounty; but he has engaged to reward the services of his
    people, and he is faithful who hath promised and will also do it. 1
    Thessalonians 5:23-24. The same line of argument is pursued by the Apostle:
    &quot;Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not
    charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I
    have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge;
    and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not
    charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,
    and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
    me nothing.&quot; 1 Corinthians 13:1-3. Hence we learn that gifts, however
    great, are inferior to love; and we may observe that the Apostle supposes a
    man to give his goods to feed the poor and his body to be burned, for
    attachment to the profession which he has made, and yet to be nothing
    because destitute of love; he then proceeds to describe the love which he so
    highly commends. 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. It is the very Spirit of Christ; God
    is love. There is no inconsistency in this declaration with our God being a
    consuming fire. The God of love is described as being jealous, and
    revenging, and being furious; his fury is poured out like fire. Nehem1:3-6.
    Sin has brought misery and confusion into his universe; and, as he sware
    that he would have war with Amalek from generation to generation, he hath
    sworn irreconcilable war with sin. But this, so far from being inconsistent
    with God&#x27;s being love, is essential to the perfection of his character
    as the God of love. It is in his righteous indignation against sin that his
    character is fully brought out. He is indeed angry with the wicked every
    day, he will in no wise clear the guilty; but the full manifestation of the
    love of God consists in his sending his only begotten Son into the world
    that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Hebrews had shown great liberality in ministering to the saints in the
    beginning of the Gospel, Acts 2:45; Acts 4:34, and they had compassion of
    himself in his bonds, Hebrews 10:34, ministering to him when he was prisoner
    at Caesarea, and, not only 1 John 3:19. This exactly corresponds with the
    passage under consideration, that we should use diligence to the full
    assurance of hope unto the end. Our hearts are deceitful above all things,
    and we are prone to take comfort from considering ourselves as believers;
    this is very common, and many substitute faith for the great object of
    faith. We see people utterly destitute of the knowledge of Christ shocked
    with the sentiments of infidels; they believe that the Scriptures are true,
    as king Agrippa believed the prophets; but as he did not believe what the
    prophets testified, neither do they believe the Gospel of Christ, but a
    figment of their own brain. I may ask a man the road to a particular place,
    with the full assurance that he knows it well; but, if I mistake his
    directions, this will not lead me to the place. So we may believe that the
    Gospel is true, while we substitute a fable for the truth as it is in Jesus;
    and what will such faith profit us? Now we are guarded against error, not
    only by the great plainness of speech used by the Lord and His Apostles, but
    by being informed what effects the faith of the Gospel must necessarily
    produce, and the more these effects are produced in us the greater evidence
    we have that it is the true grace of God wherein we stand. Nothing is more
    insisted on in Scripture than brotherly love. It is Christ&#x27;s new
    commandment, and the possession or the want of it is represented as the
    decisive test of our belonging to him, or being of the world that lieth in
    the wicked one. Matthew 25:34; Matthew 25:40.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the Word of God pours contempt on our own righteousness, declaring
    that by the deeds of the law no flesh living shall be justified, it enforces
    the duty of obedience, declaring that without holiness no man shall see the
    Lord; and so inseparably connected are faith and obedience, that all shall
    receive of the deeds done in the body, whether they be good or bad, The
    grace of God teaches the believer that, denying ungodliness and worldly
    lusts, he should live soberly, righteously, and godly; and, while we are
    justified by grace through faith, we are taught the inseparable connexion of
    faith and works, by the declaration that Abraham, the father of believers,
    Habakkuk 2:3.
