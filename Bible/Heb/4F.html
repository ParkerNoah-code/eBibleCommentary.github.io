    <h2>
      Ver 8.

        >By faith Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly
        fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he
        condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is

        his own, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of
        the same promise.</em

    </h2>

    <h2>
      Ver 10.

    <h2>F. Faith: Looking Forward (11:8-12)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 8.
      <em
        >By faith Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly
        fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he
        condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is

    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It becomes the infinite greatness and all-satisfactory goodness of God,
      at the very first revelation of himself unto any of his creatures, to
      require of them a renunciation of all other things, and of their interest
      in them, in compliance with his commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In the call of Abraham we see the power of sovereign grace in calling
      men to God, and the mighty efficacy of faith in complying therewith.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is the call of God alone that makes a distinction amongst mankind,
      as unto faith and obedience, with all the effects of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The church of believers consists of those that are called out of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Self-denial in fact or resolution is the foundation of all sincere
      profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. There is no right, title, or possession, that can prescribe against the
      righteousness of God in the disposal of all inheritances here below at his
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. God’s grant of things unto any is the best of titles, and most sure
      against all pretences or impeachments.
    </p>
    <p>8. Possession belongs unto an inheritance enjoyed.</p>
    <p>9. An inheritance may be given only for a limited season.</p>
    <p>
      10. It is faith alone that gives the soul satisfaction in future rewards,
      in the midst of present difficulties and distresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The assurance given us by divine promises is sufficient to encourage
      us to advance in the most difficult course of obedience.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 9.
      <em
        >By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not
        his own, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of
        the same promise.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Where faith enables men to live unto God as unto their eternal
      concerns, it will enable them to trust unto him in all the difficulties,
      dangers, and hazards of this life.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. If we design to have an interest in the blessing of Abraham, we must
      walk in the steps of the faith of Abraham.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Where faith is once duly fixed on the promises, it will wait patiently
      under trials, afflictions, and temptations for their full accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Faith discerning aright the glory of spiritual promises, will make the
      soul of a believer contented and well satisfied with the smallest portion
      of earthly enjoyments.
    </p>

      Ver 10.
      <em
        >For he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose builder
        and maker is God.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. A certain expectation of the heavenly reward, grounded on the promises
      and covenant of God, is sufficient to support and encourage the souls of
      believers under all their trials, in the whole course of their obedience.
    </p>
    <p>2. Heaven is a settled, quiet habitation.</p>
    <p>
      3. All stability, all perpetuity in every state, here and hereafter,
      ariseth from the purpose of God, and is resolved thereinto.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. This is that which recommends to us the city of God, the heavenly
      state, that it is, as the work of God alone, so the principal effect of
      his wisdom and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. A constant expectation of an eternal reward argues a vigorous exercise
      of faith, and a sedulous attendance to all duties of obedience.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 11.
      <em
        >By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a
        child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had
        promised.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Faith may be sorely shaken and tossed at the first appearance of
      difficulties lying in the way of the promise, which yet at last it shall
      overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Although God ordinarily worketh by his concurring blessing on the
      course of nature, yet is he not obliged thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is no defect in faith not to expect events and blessings absolutely
      above the use of means, unless we have a particular warrant for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The duty and use of faith about temporal mercies are to be regulated by
      the general rules of the word, where no especial providence doth make
      application of a promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The mercy concerning a son unto Abraham by Sarah his wife was
      absolutely decreed and absolutely promised, yet God indispensably requires
      faith in them for the fulfilling of that decree and the accomplishment of
      that promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The formal object of faith in the divine promises is not the things
      promised in the first place, but God himself in his essential excellencies
      of truth, or faithfulness, and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Every promise of God hath this consideration tacitly annexed to it, “Is
      any thing too hard for the LORD?”
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Although the truth, veracity, or faithfulness of God, be in a peculiar
      manner the immediate object of our faith, yet it takes in the
      consideration of all other divine excellencies for its encouragement and
      corroboration.
    </p>

        man, and him as good as dead.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. When God is pleased to increase his church in number, it is on various
      accounts a matter of rejoicing unto all believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. An ungodly, carnal multitude, combined together in secular interests
      for their advantage, unto the ends of superstition and sin, calling
      themselves “The church,” like that of Rome, is set up by the craft of
      Satan to evade the truth, and debase the glory of these promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. God oftentimes by nature works things above the power of nature in its
      ordinary efficacy and operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Whatever difficulties and oppositions lie in the way of the
      accomplishment of the promises under the new testament, made unto Jesus
      Christ concerning the increase and stability of his church and kingdom,
      these promises shall have an assured accomplishment.
