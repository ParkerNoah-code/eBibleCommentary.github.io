  <h2>Verse 12</h2>
  <p>
    Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief
    in departing from the living God.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon the quotation which the Apostle had made from Ecclesiastes 4:9-10. They
    are not only individually to beware of an evil heart of unbelief, but to
    exhort one another; to be aware of the dangers to which they are exposed,
    and to watch over one another in love, and daily to exhort each other, lest
    they should be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. Satan first
    entered the hearts of our first parents in the form of a lie, and he
    insinuated it in the most ensnaring manner. He at first questioned whether
    our first parents had rightly understood what God said. &quot;Yea, hath God
    said?&quot; as if he said, It cannot be; surely God could not lay you under
    this restraint. Had Eve spurned the insinuation— had she rested on the
    glorious perfections of the Divine character—had she considered that it was
    her honor and happiness to be implicitly guided by her Creator in all
    things, Satan would have been baffled, and would have fled from her, James
    4:7; but she chose to argue the matter, to explain to the tempter the
    liberty bestowed on them to eat of the trees of the garden with one
    exception. This emboldened Satan directly to contradict the Almighty, and to
    assure the woman that, in- stead of dying, they should become as gods. Thus
    was Eve hardened through the deceitfulness of sin; the tempter, by his
    subtlety, led her not only to expect impunity, but an increase of rank and
    happiness; and thus, by the hope of impunity, and the prospect of enjoyment,
    are men in every age hardened by those lusts which are gendered by the
    deceitfulness and desperate wickedness of the heart of fallen man. There is
    but one safeguard, to which we have already alluded:—&quot; Concerning the
    works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the
    destroyer.&quot; Psalm 17:4.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 14</h2>
  <p>
    For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our
    confidence steadfast unto the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Christian life is compared to a race, a warfare, in which we are
    exhorted to strenuous exertion, while we habitually recollect that in the
    Lord alone we have righteousness and strength, and that, while we are called
    to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling, it is God who worketh
    in us to will and to do of His good pleasure. We are apt to err, either by
    trusting in our own heart, which is a sure proof of folly, or to think that
    we are something, and that, by our resolutions and exertions, we are able to
    overcome. But, in either case, we are hardened through the deceitfulness of
    sin, not holding the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end. Faith
    worketh by love; it overcometh the world and its snares. Hence this verse is
    connected with the preceding by the particle &quot;for,&quot; reminding us
    how prone we are to let slip the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    This verse is exactly similar to Hebrews 2:6; in the former the Apostle
    says,—&quot; Whose house are we;&quot; in the verse before us,—&quot;We are
    made partakers of Christ&quot;—of those benefits which He bestows on His
    people, by their dwelling in Him and He in them, communicating to them of
    His fulness, leading them by His counsel, and afterwards receiving them to
    His glory. If we are Christ&#x27;s house He dwells in us, and thus we are
    made partakers of Christ; so that the two verses express the same idea,
    while, by the variation of the expression, our views of the mutual
    relationship of Christ and His people are more fully exhibited.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pronoun our is not in the original; it is simply the beginning of the
    confidence exactly corresponding with holding fast the confidence. We may
    notice that the word rendered &quot;confidence,&quot; both in vers6,14 , are
    not the same in ver14; it is the same word rendered &quot;confidence
    in.&quot; &quot;The confidence of things hoped for.&quot; The word, in ver6
    , signifies boldness; openness, 2 Corinthians 7:4. It is connected with the
    rejoicing of hope. A bold avowal of the truth exposed the disciples to
    persecution; but this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
    faith. 1 John 5:4.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Apostles were commanded by the Jewish rulers not to speak or teach
    in the name of Jesus, they replied, &quot;for we cannot but speak the things
    which we have seen and heard;&quot; and when they had been beaten for not
    complying with the commandment to hold their peace, &quot; they departed
    from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to
    suffer shame for his name.&quot; Acts 5:41. Here we have an illustration of
    the boldness, or confidence, and the rejoicing of the hope enjoined by the
    Apostle. Believers are begotten to a lively hope, but there are stony-ground
    hearers, who for a time appear to believe, and the Scriptures frequently
    speak of things according to their appearance; but he that endureth to the
    end shall be saved. In due season we shall reap if we faint not.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 15</h2>
  <p>
    While it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,
    as in the provocation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apostle here recurs to the quotation already made from Numbers 14:29.
  </p>
  <p>
    This illustrates the Apostle&#x27;s doctrine, that there was a remnant
    according to the election of grace. Thus it was in the days of Elijah, in
    the days of Malachi ( Malachi 3:16-17), and also in the days of Paul. Romans
    11:4-5.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 17</h2>
  <p>
    But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had
    sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
  </p>
  <p>
    With whom was God displeased during forty years? was it not with them whose
    carcases fell in the wilderness? Numbers 26:63-65.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 18</h2>
  <p>
    And to whom aware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them
    that believed not?
  </p>
  <p>
    And to whom did He swear that they should not enter into His rest, but to
    them that believed not. Numbers 14:11. All the rebellions of Israel sprang
    from unbelief. Their making the calf, their murmuring against God and
    against his servant Moses, and their refusing to enter Canaan, all proceeded
    from unbelief.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 19</h2>
  <p>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>
  <p>
    Thus we see that they could not enter the promised land because of unbelief.
    Faith in God was essentially necessary to their expelling the Canaanites,
    who were by far more warlike than themselves. They indeed quitted Egypt
    under the assurance that they should inherit Canaan; they followed the
    leader whom God had appointed through the sea, but they were at this period
    escaping from the house of bondage, where their lives had been embittered by
    oppression; besides, Pharaoh&#x27;s army was behind them, and to stop was
    certain destruction. Such were the motives by which they were induced to
    enter the path through the mighty waters which God had opened for them. But
    their circumstances on the borders of Canaan were very different. They were,
    so to speak, naturalized in the wilderness; albeit there was neither earing
    nor harvest, all their wants were richly supplied. The spies had given a
    description of the warlike condition of the Canaanites; they represented it
    as certain destruction to invade the land, so that every natural principle
    forbade their making the attempt. There was a lion in the way; and thus it
    is that the conduct of men is often ascribed to their faith, when, in fact,
    they are walking by sight influenced by worldly motives, while they give
    themselves, and receive from others credit for being actuated by confidence
    in God. Such was the case with Israel at the Red Sea. There was, doubtless,
    a remnant whose dread of the sea was overcome by faith in God; but the great
    body of Israel were children in whom there was no faith, while their conduct
    on some occasions appeared to result from this Divine principle.
