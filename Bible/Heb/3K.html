    <h2>K. Christ High and Lifted Up (10:11-18)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 11-14.

    <p>
      1. If all those divine institutions, in the diligent observance of them,
      could not take away sin, how much less can any thing do so that we can
      betake ourselves unto for that end!
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Faith in Christ doth jointly respect both his oblation of himself by
      death and the glorious exaltation that ensued thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Christ in this order of things is the great exemplar of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It was the entrance of sin which raised up all our enemies against us.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Lord Christ, in his ineffable love and grace, put himself between
      us and all our enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The Lord Christ, by the offering of himself making peace with God,
      ruined all the enmity against the church and all the enemies of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It is the foundation of all consolation to the church, that the Lord
      Christ, even now in heaven, takes all our enemies to be his, in whose
      destruction he is infinitely more concerned than we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Let us never esteem any thing or any person to be our enemy, but only
      so far and in what they are the enemies of Christ, 9. It is our duty to
      conform ourselves to the Lord Christ in a quiet expectancy of the ruin of
      all our spiritual adversaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Envy not the condition of the most proud and cruel adversaries of the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>11. There was a glorious efficacy in the one offering of Christ.</p>
    <p>
      12. The end of it must be effectually accomplished towards all for whom it
      was offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The sanctification and perfection of the church being that end
      designed in the death and sacrifice of Christ, all things necessary unto
      that end must be included therein, that it be not frustrated.
    </p>

      Ver 15-18.

        will put my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their mind;”
        then he says, “I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more.”
        Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</em

    <p>
      1. It is the authority of the Holy Ghost alone, speaking to us in the
      Scripture, whereinto all our faith is to be resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. We are to propose nothing, in the preaching and worship of the gospel,
      but what is testified unto by the Holy Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. When an important truth consonant unto the Scripture is declared, it is
      useful and expedient to confirm it with some express testimony of
      Scripture.
