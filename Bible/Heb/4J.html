      1. It is requisite prudence, in the confirmation of important truths, to
      give them a full proof and demonstration, and yet not to multiply
      arguments and testimonies beyond what is necessary, which serves only to
      divert the mind from attending unto the truth itself to be confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is not the dignity of the person that gives efficacy unto faith, but
      it is faith that makes the person accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Neither the guilt of sin nor the sense of it should hinder us from
      acting faith on God in Christ when we are called thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>4. True faith will save great sinners.</p>
    <p>
      5. There is nothing so great or difficult, or seemingly insuperable, no
      discouragement so great from a sense of our own unworthiness by sin, nor
      opposition arising against us from both of them in conjunction, that
      should hinder us from believing and from the exercise of faith in all
      things when we are called thereunto.

    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There is nothing that can lie in the way of the accomplishment of any
      of God’s promises but it is conquerable by faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That faith that hath stopped the mouths of lions can restrain,
      disappoint, and stop the rage of the most savage oppressors and
      persecutors of the church.
    </p>
    <h2>

    <p>
      1. It is the wisdom and duty of faith to apply itself to all lawful ways
      and means of deliverance from danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. We ought to exercise faith about temporal mercies, as they are ofttimes
      received by it and given in on the account of it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 36-37.
      <em
        >Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and
        imprisonment. They were stoned. They were sawn apart. They were tempted.
        They were slain with the sword. They went around in sheep skins and in
        goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated—</em

    <p>
      There may be sufferings sufficient for the trial of the faith of the
      church when the world is restrained from blood and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. It belongs unto the sovereign pleasure of God to dispose of the outward
      state and condition of the church, as unto its seasons of prosperity and
      persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Those whose lot falleth in the times of greatest distress or
      sufferings, are no less accepted with him than those who enjoy the highest
      terrene felicity and success.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Sufferings will stir us up unto the exercise of faith on the most
      difficult objects of it, and bring in the comforts of them into our souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. No instruments of cruelty, no inventions of the devil or the world, no
      terrible preparations of death, — that is, no endeavours of the gates of
      hell, — shall ever prevail against the faith of God’s elect.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is no small degree of suffering, for men by law or violence to be
      driven from those places of their own habitation which the providence of
      God, and all just right among men, have allotted unto them.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. He will be deceived who at any time, under a sincere profession of the
      gospel, looks for any other, any better treatment or entertainment in the
      world than reproaches, defamations, revilings, threatenings, contempt.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 38.
      <em
        >of whom the world was not worthy—wandering in deserts, mountains,
        caves, and the holes of the earth.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Let the world think as well, as highly, as proudly of itself as it
      pleaseth, when it persecutes it is base and unworthy of the society of
      true believers and of the mercies wherewith it is accompanied.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. God’s esteem of his people is never the less for their outward
      sufferings and calamities, whatever the world judgeth of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Ofttimes it is better and more safe for the saints of God to be in the
      wilderness among the beasts of the field than in a savage world, inflamed
      by the devil into rage and persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Though the world may prevail to drive the church into the wilderness,
      to the ruin of all public profession in their own apprehension, yet it
      shall be there preserved unto the appointed season of its deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It becomes us to be filled with thoughts of and affections unto
      spiritual things, to labor for an anticipation of glory, that we faint not
      in the consideration of the evils that may befall us on the account of the
      gospel.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 39-40.
      <em
        >These all, having been commended for their faith, didn’t receive the
        promise, God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that
        apart from us they should not be made perfect.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is our duty not only to believe, that we may be justified before God,
      but so to evidence our faith by the fruits of it, as that we may obtain a
      good report, or be justified before men.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The disposal of the states and times of the church, as unto the
      communication of light, grace, and privileges, depends merely on the
      sovereign pleasure and will of God, and not on any merit or preparation in
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Though God gives more light and grace unto the church in one season
      than in another, yet in every season he gives that which is sufficient to
      guide believers in their faith and obedience unto eternal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is the duty of believers, in every state of the church, to make use
      of and improve the spiritual provision that God hath made for them, always
      remembering that unto whom much is given of them much is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. God measures out unto all his people their portion in service,
      sufferings, privileges, and rewards, according to his own good pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is Christ alone who was to give, and who alone could give,
      perfection or consummation unto the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. All the outward glorious worship of the old testament had no perfection
      in it, and so no glory, comparatively, unto that which is brought in by
      the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>7. All perfection, all consummation, is in Christ alone.</p>
