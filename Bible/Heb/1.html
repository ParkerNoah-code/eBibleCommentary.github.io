    <h2>Introduction (1:1-4)</h2>
    <p>
      God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many
      times and in various ways, has at the end of these days spoken to us by
      his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made
      the worlds. His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his
      substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, who, when he
      had by himself purified us of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the
      Majesty on high, having become as much better than the angels as the more
      excellent name he has inherited is better than theirs.
    </p>
    <h2>The Son Greater than the Angels (1:5-14)</h2>
    <p>For to which of the angels did he say at any time,</p>
    <section>
      <p>“You are my Son. Today I have become your father?”</p>
    </section>
    <p>and again,</p>
    <section>
      <p>“I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son?”</p>
    </section>
    <p>
      When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says, “Let all the
      angels of God worship him.”
    </p>
    <p>Of the angels he says,</p>
    <section>
      <p>“He makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire.”</p>
    </section>
    <p>But of the Son he says,</p>
    <section>
      <p>
        “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of uprightness is
        the scepter of your Kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated
        iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of
        gladness above your fellows.”
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>And,</p>
    <section>
      <p>
        “You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth. The
        heavens are the works of your hands. They will perish, but you continue.
        They all will grow old like a garment does. You will roll them up like a
        mantle, and they will be changed; but you are the same. Your years won’t
        fail.”
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>But which of the angels has he told at any time,</p>
    <section>
      <p>
        “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your
        feet?”
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Aren’t they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of
      those who will inherit salvation?
    </p>
    <h2>Pay Attention: Great Salvation (2:1-4)</h2>
    <p>
      Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard,
      lest perhaps we drift away. For if the word spoken through angels proved
      steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just
      penalty, how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation—which at
      the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by
      those who heard, God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders,
      by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to
      his own will?
    </p>
    <h2>Everything in Subjection to Him (2:5-9)</h2>
    <p>
      For he didn’t subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels. 6
      But one has somewhere testified, saying,
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        “What is man, that you think of him? Or the son of man, that you care
        for him? You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him
        with glory and honor. You have put all things in subjection under his
        feet.”
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not
      subject to him. But now we don’t yet see all things subjected to him. But
      we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus,
      because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by
      the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.
    </p>
    <h2>Perfected Salvation through Him (2:10-18)</h2>
    <p>
      For it became him, for whom are all things and through whom are all
      things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their
      salvation perfect through sufferings. For both he who sanctifies and those
      who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to
      call them brothers, saying,
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        “I will declare your name to my brothers. Among the congregation I will
        sing your praise.”
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Again, “I will put my trust in him.” Again, “Behold, here I am with the
      children whom God has given me.” Since then the children have shared in
      flesh and blood, he also himself in the same way partook of the same, that
      through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death,
      that is, the devil, and might deliver all of them who through fear of
      death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For most certainly, he doesn’t give help to angels, but he gives help to
      the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he was obligated in all things to be
      made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high
      priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the
      people. For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to
      help those who are tempted.
    </p>
    <h2>High Priest and Apostle (3:1-6)</h2>
    <p>
      Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the
      Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus, who was faithful to him
      who appointed him, as also Moses was in all his house. For he has been
      counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house
      has more honor than the house. For every house is built by someone; but he
      who built all things is God. Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as
      a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be
      spoken, but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house. We are his house,
      if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the
      end.
