    <h2>B. Mount Zion: Heavenly City (12:18-24)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 18-19.
      <em
        >For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched and that
        burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm, the sound of a
        trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that
        not one more word should be spoken to them,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. A view of God as a judge, represented in fire and blackness, will fill
      the souls of convinced sinners with dread and terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Where God calls sinners to answer the law, there is no avoiding of an
      appearance; the terrible summons and citation will draw them out whether
      they will or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is a blessed change, to be removed from the summons of the law to
      answer for the guilt of sin, unto the invitation of the gospel to come and
      accept of mercy and pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Let no man ever think or hope to appear before God with confidence or
      peace, unless he have an answer in readiness unto all the words of this
      law, all that it requires of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. No outward privilege, such as this was, to hear the voice of God, is
      sufficient of itself to preserve men from such sins and rebellions as
      shall render them obnoxious to divine displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Then is the sinner utterly overwhelmed, when he hath a sense of the
      voice of God himself in the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The speaking of the law doth immediately discover the invincible
      necessity of a mediator between God and sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. If the giving of the law was so full of terror that the people could
      not bear it, but apprehended that they must die if God continued to speak
      it to them, what will be the execution of its curse in a way of vengeance
      at the last day?
    </p>

      Ver 22-24.
      <em
        >But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the
        heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels, to the
        festal gathering and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in
        heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made
        perfect, to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of
        sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. All pleas about church order, power, rights, and privileges, are
      useless, where men are not interested in this Sion state.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is our duty well to consider what sort of persons they ought to be
      who are meet to be denizens of this city of God.
    </p>
    <p>3. The church is the safest society in the world.</p>
    <p>
      4. The church is the most honorable society in the world, for all the
      angels in heaven belong to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. We may hence see the folly of that voluntary humility in worshipping of
      angels which the apostle condemns, and which is openly practiced in the
      church of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is the highest madness for any one to pretend himself to be the head
      of the church, as the pope doth, unless he assume also to himself to be
      the head of all the angels in heaven; for they all belong to the same
      church with the saints here below.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The revelation of the glorious mystery of this general assembly is one
      of the most excellent pre-eminences of the gospel above the law.
    </p>
    <p>8. Jesus Christ alone is absolutely the first-born and heir of all.</p>
    <p>
      9. Under the old testament the promises of Christ, and that he was to
      proceed from that people according to the flesh, gave the title of sonship
      unto the church of Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. All the right and title of believers under the old testament unto
      sonship, or the right of the first-born, arises merely from their interest
      in him and participation of him who is absolutely so.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. It is a glorious privilege to be brought unto this blessed society,
      this general assembly of the first-born.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. If we are come unto this assembly, it is our duty carefully to behave
      ourselves as becometh the members of this society.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. All contests about church order, state, interest, power, with whom the
      church is, are vain, empty, fruitless, unprofitable, among those who
      cannot evidence that they belong unto this general assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Eternal election is the rule of the dispensation of effectual grace,
      to call and collect an assembly of first-born unto God.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. In Jesus Christ believers are delivered from all discouraging dread
      and terror in the consideration of God as a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Such is the pre-eminence of the gospel state above that of the law,
      that whereas they of old were severely forbidden to make any approach unto
      the outward signs of the presence of God, we have now an access with
      boldness unto his throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. As the greatest misery of unbelievers is to be brought into the
      presence of this Judge, so it is one of the greatest privileges of
      believers that they may come unto him.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. Believers have an access to God, as the judge of all, with all their
      causes and complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. However dangerous and dreadful the outward state of the church may be
      at any time in the world, it may secure itself of final success; because
      therein God is judge alone, unto whom they have free access.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. The prospect of an eternal reward from God as the righteous judge is
      the greatest support of faith in all present distresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. A prospect by faith into the state of the souls of believers departed
      is both a comfort against the fears of death, and a support under all the
      troubles and distresses of this present life.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. This is the blessedness and safety of the catholic church, that it is
      taken into such a covenant, and hath an interest in such a mediator of it,
      as are able to save it unto the utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. The true notion of faith for life and salvation, is a coming unto
      Jesus as the mediator of the new testament,
    </p>
    <p>
      24. It is the wisdom of faith to make use of this mediator continually, in
      all wherein we have to do with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      25. The glory, the safety, the pre-eminence of the state of believers
      under the gospel consists in this, that they come therein to Jesus the
      mediator of the new covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      26. The miserable, woful condition of poor convinced sinners under the
      law, and obnoxious unto the curse thereof, is here set before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      27. The blessed state of believers is also represented unto us herein, and
      that not only in their deliverance from the law, but also in the glorious
      privileges which they obtain by the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      28. We have here a representation of the glory, beauty, and order of the
      invisible world, of the new creation, of the spiritual catholic church.
