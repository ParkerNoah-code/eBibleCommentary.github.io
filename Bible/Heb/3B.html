      Ver 11.
      <em
        >Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for under it
        the people have received the law), what further need was there for
        another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be
        called after the order of Aaron?</em

    <h2>
      Ver 12.
      <em
        >For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made
        also in the law.
      </em>
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 13.
      <em
        >For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from
        which no one has officiated at the altar.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 14.
      <em
        >For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which
        tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</em

    <h2>
      Ver 15-16.
      <em
        >This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of
        Melchizedek there arises another priest, who has been made, not after
        the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless
        life;</em

    <h2>
      Ver 17.

        of Melchizedek.”</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 18-19.
      <em
        >For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its
        weakness and uselessness (for the law made nothing perfect), and a
        bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</em
