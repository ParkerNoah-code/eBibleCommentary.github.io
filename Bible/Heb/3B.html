    <h2>

    <p>
      1. An interest in the gospel consisteth not in an outward profession of
      it, but in a real participation of those things wherein the perfection of
      its state doth consist.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The pre-eminence of the gospel state above the legal is spiritual and
      indiscernible unto a carnal eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. To look for glory in evangelical worship from outward ceremonies and
      carnal ordinances, is to prefer the Levitical priesthood before that of
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Put all advantages and privileges whatever together, and they will
      bring nothing to perfection without Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 12.
      <em
        >For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made
        also in the law.
      </em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Notwithstanding the great and many provocations of them by whom the
      priesthood was exercised, yet God took it not away until it had
      accomplished the end whereto it was designed.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The efficacy of all ordinances or institutions of worship depends on
      the will of God alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Divine institutions cease not without an express divine abrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. God will never abrogate or take away an institution or ordinance of
      worship, unto the loss or disadvantage of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. God in his wisdom so ordered all things, that the taking away of the
      priesthood of the law gave it its greatest glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. How it is a fruit of the manifold wisdom of God that it was a great
      mercy to give the law, and a greater to take it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. If under the law the whole worship of God did so depend on the
      priesthood, that that failing or being taken away, the whole worship of
      itself was to cease, as being no more acceptable before God; how much more
      is all worship under the new testament rejected by him, if there be not a
      due regard therein unto the Lord Christ, as the only high priest of the
      church, and to the efficacy of his discharge of that office.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It is the highest vanity to pretend use or continuance in the church
      from possession or prescription, or pretended benefit, beauty, order, or
      advantage, when once the mind of God is declared against it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 13.
      <em
        >For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from
        which no one has officiated at the altar.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is our duty, in studying the Scripture, to inquire diligently after
      the things which are spoken concerning Jesus Christ, and what is taught of
      him in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. All men’s rights, duties, and privileges, in sacred things, are fixed
      and limited by divine institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Seeing Christ himself had no right to minister at the material altar,
      the re-introduction of such altars is inconsistent with the perpetual
      continuance of his priesthood.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 14.
      <em
        >For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which
        tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It pleaseth God to give sufficient evidence unto the accomplishment of
      his promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Divine regulation gives bounds, postively and negatively, unto the
      worship of god.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 15-17.
      <em
        >This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of
        Melchizedek there arises another priest, who has been made, not after
        the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless
        life; for it is testified, “You are a priest forever, according to the
        order of Melchizedek.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. Present truths are earnestly to be pleaded and contended for.</p>
    <p>2. Important truths should be strongly confirmed.</p>
    <p>
      3. Arguments that are equally true may yet, on the account of evidence,
      not be equally cogent.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. In the confirmation of the truth we may use ever help that is true and
      seasonable, though some of them may be more effectual unto our end than
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. What seemed to be wanting unto Christ, in his entrance into any of his
      offices, or in the discharge of them, was on the account of a greater
      glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The eternal continuance of Christ’s person gives eternal continuance
      and efficacy into his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. To make new priests in the church, is virtually to renounce the faith
      of his living for ever as our priest, or to suppose that he is not
      sufficient to the discharge of his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The alteration that God made in the church, by the introduction of the
      priesthood of Christ, was progressive towards its perfection.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 18-19.
      <em
        >For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its
        weakness and uselessness (for the law made nothing perfect), and a
        bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is a matter of the highest nature and importance, to set up, take
      away, or remove any thing from or change any thing in the worship of god.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The revelation of the will of God, in things relating unto his worship,
      is very difficultly received where the minds of men are prepossessed with
      prejudices and traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The only securing principle, in all things of this nature, is to
      preserve our souls in an entire subjection unto the authority of Christ,
      and unto his alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The introduction into the church of what is better and more full of
      grace, in the same kind with what went before, doth disannul what so
      preceded; but the bringing in of that which is not better, which doth not
      communicate more grace, doth not do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. If God would disannul every thing that was weak and unprofitable in his
      service, though originally of his own appointment, because it did not
      exhibit the grace he intended, he will much more condemn any thing of the
      same kind that is invented by men.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is in vain for any man to look for that from the law, now it is
      abolished, which it could not effect in its best estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. When God hath designed any gracious end towards the church, it shall
      not fail nor his work cease for want of effectual means to accomplish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Believers of old, who lived under the law, did not live upon the law,
      but upon the hope of Christ, or Christ hoped for.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The Lord Christ, by his priesthood and sacrifice, makes the church
      perfect, and all things belonging thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Out of Christ, or without him, all mankind are at an inconceivable
      distance from God.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. It is an effect of infinite condescension and grace, that God would
      appoint a way of recovery for those who had willfully cast themselves into
      this woeful distance from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. All our approximation unto God in any kind, all our approaches unto
      him in holy worship, are by him alone who was the blessed hope of the
      saints under the old testament, and is the life of them under the new.
