      1. Diligent attendance unto the word of the gospel is indispensably
      necessary unto perseverance in the profession of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. There are sundry times and seasons wherein, and several ways and means
      whereby, men are in danger to lose the word that they have heard, if they
      attend not diligently unto its preservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The word heard is not lost without the great sin as well as the
      inevitable ruins of the souls of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is the nature of the word of the gospel to water barren hearts, and
      to make them fruitful unto God.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The consideration of the revelation of the gospel by the Son of God is
      a powerful motive unto diligent attendance unto it.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The true and only way of honoring the Lord Christ as the Son of God, is
      by diligent attendance and obedience unto his word.
    </p>

        escape if we neglect so great a salvation—which at the first having been

        also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works

    <p>
      1. Motives unto a due valuation of the gospel, and perseverance in the
      profession of it, taken from the penalties annexed unto the neglect of it,
      are evangelical, and of singular use in the preaching of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. All punishments annexed unto the transgression either of the law or
      gospel are effects of God’s vindictive justice, and consequently just and
      equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Every concern of the law and gospel, both as to their nature and
      promulgation, is to be weighed and considered by believers, to beget in
      their hearts a right and due valuation of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. What means soever God is pleased to use in the revelation of his will,
      he gives it a certainty, steadfastness, assurance, and evidence, which our
      faith may rest in, and which cannot be neglected without the greatest sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Every transaction between God and man is always confirmed and ratified
      by promises and threatenings, rewards, and punishments: “Every trespass.”
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The most glorious administrators of the law do stoop to look into the
      mysteries of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>7. Covenant transgressions are attended with unavoidable penalties.</p>
    <p>8. The gospel is a word of salvation to them that do believe.</p>
    <p>9. The salvation tendered in the gospel is great salvation.</p>
    <p>
      10. Men are apt to entertain thoughts of escaping the wrath of God, though
      they live in a neglect of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The neglecters of the gospel shall unavoidably perish under the wrath
      of God.

      <em>Commentary on Hebrews</em></a
    >.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 1</h2>
  <p>
    Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have
    heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, or, on this account, viz, the consideration of the surpassing
    dignity of the Son of God, by whom God had spoken in these last days.
  </p>
  <p>
    We ought to give the more earnest heed.— Here we are taught that our regard
    to what is spoken, ought to be in proportion to the dignity and authority of
    the speaker. Now, if attention is to be given to the Gospel in proportion to
    the dignity of its author, who is no less a personage than the Son of God,
    with what solemn reverence ought we to listen to His words! They are not
    only to be at first received, but to be kept in memory. The persons
    addressed had already received the Gospel, but they were to continue in
    faith and obedience to the end of their lives. Matthew 24:13.
  </p>
  <p>
    To the things which we have heard.—Believers ought diligently to attend to
    whatever the Lord Jesus has said in His Word. The Gospel itself is the great
    truth, the belief of which is salvation, however great men&#x27;s ignorance
    in other respects may be; yet nothing which God has said is to be
    overlooked, but everything is to be attended to as far as it is understood.
    All things said by Jesus are not of equal importance, but all things are
    important, and to be received and obeyed at every hazard and every loss. The
    consideration that the Lord forgives the ignorance of his people ought never
    to be alleged in justification of inattention to whatever he hath spoken, or
    of the neglect of the least of his commandments. It may also be observed
    that we are to give heed to the things that we have heard, that Acts 7:53,
    and the Apostle describes the law as being ordained of angels. Galatians
    3:19. We are, however, expressly taught that God spake the Ten Commandments.
    Exodus 20:1. This may be explained by the11th verse of Malachi 3:1. This is
    evidently descriptive of Christ. Again, it is said my name is in Him, Exodus
    23:21, and under the guidance of this angel Moses had no scruple to proceed.
    But when the Lord said he would send an angel to drive out the nations, and
    to give them the land, but that He would not go in the midst of them, Moses
    objected. He was not satisfied with being under the protection of a created
    angel, and requested, that if God&#x27;s presence went not with them, he
    would not command them to pursue their journey. Exodus 33:15. The angel who
    had hitherto conducted Israel is frequently called Jehovah; He is the angel
    of God&#x27;s presence. Isaiah 63:9. Thus, He who was afterwards manifest in
    the flesh ruled that dispensation in the character of an angel; but this was
    only for a season, and to this the prophet refers,—&quot;O the hope of
    Israel, the Savior thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a
    stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for
    a night?&quot; Jeremiah 14:8.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apostle had previously established the infinite superiority of the Son
    of God to angels, and hence he argues the inferiority of the Law to the
    Gospel,—the Law having been promulgated by God in the temporary character of
    an angel, implying the temporary nature of the dispensation; the Gospel by
    the Son of God who abideth for ever, and who has said, &quot;Heaven and
    earth shall pass away, but my Word shall not pass away.&quot; Matthew 24:35.
  </p>
  <p>
    Was steadfast.—Many prophets were raised up in Israel, but no alteration of
    the law was permitted. Malachi 4:4.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every transgression and disobedience.—The words are nearly synonymous when
    used together, transgression implies the doing of what is forbidden, and
    disobedience the omission of what is required. This exactly corresponds with
    the injunction neither to add to, nor diminish, what Moses had commanded.
    Deuteronomy 12:32.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just recompense of reward.—The punishment justly awarded according to the
    offence. It would be unjust not to visit transgression with merited
    punishment.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 3</h2>
  <p>
    How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first
    began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard
    him?
  </p>
  <p>
    How shall we escape.—This implies that there is no possibility of escaping
    the wrath of God revealed from heaven against sin. Men may deceive
    themselves by hopes founded on false views of the mercy of God; but the door
    of mercy is for ever shut against all transgressors who do not avail
    themselves of the only remedy provided by God through the death of His Son.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we neglect so great salvation.—The Apostle includes himself and his
    fellow-believers, because it was as true of them as of others. Had they
    neglected the great salvation there would not have been any way of escape
    for them. Believers are secured by having been chosen in, and given to
    Christ, and, consequently, they are secured from neglecting the great
    salvation; for He who has begun a good work in them, has engaged to perform
    it until the day of Jesus Christ. Philippians 1:6.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a wonderful proof of the wisdom of God that, in the salvation of
    sinners, He has given a more awful manifestation of the exceeding sinfulness
    of sin than in the destruction of the rebel angels. So far from sin
    appearing less pernicious by an unlimited pardon being proclaimed to the
    chief of sinners by faith in Christ, its malignity is more fully displayed.
    It was God&#x27;s eternal purpose to pluck a multitude of our fallen race,
    which no man should be able to number, as brands from the burning, and His
    purpose could only be effected by the incarnation, sufferings, and death of
    His only- begotten and well-beloved Son. If there was no other channel
    through which mercy could flow to sinners of mankind, how could any who
    neglected so great salvation possibly escape?
  </p>
  <p>
    The salvation here spoken of is deliverance from the love and power of sin,
    hence the Son of God was named Jesus. Matthew 1:21. It is great in every
    point of view, whether we consider the ruin and misery from which it
    delivers us, the means by which the deliverance was accomplished, or the
    glory into which those who receive it are introduced. On the other hand, he
    that believeth not the record that God gave of His 1 John 5:10.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some openly reject the Gospel, accounting it a cunningly-devised fable;
    others, although they do not openly reject it, are so much occupied with the
    things of time and sense as altogether to neglect it. All men neglect the
    great salvation who do not consider it as the one thing needful. All men
    neglect it who do not receive it. All men neglect it who are not influenced
    by it, for it effectually works in them that believe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps, in speaking of the great salvation, the Apostle refers to the
    deliverance of Israel from the iron furnace. In bringing them out of Egypt,
    God gave a glorious display of his power and goodness. This, however, was
    only a temporal salvation, but the salvation announced in the Gospel is
    eternal. It is deliverance from the bondage of Satan, and, consequently,
    from the wrath to come—from that lake of fire, where there is weeping, and
    wailing, and gnashing of teeth. It translates the lost and ruined sinner
    into the kingdom of God&#x27;s dear Son. It restores him to the image of God
    in which he was created. So long as God&#x27;s Word abode in the heart of
    Adam, he stood firm in that estate of holiness and happiness in which he was
    created; but Satan gained admission into his heart in the form of a lie, and
    thus was man changed into the image of him who was a liar from the
    beginning. But the believer is created anew in Christ; by receiving the love
    of the truth he is saved; Christ, who is the truth, takes possession of his
    heart, and he is thus delivered from the power of darkness and translated
    into the kingdom of God&#x27;s dear Son; and, after having fellowship with
    Christ in His death and resurrection, shall sit with Him for ever on His
    throne. Such is the great salvation, and how shall the sinner who neglects
    it escape?
  </p>
  <p>
    Began to be spoken by the Lord.—The great salvation began to be spoken by
    the Lord. The title, &quot; The Lord,&quot; belongs to Jesus as fully as to
    the Father. He is Lord of heaven and earth, the Lord of life and glory. The
    great salvation had been announced to our first parents, and intimated by
    all the prophets by types, and figures, and shadows; but the full and clear
    declaration of it was made by the Lord during his personal ministry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Confirmed unto us by them that heard him.— That John 15:27. They had
    attended Him during His public ministry, they went about with Him and heard
    all His discourses. When he spoke in parables, He explained them in private
    to the Apostles. But after all, their views were dark, they still expected a
    worldly kingdom,—that He would restore the kingdom to Israel, and raise it
    to additional splendour, and that He should sit on the throne of His Father
    David. Even after His resurrection they still fondly adhered to this notion.
    They were therefore, after all the advantages they had enjoyed, not
    qualified to preach the Gospel. John 15:26-27. In this and the preceding
    verse we see his promise fulfilled, in verse3we have the testimony of the
    Apostles, and here we have the testimony of the Spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Signs—are evidences of Divine interposition, and may, or may not, be beyond
    the course of nature;
  </p>
  <p>Wonders—things that excite wonder, prodigies;</p>
  <p>
    Diverse miracles—a variety of miraculous attestations to the truth of the
    Gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gifts of the Holy Ghost.—Rather distributions or divisions. The word
    employed here does not signify gifts, but that the powers conferred by the
    Holy Spirit were variously divided,—to some, one power; to others, another.
    1 Corinthians 12:28-30.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to his own will.—In the distribution of these powers, or gifts,
    God acted as a sovereign. Miraculous gifts, are termed the manifestation of
    the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 12:7. The Spirit dwells in every believer, but
    they do not all possess what is termed the manifestation of the Spirit.
    &quot;But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit
    withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the
    word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit;
    to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working
    of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to
    another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
    but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every
    man severally as he will.&quot; 1 Corinthians 12:7-11. These gifts were
    bestowed, not according to the will of Galatians 1:4, from which Christ came
    to deliver His people. The first, the earthly or natural Adam, was at the
    head of the first world. The second, the heavenly and spiritual Adam, is at
    the head of the new world, which God foretells by the prophet as a new
    creation. &quot;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
    former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.&quot; Isaiah 65:17. God
    made the worlds, both the present and that which is to come, by His Son.
    Hebrews 1:2. We have seen that the old dispensation was subjected to the
    angel of the covenant; but He rules the new dispensation, in the character
    of the Son of God, God manifest in the flesh. The great object of the
    epistle is the development of the glory of the new dispensation, and he
    begins by giving the most conclusive proof of the superiority of its Author
    to the angels of God. We enter the first world by birth; we are introduced
    to the second by being born again. Adam, the head of the old creation, was
    of the earth earthy; Christ, the head of the new, is the Lord from heaven.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whereof we speak.—The Apostle&#x27;s object was to speak of the things
    belonging to the world to come, the new creation.
