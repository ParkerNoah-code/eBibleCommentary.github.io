        heard, lest perhaps we drift away.</em

    <h2>
      Ver 2.

        transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,</em

    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvationâ€”which at the
        first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those
        who heard,</em

        works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own
        will?</em
