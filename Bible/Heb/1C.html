      Ver 1.

      since Christ by whom God hath spoken to us in these last days, is greaty
      superior both in nature and office to all his former messengers, and even
      to the angels themselves, by whom the law was delivered; for this reason,
      we ought more abundantly to attend to the things which we have heard,
      namely, the doctrines of the gospel which had been first published among
      the Jews by our Lord and his apostle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Lest perhaps we drift away</em>. These flow away from us, if we do not
      give earnest attention to them, so as to retain them in our memory, our
      belief and affections, without which they will soon lose all their
      influence upon us. Matters do not generally come to this issue all at once
      with backsliding professors. The words intimate a gradual and
      imperceptible progress towards apostacy, even as water oozes from a leaky
      vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the three following verses he enforces the exhortation to give the more
      earnest heed to the gospel, from its excellency above the legal economy,
      in respect of the dignity of its publisher, the salvation which it
      reveals, the evidence by which it is confirmed, and consequently the
      severer punishment which will be inflicted on those who neglect it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em
        >For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every
        transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation—which at the
        first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those
        who heard,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em
        >God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various
        works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own
        will?</em

      1. Diligent attendance unto the word of the gospel is indispensably
      necessary unto perseverance in the profession of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. There are sundry times and seasons wherein, and several ways and means
      whereby, men are in danger to lose the word that they have heard, if they
      attend not diligently unto its preservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The word heard is not lost without the great sin as well as the
      inevitable ruins of the souls of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is the nature of the word of the gospel to water barren hearts, and
      to make them fruitful unto God.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The consideration of the revelation of the gospel by the Son of God is
      a powerful motive unto diligent attendance unto it.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The true and only way of honoring the Lord Christ as the Son of God, is
      by diligent attendance and obedience unto his word.

      Ver 2-4.
      <em
        >For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every
        transgression and disobedience received a just penalty, how will we
        escape if we neglect so great a salvation—which at the first having been
        spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard, God
        also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works
        of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own
        will?</em

      1. Motives unto a due valuation of the gospel, and perseverance in the
      profession of it, taken from the penalties annexed unto the neglect of it,
      are evangelical, and of singular use in the preaching of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. All punishments annexed unto the transgression either of the law or
      gospel are effects of God’s vindictive justice, and consequently just and
      equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Every concern of the law and gospel, both as to their nature and
      promulgation, is to be weighed and considered by believers, to beget in
      their hearts a right and due valuation of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. What means soever God is pleased to use in the revelation of his will,
      he gives it a certainty, steadfastness, assurance, and evidence, which our
      faith may rest in, and which cannot be neglected without the greatest sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Every transaction between God and man is always confirmed and ratified
      by promises and threatenings, rewards, and punishments: “Every trespass.”
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The most glorious administrators of the law do stoop to look into the
      mysteries of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>7. Covenant transgressions are attended with unavoidable penalties.</p>
    <p>8. The gospel is a word of salvation to them that do believe.</p>
    <p>9. The salvation tendered in the gospel is great salvation.</p>
    <p>
      10. Men are apt to entertain thoughts of escaping the wrath of God, though
      they live in a neglect of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The neglecters of the gospel shall unavoidably perish under the wrath
      of God.
