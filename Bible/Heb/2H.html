    <h2>H. Apostacy: Crucifying Him Again (6:4-8)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 4-6.
      <em
        >For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the
        heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and tasted
        the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then fell

    <p>
      1. It is a great mercy, a great privilege, to be enlightened with the
      doctrine of the gospel, by the effectual working of the Holy Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is such a privilege as may be lost, and end in the aggravation of
      the sin and condemnation of those who were made partakers of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Where there is a total neglect of the due improvement of this privilege
      and mercy, the condition of such persons is hazardous, as inclining
      towards apostasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. All the gifts of God under the gospel are peculiarly heavenly, Jn 3:12;
      Eph 1:3.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Holy Ghost, for the revelation of the mysteries of the gospel, and
      the institution of the ordinances of spiritual worship, is the great gift
      of God under the new testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. There is a goodness and excellency in this heavenly gift, which may be
      tasted or experienced in some measure by such as never receive him in his
      life, power, and efficacy. 7. A rejection of the gospel, its truth and
      worship, after some experience had of their worth and excellency, is a
      high aggravation of sin, and a certain presage of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The Holy Ghost is present with many as to powerful operations, with
      whom he is not present as to gracious inhabitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. There is a goodness and excellency in the word of God, able to attract
      and affect the minds of men, who yet never arrive at sincere obedience to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. There is an especial goodness in the word of the promise concerning
      Jesus Christ, and the declaration of its accomplishment.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it and
        produces a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled,
        receives blessing from God;</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The minds of all men by nature are universally and equally barren with
      respect to fruits of righteousness and holiness, meet for and acceptable
      unto God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The dispensation of the word of the gospel unto men is an effect of the
      sovereign power and pleasure of God, as is the giving of rain unto the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. God so ordereth things in his sovereign, unsearchable providence, that
      the gospel shall be sent unto, and in the administration of it shall find
      admittance into what places, and at what times, seem good unto himself,
      even as he orders the rain to fall on one place, and not on another.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is the duty of those unto whom the dispensation of the word is
      committed of God, to be diligent, watchful, instant in their work, that
      their doctrine may, as it were, continually drop and distil upon their
      hearers, that the rain may fall often on the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Attendance unto the word preached, hearing of it with some diligence,
      and giving of it some kind of reception, make no great difference among
      men; for this is common unto them who never become fruitful.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. God is pleased to exercise much patience towards those to whom he once
      grants the mercy and the privilege of his word.
    </p>
    <p>7. Where God grants means, there he expects fruit.</p>
    <p>
      8. Duties of gospel obedience are fruits meet for God, things that have a
      proper and especial tendency unto his glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Wherever there are any sincere fruits of faith and obedience found in
      the hearts and lives of professors, God graciously accepts and blesseth
      them.
    </p>

      Ver 8.
      <em
        >but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being

      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Whilst the gospel is preached unto men, they are under their great
      trial for eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Barrenness under the dispensation of the gospel is always accompanied
      with an increase of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Ordinarily God proceeds to the rejection and destruction of barren
      professors by degrees, although they are seldom sensible of it until they
      fall irrecoverably into ruin.
