  <h2>Verse 4</h2>
  <p>
    For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of
    the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,....
  </p>
  <p>
    It appears from this and other parts of the Epistle that there had been a
    great apostasy among the Hebrews who had professed the faith of Christ, but
    had returned to Judaism, and their case was so hopeless that the Apostle
    would not occupy time by addressing himself to them. They are described as
    having been once enlightened. When the Lord divides the hearers of the
    Gospel into four classes, one class is represented as receiving the word
    with joy, but having no root, and therefore only enduring for a time. The
    same persons are describedâ€”&quot;For if after they have escaped the
    pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
    Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the latter end is
    worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to
    have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn
    from the holy commandment delivered unto them.&quot; 2 Peter 2:20-21. See
    also Hebrews 10:26-27. Whence it appears that a great external reformation
    may be produced by the Gospel, and the feelings of the hearers may be
    greatly excited while they are destitute of saving faith. This is the gift
    of God, and the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. Romans
    11:29.
  </p>
  <p>
    There may, however, be a temporary impression made by the Gospel, whence
    some are described as believing for a time, Luke 8:13; which is explained in
    next clause, and have been made partakers of the Holy Ghost. This refers to
    the miraculous gifts conferred by the laying on of the Apostle&#x27;s hands.
    Men thus receiving the Holy Ghost did not imply that they were truly
    converted. Hence our Lord says: &quot; Many will say to me in that day,
    Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast
    out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?&quot; Matthew 7:22.
    And the Apostle supposes the case of men possessing a faith by which they
    might remove mountains, 1 Corinthians 13:2, while destitute of love, and
    therefore ignorant of God. 1 John 4:8.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 5</h2>
  <p>
    And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tasted the good word of God, felt somewhat of its sweetness: &quot;How sweet
    are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!&quot;
    Psalm 119:103. &quot;More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much
    fine gold: sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.&quot; Psalm 19:10.
    &quot;Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the
    joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of
    Hosts.&quot; Jeremiah 15:16. The persons referred to have tasted somewhat of
    this excellence and the power of the world to come. What is rendered the
    Everlasting Father is in the LXX. the Father of the age to come, and we read
    of the world to come, that is the Gospel dispensation. Heb. ii5. Now the
    power of the world to come means the diversity of miraculous gifts under the
    new dispensation, referred to by the Apostle. 1 Corinthians 12:4; 1
    Corinthians 12:10. We are unable accurately to distinguish these, because we
    do not possess miraculous gifts; but there are the powers conferred under
    the Gospel dispensation. What is rendered in our version working of
    miracles, 1 Corinthians 12:29, is working of powers. Again in Matthew
    7:22-23, wonderful works, is in the original, powers.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 6</h2>
  <p>
    If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they
    crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no if in the original; it is &quot; and having fallen away;&quot;
    for it is coupled with the preceding participles, enlightened, tasted, made
    partakers of, after all had fallen away. [This does not imply that the
    people of God shall ever fall away. We have already seen that the gifts and
    calling of God are without repentance; indeed this must be the case, because
    believers were chosen in and given to Christ. Ephesians 1:4; John 17:6; and
    shall never perish. John 10:28-29. Where God begins a good work he will
    carry it on till the day of Christ; but believers as well as others require
    cautions and warnings, and it is not improbable that there may be here an
    intentional obscurity in regard to the feelings excited by the truth as it
    is in Jesus, which is intended to serve as a beacon against any tendency to
    backslide from God. Our comfort ought not to be derived from our past
    feelings or fancied acquirements, but from the habitual contemplation of
    Christ as our Savior. We can only enjoy the assurance of hope by the
    contemplation of the glory of the sacrifice of Christ, and the absolute
    freeness of the great salvation. Let the apparent genuineness of our
    Christian experience be what it may, we can only have proof of our being
    living members of Christ by abiding in him and holding fast the truth.]
    While this is a solemn warning to him who thinketh he standeth, to take heed
    lest he fall, 1 Corinthians 10:12, it throws no doubt upon the perseverance
    of the saints, although we can only know that such is our character by
    holding fast the truth. It is evident from this and many other passages that
    men&#x27;s natural feelings may be much excited, and such a change in their
    habits and sentiments produced as may strikingly resemble the fruits of the
    Spirit, while they are imposing on themselves and others.
  </p>
  <p>
    But it may be asked, why is it impossible to renew such persons again to
    repentance? It is not impossible for God thus to renew them, for with Him
    all things are possible. The impossibility appears to be the same as for a
    rich man to enter the kingdom of God. &quot; It is easier,&quot; says the
    Lord, &quot;for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich
    man to enter the kingdom,&quot; and adds, &quot;with man it is impossible,
    but not with God; for with God all things are possible.&quot; However, their
    case was Matthew 1:19. They, as it were, set their seal to all the insults
    and injuries which were heaped on Jesus, and that after the fullest evidence
    had been given of his divine character and mission, not only by his
    resurrection but by the outpouring of the Spirit, of whose miraculous gifts
    they had been made partakers. Acts 2:33. We find a parallel passage in
    chap10:26 , 29 , where apostates are represented as treading under foot the
    Son of God, and counting the blood of the covenant wherewith he was
    sanctified [&quot;Sanctified&quot; may either apply to Christ, who says,
    &quot;For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they may be sanctified through
    the truth.&quot; He was set apart, like the paschal lamb, that his people
    might be set apart through the truth; or it may refer to the apostate, for
    the Scripture often speaks of them as they appear, for instance Simon Magus
    is said to have believed.] an unholy thing; and, having done despite to the
    Spirit of Grace, by rejecting the testimony he bore to Jesus. These passages
    confirm the observation already made that many of the Hebrews who had
    professed the truth had returned to Judaism; and the Apostle wrote this
    Epistle with a view of putting a stop to the apostasy by teaching the
    Hebrews the nature of the Mosaic law, by the misunderstanding of which they
    had been misled, and showing them that it was a temporary dispensation, a
    shadow of good things to come.
  </p>
  <h2>Verse 7</h2>
  <p>
    For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and
    bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing
    from God.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Scriptures both of the Old and New Testament frequently illustrate
    spiritual by temporal things, and not uncommonly by a reference to the
    operations of husbandry. See John 15:1-2. Here we are taught that the
    fertility of the earth proceeds from the blessing of God, Genesis 1:11;
    Genesis 27:27; Psalm 65:9; Psalm 65:11. This does not, however, preclude the
    labours of the husbandman, which is essential to the production of the
    fruits of the earth, Genesis 3:19; but all man&#x27;s labour is vain without
    the blessing of God, Psalm 127:1, to which alone we are taught to look for
    success. When he crowns the year with his goodness, causing the grass to
    grow for the cattle and herb for the service of Isaiah 5:1-2, but it
    produced wild grapes, on which account the Lord declared his intention of
    laying it waste, so that it should only produce thorns and briers. We have
    another illustration of this passage in the prophecies of Ezekiel. He
    describes the waters which flowed from the threshold of the house, which
    gradually augmented. The water was at first to the ankles, then to the
    knees, afterwards to the loins, and then a river which could not be passed
    over. In these waters there were exceeding many fishes, and fishermen
    spreading their nets: &quot;And it shall come to pass, that every thing that
    liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and
    there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall
    come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither
    the river cometh. And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand
    upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; they shall be a place to spread
    forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the
    great sea, exceeding many. But the miry places thereof and the marishes
    thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.&quot; Ezekiel
    47:9-11. Ezekiel&#x27;s vision of the temple is very obscure, but it is
    evident that the waters issuing from the house of God denote the Gospel, and
    the fishers the Apostles and those who succeeded them as preachers of the
    Gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every thing lived whither the waters came, but the miry places and the
    marshes thereof were not healed: &quot;They shall be given to salt,&quot;
    ver11.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Gospel is not only the savour of life unto life, but of death unto
    death, and of such it will prove to apostates of whom the Apostle treats. To
    such we may apply the words of the prophet respecting Jerusalem: &quot;In
    thy filthiness is lewdness; because I have purged thee, and thou wast not
    purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have
    caused my fury to rest upon thee.&quot; Ezekiel 24:13; and again, &quot;But
    my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. So I
    gave them up unto their own hearts&#x27; lust: and they walked in their own
    counsels.&quot; Psalm 81:11-12.
