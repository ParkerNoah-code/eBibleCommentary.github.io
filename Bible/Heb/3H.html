    <h2>
      Ver 15.
      <em
        >For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has
        occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the
        first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise
        of the eternal inheritance.</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 16.
      <em
        >For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the
        death of him who made it.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 17.
      <em
        >For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in
        force while he who made it lives.</em
      >
    </h2>

    <h2>
      Ver 18.

    <h2>
      Ver 19.
      <em
        >For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people
        according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats,
        with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book
        itself and all the people,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 20.
      <em

        you.”</em

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>
      Ver 21.

        same way with the blood.</em

    <h2>
      Ver 22.

        >According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and
        apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.</em
