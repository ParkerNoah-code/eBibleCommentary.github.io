    <h2>H. Covenant: Established by Death (9:15-22)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 15.
      <em
        >For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has
        occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the
        first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise

    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is an act of mere sovereign grace in God, to provide such a blessed
      inheritance for any of them who had sinfully cast away what they were
      before intrusted withal.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. All our interest in the gospel inheritance depends on our receiving the
      promise by faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The conveyance and actual communication of the eternal inheritance by
      promise, to be received by faith alone, tends exceedingly unto the
      exaltation of the glory of God, and the security of the salvation of them
      that do believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Effectual vocation is the only way of entrance into the eternal
      inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Though God will give grace and glory unto his elect, yet he will do it
      in such a way as wherein and whereby he may be glorified also himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Such is the malignant nature of sin, of all transgression of the law,
      that unless it be removed, unless it be taken out of the way, no person
      can enjoy the promise of the eternal inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It was the work of God alone to contrive, and it was the effect of
      infinite wisdom and grace to provide, a way for the removal of sin, that
      it might not be an everlasting obstacle against the communication of an
      eternal inheritance unto them that are called.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. A new testament providing an eternal inheritance in sovereign grace;
      the constitution of a mediator, such a mediator, for that testament, in
      infinite wisdom and love; the death of that testator for the redemption of
      transgressions, to fulfill the law and satisfy the justice of God; with
      the communication of that inheritance by promise, to be received by faith
      in all them that are called, are the substance of the mystery of the
      gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The efficacy of the mediation and death of Christ extending itself to
      all the called under the old testament, is an evident demonstration of his
      divine nature, his pre-existence to all these things, and the eternal
      covenant between the Father and him about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The first covenant did only forbid and condemn transgressions;
      redemption from them is by the new testament alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The glory and efficacy of the new covenant, and the assurance of the
      communication of an eternal inheritance by virtue of it, depend hereon,
      that it was made a testament by the death of the mediator, which is
      further proved in the following verses.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 16-17.
      <em
        >For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the
        death of him who made it. For a will is in force where there has been
        death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is a great and gracious condescension in the Holy Spirit to give
      encouragement and confirmation unto our faith, by a representation of the
      truth and reality of spiritual things in those which are temporal, and
      agreeing with them in their general nature, whereby they are represented
      unto the common understandings of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. There is an irrevocable grant of the whole inheritance of grace and
      glory made unto the elect in the new covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. As the grant of these things is free and absolute, so the enjoyment of
      them is secured from all interveniences by the death of the testator.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 18.
      <em
        >Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without
        blood.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The foundation of a church-state among any people, wherein God is to be
      honored in ordinances of instituted worship, is laid in a solemn covenant
      between him and them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Approbation of the terms of the covenant, consent unto them, and solemn
      acceptance of them, are required on our part unto the establishment of any
      covenant between God and us, and our participation of the benefits of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It was the way of God from the beginning, to take children of
      covenanters into the same covenant with their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is by the authority of God alone that any thing can be effectually
      and unchangeably dedicated unto sacred use, so as to have force and
      efficacy given unto it thereby.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 19.
      <em
        >For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people
        according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats,
        with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book
        itself and all the people,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There can be no covenant between God and men, but in the hand or by
      virtue of a mediator.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. A mediator may be either only an internuncius, a messenger, a day’s-
      man, or also a surety and an undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. None can interpose between God and a people in any sacred office,
      unless he be called of God and approved of the people, as was Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. A covenant that consisted in mere precepts, without an exhibition of
      spiritual strength to enable unto obedience, could never save sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. In all our dealings with God, respect must be had unto every one of his
      precepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The first eminent use of the writing of the book of the law, that is,
      of any part of the Scripture (for this book was the first that was
      written), was that it might be read unto the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. This book was both written and read in the language which the people
      understood and commonly spake.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. God never required the observance of any rites or duties of worship
      without a previous warrant from his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The writing of this book was an eminent privilege, now first granted
      unto the church, leading unto a more perfect and stable condition than
      formerly it had enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The blood of the covenant will not benefit or advantage us, without an
      especial and particular application of it unto our own souls and
      consciences.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 20.
      <em
        >saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded
        you.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      The condescension of God in making a covenant with men, especially in the
      ways of the confirmation of it, is a blessed object of all holy
      admiration.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 21-22.
      <em
        >He sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the
        same way with the blood. According to the law, nearly everything is
        cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no
        remission.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. In all things wherein we have to do with God, whereby we approach unto
      him, it is the blood of Christ, and the application of it unto our
      consciences, that gives us a gracious acceptance with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Even holy things and institutions, that are in themselves clean and
      unpolluted, are relatively defiled, by the unholiness of them that use
      them.
    </p>
    <p>3. There was a great variety of legal purifications.</p>
    <p>
      4. This variety argues that in ourselves we are ready to be polluted on
      all occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. This variety of institutions was a great part of the bondage state of
      the church under the old testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The great mystery wherein God instructed the church from the foundation
      of the world, especially by and under legal institutions, was that all
      purging of sin was to be by blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. This is the great demonstration of the demerit of sin, and of the
      holiness, righteousness, and grace of God.
