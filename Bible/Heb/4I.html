    <h2>I. Faith: Exodus to Promised Land (11:23-31)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 23.
      <em
        >By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his
        parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they were
        not afraid of the king’s commandment.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Where there is an agreement between husband and wife in faith and the
      fear of the Lord, it makes way unto a blessed success in all their duties;
      when it is otherwise, nothing succeeds unto their comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. When difficult duties befall persons in that relation, it is their
      wisdom each to apply themselves unto that part and share of it which they
      are best suited for.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. This is the height of persecution, when private houses are searched by
      bloody officers to execute tyrannical laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is well when any thing of eminence in our children doth so engage
      our affections unto them as to make them useful and subservient unto
      diligence in disposing of them unto the glory of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The rage of men and the faith of the church shall work out the
      accomplishment of God’s counsels and promises unto his glory, from under
      all perplexities and difficulties that may arise in opposition unto it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 24.
      <em
        >By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of
        Pharaoh’s daughter,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Whatever be the privileges of any, whatever be their work or office, it
      is by faith alone that they must live to God, and obtain acceptance with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is good to fill up every age and season with the duties which are
      proper thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is a blessed thing to have the principles of true religion fixed in
      the minds of children, and their affections engaged to them, before they
      are exposed to temptations, from learning, wisdom, wealth, or preferment.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The token of God’s covenant received in infancy, being duly considered,
      is the most effectual means to preserve persons in the profession of true
      religion against apostasy by outward temptations.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The work of faith in all ages of the church, as to its nature,
      efficacy, and the method of its actings, is uniform and the same.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 25.
      <em
        >choosing rather to share ill treatment with God’s people than to enjoy
        the pleasures of sin for a time,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Let no man be offended at the low, mean, persecuted condition of the
      church at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The sovereign wisdom of God, in disposing the outward state and
      condition of his people in this world, is to be submitted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is certain there is somewhat contained in this title and privilege
      of being “the people of God” that is infinitely above all outward things
      that may be enjoyed in this world, and which doth inexpressibly outbalance
      all the evils that are in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The church, in all its distresses, is ten thousand times more honorable
      than any other society of men in the world; they are “the people of God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      5. In a time of great temptations, especially from furious persecutors, a
      sedate consideration of the true nature of all things wherein we are
      concerned, and their circumstances on every hand, is necessary, to enable
      us unto a fight choice of our lot and a due performance of our duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. No profession will endure the trial in a time of persecution but such
      as proceeds from a determinate choice of adhering unto Christ and the
      gospel, with a refusal and rejection of whatever stands in competition
      with them, on a due consideration of the respective natures and ends of
      the things proposed unto us on the one hand and on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Moses chose to be afflicted with the people of God, and so must every
      one do who will be of them unto his advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Men fearfully delude themselves in the choice they make about
      profession in times of persecution.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 26.
      <em
        >considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of
        Egypt; for he looked to the reward.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Reproach hath, in all ages, from the beginning of the world, attended
      Christ and all the sincere professors of faith in him; which in God’s
      esteem is upon his account.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Let the things of this world be increased and multiplied into the
      greatest measures and degrees imaginable, it alters not their kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There is an all-satisfactory fullness in spiritual things, even when
      the enjoyment of them is under reproach and persecution, unto all the true
      ends of the blessedness of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Such signal exemplifications of the nature and efficacy of faith in
      others, especially when victorious against mighty oppositions, as they
      were in Moses, are high encouragements unto us unto the like exercise of
      it in the like circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is our duty, in the whole course of our faith and obedience, to have
      respect unto the future recompense of reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is faith only that can carry us through the difficulties, trials,
      and persecutions which we may be called unto for the sake and name of
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Faith in exercise will carry us safely and securely through all the
      trials which we have to undergo for Christ and the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>8. Faith is highly rational in all its acts of obedience towards God.</p>
    <h2>
      Ver 27.
      <em
        >By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he
        endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. In all duties, especially such as are attended with great difficulties
      and dangers, it is the wisdom of believers to take care, not only that the
      works
    </p>
    <p>
      of them be good in themselves, but that they have a just and due call to
      their performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Even the wrath of the greatest kings is to be disregarded if it lie
      against our duty towards God.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There is a heroic frame of mind and spiritual fortitude required to the
      due discharge of our callings in times of danger, which faith in exercise
      will produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. There is nothing insuperable to faith, while it can keep a clear view
      of the power of God and his faithfulness in his promises.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 28.
      <em
        >By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, that the
        destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. There is always an especial exercise of faith required unto the due
      observance of a sacramental ordinance.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Whatever is not sprinkled with the blood of Christ, the Lamb of God,
      who was slain and sacrificed for us, is exposed unto destruction from the
      anger and displeasure of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It is the blood of Christ alone which gives us security from him that
      hath the power of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. God hath always instruments in readiness to execute the severest of his
      judgments on sinners in their greatest security.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Such is the great power and activity of these fiery ministering
      spirits, as that, in the shortest space of time imaginable, they can
      execute the judgments of God on whole nations as well and as easily as on
      private persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Unless we are sprinkled with the blood of Christ, our paschal Lamb, no
      other privilege can secure us from eternal destruction.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 29.
      <em
        >By faith they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the
        Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Where God engageth his word and promise, there is nothing so difficult,
      nothing so remote from the rational apprehensions of men, but he may
      righteously require our faith and trust in him therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Faith will find a way through a sea of difficulties under the call of
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There is no trial, no difficulty, that the church can be called unto,
      but that there are examples on record of the power of faith in working out
      its deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. God knows how to secure impenitent sinners unto their appointed
      destruction, by giving them up unto hardness of heart and an obstinate
      continuance in their sins against all warnings and means of repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. God doth not give up any in a judiciary way unto sin, but it is a
      punishment for preceding sins, and as a means to bring on them total ruin
      and destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Let us not wonder that we see men in the world obstinate in foolish
      counsels and undertakings, tending unto their own inevitable ruin, seeing
      probably they are under judiciary hardness from God.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. There is no such blinding, hardening lust in the minds or hearts of
      men, as hatred of the people of God and desire of their ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. When the oppressors of the church are nearest unto their ruin, they
      commonly rage most, and are most obstinate in their bloody persecutions.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 30.
      <em
        >By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled
        for seven days.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Faith will embrace and make use of means divinely prescribed, though it
      be not able to discern the effective influence of them unto the end aimed
      at.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Faith will cast down walls and strong towers that lie in the way of the
      work of God.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 31.
      <em
        >By faith Rahab the prostitute didn’t perish with those who were
        disobedient, having received the spies in peace.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Although unbelief be not the only destroying sin (for the wages of
      every sin is death, and many are accompanied with peculiar provocations),
      yet it is the only sin which makes eternal destruction inevitable and
      remediless.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Where there are means granted of the revelation of God and his will, it
      is unbelief that is the greatest and most provoking sin, and from whence
      God is glorified in his severest judgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Where this revelation of the mind and will of God is most open, full,
      and evident, and the means of it are most express and suited unto the
      communication of the knowledge of it, there is the highest aggravation of
      unbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Every thing which God designs as an ordinance to bring men unto
      repentance ought to be diligently attended to and complied withal, seeing
      the neglect of it or of the call of God therein shall be severely
      revenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is in the nature of true, real, saving faith immediately, or at its
      first opportunity, to declare and protest itself in confession before men.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Separation from the cause and interest of the world is required in all
      believers, and will accompany true faith wherever it is.
