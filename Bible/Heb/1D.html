  <p>Verse 6</p>
  <p>
    But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is Acts 13:33-35; but all
    Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and the Lord establishes its
    authority by so frequently referring to it during His personal ministry. He
    divides it into three parts—the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalm. To the
    Jews were committed the lively oracles; and, amidst all their wickedness,
    they have been faithful to this trust, and have preserved the Scriptures as
    delivered to them by the prophets. On this subject they have been very
    cautious; and, although they have adopted many false interpretations, they
    have never trifled with the purity of the sacred books.
  </p>
  <p>
    Testified, saying, What is Genesis 1:26; but the question is decided by the
    Apostle&#x27;s application of it to the Lord Jesus, showing that it contains
    a prophetic intimation of the universal dominion of the Son of man. At the
    same time it holds true, in a measure, of the authority bestowed on man over
    the creatures as a type of the unlimited power of Jesus. One testimony from
    the Scriptures is amply sufficient for the establishment of any truth; but,
    by comparing one passage with another referring to the same subject, we have
    a confirmation of the interpretation just given. Now, in 1 Corinthians
    15:27, Ephesians 1:22, Matthew 21:16, where the eighth Psalm is applied to
    Christ, we have a confirmation of the true application of the Psalm.
    Compared with the magnitude and glory of creation, man appears very
    insignificant; but this evidently refers to man in his fallen state. Man was
    made in the image of God, and the world which contains all within his reach
    was subjected to him; but now man is altogether vanity, he is cut down as a
    flower. All flesh is grass; man is of few days, and full of trouble, and in
    this state he is viewed by the Psalmist.
  </p>
  <p>
    That thou art mindful of him.—Considering the glorious majesty of God, how
    could it be expected that God should be mindful of him?
  </p>
  <p>
    Son of man.—This is not applicable to Adam, he was a man but had no father;
    he was created of the dust by God.
  </p>
  <p>Visitest him.—God condescended to visit Genesis 9:2.</p>
  <p>
    For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not
    put under him.— We have seen that the words quoted by the Apostle, in a
    limited and modified degree, hold true even of fallen man; but the Apostle
    takes them in their full extent, without any modification. But now we see
    not yet all things put under him.—Not unfrequently the word all must be
    understood with limitation; but the Apostle teaches us that the word all, in
    the eighth Philippians 2:5-11. Christ drank of the brook in the way,
    therefore He lifted up His head. He is seated at the right hand of God, till
    all His enemies be made His footstool. Psalm 110:1 : At the same time it is
    true that our translators have followed the order of the words in the
    original; but, although the Greek may admit of this inverted order, it is
    evident that Christ was made for a little while lower than the angels by His
    incarnation and that, in consequence of His voluntary humiliation, He is
    crowned with glory and honor.
  </p>
  <p>
    That he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.—Here we are
    taught the object of the death of Christ. A multitude whom no man shall be
    able to number were chosen in, and given to Christ. They came under the
    curse of the broken law, and by the grace of God He laid down His life for
    them, that He might redeem them from death, might ransom them from the power
    of the grave, and swallow up death in victory. Adam was the source or
    fountain of their natural life, but it was dried up, the streams,
    consequently, all failed; but Jesus said, &quot;Lo, I come to do thy will, O
    God.&quot; Hebrews 10:9. &quot;By the which will we are sanctified through
    the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&quot; Chap10:10.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having risen from the dead to die no more, He is to all His people the
    fountain of eternal life; because I live, ye shall live also.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the grace of God.—The gift of Christ to die for His people was an act of
    pure grace; but if 1 Corinthians 4:5. God deals to every man the measure of
    faith. Romans 12:3. The blind Luke 16:16. In the passage before us, the
    context proves that the general expression must be limited to those to whom
    Christ stands in the relation of the Captain of their salvation. Ver10.
  </p>
  <p>
    He tasted death for every one of the &quot; many sons&quot; whom He brings
    to glory. Here the expression imports that Christ died for each of His
    people; he died for them (as Israel is to be gathered) &quot;one by
    one.&quot; [See the author&#x27;s &quot;Doctrine of the Atonement.&quot;
    Second edition. Pages276-277] He tasted death for every one of the
    sanctified. Ver11. For every one of his brethren, ver11 , 12; for every one
    of the Church, for which He gave Himself, Ephesians 5:23. Hebrews 2:12. For
    every one of the children whom God gave unto Him. Ver13. For every one of
    the seed of Abraham. &quot;And if ye be Christ&#x27;s, then are ye
    Abraham&#x27;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.&quot; Galatians
    3:29. So far from dying for all, Christ will say to many, &quot;I never knew
    you.&quot; He prays for the men whom His Father had given Him out of the
    world, while He expressly states He prays not for the world, John 17:6-9. In
    point of fact, the greater part of mankind have never heard of a Savior, and
    are not only living without God, but without hope in the world. If Christ
    died for all, no man is saved by His death. But perhaps it is said, that
    they are saved by faith in His death. Still, faith is the gift of God,
    which, like every other gift, is imparted to sinners through the atonement
    by which God&#x27;s righteousness in the remission of sins is manifested.
  </p>
  <p>
    If salvation be purely of grace, no difficulty is got rid of by holding that
    Christ died for all. Besides, if the atonement of Christ was not made
    exclusively for the elect and saved, but for all, even for those who are
    lost, the unity of the Godhead is denied. If Christ died for all, and the
    Spirit effectually reveals the truth only to some, where is the unity of
    operation between Christ and the Holy Spirit?
