      This is the great privilege of the church of the gospel, that, in the
      things of the worship of God, it is made subject unto and immediately
      depends upon the Lord Jesus Christ, and not any other, angels or men.
    </p>
    <p>1. That the Lord Christ is our head.</p>
    <p>2. That he is our only head.</p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6-9.
      <em
        >But one has somewhere testified, saying, “What is man, that you think

        lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor. You have
        put all things in subjection under his feet.” For in that he subjected
        all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now
        we don’t yet see all things subjected to him. But we see him who has
        been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the
        suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of
        God he should taste of death for everyone.</em

      The consideration of the infinitely glorious excellencies of the nature of
      God, manifesting themselves in his works, doth greatly set out his
      condescension and grace in his regard and respect to mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The respect, care, love, and grace of God unto mankind, expressed in
      the person and mediation of Jesus Christ, is a matter of singular and
      eternal admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That such was the inconceivable love of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
      unto the souls of men, that he was free and willing to condescend unto any
      condition for their good and salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The blessed issue of the abasement of Jesus Christ, in his exaltation
      unto glory and honor, is an assured pledge of the final glory and
      blessedness of all that believe in him, whatever difficulties and dangers
      they may be exercised withal in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Jesus Christ, as the mediator of the new covenant, hath absolute and
      supreme authority given unto him over all the works of God in heaven and
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Lord Jesus Christ is the only Lord of the gospel state of the
      church, called under the old testament “The world to come.”
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The Lord Jesus Christ in his death did undergo the penal sentence of
      the law, in the room and stead of them for whom he died.
