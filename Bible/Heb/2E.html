      1. That great opposition is, and always will be, made unto the permanency
      of believers in their profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is our duty, in the midst of all oppositions, to hold our profession
      firm and steadfast unto the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Believers have great encouragement unto and assistance in the constancy
      of their profession, by and from the priesthood of Jesus Christ.

      The church of God hath a standing, perpetual advantage, in the union of
      our nature to the person of the Son of God, as he is our high priest.

      1. There is, there will be a season, many a season, in the course of our
      profession or walking before God, wherein we do or shall stand in need of
      especial aid and assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That there is with God in Christ, God on his throne of grace, a spring
      of suitable and seasonable help for all times and occasions of difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. All help, succor, or spiritual assistance in our straits and
      difficulties, proceeds from mere mercy and grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. When we have, through Christ, obtained mercy for our persons, we need
      not fear but that we shall have suitable and seasonable help for our
      duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The way to obtain help from God, is by a due gospel application of our
      souls for it to the throne of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Great discouragements are used to interpose themselves in our minds and
      against their faith, when we stand in need of especial help from God, and
      would make an application unto him for relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Faith’s consideration of the interposition of Christ in our behalf, as
      our high priest, is the only way to remove discouragements, and to give us
      boldness in our access unto God.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. That in all our approaches unto God, we are to consider him as on a
      throne.
