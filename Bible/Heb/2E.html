  <h2>Verse 14-15</h2>
  <p>
    V:14-15.—Seeing then that we have a great High Priest, that is passed into
    the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we
    have not an High Priest which cannot he touched with the feeling of our
    infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
  </p>
  <p>
    For we have not a High Priest who cannot he touched with or cannot
    sympathize with our infirmities; for, having assumed our nature, He was in
    all things tempted like as we are, yet without sin. The Lord Jesus was truly
    a man, born of a woman, and consequently had all the feelings of a man; but
    these were under such entire subjection to the will of God, that He had no
    sin, but was entirely conformed to the will of God. In every situation He
    did the things which pleased His heavenly Father.
  </p>
  <p>
    He suffered, being tempted, for instance, when He was hungry; the devil
    tempted Him to change the stones into bread. His hunger prompted him to
    comply; but, while His Father had given Him power to accomplish many mighty
    works, in proof of His having come forth from God, had He employed that
    power for the supply of His own wants, it would have interfered with the
    example which He has left us of confidence in God, being assured that He
    will withhold from us no good thing. We cannot imitate the signs and wonders
    which He wrought.
  </p>
  <p>
    These were peculiar to Himself, and to those upon whom He thought fit to
    bestow them, for the confirmation of the word of the truth of the Gospel;
    but He was in all things conformed to His brethren, so that He hath afforded
    us a perfect pattern for our conduct during our pilgrimage; and, had He not
    in all things been made like unto His brethren, this could not have been the
    case. In all things, therefore, &quot;it behooved Him to be made like unto
    His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things
    pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in
    that He Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succor them that
    are tempted.&quot; Chap, 18. Christ&#x27;s entire submission to His
    Father&#x27;s will, and not pleasing Himself, may be represented as
    inconsistent with His supreme divinity; but on the contrary it was His
    Divinity that enabled the man Christ Jesus thus to glorify His Father. He
    thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but, having taken on Him the
    form of a servant, He was in all things obedient to the will of His Father.
    It was His meat and His drink to do His will; and at last, in obedience to
    the commandment which He had received, He laid down His life and took it
    again.
  </p>
  <p>
    A sin-offering must be perfect to be accepted; and He offered Himself
    without spot or blemish; and although He had no sin, yet was He made sin for
    His people, that they might be made the righteousness of God in Him; that,
    having by His blameless life and meritorious death, as the Head and Surety
    of His people, atoned for their sins, and brought in everlasting
    righteousness, that righteousness might belong to all the seed of the woman,
    with whom He took part in flesh and blood.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus God&#x27;s eternal purpose was accomplished by His own Son manifest in
    the flesh. The Son of God made His soul an offering for the sins of an
    unnumbered multitude, who were chosen in and given to Him by His Father; and
    thus grace reigned through righteousness unto eternal life, by Christ Jesus.
    Had His people broken the holy law? He obeyed it in all its extent, and
    endured its penalty. Had they come under the curse? He redeemed them by
    being made a curse for them, and opened a new and living way for their
    entering into life through His obedience unto death.
