      18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother
      Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
      child of the Holy Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word or two sufficed to describe the birth of all the kings whose names
      we have read, but for our Lord Jesus Christ there is much more to be said.
      The evangelist girds himself up for his solemn duty and writes, “Now the
      birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise.” It is a deep, mysterious, and
      delicate subject, fitter for reverent faith than for speculative
      curiosity. The Holy Ghost wrought in the chosen virgin the body of our
      Lord. There was no other way of His being born, for had He been of a
      sinful father, how should He have possessed a sinless nature? He is born
      of a woman, that He might be human, but not by man that He might not be
      sinful. See how the Holy Ghost co-operates in the work of our redemption
      by preparing the body of our Lord!

      19. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her
      a public example, was minded to put her away privily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was espoused to him and he was saddened and perplexed when he learned
      that she would become a mother before they had been actually married. Many
      would have thrust her away in indignation and put her to an open shame,
      but Joseph was of royal mind as well as royal race. He would not expose
      what he thought to be the sin of his espoused wife—although he felt that
      she must be put away, he would do it quietly. When we have to do a severe
      thing, let us choose the tenderest manner. May be, we shall not have to do
      it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord
      appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not
      to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of
      the Holy Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not but feel very anxious and no doubt he prayed about these
      things both day and night. God would not leave the honor of the chosen
      virgin-mother without protection. Soon Joseph had the best of guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      From heaven, he had the assurance that Mary had not sinned, but had been
      favored of the Lord. Joseph is reminded of his royal rank, “thou son of
      David,” and is bidden to cast away his fear. How he must have been
      comforted by the Lord’s “fear not”! He was to take Mary under his tender
      care and be a foster-father to the Son who would be born of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary must have been in great anxiety herself as to whether her story of
      angelic visitation would be believed, for it looked improbable enough. We
      doubt not that faith sustained her, but she needed much of it. Every great
      favor brings a great trial with it as its shadow and becomes thus a new
      test of faith. The Lord very graciously removed all suspicion from
      Joseph’s mind and thus provided for the honor of the mother and for the
      comfort of the holy child. If Jesus is born in our hearts, we shall have
      trouble, but the Lord will witness that Christ is ours and He will surely
      bear us through.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:
      for he shall save his people from their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord of glory is born the Son of man and is named by God’s command,
      and by man’s mouth, JESUS the Savior. He is what He is called.
    </p>
    <p>
      HE saves us from the punishment and the guilt of sin and then from the ill
      effect and evil power of sin. This He does for “his people,” even for all
      who believe in Him. It is His nature to do this, as we see in the fact
      that His very name is JESUS— Savior. We still call Him by that name, for
      He still saves us in these latter days. Let us go and tell out His name
      among men, for He will save others.
    </p>
    <p>
      22, 23. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
      of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child,
      and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name EMMANUEL, which
      being interpreted, God with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who would have thought that the prophecy contained in Isaiah 7:14 could
      have referred to our Lord? One of these days, we shall discover a great
      deal more in the inspired Word than we can see today. Perhaps it is
      needful to our understanding a prophecy that we should see it actually
      fulfilled. What blind eyes we have!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is pleasant to mark that, according to this verse and the twenty-first,
      EMMANUEL and JESUS mean the same thing. “God with us” is our Savior. He is
      with us as God on purpose to save us. The incarnation of Jesus is our
      salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cheer Joseph and decide his mind, Holy Scripture is brought to his
      remembrance and truly, when we are in a dilemma, nothing gives us such
      confidence in going forward as the sacred oracles impressed upon the
      heart. How conversant was Joseph with the prophets to have their words
      before him in a dream! Lord, whether I read Thy Word when awake or have it
      brought to my memory in my sleep, it is always precious to me! But Thou,
      Lord Jesus, God with us, art dearer still and the written Word is chiefly
      precious because it speaks of Thee, the incarnate Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      24, 25. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord
      had bidden him, and took unto him a wife: and knew her not till she had
      brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph was not disobedient to the heavenly vision in any respect. He did
      not delay, but as soon as he rose he “did as the angel of the Lord had
      bidden him.” Without delay, demur, or reservation, he obeyed. What holy
      awe filled his heart as he welcomed the favored virgin to his home, to be
      respectfully and affectionately screened from all evil! What must he have
      thought when he saw the Son of the Highest lying on the bosom of her whom
      he had espoused! He was happy to render any service to the newborn King.
      Since he accepted Mary as his espoused wife, her child was the heir of
      Joseph and so of David, and thus was by right the King of the Jews. Our
      Lord Jesus had a birthright by His mother, but His right on the father’s
      side was, by Joseph’s act and deed, also put beyond dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us leave this wonderful passage worshipping the Son of God, who
      condescended to be born the Son of man. Thus our God became our brother,
      bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh. The nearer He comes to us, the
      more humbly let us adore Him. The more true the kinship of our King, the
      more enthusiastically let us crown Him Lord of all!
