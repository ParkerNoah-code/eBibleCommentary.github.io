    <h2>Audience, Occasion, and Background</h2>
    <p>
      There were some who, through ambitious motives, wished to be elevated to
      the rank of pastors, and who, because Titus did not comply with their
      wicked desires, spoke unfavorably of him to many persons. On the other
      hand, there were Jews who, under the presence of supporting the Mosaic
      law, introduced a great number of trifles; and such persons were listened
      to with eagerness and with much acceptance. Paul therefore writes with
      this design, to arm Titus with his authority, that he may be able to bear
      so great a burden; for undoubtedly there were some who fearlessly despised
      him as being but one of the ordinary rank of pastors. It is also possible
      that complaints about him were in circulation, to the effect that he
      assumed more authority than belonged to him when he did not admit pastors
      till he had made trial and ascertained their fitness.

    <p>
      Hence we may infer, that this was not so much a private epistle of Paul to
      Titus, as it was a public epistle to the Cretans. It is not probable that
      Titus is blamed for having with too great indulgence raised unworthy
      persons to the office of bishop, or that, as an ignorant man and a novice,
      he is told what is that kind of doctrine in which he ought to instruct the
      people; but because due honor was not rendered to him, Paul clothes him
      with his own authority, both in ordaining ministers and in the whole
      government of the Church. Because there were many who foolishly desired to
      have another form of doctrine than that which he delivered, Paul approves
      of this alone -- rejecting all others -- and exhorts him to proceed as he
      had begun.

    <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
    <p>
      First, then, he shows what sort of persons ought to be chosen for being
      ministers. Among other qualifications, he requires that a minister shall
      be well instructed in sound doctrine, that by means of it he may resist
      adversaries. Here he takes occasion to censure some vices of the Cretans,
      but especially rebukes the Jews, who made some kind of holiness to consist
      in a distinction of food, and in other outward ceremonies. In order to
      refute their fooleries, he contrasts with them the true exercises of piety
      and Christian life; and, with the view of pressing them more closely, he
      describes what are the duties which belong to every one in his calling.
      These duties he enjoins Titus diligently and constantly to inculcate. On
      the other hand, he admonishes others not to be weary of hearing them, and
      shows that this is the design of time redemption and salvation obtained
      through Christ. If any obstinate person oppose, or refuse to obey, he bids
      him set that person aside. We now see that Paul has no other object in
      view than to support the cause of Titus, and to stretch out the hand to
      assist him in performing the work of the Lord.
