    <h2>Audience, Occasion, and Background</h2>
    <p>
      There were some who, through ambitious motives, wished to be elevated to
      the rank of pastors, and who, because Titus did not comply with their
      wicked desires, spoke unfavorably of him to many persons. On the other
      hand, there were Jews who, under the presence of supporting the Mosaic
      law, introduced a great number of trifles; and such persons were listened
      to with eagerness and with much acceptance. Paul therefore writes with
      this design, to arm Titus with his authority, that he may be able to bear
      so great a burden; for undoubtedly there were some who fearlessly despised
      him as being but one of the ordinary rank of pastors. It is also possible
      that complaints about him were in circulation, to the effect that he
      assumed more authority than belonged to him when he did not admit pastors
      till he had made trial and ascertained their fitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence we may infer, that this was not so much a private epistle of Paul to
      Titus, as it was a public epistle to the Cretans. It is not probable that
      Titus is blamed for having with too great indulgence raised unworthy
      persons to the office of bishop, or that, as an ignorant man and a novice,
      he is told what is that kind of doctrine in which he ought to instruct the
      people; but because due honor was not rendered to him, Paul clothes him
      with his own authority, both in ordaining ministers and in the whole
      government of the Church. Because there were many who foolishly desired to
      have another form of doctrine than that which he delivered, Paul approves
      of this alone -- rejecting all others -- and exhorts him to proceed as he
      had begun.
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
    <p>
      First, then, he shows what sort of persons ought to be chosen for being
      ministers. Among other qualifications, he requires that a minister shall
      be well instructed in sound doctrine, that by means of it he may resist
      adversaries. Here he takes occasion to censure some vices of the Cretans,
      but especially rebukes the Jews, who made some kind of holiness to consist
      in a distinction of food, and in other outward ceremonies. In order to
      refute their fooleries, he contrasts with them the true exercises of piety
      and Christian life; and, with the view of pressing them more closely, he
      describes what are the duties which belong to every one in his calling.
      These duties he enjoins Titus diligently and constantly to inculcate. On
      the other hand, he admonishes others not to be weary of hearing them, and
      shows that this is the design of time redemption and salvation obtained
      through Christ. If any obstinate person oppose, or refuse to obey, he bids
      him set that person aside. We now see that Paul has no other object in
      view than to support the cause of Titus, and to stretch out the hand to
      assist him in performing the work of the Lord.

      1.1-4. Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to
      the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth which is
      according to godliness, in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie,
      promised before time began; but in his own time revealed his word in the
      message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our
      Savior, to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy,
      and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.5-9. I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order
      the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I
      directed you— if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having
      children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior. For
      the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not
      easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest
      gain; but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy,
      self-controlled, holding to the faithful word which is according to the
      teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to
      convict those who contradict him.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.10-16. For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers,
      especially those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped: men
      who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for
      dishonest gain’s sake. One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans
      are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.” This testimony is true.
      For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
      not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn
      away from the truth. To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who
      are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and
      their conscience are defiled. They profess that they know God, but by
      their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for
      any good work.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.1-5. But say the things which fit sound doctrine, that older men should
      be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in
      perseverance, and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not
      slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good, that
      they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their
      children, to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in
      subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.6-8. Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded. In all things
      show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity,
      seriousness, incorruptibility, and soundness of speech that can’t be
      condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to
      say about us.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.9-14. Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be
      well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, not stealing, but showing
      all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in
      all things. For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all
      men, instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly
      lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age;
      looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God
      and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us
      from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own possession,
      zealous for good works.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.15. Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no
      one despise you.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.1-7. Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be
      obedient, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, not to
      be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men. For we
      were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and
      pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But
      when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,
      not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his
      mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the
      Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our
      Savior; that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs
      according to the hope of eternal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.8-11. This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that
      you insist confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful
      to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men; but
      shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the
      law; for they are unprofitable and vain. Avoid a factious man after a
      first and second warning, knowing that such a one is perverted and sinful,
      being self-condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.12-14. When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to
      me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. Send Zenas the
      lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking
      for them. Let our people also learn to maintain good works to meet
      necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.15. All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith.
    </p>
    <p>Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
