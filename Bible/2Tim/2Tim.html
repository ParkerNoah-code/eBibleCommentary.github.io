  <h2>Canonical Acceptance</h2>
  <p>
    The canonicity of this Epistle has never been questioned by the Church; and
    the testimony to its early and general use is in no way deficient. There are
    quite clear traces of its language in Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Polycarp,
    Justin Martyr, The Acts of Paul and Thecla, and Theophilus of Antioch. The
    letter is included in all the MSS., the old Versions and the Lists of the
    Pauline Epistles. The Muratorian Fragment names it as a production of Paul,
    and from the end of the second century it is quoted by name.
  </p>
  <h2>Significance</h2>
  <p>
    The Epistle has some permanent doctrinal value as containing the most
    important proof-passage for the inspiration of Scripture, 3:16, and also
    abiding historical significance in that it contains the clearest Scriptural
    testimony to the life of Paul after his first Roman imprisonment. Its main
    interest is one of character, and two portraits emerge from it. We have (1)
    the portrait of the ideal Christian minister, busily engaged in the work of
    his Master, confessing His Name, proclaiming His truth, shepherding His
    fold, defending his heritage, and battling with the powers of evil; and (2)
    the portrait of the Christian minister, with his work done, facing death. He
    acquiesces gladly in the present, but his eyes are turned mainly to the past
    or to the future. He is thankful for the work he was permitted to do, and
    serenely awaits the day of his crowning.
