    <h2>Canonical Acceptance</h2>
    <p>
      The canonicity of this Epistle has never been questioned by the Church;
      and the testimony to its early and general use is in no way deficient.
      There are quite clear traces of its language in Clement of Rome, Ignatius,
      Polycarp, Justin Martyr, The Acts of Paul and Thecla, and Theophilus of
      Antioch. The letter is included in all the MSS., the old Versions and the
      Lists of the Pauline Epistles. The Muratorian Fragment names it as a
      production of Paul, and from the end of the second century it is quoted by
      name.
    </p>
    <h2>Significance</h2>
    <p>
      The Epistle has some permanent doctrinal value as containing the most
      important proof-passage for the inspiration of Scripture, 3:16, and also
      abiding historical significance in that it contains the clearest
      Scriptural testimony to the life of Paul after his first Roman
      imprisonment. Its main interest is one of character, and two portraits
      emerge from it. We have (1) the portrait of the ideal Christian minister,
      busily engaged in the work of his Master, confessing His Name, proclaiming
      His truth, shepherding His fold, defending his heritage, and battling with
      the powers of evil; and (2) the portrait of the Christian minister, with
      his work done, facing death. He acquiesces gladly in the present, but his
      eyes are turned mainly to the past or to the future. He is thankful for
      the work he was permitted to do, and serenely awaits the day of his
      crowning.

    <p>
      1.1-2. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according
      to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, to Timothy, my
      beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ
      Jesus our Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.3-5. I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure
      conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and
      day longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with
      joy; having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived
      first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded,
      in you also.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.6-12a. For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of
      God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God didn’t give
      us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. Therefore don’t
      be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but
      endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, who saved
      us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but
      according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ
      Jesus before times eternal, but has now been revealed by the appearing of
      our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and
      immortality to light through the Good News. For this I was appointed as a
      preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. For this cause I also
      suffer these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.12b. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am
      persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him
      against that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.13-14. Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in
      faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was
      committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.15-18. This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of
      whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. May the Lord grant mercy to the house of
      Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,
      but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me (the Lord
      grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things
      he served at Ephesus, you know very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.1-7. You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in
      Christ Jesus. The things which you have heard from me among many
      witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to
      teach others also. You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of
      Christ Jesus. No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life,
      that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. Also, if anyone
      competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the
      rules. The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the
      crops. Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.8-13. Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring of
      David, according to my Good News, in which I suffer hardship to the point
      of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained. Therefore I endure
      all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the
      salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. This saying is
      trustworthy:
    </p>
    <p>
      “For if we died with him,
      <br />
      <span class="tab"></span>we will also live with him.
      <br />
      If we endure,
      <br />
      <span class="tab"></span>we will also reign with him.
      <br />
      If we deny him,
      <br />
      <span class="tab"></span>he also will deny us.
      <br />
      If we are faithless,
      <br />
      <span class="tab"></span>he remains faithful;
      <br />
      <span class="tab"></span>for he can’t deny himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      2.14. Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord
      that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those
      who hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.15-19. Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who
      doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. But shun
      empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, and those words will
      consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: men who have
      erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past,
      and overthrowing the faith of some. However, God’s firm foundation stands,
      having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one
      who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      2.20-21. Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of
      silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor and some for
      dishonor. If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a
      vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared
      for every good work.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.22-26. Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love,
      and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. But refuse
      foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. The
      Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach,
      patient, in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may
      give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, and they
      may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive
      by him to do his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.1-9. But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come. For
      men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant,
      blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural
      affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not
      lovers of good, traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather
      than lovers of God, holding a form of godliness but having denied its
      power. Turn away from these, also. For some of these are people who creep
      into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led
      away by various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the
      knowledge of the truth. Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these
      also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are
      rejected. But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be
      evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.10-17. But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience,
      love, steadfastness, persecutions, and sufferings—those things that
      happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those
      persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. Yes, and all who
      desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. But evil men
      and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. But
      you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of,
      knowing from whom you have learned them. From infancy, you have known the
      holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through
      faith which is in Christ Jesus. Every Scripture is God-breathed and
      profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction
      in righteousness, that each person who belongs to God may be complete,
      thoroughly equipped for every good work.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.1-5. I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
      will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:
      preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke,
      and exhort with all patience and teaching. For the time will come when
      they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will
      heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts, and will turn away
      their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables. But you be sober in
      all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill
      your ministry.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.6-8. For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has
      come. I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have
      kept the faith. From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for
      me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and
      not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.9-15. Be diligent to come to me soon, for Demas left me, having loved
      this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and
      Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you,
      for he is useful to me for service. But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. Bring
      the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come—and the books,
      especially the parchments. Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me.
      The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. Beware of him, for he
      greatly opposed our words.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.16-18. At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May
      it not be held against them. But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me,
      that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the
      Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. And
      the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his
      heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.19-21. Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. Erastus
      remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. Be diligent to
      come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and
      all the brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.22. The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
