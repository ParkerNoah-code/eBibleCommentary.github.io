  <h1>Exodus</h1>
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>
    In the Hebrew Bible, this book is known as "Shemot" (שְׁמוֹת), which means
    "Names." This title is derived from the opening words of the book: "These
    are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob" (Exodus
    1:1). This naming convention, where a book is titled after its opening
    words, is common in the Hebrew Bible.
  </p>
  <p>
    The English title "Exodus" comes from the Greek Septuagint (LXX), where it
    is called "Exodos" (Ἔξοδος), meaning "exit" or "departure." This title aptly
    describes the central event of the book: the departure of the Israelites
    from Egypt. The Latin Vulgate retained this Greek title, from which we get
    our English name for the book.
  </p>
  <p>
    The title "Exodus" is significant as it encapsulates the primary narrative
    thrust of the book - the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery
    and their journey towards the Promised Land. This exodus event becomes a
    defining moment in Israel's history, frequently referred to throughout the
    rest of the Bible as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness to His
    covenant promises.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's worth noting that while the Hebrew title focuses on the continuity with
    Genesis (by referring to the names of Jacob's sons), the Greek/English title
    emphasizes the new chapter in Israel's history that this book represents.
    Both aspects - continuity and new beginnings - are crucial themes in Exodus.
  </p>

  <h2>Authorship</h2>
  <p>
    The traditional view, held by both Jewish and Christian traditions for many
    centuries, attributes the authorship of Exodus (along with the rest of the
    Pentateuch) to Moses. This view is based on several factors:
  </p>
  <h3>Internal Evidence</h3>
  <p>Several passages in Exodus explicitly mention Moses writing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Exodus 17:14 - "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Write this on a scroll as
      something to be remembered...'"
    </li>
    <li>Exodus 24:4 - "Moses then wrote down everything the Lord had said."</li>
    <li>
      Exodus 34:27 - "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Write down these words, for
      in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with
      Israel.'"
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Moreover, Moses' central role in the narrative and his unique position as
    mediator between God and Israel lend credence to the idea that he recorded
    these events.
  </p>
  <h3>External Evidence</h3>
  <p>
    Other biblical books attribute the Pentateuch to Moses (e.g., Joshua 1:7-8,
    1 Kings 2:3, 2 Kings 14:6, Ezra 6:18, Nehemiah 13:1, Daniel 9:11-13, Malachi
    4:4). In the New Testament, Jesus and the apostles refer to Moses as the
    author of the Pentateuch (e.g., Mark 12:26, Luke 24:27, John 5:46-47, Romans
    10:5).
  </p>
  <h3>Challenges to Mosaic Authorship</h3>
  <p>
    Since the 19th century, some scholars have challenged Mosaic authorship
    based on several arguments:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Apparent anachronisms (e.g., references to the Philistines in Exodus
      13:17)
    </li>
    <li>Variations in style and vocabulary</li>
    <li>The account of Moses' death in Deuteronomy</li>
    <li>
      The Documentary Hypothesis, which posits multiple sources compiled over
      centuries
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Conservative scholars have responded to these challenges, arguing that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some apparent anachronisms may be later editorial updates</li>
    <li>
      Variations in style can be explained by the different genres within the
      book
    </li>
    <li>
      Moses could have written most of the Pentateuch, with later inspired
      additions (like the account of his death)
    </li>
    <li>
      The unity and coherence of the Pentateuch argue against the fragmentation
      suggested by the Documentary Hypothesis
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While debate continues in academic circles, many conservative scholars
    maintain that Moses was the substantial author of Exodus, possibly with some
    later inspired editorial additions. This view aligns with the book's
    internal claims and the testimony of later Scripture.
