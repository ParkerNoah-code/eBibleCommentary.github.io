    <h2>Recipient</h2>
    <p>
      Timothy, the recipient of this letter, was known for his early piety and
      familiarity with the sacred Scriptures. His mother was Jewish and his
      father was Greek, which is why he wasn't circumcised as a baby. In the
      second letter to Timothy, his mother Eunice and grandmother Lois are
      mentioned as believers, and Timothy's knowledge of Scripture from
      childhood is highlighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apostle Paul encountered Timothy in Lystra, where he had a good
      reputation among the local brethren. Paul chose Timothy as his companion
      for traveling and spreading the Gospel. Knowing that the Jewish audience
      might find it difficult to accept the message from an uncircumcised
      person, Paul circumcised Timothy, adapting to different circumstances to
      connect with various people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, they traveled to different places, with Timothy actively
      involved in preaching, establishing churches, and writing letters. Paul
      sent Timothy on various missions to cities like Corinth, Philippi, and
      Thessalonica. At the time of writing, Paul had left Timothy in Ephesus for
      a period. Although Timothy wasn't the permanent bishop or overseer of the
      Ephesian church, he was entrusted with certain responsibilities and acted
      under Paul's guidance.
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
    <p>
      Timothy's presence in Ephesus aimed to counter emerging errors and
      heresies and uphold the church's discipline. The purpose of this letter
      was to provide Timothy with guidance on his conduct in the church. Paul
      emphasized the importance of Timothy's teaching and behavior, offered
      criteria for selecting bishops and deacons, discussed the care of widows,
      advised on church discipline, and outlined appropriate behavior for
      individuals in various roles within the church.

      Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the commandment of God our
      Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ our hope, to Timothy, my true child in
      faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our
      Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you
      might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine, and not to
      pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes
      rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith. But the goal of this
      command is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith,
      from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned away to vain
      talking, desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand
      neither what they say nor about what they strongly affirm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we know that the law is good if a person uses it lawfully, as knowing
      this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and
      insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane,
      for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for the
      sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for
      perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine,
      according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was
      committed to my trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me
      faithful, appointing me to service, although I used to be a blasphemer, a
      persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy because I did it
      ignorantly in unbelief. The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with
      faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. The saying is faithful and worthy
      of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
      of whom I am chief. However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me
      first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience for an example of those
      who were going to believe in him for eternal life. Now to the King
      eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory
      forever and ever. Amen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I commit this instruction to you, my child Timothy, according to the
      prophecies which were given to you before, that by them you may wage the
      good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience, which some having
      thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith, of whom are Hymenaeus
      and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they might be taught not to
      blaspheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions,
      and givings of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in
      high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness
      and reverence. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
      Savior, who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of
      the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the
      man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at
      the proper time, to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am
      telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith
      and truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands
      without anger and doubting. In the same way, that women also adorn
      themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not with
      braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing, but with good works,
      which is appropriate for women professing godliness. Let a woman learn in
      quietness with full submission. But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor
      to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness. For Adam was
      formed first, then Eve. Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being
      deceived, has fallen into disobedience; but she will be saved through her
      childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a faithful saying: someone who seeks to be an overseer desires a
      good work. The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of
      one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching; not a
      drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome,
      not covetous; one who rules his own house well, having children in
      subjection with all reverence; (for how could someone who doesn’t know how
      to rule his own house take care of God’s assembly?) not a new convert,
      lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.
      Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid
      falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not
      addicted to much wine, not greedy for money, holding the mystery of the
      faith in a pure conscience. Let them also first be tested; then let them
      serve if they are blameless. Their wives in the same way must be reverent,
      not slanderers, temperate, and faithful in all things. Let servants be
      husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. For
      those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing and great
      boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly, but if I wait
      long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God’s house,
      which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the
      truth. Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great:
    </p>
    <p>
      God was revealed in the flesh,
      <br />
      justified in the spirit,
      <br />
      seen by angels,
      <br />
      preached among the nations,
      <br />
      believed on in the world,
      <br />
      and received up in glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from
      the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,
      through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own
      conscience as with a hot iron, forbidding marriage and commanding to
      abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by
      those who believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good,
      and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving. For it
      is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant
      of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith and of the good
      doctrine which you have followed. But refuse profane and old wives’
      fables. Exercise yourself toward godliness. For bodily exercise has some
      value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the
      life which is now and of that which is to come. This saying is faithful
      and worthy of all acceptance. For to this end we both labor and suffer
      reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the
      Savior of all men, especially of those who believe. Command and teach
      these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in
      word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.
      Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching.
      Don’t neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy
      with the laying on of the hands of the elders. Be diligent in these
      things. Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed
      to all. Pay attention to yourself and to your teaching. Continue in these
      things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as
      brothers; the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all
      purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honor widows who are widows indeed. But if any widow has children or
      grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety toward their own family
      and to repay their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
      Now she who is a widow indeed and desolate, has her hope set on God and
      continues in petitions and prayers night and day. But she who gives
      herself to pleasure is dead while she lives. Also command these things,
      that they may be without reproach. But if anyone doesn’t provide for his
      own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith and is
      worse than an unbeliever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the
      wife of one man, being approved by good works, if she has brought up
      children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the
      saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently
      followed every good work.
    </p>
    <p>
      But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ,
      they desire to marry, having condemnation, because they have rejected
      their first pledge. Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from
      house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying
      things which they ought not. I desire therefore that the younger widows
      marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the
      adversary for insulting. For already some have turned away after Satan. If
      any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don’t
      let the assembly be burdened, that it might relieve those who are widows
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially
      those who labor in the word and in teaching. For the Scripture says, “You
      shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.” And, “The laborer
      is worthy of his wages.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t receive an accusation against an elder except at the word of two or
      three witnesses. Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest
      also may be in fear. I command you in the sight of God, and the Lord Jesus
      Christ, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without
      prejudice, doing nothing by partiality. Lay hands hastily on no one. Don’t
      be a participant in other people’s sins. Keep yourself pure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your
      stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some men’s sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also
      follow later. In the same way also there are good works that are obvious,
      and those that are otherwise can’t be hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters
      worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be
      blasphemed. Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them
      because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those
      who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort
      these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anyone teaches a different doctrine and doesn’t consent to sound words,
      the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according
      to godliness, he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with
      arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife,
      insulting, evil suspicions, constant friction of people of corrupt minds
      and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain.
      Withdraw yourself from such.
    </p>
    <p>
      But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into
      the world, and we certainly can’t carry anything out. But having food and
      clothing, we will be content with that. But those who are determined to be
      rich fall into a temptation, a snare, and many foolish and harmful lusts,
      such as drown men in ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root
      of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their
      greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness,
      godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness. Fight the good fight
      of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you
      confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses. I command
      you before God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who
      before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession, that you keep the
      commandment without spot, blameless until the appearing of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, which at the right time he will show, who is the blessed and only
      Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords. He alone has immortality,
      dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see, to
      whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charge those who are rich in this present age that they not be arrogant,
      nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living
      God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy; that they do good,
      that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing
      to share; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the
      time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away from the empty
      chatter and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge, which some
      profess, and thus have wandered from the faith.
    </p>
    <p>Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
