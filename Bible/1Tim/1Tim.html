    <h2>Recipient</h2>
    <p>
      Timothy, the recipient of this letter, was known for his early piety and
      familiarity with the sacred Scriptures. His mother was Jewish and his
      father was Greek, which is why he wasn't circumcised as a baby. In the
      second letter to Timothy, his mother Eunice and grandmother Lois are
      mentioned as believers, and Timothy's knowledge of Scripture from
      childhood is highlighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apostle Paul encountered Timothy in Lystra, where he had a good
      reputation among the local brethren. Paul chose Timothy as his companion
      for traveling and spreading the Gospel. Knowing that the Jewish audience
      might find it difficult to accept the message from an uncircumcised
      person, Paul circumcised Timothy, adapting to different circumstances to
      connect with various people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, they traveled to different places, with Timothy actively
      involved in preaching, establishing churches, and writing letters. Paul
      sent Timothy on various missions to cities like Corinth, Philippi, and
      Thessalonica. At the time of writing, Paul had left Timothy in Ephesus for
      a period. Although Timothy wasn't the permanent bishop or overseer of the
      Ephesian church, he was entrusted with certain responsibilities and acted
      under Paul's guidance.
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
    <p>
      Timothy's presence in Ephesus aimed to counter emerging errors and
      heresies and uphold the church's discipline. The purpose of this letter
      was to provide Timothy with guidance on his conduct in the church. Paul
      emphasized the importance of Timothy's teaching and behavior, offered
      criteria for selecting bishops and deacons, discussed the care of widows,
      advised on church discipline, and outlined appropriate behavior for
      individuals in various roles within the church.
