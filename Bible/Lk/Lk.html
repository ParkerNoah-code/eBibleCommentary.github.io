  <h1>Luke</h1>
  <h2>Canonical Acceptance</h2>
  <p>
    The canonicity of this Gospel is well attested. The same arguments by which
    the canonical authority of the Gospels of Matthew and Mark was established,
    apply with their full force to the Gospel of Luke. It was universally
    received as canonical by the whole primitive Church has a place in every
    catalogue of the books of the New Testament, which was ever published is
    constantly referred to and cited by the Fathers as a part of sacred
    Scripture and was one of the books constantly read in the churches, as a
    part of the rule of faith and practice for all believers. There are in all
    16 witnesses before the end of the second century that testify to its use
    and general acceptance in the Church.

  <h2>Significance</h2>
  <p>
    The gospel of Luke presents to us Christ especially as one of the human
    race, the Seed of the woman, in his saving work not only for Israel, but
    also for the Gentiles. Hence it pictures him as the friend of the poor and
    as seeking sinners, emphasizes the universality of the Gospel blessings, and
    distinctly bespeaks a friendly relation to the Samaritans. Its permanent
    spiritual value is that it reminds the Church of all ages that in every
    nation he that feareth God, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him;
    and that we have a great High Priest that was touched with the feeling of
    our infirmities, and was in all parts tempted like as we are, yet without
    sin.
