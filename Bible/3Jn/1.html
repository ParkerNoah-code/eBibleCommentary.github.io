    <h2>1. <em>The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</em></h2>
    <p>
      <em>The elder to Gaius the beloved</em>. The elder is the writer of the
      epistle, the Apostle John, who so styles himself on account of his age,
      and office, as in the preceding epistle. The person to whom he writes is
      "the well beloved Gaius"; not that Gaius, who was the Apostle Paul's host,
      Romans 16:23, for though their characters agree, being both hospitable
      men, yet neither the place nor time in which they lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apostle Paul's Gaius lived at Corinth, this is in some place near to
      Ephesus, for the apostle in his old age purposed to come and see him
      shortly; the other was contemporary with Paul, this with John; there were
      thirty or forty years difference between them: besides, the Corinthian
      Gaius was baptized by Paul, and was doubtless one of his spiritual
      children, or converts, whereas this Gaius was one of the Apostle John's
      spiritual children, 3 John 1:4; nor does he seem to be the same with Gaius
      of Macedonia, Acts 19:29, or with Gaius of Derbe, Acts 20:4, who seem to
      be two different persons by their country, though both companions in
      travel of the Apostle Paul; for which reason, as well as the time of their
      living, neither of them can be this Gaius, who was a settled housekeeper,
      and resided at some certain place.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name is a Roman name, and the same with Caius, though he seems to have
      been a Jew, as he might, it being usual with the Jews in other countries
      to take Gentile names. His character is, that he was "well beloved"; that
      is, of God, as it appears he was from the grace bestowed on him, from the
      prosperous estate of his soul, and from the truth that was in him, and his
      walking in it; and of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the same reasons; and
      also of all the brethren and saints that knew him; he being a person not
      only truly gracious, and of faithfulness and integrity, but of great
      liberality and beneficence, which must gain him much love and esteem among
      them; and he was well beloved by the Apostle John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>whom I love in truth</em>. As being in it, or for the sake of it, or
      truly and sincerely.
    </p>
    <h2>
      2.
      <em
        >Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy, even
        as your soul prospers.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Beloved, I pray that you may prosper</em>. Or succeed in all temporal
      affairs, in the business of life, in which he was; and as success of this
      sort depends upon the blessing of God, which maketh rich, it is to be
      wished and prayed for from him: and be in health; that is, of body, which
      above all things above all outward mercies, is the most desirable; for
      without this, what are the richest dainties, the largest possessions, or
      the best of friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      Without this there can be no comfortable enjoyment of either of them; and
      therefore of this sort of mercies, it is in the first place, and above all
      others, to be wished for, and desired by one friend for another. The rule
      and measure of this wish is according to the prosperity of his soul,
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>even as your soul prospers</em>. The soul is diseased with sin, and
      may be said to be in good health, when all its iniquities are forgiven;
      and may be said to prosper, when having a spiritual appetite for the
      Gospel, the sincere milk of the word, it feeds upon it, is nourished by
      it, and grows thereby; when it is in the lively exercise of faith, hope,
      and love; when spiritual knowledge is increased, or it grows in grace, and
      in the knowledge of Christ Jesus; when the inward man is renewed day by
      day with fresh strength; and when it enjoys communion with God, has the
      light of his countenance, and the joys of his salvation; and when it is
      fruitful in every good work.
