    <p>
      <em>I wrote unto the church</em>; this was probably some church of which
      Gaius was. <em>Diotrephes</em>, one who had received or usurped some
      office or authority in it, to so ill a purpose, as when he had no
      inclination to be hospitable himself to fellow Christians, prevented
      others from being so; and upon pretence of the little differences of these
      Jewish from the Gentile Christians, excluded them their communion.

        >Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does,
        unjustly accusing us with wicked words. Not content with this, he
        doesn’t receive the brothers himself, and those who would, he forbids
        and throws out of the assembly.</em

    <h2>
      11.
      <em
        >Beloved, don’t imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He
        who does good is of God. He who does evil hasn’t seen God.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Follow not</em>; by following here he means imitation, i.e. the
      deformity of evil appearing in the practice of some, and the beauty of
      true goodness in others, (examples being given of both sorts in vv. 9,
      12), he exhorts to decline the former, and imitate the other; and enforces
      the exhortation by the weightiest arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>He that doeth good</em>; a doer of good, one made up of kindness and
      benignity (as the contest draws the sense to that special kind of
      goodness); agayopoiwn and o kakopoiwn, signify doing well or ill, from a
      fixed, prevailing habit, 1Jo 3:7,8.
    </p>
    <p><em>Is of God</em>; is allied to heaven, born of God, his offspring.</p>
    <p>
      <em>But he that doeth evil hath not seen God</em>; an evil-doer, on the
      other hand, such a one as is a composition of spite, envy, and malice, is
      a mere stranger to him, hath not been, or known, or had to do with him.
