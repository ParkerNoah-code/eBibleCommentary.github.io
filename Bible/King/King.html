  <h1>1-2 Kings</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Books of 1 and 2 Kings, originally a single book in the Hebrew Bible,
    continue the narrative of Israel's monarchy, picking up where 2 Samuel left
    off. 1 Kings begins with the reign of Solomon, David's son, who is known for
    his wisdom, wealth, and the construction of the magnificent temple in
    Jerusalem. However, Solomon's later years are marked by his turning away
    from God and his many foreign wives and concubines.

  <p>
    After Solomon's death, the kingdom is divided into two: the northern Kingdom
    of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah. The rest of 1 Kings and 2 Kings
    detail the reigns of the subsequent kings of both kingdoms, with a primary
    focus on their faithfulness (or lack thereof) to God. The books also
    introduce the prophets Elijah and Elisha, who play significant roles in
    calling the kings and people to repentance and obedience. The narrative in 2
    Kings continues to alternate between the two kingdoms, highlighting the
    growing idolatry and disobedience that ultimately lead to their downfall.
    The northern Kingdom of Israel is conquered by the Assyrians in 722 BC,
    while the southern Kingdom of Judah falls to the Babylonians in 586 BC, with
    the people taken into exile and the temple destroyed.

    Throughout 1 and 2 Kings, the authors emphasize the importance of
    faithfulness to God and the consequences of disobedience, providing valuable
    lessons for both the Israelites and future readers. The books also
    demonstrate God's patience and mercy in repeatedly sending prophets to warn
    and call His people back to Him, even in the face of their persistent
    rebellion.
