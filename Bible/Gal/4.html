    <p>
      For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom as
      an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.
      For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your
      neighbor as yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, be careful
      that you don’t consume one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the
      flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the
      flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the
      things that you desire. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not
      under the law. Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are:
      adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness, idolatry, sorcery,
      hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions,
      heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of
      which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who
      practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
      goodness, faith, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there
      is no law. Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its
      passions and lusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit. Let’s not become
      conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual
      must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, looking to yourself so
      that you also aren’t tempted. Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill
      the law of Christ. For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is
      nothing, he deceives himself. But let each man examine his own work, and
      then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else. For
      each man will bear his own burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who
      teaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he
      will also reap. For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap
      corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap
      eternal life. Let’s not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due
      season if we don’t give up. So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what
      is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the
      household of the faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand. As many as
      desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be
      circumcised, just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
      For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but
      they desire to have you circumcised, so that they may boast in your flesh.
      But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the
      world. For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor
      uncircumcision, but a new creation. As many as walk by this rule, peace
      and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the
      Lord Jesus branded on my body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
