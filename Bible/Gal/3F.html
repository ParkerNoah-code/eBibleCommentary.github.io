    Ambrose writes, "Therefore if they dare not say He is God by appellation,
    and it is a mark of deep impiety to say He is a false god, it remains that
    He is true God, not unlike to the true Father, but equal to Him. And as He
    sanctifies and justifies whom He will, [Romans 9:18] not by assuming that
    power from without Himself, but having within Himself the power of
    sanctification, how is He not true God? For the Apostle called Him indeed
    true God, Who according to His nature was God, as it is written: 'Howbeit
    then, when you knew not God, you serviced unto them, who by nature were not
    gods;'[Galatians 4:8] that is, who could not be true gods, for this title by
    no means belonged to them by nature." (<a

    Theophilus writes, "But you do not believe that the dead are raised. When
    the resurrection shall take place, then you will believe, whether you will
    or no; and your faith shall be reckoned for unbelief, unless you believe
    now. And why do you not believe? Do you not know that faith is the leading
    principle in all matters? For what husbandman can reap, unless he first
    trust his seed to the earth? Or who can cross the sea, unless he first
    entrust himself to the boat and the pilot? And what sick person can be
    healed, unless first he trust himself to the care of the physician? And what
    art or knowledge can any one learn, unless he first apply and entrust
    himself to the teacher? If, then, the husbandman trusts the earth, and the
    sailor the boat, and the sick the physician, will you not place confidence
    in God, even when you hold so many pledges at His hand? For first He created
    you out of nothing, and brought you into existence (for if your father was
    not, nor your mother, much more were you yourself at one time not in being),
    and formed you out of a small and moist substance, even out of the least
    drop, which at one time had itself no being; and God introduced you into
    this life. Moreover, you believe that the images made by men are gods, and
    do great things; and can you not believe that the God who made you is able
    also to make you afterwards?" (<a href="" target="_blank"
