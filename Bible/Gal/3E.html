      Jerome comments, "Others interpret the basic elements of this world as the
      Law of Moses and the utterances of the prophets.' For it is through the
      Law and the prophets, which are analogous to the first lessons in writing,
      that we come to acquire a fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom.
      In his letter to the Hebrews, the Apostle addresses those who were already
      supposed to be [spiritually] mature but who cast aside the truth and still
      clung to the rudimentary principles of learning. 'In fact, though by this
      time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the
      elementary truths of God's word all over again' [Heb 5:12]." (<a

      J. B. Lightfoot comments, "On the other hand, a few of the fathers
      (Jerome, Gennadius, Primasius) adopt the other sense, 'elementary
      teaching.' This is probably the correct interpretation, both as simpler in
      itself and as suiting the context better. St. Paul seems to be dwelling
      still on the rudimentary character of the law, as fitted for an earlier
      stage in the world's history. The expression occurs again in reference to
      formal ordinances, Col. ii. 8 [Be careful that you don’t let anyone rob
      you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men,
      after the elemental spirits of the world, and not after Christ.]" (<a

      David R. Bundrick comments, "The interpretation most consistent with the
      evidence and that is enunciated in slightly various ways by Lightfoot,
      Meyer, Black, Burton, Mickelson and Delling (among others) is the
      principle view: the elementary or rudimentary religious teachings,
      possessed by the whole human race, to which both Jew and Gentile were
      enslaved prior to experiencing freedom by faith in Christ." (<a

      Irenaeus writes, "For as by the disobedience of the one man who was
      originally moulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners, [Romans
      5:19] and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of
      one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified
      and receive salvation. Thus, then, was the Word of God made man, as also
      Moses says: 'God, true are His works.' [Deuteronomy 32:4] But if, not
      having been made flesh, He did appear as if flesh, His work was not a true
      one. But what He did appear, that He also was: God recapitulated in
      Himself the ancient formation of man, that He might kill sin, deprive
      death of its power, and vivify man; and therefore His works are true." (<a

      Gordon D. Fee comments, "Although Paul's emphases in what follows are thus
      primarily soteriological, there also emerges a variety of 'Son of God'
      affirmations (Jewish messianism, preexistence, incarnation, knowledge of
      the historical Jesus), which are crucial to Paul's special interests and
      therefore cause for close scrutiny." (Pauline Christology, Baker, 2007, pg
      212).

      "He it is who spake with Moses in the bush, and said: Seeing have I seen
      the affliction of thy people that is in Egypt; and I am come down to
      deliver them. He it is who came forth and came down for the deliverance of
      the oppressed, bringing us out from the power of the Egyptians, that is,
      from all idolatry and impiety; and delivering us from the Red Sea, that
      is, delivering us from the deadly confusion of the Gentiles and the
      grievous vexation of their blasphemy. For in them the Word of God prepared
      and rehearsed beforehand the things concerning us. Then He set forth in
      types beforehand that which was to be; now in very truth He has brought us
      out from the cruel service of the Gentiles, and a stream of water in the
      desert has He made to flow forth in abundance from a rock; and that rock
      is Himself; and has given twelve fountains, that is, the teaching of the
      twelve apostles. And the obstinate unbelievers He brought to an end and
      consumed in the wilderness; but those who believed on Him, and in malice
      were children, He made to enter into the inheritance of the fathers; whom
      not Moses, but Jesus puts in possession of the heritage: who also delivers
      us from Amalek by the expansion of His hands, and brings us to the kingdom
      of the Father." (Irenaeus,
