      Augustine writes, "Now it was quite competent for the apostle to say, and
      to say rightly: 'Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ;' but he could
      never say: Be justified by me, as I also am by Christ;— since there may
      be, and indeed actually are and have been, many who were righteous and
      worthy of imitation; but no one is righteous and a justifier but Christ
      alone. Whence it is said: 'To the man that believes in him that justifies
      the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness' [ Romans 4:5 ]... But
      it has never been in the power of any of the saints of God to say this
      except the Saint of saints, who said:
      <em>You believe in God, believe also in me</em> [John 14:1]; so that,
      inasmuch as it is He that justifies the ungodly, to the man who believes
      in him that justifies the ungodly his faith is imputed for righteousness."

      Tertullian writes, "One man perverts the Scriptures with his hand, another
      their meaning by his exposition. For although Valentinus seems to use the
      entire volume, he has none the less laid violent hands on the truth only
      with a more cunning mind and skill than Marcion. Marcion expressly and
      openly used the knife, not the pen, since he made such an excision of the
      Scriptures as suited his own subject-matter. Valentinus, however,
      abstained from such excision, because he did not invent Scriptures to
      square with his own subject-matter, but adapted his matter to the
      Scriptures; and yet he took away more, and added more, by removing the
      proper meaning of every particular word, and adding fantastic arrangements
      of things which have no real existence." (<a

      J. C. Ryle comments, "We all know the habit of mind that makes men great
      in this world,—that makes such men as Alexander the Great, or Julius
      Caesar, or Oliver Cromwell, or Peter the Great, or Charles XII., or
      Marlborough, or Napoleon, or Pitt. We know that, with all their faults,
      they were all men of one thing. They threw themselves into one grand
      pursuit. They cared for nothing else. They put every thing else aside.
      They counted everything else as second-rate, and of subordinate
      importance, compared to the one thing that they put before their eyes
      every day they lived. I say that the same habit of mind applied to the
      service of the Lord Jesus Christ becomes religious zeal." (<a
