    <h2>Author</h2>
    <p>
      Internal evidence: The contents in the Epistle to the Galatians strongly
      suggest Pauline authorship. The author identifies himself as Paul and
      exhibits distinct Pauline style, vocabulary, and theological emphases,
      which are consistent with his other letters. The passionate and forceful
      tone of the letter reflects Paul's personal investment in the Galatian
      churches and his authoritative stance as an apostle. Moreover, Paul's
      personal experiences, as mentioned in the letter, align with what is known
      about his life from other sources. He refers to his conversion experience
      (Gal 1:11-17) and his meeting with the apostles in Jerusalem (Gal 2:1-10).
      These accounts correspond with details found in the Book of Acts and
      Paul's other letters, reinforcing the link between the author of Galatians
      and the historical figure of Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      External evidence: The information derived from early Christian writings
      and historical testimonies, further supports Pauline authorship of the
      Epistle to the Galatians. The earliest extant Christian sources
      consistently attribute the letter to Paul. Early Church fathers such as
      Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria recognized the letter as
      Paul's work, demonstrating the widespread recognition and acceptance of
      its authorship in the early Christian community. Additionally, the
      letter's inclusion in the canon of the New Testament, alongside other
      Pauline letters, attests to its authenticity. The early church also
      recognized the theological and doctrinal coherence between Galatians and
      Paul's other letters, further affirming this fact.
    </p>

    <h2>Date</h2>
    <p>
      While there is some uncertainty surrounding the date of Galatians because
      of the limited historical information available and the complexities of
      reconstructing the timeline of Paul's missionary activities, scholars
      generally agree that the letter was written in the late 40s or early 50s
      AD. There are three primary views (note that views 1 and 2 sometimes
      overlap): (1) Proponents of the early date, in the late 40s or early 50's
      AD, argue that the meeting in Jerusalem mentioned in Galatians 2:1-10
      corresponds to the Jerusalem Council described in Acts 15 which is dated
      around 48-49 AD and typically follow the South Galatian view. (2)
      Proponents of a middle dating, in the early to mid 50's AD, typically
      follow the North Galatian view in which case it would have taken Paul a
      longer time to reach them. (3) Proponents of a late dating, in the late
      50's or early 60's AD, often believe the gravity of the issues at stake
      necessitate a longer timeframe.
    </p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
      The matter of whether the Epistle was intended for the churches in North
      or South Galatia is an ongoing question. Although there is no consensus
      among scholars, the evidence appears to lean towards the South Galatian
      view. If the Epistle to the Galatians was directed to the churches in
      Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe, there is important
      historical, geographical, literary, and epigraphic data to better
      understand the letter.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Occasion and Background</h2>
    <p>
      Paul had previously established churches in this region during his
      missionary journeys. The occasion that prompted Paul to write this letter
      was the arrival of false teachers who were promoting a distorted version
      of the Gospel among the Galatian believers. These teachers, often referred
      to as "Judaizers," insisted that Gentile converts to Christianity needed
      to be circumcised and adhere to Jewish laws in order to be justified
      before God. The Judaizers sought to undermine Paul's authority and
      discredit his message, causing confusion and division among the believers.
      Recognizing the gravity of the situation and the potential danger of the
      Galatians abandoning the true Gospel, Paul writes Galatians as a
      passionate defense of his apostleship and a clear articulation of the
      Gospel of grace. Paul maintains the purity of the Gospel message of faith
      in Jesus Christ in opposition to the false apostles whose doctrine was
      corrupted by false additions.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
    <p>
      The overarching message of Galatians is the central theme of justification
      by faith. Paul emphasizes that a person is declared righteous before God,
      not by observing the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ. Salvation is
      a gift of God's grace, received by faith alone, and not by human effort or
      merit. Paul emphasizes the freedom that believers have in Christ enabling
      them to live in a new covenant of grace, as opposed to the bondage and
      futility of trying to attain righteousness through the law. In the new
      covenant of grace, there is neither Jew nor Gentile, but all who have
      faith in Christ are one family, heirs to the promise given to Abraham. It
      serves as a forceful reminder of the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice and
      the undeserved nature of salvation.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Themes</h2>
    <p>
      Justification: The theme of justification by faith is a central and
      foundational concept in the Epistle to the Galatians. Throughout the
      letter, the apostle Paul passionately argues that justification is by
      faith in Christ for salvation and rejects any form of reliance on works of
      the law (Gal 3:28) or human effort (Gal 3:11). Paul vehemently opposes the
      necessity of observing Jewish laws (2:16), particularly circumcision (Gal
      5:6), as a requirement for salvation and asserts that justification—being
      declared righteous before God—is solely by faith in Jesus Christ. It is
      Christ and his redemptive work on the cross that reconciles humanity with
      God (Gal 1:4) and grants them justification as a result of God's grace
      through faith (Gal 2:21).
    </p>

    <h2>Significance</h2>
    <p>
      This Epistle too has abiding significance for the Church of God. It is
      essentially a defense of the doctrine of free grace, of the Christian
      liberty of New Testament believers over against those that would bring
      them under the law in its Old Testament application, and would place them
      under the obligation to submit to circumcision and to participate in the
      shadowy ceremonies of a by-gone day. The great central exhortation of this
      letter is: “Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free,
      and be not tangled again with the yoke of bondage.” The way of the
      ritualist is not the way of life, is the lesson that should be remembered
      by all those who are inclined to over-emphasize the outward form of
      religion to the neglect of its spirit and essence.
    </p>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>
      I. Pauls Defense of his Apostleship (1:1-2:21). After the usual
      introduction the apostle states the occasion of his writing (1:1-10). In
      defense of his apostleship he points out that he has been called by God
      himself and received his Gospel by direct revelation, and had no occasion
      to learn it from the other apostles (1:11-24); that the apostles showed
      their agreement with him by not demanding the circumcision of Titus and by
      admitting his mission to the gentiles (2:1-10); and that he had even
      rebuked Peter, when this “pillar of the church” was not true to the
      doctrine of free grace (2:11-21).
    </p>
    <p>
      II. His Defense of the Doctrine of Justification (3:1-4:31). Here the
      apostle clearly brings out that the Galatians received the gift of the
      Spirit by faith (3:1-5); that Abraham was justified by faith (3:6-9); that
      delivery from the curse of the law is possible only through faith
      (3:10-14); and that the law has merely a parenthetic character, coming, as
      it does, between the promise and its fulfillment (3:15-29). He compares
      Judaism to a son who is minor, and Christianity to a son that has attained
      his majority (4:1-7); admonishes the Galatians that, realizing their
      privilege, they should not return to the beggarly elements of knowledge
      (4:8-20); and says that the Jew is like the child of Hagar, while the
      Christian resembles the child of Sara (4:21-31).
    </p>
    <p>
      III. Practical Exhortations (5:1-6:18). The Galatians are exhorted to
      stand in their Christian liberty (5:1-12), a liberty that is not license
      but obedience (5:13-18). The works of the flesh and the fruits of the
      Spirit are described that the Galatians may avoid the former and yield the
      latter (5:19-26). The right way of treating the erring and weak is pointed
      out, and also the relation of what one sows to what one reaps (5:1-10).
      With a brief summary and benediction Paul ends his letter (6:11-18).

      Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ,
      and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— and all the brothers who
      are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia: Grace to you and peace from God
      the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that
      he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of
      our God and Father— to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace
      of Christ to a different “good news”, but there isn’t another “good news.”
      Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of
      Christ. But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you
      any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be
      cursed. As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to
      you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to
      please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was
      preached by me, that it is not according to man. For I didn’t receive it
      from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of
      Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the
      Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God
      and ravaged it. I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age
      among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of
      my fathers. But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me
      from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace, to reveal his Son
      in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately
      confer with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who
      were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to
      Damascus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed
      with him fifteen days. But of the other apostles I saw no one except
      James, the Lord’s brother. Now about the things which I write to you,
      behold, before God, I’m not lying. Then I came to the regions of Syria and
      Cilicia. I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were
      in Christ, but they only heard, “He who once persecuted us now preaches
      the faith that he once tried to destroy.” So they glorified God in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with
      Barnabas, taking Titus also with me. I went up by revelation, and I laid
      before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately
      before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had
      run, in vain. But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was
      compelled to be circumcised. This was because of the false brothers
      secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in
      Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage, to whom we gave no
      place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the
      Good News might continue with you. But from those who were reputed to be
      important—whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn’t
      show partiality to man—they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to
      me, but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the
      Good News for the uncircumcised, even as Peter with the Good News for the
      circumcised— for he who worked through Peter in the apostleship with the
      circumcised also worked through me with the Gentiles— and when they
      perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, those
      who were reputed to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of
      fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the
      circumcision. They only asked us to remember the poor—which very thing I
      was also zealous to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he
      stood condemned. For before some people came from James, he ate with the
      Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing
      those who were of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews joined him in
      his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their
      hypocrisy. But when I saw that they didn’t walk uprightly according to the
      truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, “If you, being a
      Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel
      the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?
    </p>
    <p>
      “We, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners, yet knowing that a man
      is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus
      Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by
      faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be
      justified by the works of the law. But if while we sought to be justified
      in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of
      sin? Certainly not! For if I build up again those things which I
      destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker. For I through the law died to the
      law, that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ, and it
      is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. That life which I now
      live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and
      gave himself up for me. I don’t reject the grace of God. For if
      righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before
      whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you as crucified? I
      just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works
      of the law, or by hearing of faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun in
      the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh? Did you suffer so many
      things in vain, if it is indeed in vain? He therefore who supplies the
      Spirit to you and does miracles among you, does he do it by the works of
      the law, or by hearing of faith? Even so, Abraham “believed God, and it
      was counted to him for righteousness.” Know therefore that those who are
      of faith are children of Abraham. The Scripture, foreseeing that God would
      justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to
      Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.” So then, those
      who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.
    </p>
    <p>
      For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is
      written, “Cursed is everyone who doesn’t continue in all things that are
      written in the book of the law, to do them.” Now that no man is justified
      by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”
      The law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for
      us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,” that the
      blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, that
      we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet
      when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void or adds to it. Now the
      promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. He doesn’t say, “To
      descendants”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”, which is
      Christ. Now I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ,
      the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as
      to make the promise of no effect. For if the inheritance is of the law, it
      is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then why is there the law? It was added because of transgressions, until
      the offspring should come to whom the promise has been made. It was
      ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator is not
      between one, but God is one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there
      had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness
      would have been of the law. But the Scripture imprisoned all things under
      sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for
      the faith which should afterwards be revealed. So that the law has become
      our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But
      now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. For you are all
      children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were
      baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek,
      there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for
      you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you are Christ’s, then you are
      Abraham’s offspring and heirs according to promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a
      bondservant, though he is lord of all, but is under guardians and stewards
      until the day appointed by the father. So we also, when we were children,
      were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world. But when
      the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born
      under the law, that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we
      might receive the adoption as children. And because you are children, God
      sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”
      So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir
      of God through Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by
      nature are not gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather to
      be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable
      elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?
      You observe days, months, seasons, and years. I am afraid for you, that I
      might have wasted my labor for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are.
      You did me no wrong, but you know that because of weakness in the flesh I
      preached the Good News to you the first time. That which was a temptation
      to you in my flesh, you didn’t despise nor reject; but you received me as
      an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible,
      you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. So then, have I
      become your enemy by telling you the truth? They zealously seek you in no
      good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them. But it
      is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am
      present with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed
      in you— but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my
      tone, for I am perplexed about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don’t you listen to the law?
      For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant, and one
      by the free woman. However, the son by the servant was born according to
      the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise. These
      things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount
      Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar. For this Hagar is
      Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for
      she is in bondage with her children. But the Jerusalem that is above is
      free, which is the mother of us all. For it is written,
    </p>
    <p>“Rejoice, you barren who don’t bear.</p>
    <p>Break out and shout, you who don’t travail.</p>
    <p>
      For the desolate women have more children than her who has a husband.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise. But as then, he
      who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according
      to the Spirit, so also it is now. However, what does the Scripture say?
      “Throw out the servant and her son, for the son of the servant will not
      inherit with the son of the free woman.” So then, brothers, we are not
      children of a servant, but of the free woman.

      Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and
      don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will
      profit you nothing. Yes, I testify again to every man who receives
      circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law. You are alienated
      from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen
      away from grace. For we through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of
      righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
      amounts to anything, but faith working through love.
    </p>
    <p>
      You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey
      the truth? This persuasion is not from him who calls you. A little yeast
      grows through the whole lump. I have confidence toward you in the Lord
      that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his
      judgment, whoever he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still
      persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed. I wish
      that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.
    </p>
    <p>
      For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom as
      an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.
      For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your
      neighbor as yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, be careful
      that you don’t consume one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the
      flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the
      flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the
      things that you desire. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not
      under the law. Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are:
      adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness, idolatry, sorcery,
      hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions,
      heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of
      which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who
      practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
      goodness, faith, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there
      is no law. Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its
      passions and lusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit. Let’s not become
      conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual
      must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, looking to yourself so
      that you also aren’t tempted. Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill
      the law of Christ. For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is
      nothing, he deceives himself. But let each man examine his own work, and
      then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else. For
      each man will bear his own burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who
      teaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he
      will also reap. For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap
      corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap
      eternal life. Let’s not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due
      season if we don’t give up. So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what
      is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the
      household of the faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand. As many as
      desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be
      circumcised, just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
      For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but
      they desire to have you circumcised, so that they may boast in your flesh.
      But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the
      world. For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor
      uncircumcision, but a new creation. As many as walk by this rule, peace
      and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the
      Lord Jesus branded on my body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
