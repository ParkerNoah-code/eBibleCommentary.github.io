      Ver 6.
      <em
        >I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the
        grace of Christ to a different “good news”,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>I wonder</em>. He commences by administering a rebuke, though a
      somewhat milder one than they deserved; but his greatest severity of
      language is directed, as we shall see, against the false apostles. He
      charges them with turning aside, not only from his gospel, but from
      Christ; for it was impossible for them to retain their attachment to
      Christ, without acknowledging that he has graciously delivered us from the
      bondage of the law. But such a belief cannot be reconciled with those
      notions respecting the obligation of ceremonial observance which the false
      apostles inculcated. They were <em>removed from</em> Christ; not that they
      entirely rejected Christianity, but that the corruption of their doctrines
      was such as to leave them nothing more than an imaginary Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in our own times, the Papists, choosing to have a divided and
      mangled Christ, have none, and are therefore "removed from Christ." They
      are full of superstitions, which are directly at variance with the nature
      of Christ. Let it be carefully observed, that we are
      <em>removed from</em> Christ, when we fall into those views which are
      inconsistent with his mediatorial office; for light can have no fellowship
      with darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same principle, he calls it
      <em>another gospel</em>, that is, a gospel different from the true one.
      And yet the false apostles professed that they preached the gospel of
      Christ; but, mingling with it their own inventions, by which its principal
      efficacy was destroyed, they held a false, corrupt, and spurious gospel.
      By using the present tense, ("ye are removed") he appears to say that they
      were only in the act of failing. As if he had said, "I do not yet say that
      ye have been removed; for then it would be more difficult to return to the
      right path. But now, at the critical moment, do not advance a single step,
      but instantly retreat."
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>From Christ, who called you by grace</em>. Others read it, "from him
      who called you by the grace of Christ," understanding it to refer to the
      Father; but the reading which we have followed is more simple. When he
      says that they were called by Christ through grace, this tends to heighten
      the criminality of their ingratitude. To revolt from the Son of God under
      any circumstances, is unworthy and disgraceful; but to revolt from him,
      after being invited to partake salvation by grace, is more eminently base.
      His goodness to us renders our ingratitude to him more dreadfully heinous.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>So soon</em>. When it is considered how <em>soon</em> they had
      discovered a want of steadfastness, their guilt is still further
      heightened. A proper season, indeed, for departing from Christ cannot be
      imagined. But the fact, that no sooner had Paul left them than the
      Galatians were led away from the truth, inferred still deeper blame. As
      the consideration of the grace by which they had been called was adduced
      to aggravate their ingratitude, so the circumstance of the time when they
      were removed is now adduced to aggravate their levity.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Ver 7.
      <em
        >but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble
        you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Which is not another thing</em>. Some explain it thus, "though there
      is not another gospel;" as if it were a sort of correction of the
      Apostle's language, to guard against the supposition that there were more
      gospels than one. So far as the explanation of the words is concerned, I
      take a more simple view of them; for he speaks contemptuously of the
      doctrine of the false apostles, as being nothing else than a mass of
      confusion and destruction. As if he had said, "What do those persons
      allege? On what grounds do they attack the doctrine which I have
      delivered? They merely trouble you, and subvert the gospel. They do
      nothing more." But it amounts to the same meaning; for this, too, I
      acknowledge, is a correction of the language he had used about
      <em>another gospel</em>. He declares that it is not a gospel, but a mere
      disturbance. All I intended to say was, that, in my opinion, the word
      <em>another</em> means another thing. It resembles strongly the expression
      in common use, "this amounts to nothing, but that you wish to deceive."
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>And wish to pervert</em>. He charges them with the additional crime of
      doing an injury to Christ, by endeavoring to subvert his gospel.
      Subversion is an enormous crime. It is worse than corruption. And with
      good reason does he fasten on them this charge. When the glow of
      justification is ascribed to another, and a snare is laid for the
      consciences of men, the Savior no longer occupies his place, and the
      doctrine of the gospel is utterly ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The gospel of Christ</em>. To know what are the leading points of the
      gospel, is a matter of unceasing importance. When these are attacked, the
      gospel is destroyed. When he adds the words, of Christ, this may be
      explained in two ways; either that it has come from Christ as its author,
      or that it purely exhibits Christ. The apostle's reason for employing that
      expression unquestionably was to describe the true and genuine gospel,
      which alone is worthy of the name.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Ver 8.
      <em
        >But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any
        “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be
        cursed.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>But though we</em>. As he proceeds in defending the authority of his
      doctrine, his confidence swells. First of all, he declares that the
      doctrine which he had preached is the only gospel, and that the attempt to
      set it aside is highly criminal. But then he was aware, the false apostles
      might object: "We will not yield to you in our desire to maintain the
      gospel, or in those feelings of respect for it which we are accustomed to
      cherish." Just as, at the present day, the Papists describe in the
      strongest terms the sacredness with which they regard the gospel, and kiss
      the very name with the deepest reverence, and yet, when brought to the
      trial, are found to persecute fiercely the pure and simple doctrine of the
      gospel. Accordingly, Paul does not rest satisfied with this general
      declaration, but proceeds to define what the gospel is, and what it
      contains, and declares boldly that his doctrine is the true gospel; so as
      to resist all further inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of what avail was it to profess respect for the gospel, and not to know
      what it meant? With Papists, who hold themselves bound to render implicit
      faith, that might be perfectly sufficient; but with Christians, where
      there is no knowledge, there is no faith. That the Galatians, who were
      otherwise disposed to obey the gospel, might not wander hither and
      thither, and "find no rest for the sole of their foot" (Genesis 8:9), Paul
      enjoins them to stand steadfastly by his doctrine. He demands such
      unhesitating belief of his preaching, that he pronounces a curse on all
      who dared to contradict it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here it is not a little remarkable, that he begins with himself; for
      thus he anticipates a slander with which his enemies would have loaded
      him. "You wish to have everything which comes from you received without
      hesitation, because it is your own." To show that there is no foundation
      for such a statement, he instantly surrenders the right of advancing
      anything against his own doctrine. He claims no superiority, in this
      respect, over other men, but justly demands from all, equally with
      himself, subjection to the word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Or an angel from heaven</em>. In order to destroy more completely the
      pretensions of the false apostles, he rises so high as to speak of angels;
      and, on the supposition that they taught a different doctrine, he does not
      satisfy himself with saying that they were not entitled to be heard, but
      declares that they ought to be held accursed. Some may think, that it was
      absurd to engage in a controversy with angels about his doctrine; but a
      just view of the whole matter will enable any one to perceive, that this
      part of the apostle's proceedings was proper and necessary. It is
      impossible, no doubt, for angels from heaven to teach anything else than
      the certain truth of God. But when the credit due to doctrines which God
      had revealed concerning the salvation of men was the subject of
      controversy, he did not reckon it enough to disclaim the judgment of men,
      without declining, at the same time, the authority of angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, when he pronounces a curse on angels who should teach any other
      doctrine though his argument is derived from an impossibility, it is not
      superfluous. This exaggerated language must, have contributed greatly to
      strengthen the confidence in Paul's preaching. His opponents, by employing
      the lofty titles of men, attempted to press hard on him and on his
      doctrine. He meets them by the bold assertion, that even angels are unable
      to shake his authority. This is no disparagement to angels. To promote the
      glory of God by every possible means was the design of their creation. He
      who endeavors, in a pious manner, to accomplish this object, by an
      apparently desrespectful mention of their name, detracts nothing from
      their high rank. This language not only exhibits, in an impressive manner,
      the majesty of the word of God, but yields, also, a powerful confirmation
      to our faith while, in reliance on that word, we feel ourselves at liberty
      to treat even angels with defiance and scorn. When he says, "let him be
      accursed," the meaning must be, "let him be held by you as accursed." In
      expounding 1 Corinthians 12:3, we had occasion to speak of the word
      accursed. Here it denotes cursing.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Ver 9.
      <em
        >As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you
        any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be
        cursed.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Let him be cursed.</em> Paul repeats the curse, directing it now upon
      other persons. Before, he cursed himself, his brethren, and an angel from
      heaven. "Now," he says, "if there are any others who preach a gospel
      different from that you have received from us, let them also be accursed."
      Paul herewith curses and excommunicates all false teachers including his
      opponents. He is so worked up that he dares to curse all who pervert his
      Gospel. Would to God that this terrible pronouncement of the Apostle might
      strike fear into the hearts of all who pervert the Gospel of Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Galatians might say: "Paul, we do not pervert the Gospel you have
      brought unto us. We did not quite understand it. That is all. Now these
      teachers who came after you have explained everything so beautifully."
      This explanation the Apostle refuses to accept. They must add nothing;
      they must correct nothing. "What you received from me is the genuine
      Gospel of God. Let it stand. If any man brings any other gospel than the
      one I brought you, or promises to deliver better things than you have
      received from me, let him be accursed."
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this emphatic denunciation so many accept the pope as the
      supreme judge of the Scriptures. "The Church," they say, "chose only four
      gospels. The Church might have chosen more. Therefore the Church is above
      the Gospel." With equal force one might argue: "I approve the Scriptures.
      Therefore I am above the Scriptures. John the Baptist confessed Christ.
      Hence he is above Christ." Paul subordinates himself, all preachers, all
      the angels of heaven, everybody to the Sacred Scriptures. We are not the
      masters, judges, or arbiters, but witnesses, disciples, and confessors of
      the Scriptures, whether we be pope, Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Paul, or
      an angel from heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>As we said before</em>. Observe the expression -- ye have received;
      for he uniformly insists, that they must not regard the gospel as
      something unknown, existing in the air, or in their own imaginations. He
      exhorts them to entertain a firm and serious conviction, that the doctrine
      which they had received and embraced is the true gospel of Christ. Nothing
      can be more inconsistent with the nature of faith than a feeble, wavering
      assent. What, then, must be the consequence, if ignorance of the nature
      and character of the gospel shall lead to hesitation? Accordingly he
      enjoins them to regard as devils those who shall dare to bring forward a
      gospel different from his, -- meaning by <em>another gospel</em>, one to
      which the inventions of other men are added; for the doctrine of the false
      apostles was not entirely contrary, or even different, from that of Paul,
      but corrupted by false additions.
    </p>
    <p>
      To what poor subterfuges do the Papists resort, in order to escape from
      the Apostle's declaration! First, they tell us, that we have not in our
      possession the whole of Paul's preaching, and cannot know what it
      contained, unless the Galatians who heard it shall be raised from the
      dead, in order to appear as witnesses. Next, they assert, that it is not
      every kind of addition which is forbidden, but that other gospels only are
      condemned. What Paul's doctrine was, so far as it concerns us to know, may
      be learned with sufficient clearness from his writings. Of this gospel, it
      is plain, the whole of Popery is a dreadful perversion. And from the
      nature of the case, we remark in conclusion, it is manifest that any
      spurious doctrine whatever is at variance with Paul's preaching; so that
      these cavils will avail them nothing.

      Marius Victorinus comments, "The gospel Paul announces is sure: that
      Christ is the Son of God, the power of God for salvation to all that
      believe, to the Greeks and to the Jews—and nothing besides! In fact, all
      hope for salvation and for the grace of God pertaining to us lies in faith
      pertaining to Christ, to the effect that we would believe he is the Son of
      God, that he suffered for our sake and rose again, from which we too might
      arise with the forgiveness of sins. This is the true gospel that Paul
      announces. Therefore, if anyone adds on something else—like Judaism,
      circumcision, sabbath observance, and other things of this sort—he is
      sinning and is a stranger to the truth." (<a

      The Glossa Ordinaria says, "The canonical books have been brought about
      through the dictation of the Holy Spirit. It is not known, however, at
      which time or by which authors the non-canonical or apocryphal books were
      produced. Since, nevertheless, they are very good and useful, and nothing
      is found in them which contradicts the canonical books, the church reads
      them and permits them to be read by the faithful for devotion and
      edification. Their authority, however, is not considered adequate for
      proving those things which come into doubt or contention, or for
      confirming the authority of ecclesiastical dogma, as blessed Jerome states
      in his prologue to Judith and to the books of Solomon. But the canonical
      books are of such authority that whatever is contained therein is held to
      be true firmly and indisputably, and likewise that which is clearly
      demonstrated from them. For just as in philosophy a truth is known through
      reduction to self-evident first principles, so too, in the writings handed
      down from holy teachers, the truth is known, as far as those things that
      must be held by faith, through reduction to the canonical scriptures that
      have been produced by divine revelation, which can contain nothing false.
      Hence, concerning them Augustine says to Jerome: To those writers alone
      who are called canonical I have learned to offer this reverence and honor:
      I hold most firmly that none of them has made an error in writing. Thus if
      I encounter something in them which seems contrary to the truth, I simply
      think that the manuscript is incorrect, or I wonder whether the translator
      has discovered what the word means, or whether I have understood it at
      all. But I read other writers in this way: however much they abound in
      sanctity or teaching, I do not consider what they say true because they
      have judged it so, but rather because they have been able to convince me
      from those canonical authors, or from probable arguments, that it agrees
      with the truth." (<a

      Thomas Aquinas comments, "Now, a teaching passed on by a man can be
      changed and revoked by another man who knows better, as one philosopher
      refutes the sayings of another... But a teaching that comes directly from
      God can be nullified neither by man nor angel. Hence if a man or an angel
      were to state anything contrary to what has been taught by God, such a
      statement would not contradict God’s teaching, so as to void or destroy
      it; rather, God’s teaching would be against him... Hence the Apostle says
      that the dignity of the Gospel teaching, which has come directly from God,
      is so great that if a man or even an angel preached another Gospel besides
      that which he has preached among them, he is anathema, i.e., must be
      rejected and expelled...nothing is to be taught except what is contained,
      either implicitly or explicitly, in the Gospels and epistles and Sacred
      Scripture. For Sacred Scripture and the Gospels announce that Christ must
      be believed explicitly. Hence whatever is contained therein implicitly and
      fosters its teaching and faith in Christ can be preached and taught.
      Therefore, when he says, besides that which you have received, he means by
      adding something completely alien: 'If any, man shall add to these things,
      God shall add unto him the plagues written in this book' (Rev 22:18). And
      'Neither add anything,' i.e., contrary or alien, 'nor diminish' (Deut
      12:32)." (<a

      Tertullian writes, "But what if a bishop, if a deacon, if a widow, if a
      virgin, if a doctor, if even a martyr, have fallen from the rule of faith,
      will heresies on that account appear to possess the truth? Do we prove the
      faith by the persons, or the persons by the faith?... In the Lord's
      apostles we possess our authority; for even they did not of themselves
      choose to introduce anything, but faithfully delivered to the nations of
      mankind the doctrine which they had received from Christ. If, therefore,
      even 'an angel from heaven should preach any other gospel' than theirs, he
      would be called accursed by us... in order that the truth may be adjudged
      to belong to us, 'as many as walk according to the rule,' which the church
      has handed down from the apostles, the apostles from Christ, and Christ
      from God, the reason of our position is clear, when it determines that
      heretics ought not to be allowed to challenge an appeal to the
      Scriptures... I hold sure title-deeds from the original owners themselves,
      to whom the estate belonged. I am the heir of the apostles." (<a

      Dionysius of Alexandria writes, "... [if] anyone alter or destroy [it], or
      [say] that he was either not God or not man, or that he did not die or
      rise again, or that he is not coming again to judge the quick and the
      dead; or
      <em
        >if he preach any other gospel than we have preached, let him be
        accursed</em
      >, says Paul. But if anyone despises the doctrine of the resurrection of
      the body, let such an one be at once ranked with the dead. For these
      reasons, that we may be in accord, church with church and bishop with
      bishop and elder with elder, let us be careful in our utterances." (<a

      John Calvin comments, "Accordingly he enjoins them to regard as devils
      those who shall dare to bring forward a gospel different from his, —
      meaning by another gospel, one to which the inventions of other men are
      added; for the doctrine of the false apostles was not entirely contrary,
      or even different, from that of Paul, but corrupted by false additions."
