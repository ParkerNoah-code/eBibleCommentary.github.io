      <em
        >For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to
        please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldnâ€™t be a servant of
        Christ.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>For do I now persuade men, or God?</em>
      With the same vehemence Paul continues: "You Galatians ought to be able to
      tell from my preaching and from the many afflictions which I have endured,
      whether I serve men or God. Everybody can see that my preaching has
      stirred up persecution against me everywhere, and has earned for me the
      cruel hatred of my own people, in fact the hatred of all men. This should
      convince you that by my preaching I do not seek the favor and praise of
      men, but the glory of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you see that I seek no man's favor by my doctrine?" asks Paul. "If
      I were anxious for the favor of men I would flatter them. But what do I
      do? I condemn their works. I teach things only that I have been commanded
      to teach from above. For that I bring down upon my head the wrath of Jews
      and Gentiles. My doctrine must be right. It must be divine. Any other
      doctrine cannot be better than mine. Any other doctrine must be false and
      wicked."
    </p>
    <p>
      With Paul we boldly pronounce a curse upon every doctrine that does not
      agree with ours. We do not preach for the praise of men, or the favor of
      princes. We preach for the favor of God alone whose grace and mercy we
      proclaim. Whosoever teaches a gospel contrary to ours, or different from
      ours, let us be bold to say that he is sent of the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Or do I seek to please men?</em> "Do I serve men or God?" Paul keeps
      an eye on the false apostles, those flatterers of men. They taught
      circumcision to avoid the hatred and persecution of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this day you will find many who seek to please men in order that they
      may live in peace and security. They teach whatever is agreeable to men,
      no matter whether it is contrary to God's Word or their own conscience.
      But we who endeavor to please God and not men, stir up hell itself. We
      must suffer reproach, slanders, death.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who go about to please men we have a word from Christ recorded
      in the fifth chapter of St. John: "How can ye believe, which receive honor
      one of another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</em>
      Observe the consummate cleverness with which the false apostles went about
      to bring Paul into disrepute. They combed Paul's writings for
      contradictions (our opponents do the same) to accuse him of teaching
      contradictory things. They found that Paul had circumcised Timothy
      according to the Law, that Paul had purified himself with four other men
      in the Temple at Jerusalem, that Paul had shaven his head at Cenchrea. The
      false apostles slyly suggested that Paul had been constrained by the other
      apostles to observe these ceremonial laws. We know that Paul observed
      these decora out of charitable regard for the weak brethren. He did not
      want to offend them. But the false apostles turned Paul's charitable
      regard to his disadvantage. If Paul had preached the Law and circumcision,
      if he had commended the strength and free will of man, he would not have
      been so obnoxious to the Jews. On the contrary they would have praised his
      every action.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Ver 11.
      <em
        >But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was
        preached by me, that it is not according to man.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      This passage constitutes Paul's chief defense against the accusations of
      his opponents. He maintains under oath that he received his Gospel not
      from men, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. In declaring that his
      Gospel is not after man, Paul does not merely wish to state that his
      Gospel is not mundane. The false apostles made the same claim for their
      gospel. Paul means to say that he learned his Gospel not in the usual and
      accepted manner through the agency of men by hearing, reading, or writing.
      He received the Gospel by special revelation directly from Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul received his Gospel on the way to Damascus when Christ appeared to
      him. St. Luke furnishes an account of the incident in the ninth chapter of
      the Book of Acts. "Arise," said Christ to Paul, "and go into the city, and
      it shall be told thee what thou must do." Christ did not send Paul into
      the city to learn the Gospel from Ananias. Ananias was only to baptize
      Paul, to lay his hands on Paul, to commit the ministry of the Word unto
      Paul, and to recommend him to the Church. Ananias recognized his limited
      assignment when he said to Paul: "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that
      appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou
      mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost." Paul did
      not receive instruction from Ananias. Paul had already been called,
      enlightened, and taught by Christ in the road. His contact with Ananias
      was merely a testimonial to the fact that Paul had been called by Christ
      to preach the Gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul was forced to speak of his conversion to combat the slanderous
      contention of the false apostles to the effect that this apostleship was
      inferior to that of the other apostles.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were not for the example of the Galatian churches I would never have
      thought it possible that anybody who had received the Word of God with
      such eagerness as they had, could so quickly let go of it. Good Lord, what
      terrible mischief one single false statement can create.
    </p>
    <p>
      The article of justification is fragile. Not in itself, of course, but in
      us. I know how quickly a person can forfeit the joy of the Gospel. I know
      in what slippery places even those stand who seem to have a good footing
      in the matters of faith. In the midst of the conflict when we should be
      consoling ourselves with the Gospel, the Law rears up and begins to rage
      all over our conscience. I say the Gospel is frail because we are frail.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes matters worse is that one-half of ourselves, our own reason,
      stands against us. The flesh resists the spirit, or as Paul puts it, "The
      flesh lusteth against the Spirit." Therefore we teach that to know Christ
      and to believe in Him is no achievement of man, but the gift of God. God
      alone can create and preserve faith in us. God creates faith in us through
      the Word. He increases, strengthens and confirms faith in us through His
      word. Hence the best service that anybody can render God is diligently to
      hear and read God's Word. On the other hand, nothing is more perilous than
      to be weary of the Word of God. Thinking he knows enough, a person begins
      little by little to despise the Word until he has lost Christ and the
      Gospel altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let every believer carefully learn the Gospel. Let him continue in humble
      prayer. We are molested not by puny foes, but by mighty ones, foes who
      never grow tired of warring against us. These, our enemies, are many: Our
      own flesh, the world, the Law, sin, death, the wrath and judgment of God,
      and the devil himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arguments which the false apostles advanced impress people to this
      day. "Who are you to dissent from the fathers and the entire Church, and
      to bring a contradictory doctrine? Are you wiser than so many holy men,
      wiser than the whole Church?" When Satan, abetted by our own reason,
      advances these arguments against us, we lose heart, unless we keep on
      saying to ourselves: "I don't care if Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine, Peter,
      Paul, John, or an angel from heaven, teaches so and so. I know that I
      teach the truth of God in Christ Jesus." You may argue that the Church and
      the fathers are holy. Yet the Church is compelled to pray: "Forgive us our
      trespasses," I am not to be believed, nor is the Church to be believed, or
      the fathers, or the apostles, or an angel from heaven, if they teach
      anything contrary to the Word of God. Let the Word of God abide forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter erred in life and in doctrine. Paul might have dismissed Peter's
      error as a matter of no consequence. But Paul saw that Peter's error would
      lead to the damage of the whole Church unless it were corrected. Therefore
      he withstood Peter to his face. The Church, Peter, the apostles, angels
      from heaven, are not to be heard unless they teach the genuine Word of
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      This argument is not always to our advantage. People ask: "Whom then shall
      we believe?" Our opponents maintain that they teach the pure Word of God.
      We do not believe them. They in turn hate and persecute us for vile
      heretics. What can we do about it? With Paul we glory in the Gospel of
      Jesus Christ. What to do? Let everybody become sure of his calling and
      doctrine, that he may boldly say with Paul: "But though we, or an angel
      from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than ye have received, let
      him be accursed."
    </p>

    <h2>
      Ver 12.
      <em

    <p>
      You observe how sedulously he affirms that he was taught of Christ, who
      Himself, without human intervention, condescended to reveal to him all
      knowledge. And if he were asked for his proof that Christ Himself thus
      immediately revealed to him these ineffable mysteries, he would instance
      his former conversation, arguing that his conversion would not have been
      so sudden, had it not been by Divine revelation. For when men have been
      vehement and eager on the contrary side, their conviction, if it is
      effected by human means, requires much time and ingenuity. It is clear
      therefore that he, whose conversion is sudden, and has been sobered in the
      very height of his madness, must have been vouchsafed a Divine revelation
      and teaching, and so have at once arrived at complete sanity. On this
      account he is obliged to relate his former life, and to call the Galatians
      as witnesses of past events. That the Only-begotten Son of God had Himself
      from heaven vouchsafed to call him, they who were not present could not
      know, but that he had been a persecutor they well knew. For his violence
      had even reached their ears, and the distance between Palestine and
      Galatia was so great, that the report would not have extended thither, had
      not his acts exceeded all bounds and endurance.

      Ver 13-14.
      <em
        >For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jewsâ€™
        religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and
        ravaged it. I advanced in the Jewsâ€™ religion beyond many of my own age
        among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions

      <em>For you have heard of my way of living in time past.</em>
      Observe how he shrinks not from aggravating each point; not saying simply
      that he <em>persecuted</em> but <em>beyond measure</em>, and not only
      <em>persecuted</em> but <em>ravaged</em>, which signifies an attempt to
      extinguish, to pull down, to destroy, to annihilate, the Church.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Traditions of my fathers.</em> Speaking now of the Mosaic Law, Paul
      declares that he was wrapped up in it. To the Philippians he wrote: "As
      touching the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the church;
      touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless." He means to
      say, "I can compare myself with the best and holiest of all those who are
      of the circumcision. Let them show me if they can, a more earnest defender
      of the Mosaic Law than I was at one time. This fact, O Galatians, should
      have put you on your guard against these deceivers who make so much of the
      Law. If anybody ever had reason to glory in the righteousness of the Law,
      it was I."

      Cyril of Jerusalem writes, "Vice mimics virtue, and the tares strive to be
      thought wheat, growing like the wheat in appearance, but being detected by
      good judges from the taste... We have need therefore of divine grace, and
      of a sober mind, and of eyes that see, lest from eating tares as wheat we
      suffer harm from ignorance, and lest from taking the wolf to be a sheep we
      become his prey... for, as the Scripture says,
      <em>he goes about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour</em>...
      The Greeks on the one hand draw men away by their smooth tongue,
      <em>for honey drops from a harlot's lips</em> whereas they of the
      Circumcision deceive those who come to them by means of the Divine
      Scriptures, which they miserably misinterpret though studying them from
      childhood to old age, and growing old in ignorance. But the children of
      heretics, by their good words and smooth tongue, deceive the hearts of the
      innocent, disguising with the name of Christ as it were with honey the
      poisoned arrows of their impious doctrines: concerning all of whom
      together the Lord says, <em>Take heed lest any man mislead you</em>." (<a

      Hippolytus writes, "There is, brethren, one God, the knowledge of whom we
      gain from the Holy Scriptures, and from no other source. For just as a
      man, if he wishes to be skilled in the wisdom of this world, will find
      himself unable to get at it in any other way than by mastering the dogmas
      of philosophers, so all of us who wish to practise piety will be unable to
      learn its practice from any other quarter than the oracles of God.
      Whatever things, then, the Holy Scriptures declare, at these let us took;
      and whatsoever things they teach, these let us learn; and as the Father
      wills our belief to be, let us believe; and as He wills the Son to be
      glorified, let us glorify Him; and as He wills the Holy Spirit to be
      bestowed, let us receive Him. Not according to our own will, nor according
      to our own mind, nor yet as using violently those things which are given
      by God, but even as He has chosen to teach them by the Holy Scriptures, so
      let us discern them." (<a

      Lactantius writes, "For since all error arises either from false religion
      or from wisdom, in refuting error it is necessary to overthrow both. For
      inasmuch as it has been handed down to us in the sacred writings that the
      thoughts of philosophers are foolish, this very thing is to be proved by
      fact and by arguments, that no one, induced by the honourable name of
      wisdom, or deceived by the splendour of empty eloquence, may prefer to
      give credence to human rather than to divine things. Which things, indeed,
      are related in a concise and simple manner. For it was not befitting that,
      when God was speaking to man, He should confirm His words by arguments, as
      though He would not otherwise be regarded with confidence: but, as it was
      right, He spoke as the mighty Judge of all things, to whom it belongs not
      to argue, but to pronounce sentence. He Himself, as God, is truth. But we,
      since we have divine testimony for everything, will assuredly show by how
      much surer arguments truth may be defended, when even false things are so
      defended that they are accustomed to appear true. Wherefore there is no
      reason why we should give so much honour to philosophers as to fear their
      eloquence. For they might speak well as men of learning; but they could
      not speak truly, because they had not learned the truth from Him in whose
      power it was." (<a

      Gregory of Nyssa writes, "Now they charge us with innovation, and frame
      their complaint against us in this way:â€” They allege that while we confess
      three Persons we say that there is one goodness, and one power, and one
      Godhead... But the ground of their complaint is that their custom does not
      admit this, and Scripture does not support it. What then is our reply? We
      do not think that it is right to make their prevailing custom the law and
      rule of sound doctrine. For if custom is to avail for proof of soundness,
      we too, surely, may advance our prevailing custom; and if they reject
      this, we are surely not bound to follow theirs. Let the inspired
      Scripture, then, be our umpire, and the vote of truth will surely be given

      Thomas Aquinas, answering whether it must be said that the three persons
      are of one essence, raises and responds to an objection: "Objection 2.
      Further, nothing is to be affirmed of God except what can be confirmed by
      the authority of Holy Writ, as appears from Dionysius (Div. Nom. i). Now
      Holy Writ never says that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are of one
      essence. Therefore this should not be asserted.
      <br />
      Reply to Objection 2. Although we may not find it declared in Holy Writ in
      so many words that the three persons are of one essence, nevertheless we
      find it so stated as regards the meaning; for instance, 'I and the Father
      are one (John 10:30),' and 'I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John
      10:38)'; and there are many other texts of the same import." (<a

      have had its certainty before the latter began to exist... How shall we be
      persuaded that it came from God without recurring to a decree of the
      Church? it is just the same as if it were asked, How shall we learn to
      distinguish light from darkness, white from black, sweet from bitter?

      white and black do of their colour, sweet and bitter of their taste." (<a

      far as possible to hold to and confirm the things which lay before us, and

      Anselm of Canterbury writes, "For if at times we assert by a process of
      reasoning a conclusion which we cannot explicitly cite from the sayings of
      Scripture or demonstrate from the bare wording, still it is by using
      Scripture that we know in the following way whether the affirmation should
      be accepted or rejected. If the conclusion is reached by straightforward
      reasoning and Scripture in no way contradicts it, then by the very fact
      that it does not deny what is inferred on the basis of reason, that
      conclusion is accepted as authorized by Scripture. But if Scripture
      indubitably opposes our understanding, even though our reasoning appears
      to us to be impregnable, still it ought not to be believed to be
      substantiated by any truth at all. It is when Sacred Scripture either
      clearly affirms or in no wise denies it, that it gives support to the
