          <p>
            <em>But when Peter came to Antioch</em>. The exact timing of Peter's
            visit to Antioch remains uncertain. Some speculate it might have
            occurred before the Jerusalem council that discussed the necessity
            of circumcision for salvation. This is based on the assumption that
            after the council's decree, Peter would not have behaved as
            described in this account. However, it's important to note that the
            council's decree only pertained to Gentiles, not Jews. Thus, Peter
            and other Jewish believers could still adhere to the Mosaic law's
            rituals and ceremonies. Based on the sequence of events and the
            order of the narrative, it appears likely that Peter's visit to
            Antioch occurred after the council which aligns with Acts 15:30 and
            the ensuing events.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>I resisted him to his face</em>. This wasn't a mere outward show
            or pretense, as some ancient scholars suggested. The intention
            wasn't for Jews to overhear their conversation and come to
            appreciate the appropriateness of eating with Gentiles, thus
            avoiding offense. Such duplicity would be unjust, as it would mirror
            the very dissimulation Paul was challenging in Peter. Paul's
            opposition was sincere and honest. He did not engage in gossip,
            whispering, or backbiting. Instead, he addressed him to his face,
            candidly expressing his thoughts, steadfastly challenging his
            behavior, and striving to persuade him of his error and halt his
            actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Because he stood condemned</em>. The word condemned is best
            redendered <em>to be blamed</em>, which shows that the apostle did
            not oppose him for opposition sake, rashly, and without any
            foundation; there was a just reason for it, he had done that which
            was culpable, and for which he was blameworthy. Paul accommodated
            himself to the Jews no farther than was consistent with the doctrine
            of liberty; and therefore he refused to circumcise Titus, that the
            truth of the gospel might remain unimpaired. But Peter Judaized in
            such a manner as to "compel the Gentiles" to suffer bondage, and at
            the same time to create a prejudice against Paul's doctrine. He did
            not, therefore, observe the proper limit; for he was more desirous
            to please than to edify, and more solicitous to inquire what would
            gratify the Jews than what would be expedient for the whole body.

            The Alexandrian manuscript, along with other versions like the
            Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic translations, replace "Peter"
            with "Cephas." Some ancient writers suggest that this "Cephas" might
            not be the Apostle Peter, who was named Cephas by Christ, but
            instead one of the seventy disciples. Clement, for instance,
            mentions that the Cephas whom Paul speaks of, the one who confronted
            him face to face in Antioch, was a disciple from the seventy who
            shared the name with the Apostle Peter. Jerome also notes that there
            were those who believed that the Cephas mentioned by Paul, who
            confronted him face to face, might not be the Apostle Peter but a
            disciple from the seventy with the same name. However, these
            opinions lack any substantial basis. The context of the discourse
            and the flow of the narrative make it abundantly clear that the same
            Cephas, or Peter, one of the twelve disciples referred to as pillars
            alongside James and John (Galatians 2:9), is being referred to here.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the Papists greedily catch at this, to secure the
            infallibility of the bishops of Rome, who pretend to be the
            successors of Peter, lest, should the apostle appear blameworthy,
            and to be reproved and opposed, they could not, with any grace,
            assume a superior character to his: but that Peter the Apostle is
            here designed is so manifest, that some of their best writers are
            obliged to own it, and give up the other as a mere conceit. When
            Peter came to Antioch is not certain; some have thought it was
            before the council at Jerusalem concerning the necessity of
            circumcision to salvation, because it is thought that after the
            decree of that council Peter would never have behaved in such a
            manner as there related; though it should be observed, that that
            decree did not concern the Jews, and their freedom from the
            observance of the law, only the Gentiles; so that Peter and other
            Jews might, as it is certain they did, retain the rites and
            ceremonies of the law of Moses; and according to the series of
            things, and the order of the account, it seems to be after that
            council, when Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch, and with others
            continued there for some time, during which time Peter came (Acts
            15:30) and the following contention happened.

            Marius Victorinus comments, "Not only was my gospel approved, says
            Paul, on the part of the apostles who were in Jerusalem; not only
            was I charged to be mindful of the poor... but also I did not keep
            quiet about Peter's sin, he says... And if there were some sin in
            me, the congregation would in an equal manner be reprimanding me
            just as they did him." (<a

            David DeSilva comments, "This is the 'truth of the gospel' that
            Peter will himself shortly violate as he draws back from this
            practice to honor, once again, the lines of purity that place
            gentiles on the outside rather than honoring the new lines of purity
            drawn by the Holy Spirit poured out on gentile Christian alongside
            Jewish Christians." (The Letter to the Galatians, NICNT: Eerdmans,
            2018).

            Siricius writes, "O miserable boldness, O craft of a desperate mind!
            Already was this unknown language of heresy spreading through the
            Church like a cancer, seeking to fill the breast, and plunge the
            whole man in destruction: and unless the Lord of Sabaoth had broken
            through the snare which they had laid, the public exhibition of so
            much evil and hypocrisy would have led to ruin the hearts of many
            simple ones, for the human mind is easily drawn aside towards evil,
            choosing rather to fly through open space, than to travel with pain
            along the narrow way...
          </p>

          <p>
            And indeed from the times of the Apostles up to now we have heard
            and known by experience of many malignant heresies, but the sacred
            truth of the Church has never been assailed by the barking of such
            dogs as those who have now suddenly broken in upon us, with the
            doctrines of unbelief fully sprouted, enemies of the faith; who by
            the fruit of their works have betrayed whose disciples they are. For
            while other heretics misunderstanding single points have proposed to
            bear away and abstract from the Divine system of teaching, these
            men,
            <em>not having on a wedding garment</em>, wound the Catholics,
            perverting, as I have said, the continuity of the New and Old
            Testament, and interpreting it in a diabolical spirit, have by their
            alluring and false arguments already begun to ruin some Christians,
            and to make them associates of their madness, not keeping within
            themselves the poison of their iniquity: but some of their chosen
            ones have betrayed their blasphemies by writing a rash discourse,
            which the rage of a desperate mind has led them openly to publish,
            favouring, as it does, the cause of the Heathens." (<a
