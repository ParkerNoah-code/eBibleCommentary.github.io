      <em>But when Peter came to Antioch</em>. The exact timing of Peter's visit
      to Antioch remains uncertain. Some speculate it might have occurred before
      the Jerusalem council that discussed the necessity of circumcision for
      salvation. This is based on the assumption that after the council's
      decree, Peter would not have behaved as described in this account.
      However, it's important to note that the council's decree only pertained
      to Gentiles, not Jews. Thus, Peter and other Jewish believers could still
      adhere to the Mosaic law's rituals and ceremonies. Based on the sequence
      of events and the order of the narrative, it appears likely that Peter's
      visit to Antioch occurred after the council which aligns with Acts 15:30
      and the ensuing events.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I resisted him to his face</em>. This wasn't a mere outward show or
      pretense, as some ancient scholars suggested. The intention wasn't for
      Jews to overhear their conversation and come to appreciate the
      appropriateness of eating with Gentiles, thus avoiding offense. Such
      duplicity would be unjust, as it would mirror the very dissimulation Paul
      was challenging in Peter. Paul's opposition was sincere and honest. He did
      not engage in gossip, whispering, or backbiting. Instead, he addressed him
      to his face, candidly expressing his thoughts, steadfastly challenging his
      behavior, and striving to persuade him of his error and halt his actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Because he stood condemned</em>. The word condemned is best redendered
      <em>to be blamed</em>, which shows that the apostle did not oppose him for
      opposition sake, rashly, and without any foundation; there was a just
      reason for it, he had done that which was culpable, and for which he was
      blameworthy. Paul accommodated himself to the Jews no farther than was
      consistent with the doctrine of liberty; and therefore he refused to
      circumcise Titus, that the truth of the gospel might remain unimpaired.
      But Peter Judaized in such a manner as to "compel the Gentiles" to suffer
      bondage, and at the same time to create a prejudice against Paul's
      doctrine. He did not, therefore, observe the proper limit; for he was more
      desirous to please than to edify, and more solicitous to inquire what
      would gratify the Jews than what would be expedient for the whole body.

      The Alexandrian manuscript, along with other versions like the Vulgate
      Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic translations, replace "Peter" with "Cephas."
      Some ancient writers suggest that this "Cephas" might not be the Apostle
      Peter, who was named Cephas by Christ, but instead one of the seventy
      disciples. Clement, for instance, mentions that the Cephas whom Paul
      speaks of, the one who confronted him face to face in Antioch, was a
      disciple from the seventy who shared the name with the Apostle Peter.
      Jerome also notes that there were those who believed that the Cephas
      mentioned by Paul, who confronted him face to face, might not be the
      Apostle Peter but a disciple from the seventy with the same name. However,
      these opinions lack any substantial basis. The context of the discourse
      and the flow of the narrative make it abundantly clear that the same
      Cephas, or Peter, one of the twelve disciples referred to as pillars
      alongside James and John (Galatians 2:9), is being referred to here.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the Papists greedily catch at this, to secure the infallibility
      of the bishops of Rome, who pretend to be the successors of Peter, lest,
      should the apostle appear blameworthy, and to be reproved and opposed,
      they could not, with any grace, assume a superior character to his: but
      that Peter the Apostle is here designed is so manifest, that some of their
      best writers are obliged to own it, and give up the other as a mere
      conceit. When Peter came to Antioch is not certain; some have thought it
      was before the council at Jerusalem concerning the necessity of
      circumcision to salvation, because it is thought that after the decree of
      that council Peter would never have behaved in such a manner as there
      related; though it should be observed, that that decree did not concern
      the Jews, and their freedom from the observance of the law, only the
      Gentiles; so that Peter and other Jews might, as it is certain they did,
      retain the rites and ceremonies of the law of Moses; and according to the
      series of things, and the order of the account, it seems to be after that
      council, when Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch, and with others
      continued there for some time, during which time Peter came (Acts 15:30)
      and the following contention happened.

      Marius Victorinus comments, "Not only was my gospel approved, says Paul,
      on the part of the apostles who were in Jerusalem; not only was I charged
      to be mindful of the poor... but also I did not keep quiet about Peter's
      sin, he says... And if there were some sin in me, the congregation would
      in an equal manner be reprimanding me just as they did him." (<a

      David DeSilva comments, "This is the 'truth of the gospel' that Peter will
      himself shortly violate as he draws back from this practice to honor, once
      again, the lines of purity that place gentiles on the outside rather than
      honoring the new lines of purity drawn by the Holy Spirit poured out on
      gentile Christian alongside Jewish Christians." (The Letter to the
      Galatians, NICNT: Eerdmans, 2018).

      Siricius writes, "O miserable boldness, O craft of a desperate mind!
      Already was this unknown language of heresy spreading through the Church
      like a cancer, seeking to fill the breast, and plunge the whole man in
      destruction: and unless the Lord of Sabaoth had broken through the snare
      which they had laid, the public exhibition of so much evil and hypocrisy
      would have led to ruin the hearts of many simple ones, for the human mind
      is easily drawn aside towards evil, choosing rather to fly through open
      space, than to travel with pain along the narrow way...
    </p>

    <p>
      And indeed from the times of the Apostles up to now we have heard and
      known by experience of many malignant heresies, but the sacred truth of
      the Church has never been assailed by the barking of such dogs as those
      who have now suddenly broken in upon us, with the doctrines of unbelief
      fully sprouted, enemies of the faith; who by the fruit of their works have
      betrayed whose disciples they are. For while other heretics
      misunderstanding single points have proposed to bear away and abstract
      from the Divine system of teaching, these men,
      <em>not having on a wedding garment</em>, wound the Catholics, perverting,
      as I have said, the continuity of the New and Old Testament, and
      interpreting it in a diabolical spirit, have by their alluring and false
      arguments already begun to ruin some Christians, and to make them
      associates of their madness, not keeping within themselves the poison of
      their iniquity: but some of their chosen ones have betrayed their
      blasphemies by writing a rash discourse, which the rage of a desperate
      mind has led them openly to publish, favouring, as it does, the cause of
      the Heathens." (<a

      Jerome comments, "By specifying 'the traditions of my forefathers' rather
      than 'the commandments of the Lord,' he indicates that he was a Pharisee
      of Pharisees and that his zeal for God was not according to understanding.
      Down to the present day, those who interpret Scripture according to a
      Jewish mentality persecute the church of Christ and devastate it not out
      of zeal for the Law of God but because they have been corrupted by the
      traditions of men." (<a

      Richard Longnecker comments, "In attempting to be considerate of the
      Jerusalem church in its existence under zealot-nationalistic pressures,
      and so to preserve the integrity of the Jewish Christian mission, Cephas
      had acutally, even though inadvertently, destroyed the integrity of
      Gentile Christians." (Galatians, WEB: Zondervan, vol 41, 1990).
