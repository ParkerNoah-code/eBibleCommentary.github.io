      For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to
      please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was
      preached by me, that it is not according to man. For I didn’t receive it
      from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of
      Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the
      Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God
      and ravaged it. I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age
      among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of
      my fathers. But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me
      from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace, to reveal his Son
      in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately
      confer with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who
      were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to
      Damascus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed
      with him fifteen days. But of the other apostles I saw no one except
      James, the Lord’s brother. Now about the things which I write to you,
      behold, before God, I’m not lying. Then I came to the regions of Syria and
      Cilicia. I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were
      in Christ, but they only heard, “He who once persecuted us now preaches
      the faith that he once tried to destroy.” So they glorified God in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with
      Barnabas, taking Titus also with me. I went up by revelation, and I laid
      before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately
      before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had
      run, in vain. But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was
      compelled to be circumcised. This was because of the false brothers
      secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in
      Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage, to whom we gave no
      place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the
      Good News might continue with you. But from those who were reputed to be
      important—whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn’t
      show partiality to man—they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to
      me, but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the
      Good News for the uncircumcised, even as Peter with the Good News for the
      circumcised— for he who worked through Peter in the apostleship with the
      circumcised also worked through me with the Gentiles— and when they
      perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, those
      who were reputed to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of
      fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the
      circumcision. They only asked us to remember the poor—which very thing I
      was also zealous to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he
      stood condemned. For before some people came from James, he ate with the
      Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing
      those who were of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews joined him in
      his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their
      hypocrisy. But when I saw that they didn’t walk uprightly according to the
      truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, “If you, being a
      Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel
      the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?
    </p>
    <p>
      “We, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners, yet knowing that a man
      is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus
      Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by
      faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be
      justified by the works of the law. But if while we sought to be justified
      in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of
      sin? Certainly not! For if I build up again those things which I
      destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker. For I through the law died to the
      law, that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ, and it
      is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. That life which I now
      live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and
      gave himself up for me. I don’t reject the grace of God. For if
      righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!”
