      Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ,
      and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— and all the brothers who
      are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia: Grace to you and peace from God
      the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that
      he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of
      our God and Father— to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

      I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace
      of Christ to a different “good news”, but there isn’t another “good news.”
      Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of
      Christ. But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you
      any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be
      cursed. As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to
      you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.

        Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</em

    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Paul, an apostle</em>. In the salutations with which he commenced his
      Epistles, Paul was accustomed to claim the title of "an Apostle." His
      object in doing so, as we have remarked on former occasions, was to employ
      the authority of his station, for the purpose of enforcing his doctrine.
      This authority depends not on the judgment or opinion of men, but
      exclusively on the calling of God; and therefore he demands a hearing on
      the ground of his being "an Apostle." Let us always bear this in mind,
      that in the church we ought to listen to God alone, and to Jesus Christ,
      whom he has appointed to be our teacher. Whoever assumes a right to
      instruct us, must speak in the name of God or of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the calling of Paul was more vehemently disputed among the
      Galatians, he asserts it more strongly in his address to that church, than
      in his other Epistles; for he does not simply affirm that he was called by
      God, but states expressly that it was not either from men or by men. This
      statement, be it observed, applies not to the office which he held in
      common with other pastors, but to the apostleship. The authors of the
      calumnies which he has in his eye did not venture to deprive him
      altogether of the honor of the Christian ministry. They merely refused to
      allow him the name and rank of an apostle.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now speaking of the apostleship in the strictest sense; for the
      word is employed in two different ways. Sometimes, it denotes preachers of
      the Gospel, to whatever class they might belong; but here it bears a
      distinct reference to the highest rank in the church; so that Paul is
      equal to Peter and to the other twelve.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Not from men, nor through man</em>. The first clause, that he was
      called not from men, he had in common with all the true ministers of
      Christ. As no man ought to "take this honor unto himself" (Heb 5:4), so it
      is not in the power of men to bestow it on whomsoever they choose. It
      belongs to God alone to govern his church; and therefore the calling
      cannot be lawful, unless it proceed from Him. So far as the church is
      concerned, a man who has been led to the ministry, not by a good
      conscience, but by ungodly motives, may happen to be regularly called. But
      Paul is here speaking of a call ascertained in so perfect, a manner, that
      nothing farther can be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second clause, that he was called not by man, belonged in a peculiar
      manner to the apostles; for in an ordinary pastor, this would have implied
      nothing wrong. Paul himself, when travelling through various cities in
      company with Barnabas, "ordained elders in every church," by the votes of
      the people (Acts 14:23); and he enjoins Titus and Timothy to proceed in
      the same work (1 Tim 5:17 Titus 1:5). Such is the ordinary method of
      electing pastors; for we are not entitled to wait until God shall reveal
      from heaven the names of the persons whom he has chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was called, not by a mere man, but by one that was more than a man; nor
      by a mortal man, but by Christ, as raised from the dead, immortal and
      glorious at God's right hand: or rather the sense is, he was not chosen
      into the office of apostleship by the suffrages of men, as Matthew was; or
      he was not ordained an apostle in the manner the ordinary ministers of the
      Gospel and pastors are, by the churches of Christ; so that as the former
      clause is opposed to an unlawful call of men, this is opposed to a lawful
      one; and shows him to be not an ordinary minister, but an extraordinary
      one, who was called to this office, not mediately by men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if human agency was not improper, if it was even commendable, why does
      Paul disclaim it in reference to himself? I have already mentioned that
      something more was necessary to be proved than that Paul was a pastor, or
      that he belonged to the number of the ministers of the Gospel; for the
      point in dispute was the apostleship. It was necessary that the apostles
      should be elected, not in the same manner as other pastors, but by the
      direct agency of the Lord himself. Thus, Christ himself (Matthew 10:1)
      called the Twelve; and when a successor was to be appointed in the room of
      Judas, the church does not venture to choose one by votes, but has
      recourse to lot. (Acts 1:26). We are certain that the lot was not employed
      in electing pastors. Why was it resorted to in the election of Matthias?
      To mark the express agency of God for it was proper that the apostles
      should be distinguished from other ministers. And thus Paul, in order to
      show that he does not belong to the ordinary rank of ministers, contends
      that his calling proceeded immediately from God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how does Paul affirm that he was not called by men, while Luke records
      that Paul and Barnabas were called by the church at Antioch? Some have
      replied, that he had previously discharged the duties of an apostle, and
      that, consequently, his apostleship was not founded on his appointment by
      that church. But here, again, it may be objected, that this was his first
      designation to be the apostle of the Gentiles, to which class the
      Galatians belonged. The more correct, and obvious reply is, that he did
      not intend here to set aside entirely the calling of that church, but
      merely to show that his apostleship rests on a higher title. This is true;
      for even those who laid their hands on Paul at Antioch did so, not of
      their own accord, but in obedience to express revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since, therefore, he was called by Divine revelation, and was also
      appointed and declared by the Holy Spirit to be the apostle of the
      Gentiles, it follows, that he was not brought forward by men, although the
      customary rite of ordination was afterwards added.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will, perhaps, be thought that an indirect contrast between Paul and
      the false apostles is here intended. I have no objection to that view; for
      they were in the habit of glorying in the name of men. His meaning will
      therefore stand thus: "Whoever may be the persons by whom others boast
      that they have been sent, I shall be superior to them; for I hold my
      commission from God and Christ."
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>By Jesus Christ and God the Father.</em> He asserts that God the
      Father and Christ had bestowed on him his apostleship. Christ is first
      named, because it is his prerogative to send, and because we are his
      ambassadors. But to make the statement more complete, the Father is also
      mentioned; as if he had said, "If there be any one whom the name of Christ
      is not sufficient to inspire with reverence, let him know that I have also
      received my office from God the Father."
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Who raised him from the dead</em>. The resurrection of Christ is the
      commencement of his reign, and is therefore closely connected with the
      present subject. It was a reproach brought by them against Paul that he
      had held no communication with Christ, while he was on the earth. He
      argues, on the other hand, that, as Christ was glorified by his
      resurrection, so he has actually exercised his authority in the government
      of his church. The calling of Paul is therefore more illustrious than it
      would have been, if Christ, while still a mortal, had ordained him to the
      office. And this circumstance deserves attention; for Paul intimates that
      the attempt to set aside his authority, involved a malignant opposition to
      the astonishing power of God, which was displayed in the resurrection of
      Christ; because the same heavenly Father, who raised Christ from the dead,
      commanded Paul to make known that exertion of his power.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em
        >and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>And all the brethren who are with me</em>. -- He appears to have
      usually written in the name of many persons, judging that, if those to
      whom he wrote should attach less weight to a solitary individual, they
      might listen to a greater number, and would not despise a whole
      congregation. His general practice is, to insert the salutations from
      brethren at the conclusion, instead of introducing them at the
      commencement as joint authors of the epistle: at least, he never mentions
      more than two names, and those very well known. But here he includes all
      the brethren; and thus adopts, though not without good reason, an opposite
      method. The concurrence of so many godly persons must have had some degree
      of influence in softening the minds of the Galatians, and preparing them
      to receive instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>To the churches of Galatia</em>. It was an extensive country, and
      therefore contained many churches scattered through it. But is it not
      wonderful that the term "Church", which always implies unity of faith,
      should have been applied to the Galatians, who had almost entirely
      revolted from Christ? I reply, so long as they professed Christianity,
      worshipped one God, observed the sacraments, and enjoyed some kind of
      Gospel ministry, they retained the external marks of a church. We do not
      always find in churches such a measure of purity as might be desired. The
      purest have their blemishes; and some are marked, not by a few spots, but
      by general deformity. Though the doctrines and practices of any society
      may not, in all respects, meet our wishes, we must not instantly pronounce
      its defects to be a sufficient reason for withholding from it the
      appellation of a Church. Paul manifests here a gentleness of disposition
      utterly at variance with such a course. Yet our acknowledgment of
      societies to be churches of Christ must be accompanied by an explicit
      condemnation of everything in them that is improper or defective; for we
      must not imagine, that, wherever there is some kind of church, everything
      in it that ought to be desired in a church is perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I make this observation, because the Papists, seizing on the single word
      Church, think that whatever they choose to force upon us is sanctioned;
      though the condition and aspect of the Church of Rome are widely different
      from what existed in Galatia. If Paul were alive at the present day, he
      would perceive the miserable and dreadfully shattered remains of a church;
      but he would perceive no building. In short, the word Church is often
      applied by a figure of speech in which a part is taken for the whole, to
      any portion of the church, even though it may not fully answer to the
      name.

    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus
        Christ,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Grace be to you and peace</em>. The terms of grace and peace are
      common terms with Paul and are now pretty well understood. But since we
      are explaining this epistle, you will not mind if we repeat what we have
      so often explained elsewhere. The article of justification must be sounded
      in our ears incessantly because the frailty of our flesh will not permit
      us to take hold of it perfectly and to believe it with all our heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing. Grace remits sin, and peace
      quiets the conscience. Sin and conscience torment us, but Christ has
      overcome these fiends now and forever. Only Christians possess this
      victorious knowledge given from above. These two terms, grace and peace,
      constitute Christianity. Grace involves the remission of sins, peace, and
      a happy conscience. Sin is not canceled by lawful living, for no person is
      able to live up to the Law. The Law reveals guilt, fills the conscience
      with terror, and drives men to despair. Much less is sin taken away by
      man-invented endeavors. The fact is, the more a person seeks credit for
      himself by his own efforts, the deeper he goes into debt. Nothing can take
      away sin except the grace of God. In actual living, however, it is not so
      easy to persuade oneself that by grace alone, in opposition to every other
      means, we obtain the forgiveness of our sins and peace with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world brands this a pernicious doctrine. The world advances free will,
      the rational and natural approach of good works, as the means of obtaining
      the forgiveness of sin. But it is impossible to gain peace of conscience
      by the methods and means of the world. Experience proves this. Various
      holy orders have been launched for the purpose of securing peace of
      conscience through religious exercises, but they proved failures because
      such devices only increase doubt and despair. We find no rest for our
      weary bones unless we cling to the word of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apostle does not wish the Galatians grace and peace from the emperor,
      or from kings, or from governors, but from God the Father. He wishes them
      heavenly peace, the kind of which Jesus spoke when He said, "Peace I leave
      unto you: my peace I give unto you." Worldly peace provides quiet
      enjoyment of life and possessions. But in affliction, particularly in the
      hour of death, the grace and peace of the world will not deliver us.
      However, the grace and peace of God will. They make a person strong and
      courageous to bear and to overcome all difficulties, even death itself,
      because we have the victory of Christ's death and the assurance of the
      forgiveness of our sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, Paul confirms our creed, "that Christ is very God." We
      need such frequent confirmation of our faith, for Satan will not fail to
      attack it. He hates our faith. He knows that it is the victory which
      overcometh him and the world. That Christ is very God is apparent in that
      Paul ascribes to Him divine powers equally with the Father, as for
      instance, the power to dispense grace and peace. This Jesus could not do
      unless He were God.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bestow peace and grace lies in the province of God, who alone can
      create these blessings. The angels cannot. The apostles could only
      distribute these blessings by the preaching of the Gospel. In attributing
      to Christ the divine power of creating and giving grace, peace,
      everlasting life, righteousness, and forgiveness of sins, the conclusion
      is inevitable that Christ is truly God. Similarly, St. John concludes from
      the works attributed to the Father and the Son that they are divinely One.
      Hence, the gifts which we receive from the Father and from the Son are one
      and the same. Otherwise Paul should have written: "Grace from God the
      Father, and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ." In combining them he
      ascribes them equally to the Father and the Son. I stress this on account
      of the many errors emanating from the sects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Arians were sharp fellows. Admitting that Christ had two natures, and
      that He is called "very God of very God," they were yet able to deny His
      divinity. The Arians took Christ for a noble and perfect creature,
      superior even to the angels, because by Him God created heaven and earth.
      Mohammed also speaks highly of Christ. But all their praise is mere
      palaver to deceive men. Paul's language is different. To paraphrase him:
      "You are established in this belief that Christ is very God because He
      gives grace and peace, gifts which only God can create and bestow."
    </p>

    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em
        >who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this
        present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>Who gave himself for our sins</em>. He begins with commending the
      grace of Christ, in order to recall and fix on Him the attention of the
      Galatians; for, if they had justly appreciated this benefit of redemption,
      they would never have fallen into opposite views of religion. He who knows
      Christ in a proper manner beholds him earnestly, embraces him with the
      warmest affection, is absorbed in the contemplation of him, and desires no
      other object. The best remedy for purifying our minds from any kind of
      errors or superstitions, is to keep in remembrance our relation to Christ,
      and the benefits which he has conferred upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words,
      <em>who gave himself for our sins</em>, were intended to convey to the
      Galatians a doctrine of vast importance; that no other satisfactions can
      lawfully be brought into comparison with that sacrifice of himself which
      Christ offered to the Father; that in Christ, therefore, and in him alone,
      atonement for sin, and perfect righteousness, must be sought; and that the
      manner in which we are redeemed by him ought to excite our highest
      admiration. What Paul here ascribes to Christ is, with equal propriety,
      ascribed in other parts of Scripture to God the Father; for, on the one
      hand, the Father, by an eternal purpose, decreed this atonement, and gave
      this proof of his love to us, that he "spared not his only-begotten Son,
      (Romans 8:32), but delivered him up for us all;" and Christ, on the other
      hand, offered himself a sacrifice in order to reconcile us to God. Hence
      it follows, that his death is the satisfaction for sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>That he might deliver us</em>. He likewise declares the design of our
      redemption to be, that Christ, by his death, might purchase us to be his
      own property. This takes place when we are separated from the world; for
      so long as we are of the world, we do not belong to Christ. The word
      <em>age</em> is here put for the corruption which is in the world; in the
      same manner as in the first Epistle of John, (1 John 5:19) where it is
      said that "the whole world lieth in the wicked one," and in his Gospel,
      (John 17:15), where the Savior says, "I pray not that thou shouldst take
      them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil;"
      for there it signifies the present life. What then is meant by the word
      "World" in this passage? Men separated from the kingdom of God and the
      grace of Christ. So long as a man lives to himself, he is altogether
      condemned. The World is, therefore, contrasted with regeneration, as
      nature with grace, or the flesh with the spirit. Those who are born of the
      world have nothing but sin and wickedness, not by creation, but by
      corruption. Christ, therefore, died for our sins, in order to redeem or
      separate us from the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>From the present wicked age</em>. By adding the epithet "wicked", he
      intended to show that he is speaking of the corruption or depravity which
      proceeds from sin, and not of God's creatures, or of the bodily life. And
      yet by this single word, as by a thunderbolt, he lays low all human pride;
      for he declares, that, apart from that renewal of the nature which is
      bestowed by the grace of Christ, there is nothing in us but unmixed
      wickedness. We are of the world; and, till Christ take us out of it, the
      world reigns in us, and we live to the world. Whatever delight men may
      take in their fancied excellence, they are worthless and depraved; not
      indeed in their own opinion, but in the judgment of our Lord, which is
      here pronounced by the mouth of Paul, and which ought to satisfy our
      minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the will. He points out the original fountain of grace,
      namely, the purpose of God; "for God so loved the world, that he gave his
      only-begotten Son." (John 3:16). But it deserves notice, that Paul is
      accustomed to represent the decree of God as setting aside all
      compensation or merit on the part of men, and so Will denotes here what is
      commonly called "good pleasure." The meaning is, that Christ suffered for
      us, not because we were worthy, or because anything done by us moved him
      to the act, but because such was the purpose of God. Of God and our Father
      is of the same import as if he had said, "Of God who is our Father."
    </p>

    <h2>Ver 5. <em>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</em></h2>
    <p>
      <em>To whom be glory</em>. By this sudden exclamation of thanksgiving, he
      intends to awaken powerfully in his readers the contemplation of that
      invaluable gift which they had received from God, and in this manner to
      prepare their minds more fully for receiving instruction. It must at the
      same time be viewed as a general exhortation. Every instance in which the
      mercy of God occurs to our remembrance, ought to be embraced by us as an
      occasion of ascribing glory to God.

      Justin Martyr writes, "But to give you the account of the revelation of
      the holy Jesus Christ, I take up again my discourse, and I assert that
      even that revelation was made for us who believe in Christ the High
      Priest, namely this crucified One; and though we lived in fornication and
      all kinds of filthy conversation, we have by the grace of our Jesus,
      according to His Father's will, stripped ourselves of all those filthy
      wickednesses with which we were imbued... even so we, who through the name
      of Jesus have believed as one man in God the Maker of all, have been
      stripped, through the name of His first-begotten Son, of the filthy
      garments, i.e., of our sins; and being vehemently inflamed by the word of
      His calling, we are the true high priestly race of God, as even God
      Himself bears witness, saying that in every place among the Gentiles
      sacrifices are presented to Him well-pleasing and pure. Now God receives
      sacrifices from no one, except through His priests." (<a

      John Chrysostom comments, "Not only this exordium, but, so to speak, the
      whole Epistle, is full of a vehement and lofty spirit. For always to
      address one's disciples with mildness, even when they needed severity,
      would be to play the corrupter and enemy, not the teacher. Wherefore our
      Lord too, who generally spoke gently to His disciples, here and there uses
      sterner language, and at one time pronounces a blessing, at another a
      rebuke" (<a

      F. F. Bruce comments, "The question of the North or South Galatian
      destination of our epistle is not one in which it is proper to take up
      partisan attitudes or indulge in dogmatic assertions; and it ill becomes
      champions of either view to disparage the rival view of those who maintain
      it. The fact that so many competent scholars can be cited in support of
      either position suggests that the evidence for neither is absolutely
      conclusive. But the weight of the evidence, it seems to me, favours the
      South Galatian view. If the Epistle to the Galatians was indeed addressed
      to the churches of Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra and Oerbe, then we
      have important historical, geographical, literary and epigraphic data
      which will provide material for its better understanding." (<a

      Martin Luther comments, "The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing. Grace
      remits sin, and peace quiets the conscience. Sin and conscience torment
      us, but Christ has overcome these fiends now and forever. Only Christians
      possess this victorious knowledge given from above. These two terms, grace
      and peace, constitute Christianity. Grace involves the remission of sins,
      peace, and a happy conscience. Sin is not canceled by lawful living, for
      no person is able to live up to the Law. The Law reveals guilt, fills the
      conscience with terror, and drives men to despair. Much less is sin taken
      away by man-invented endeavors. The fact is, the more a person seeks
      credit for himself by his own efforts, the deeper he goes into debt.
      Nothing can take away sin except the grace of God. In actual living,
      however, it is not so easy to persuade oneself that by grace alone, in
      opposition to every other means, we obtain the forgiveness of our sins and
      peace with God." (<a

      God in whom he recognizes 'our Father,' and with him Jesus Christ, 'our
      Lord;' that is, our Master, Head, Mediator, 'through whom are all things,
      and we through him.' Grace and peace coming down from heaven, must come
      from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. From the very nature of the
      case it is obvious that the blessings referred to come to us through
      Christ, though also 'from' him; as also that St. Paul's delegation as
      apostle, spoken of in the first verse, originated from a volition and
      appointment of God the Father, as well as was brought about 'through' the
      ordering of his providence." (<a

      to attend to the following considerations, O emperors, on both points. And
      first, as to our not sacrificing: the Framer and Father of this universe
      does not need blood, nor the odour of burnt-offerings, nor the fragrance
      of flowers and incense,40 for as much as He is Himself perfect fragrance,
      needing nothing either within or without; but the noblest sacrifice41 to
      Him is for us to know who stretched out and vaulted the heavens, and fixed
      the earth in its place like a centre, who gathered the water into seas and
      divided the light from the darkness, who adorned the sky with stars and
      made the earth to bring forth seed of every kind, who made animals and

      temptations to which we are exposed as long as we continue in it. But, 2.
      Jesus Christ has died to deliver us from this present evil world, not
      presently to remove his people out of it, but to rescue them from the
      power of it, to keep them from the evil of it, and in due time to possess
      them of another and better world. This, the apostle informs us, he has
      done
      <em>according to the will of God and our Father</em>. In offering up
      himself a sacrifice for this end and purpose, he acted by the appointment
      of the Father, as well as with his own free consent; and therefore we have

      the glory of the Father: even as God promised by the prophet, saying:
      <em>And I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen</em>; that
      is, the flesh that was from David. And this our Lord Jesus Christ truly
      fulfilled, when He gloriously achieved our redemption, that He might truly
      raise us up, setting us free unto the Father. And if any man will not
      receive His birth from a virgin, how shall he receive His resurrection
      from the dead? For it is nothing wonderful and astonishing and
      extraordinary, if one who was not born rose from the dead: nay indeed we
      cannot speak of a resurrection of him who came unto being without birth.
      For one who is unborn and immortal, and has not undergone birth, will also
      not undergo death. For he who took not the beginning of man, how could he
      receive his end?" (<a

      world; for the whole earth is full of the mercy of the Lord, and His
      goodness is over all His works. Therefore he who has no perception of that
      fragrance, sweet, life giving, and everywhere diffused, and because of
      this does not run after Christ, is either dead, or he is corrupt... And
      the great fragrance of Thy righteousness is spread abroad upon every side,
