      Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ,
      and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— and all the brothers who
      are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia: Grace to you and peace from God
      the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that
      he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of
      our God and Father— to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

      I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace
      of Christ to a different “good news”, but there isn’t another “good news.”
      Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of
      Christ. But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you
      any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be
      cursed. As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to
      you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.
