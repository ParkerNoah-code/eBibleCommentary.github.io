    >, Chapter 11. Of Patience:
  </p>
  <p>
    Without patience there can be no real self-denial, nor true submission to
    the will of God in adversity; nor contentment in every state; nor
    thankfulness for every mercy; it is what accompanies every grace, as faith,
    hope, and love; hence we read of &quot;the work of faith, and labor of love,
    and patience of hope,&quot; as together in the same persons, remembered by
    the apostle (1 Thessalonians 1:3), and to the exercise of every grace this
    of patience is to be added (2 Peter 1:5,6), and this, with other graces, is
    to be eagerly pursued, closely followed after, and constantly exercised (1
    Timothy 6:11), it is so necessary in the things of God, that one a stranger
    to this grace, as Tertullian observes, cannot undertake to perform any
    command, nor do any work that is acceptable to the Lord. Concerning which
    may be inquired,
  </p>
  <p>1. First, in what it lies, or wherein is the exercise of it.</p>
  <p>
    1a. In patiently bearing afflictions, of whatever kind it pleases God to
    exercise with; hence the exhortation to &quot;be patient in
    tribulation&quot; (Romans 12:12), afflictions are the lot of the children of
    God, who are described as a poor and afflicted people; these are what they
    are appointed unto, what Christ has given them reason to expect in this
    world, and of which all the children of God are partakers; for if without
    them, they are bastards, and not sons; and therefore should be patiently
    bore: every follower of Christ has a cross, his own peculiar cross; which he
    is to take up willingly and bear cheerfully; &quot;a Christian is a cross
    bearer,&quot; as Luther used to say; nor should we be impatient under it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Afflictions lie in the way to the heavenly glory, which is a &quot;narrow
    way,&quot; an afflicted way, strewn with afflictions; and through this rough
    way all Christian pilgrims and travelers pass, and enter the kingdom; so did
    Christ himself; and before long they will come to the end of it, and out of
    great tribulations, and therefore should patiently endure them. They are no
    other than fatherly chastisements, given in love, and for good; and sooner
    or later apparently issue in good, either here or hereafter, and therefore
    to be yielded to with filial reverence and subjection; and though in
    themselves not joyous, but grievous; yet since peaceable fruits of
    righteousness follow them, those who are exercised with them, should be
    content to bear them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now to the exercise of patience under afflictions, murmurings, and repinings
    at them, and complainings of them, are opposite. Nor should saints be in
    haste to be rid of them, but wait the Lord&#x27;s time; nor make use of any
    unlawful methods to get out of them; but should be willing they should take
    their course, and should let patience have its perfect work.
  </p>
  <p>
    1b. The exercise of patience lies in bearing reproach and persecution for
    the sake of Christ and his gospel; they that will live godly in Christ must
    expect these things; they are not to be thought new and strange, as if they
    were never before known or heard of; nor should saints he impatient under
    them. Moses esteemed reproach for Christ&#x27;s sake greater riches than the
    treasures of Egypt; and the apostles rejoiced that they were counted worthy
    to suffer shame for the name of Christ; yes more than this, the followers of
    Christ have been called unto in all ages, especially in the first ages of
    Christianity, under Rome pagan, and since under Rome papal, even to endure
    the most cruel persecutions and severe deaths; after an account of which
    this observation is made, &quot;Here is the patience and faith of the
    saints;&quot; that is, the trial of their patience and faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    And we are not yet out of anti-christian times; the reign of antichrist is
    not yet at an end: and whatever saints are called to suffer for the sake of
    Christ, is cheerfully to be submitted to and patiently endured; nor should
    they desert their station, nor withdraw themselves from their duty, nor drop
    their profession, nor forsake the fellowship of the saints, and be like the
    stony ground hearer, who by and by is offended, withdraws himself, and is
    gone.
  </p>
  <p>
    1c. Patience is tried and exercised in and by the temptations of Satan; our
    Lord suffered much himself, being tempted; and with what patience did he
    endure his sufferings by them, repelling every temptation only by saying,
    &quot;It is written&quot; so and so; though at the last temptation, and
    which was the most insolent and audacious, he added, &quot;Get you hence,
    Satan.&quot; Saints have reason to bear them all patiently; since Christ
    their High Priest not only sympathizes with them, but helps them when
    tempted, and prays for them, that their faith fail not; and still the more,
    since he assures them his grace is sufficient for them, to bear them up
    under temptations, and carry through them, and that his strength shall be
    made perfect in their weakness, to deliver out of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    1d. Patience is exercised by divine desertions, and lies in quietly waiting
    for the Lord&#x27;s gracious manifestations of himself unto his people
    again. Sometimes they are impatient on this account, and inquire the reason
    of it, and say, &quot;Why hide you yourself?&quot; and complain of the
    length of time, and ask, &quot;How long will you hide your face from
    me?&quot; (Psalm 10:1; 13:1), thinking the time of desertion so long as to
    be a sort of eternity; and, indeed, unbelief sometimes suggests, that God
    has cast off forever, and will be favorable no more; but at other times we
    find the saints more patient, and in more quiet and waiting postures; as the
    prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 8:17), and more especially the church, under the
    hidings of God&#x27;s face (Micah 7:7-10).
  </p>
  <p>
    1e. Patience is exercised when answers of prayer are deferred, and it lies
    in a quiet waiting for them. Sometimes the Lord&#x27;s people are very
    uneasy and impatient because they are not immediately answered, and imagine
    that God has covered himself with a cloud, that their prayer cannot pass
    through; or that he has turned a deaf ear to them, and will never regard
    them; though the vision is for an appointed time, and therefore should be
    waited for until that time comes, when it will not tarry; and so it has been
    found by experience; as by David (Psalm 40:1,2).
  </p>
  <p>
    1f. This grace appears and shows itself in a patient waiting for the
    heavenly glory; sometimes the saints are impatient, and want to depart, and
    be in the enjoyment of it before God&#x27;s time, because of the
    afflictions, trials, and exercises they meet with in life; which does not
    become them; instances of which were Elijah, Job, Jonah, and others: but
    afflictions are to be endured patiently, in expectation of glory; since it
    is but a short time they will last; a little while and he who shall come
    will come, and will not tarry; and therefore they have need of, and should
    exercise patience in doing the will of God, that they may receive the
    promises; and should consider that their afflictions are but for a moment,
    as well as light, when compared with the eternal weight of glory that will
    shortly follow; and therefore should hope and quietly wait for it (Romans
    8:25). I shall next consider,
  </p>
  <p>2. Secondly, the causes of this grace, and from whence it comes.</p>
  <p>
    2a. The efficient cause is God, from whom every good and perfect gift comes;
    and as this is a gift, as every grace is, and a good one in its nature, use,
    and consequences; and is a perfect one, when it has its perfect work and
    effect, it must come from God; and hence he is called, &quot;The God of
    patience,&quot; because he is the author of it, as well as requires it, and
    it is exercised towards him, by whom seems to be meant God, even the Father
    of our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 15:5,6).
  </p>
  <p>
    We read also of the &quot;patience of Christ,&quot; and of being directed
    into it, as well as into the love of God (2 Thessalonians 3:5), and which
    may signify, not only the patience exercised by Christ in his human nature,
    amidst all his afflictions and sufferings; but what he works in the hearts
    of his people, and encourages them to exercise; for as he is the author and
    finisher of faith, so of patience; and the saints are companions of one
    another in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ: and even his patience
    as man is the exemplar and pattern of theirs; for he has left an example of
    it, that they may tread in his steps; and certain it is, that longsuffering,
    or patience, which is the same, is a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22),
    so that all the three Persons are concerned in it.
  </p>
  <p>
    2b. The instrumental causes of it are the scriptures, and word of God and
    Christ; which are written, &quot;that we through patience and comfort of the
    scriptures might have hope;&quot; which, as they are the means of
    instruction and consolation, so of patience. The word of God encourages to
    it, furnishes with arguments for the exercise of it, and gives instances and
    examples of it, exciting thereunto; hence
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ calls it, the word of his patience; &quot;Because you have kept the
    word of my patience&quot; (Revelation 3:10), and this word, accompanied with
    a divine power, and received into a good heart, made so by the Spirit of
    God, &quot;brings forth fruit with patience,&quot; and patience is one of
    its fruits (Luke 8:13).
  </p>
  <p>
    2c. Afflictions themselves are a means of increasing it, for afflictions try
    faith; and the &quot;trying of faith works patience,&quot; and brings that
    into exercise, and inures unto it; yes, it is expressly said, that
    &quot;tribulation works patience,&quot; that is, when sanctified; otherwise
    it produces impatience and murmurings (James 1:3; Romans 5:3). I proceed to
    observe,
  </p>
  <p>3. Thirdly, the usefulness of this grace, and the exercise of it. As,</p>
  <p>
    3a. It makes a man comfortable and happy in himself; without this a man
    cannot enjoy himself, his mercies and his friends; hence the advice of
    Christ to his disciples, &quot;In your patience possess you your souls&quot;
    (Luke 21:19), an impatient man can have no enjoyment of himself, nor of
    anything he has; he is always restless and uneasy, and has no peace in
    himself; whereas a man possessed of patience, and in the exercise of it, has
    a peace which the world can, neither give nor take away, a peace in the
    midst of tribulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    3b. It is of great use in running the Christian race; &quot;Let us run with
    patience the race that is set before us&quot; (Hebrews 12:1), by the race is
    meant the Christian&#x27;s course of life in this world, and what still
    remains of it to be run out; the prize run for is the prize of the high
    calling, the heavenly glory, the crown of life, glory, and righteousness,
    laid up in Heaven; this race is &quot;set before us,&quot; the way is marked
    out in which we are to run; the rubs, the troubles, the impediments to be
    met with in the way are appointed; the mark to direct and steer the course
    by, and which is always to be had in view, is Christ, who is the hope set
    before us in the gospel; the length of the course to be run is fixed, the
    whole time of life, every year, month, day, and moment: and it requires
    patience to run it; partly through the length of the race, which sometimes
    appears tedious; and partly because of the troubles, difficulties, and
    discouragements in the way; and likewise because of the prize saints long to
    be in the enjoyment of.
  </p>
  <p>
    3c. There is need of it, and of its exercise, in &quot;doing the will of
    God,&quot; in order to receive the promise (Hebrews 10:36), by doing the
    will of God is not so much meant obeying the preceptive will of God, as to
    submit to the will of God respecting afflictions and sufferings for his
    sake; for it is given, and it is the will of God, not only that men should
    believe in Christ, and follow him, but that they should &quot;suffer for his
    sake;&quot; and to do this requires patience, and a quiet submission to the
    will of God; which is the way to be quiet, patient, and humble under his
    mighty hand, while suffering according to his will (1 Peter 4:19), and so
    patience is necessary to receive the promise, the promised glory, after the
    will of God is done in a way of suffering; for the promise is made to him
    that endures patiently; &quot;Blessed is the man that endures temptation,
    afflictions with patience; he shall receive the crown of life; obtain the
    promise, as Abraham did, and through faith and patience inherit it&quot;
    (James 1:12; Hebrews 6:12,15).
  </p>
  <p>
    3d. Another use of the grace of patience is, that when it has its perfect
    work, saints become perfect also (James 1:4 this grace is imperfect, as all
    others are, faith, hope, love, knowledge, etc. and even in the best, and in
    such who have been most eminent for it, as Job particularly; and yet what
    impatience was he guilty of at times? though it may be increased, as every
    other grace; for as there is such a thing as growing in grace in general, so
    in any grace in particular, and in this also: when it is said, that
    &quot;tribulation works patience,&quot; the meaning is, that it is the means
    and occasion of increasing it. And it may be said to be perfect, when it
    appears to be sincere and genuine, as it does by its being tried by
    afflictions; and it has its &quot;perfect work&quot; when it is constant in
    its exercise, and continues to the end; and then will the saints be perfect,
    which they are not now in themselves, only in Christ their head; but when
    this grace, and every other, shall be perfect, then will they be perfect in
    holiness and happiness, as they will be at the resurrection in soul and
    body, and be entire, complete, and want nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Fourthly, the motives or arguments exciting to the exercise of this
    grace, may next be considered,
  </p>
  <p>
    4a. It is what God calls his people to; as to suffer for well doing, so to
    take suffering for well doing patiently; &quot;For even hereunto were you
    called,&quot; that is, to take it patiently (1 Peter 2:21), hence these
    frequent exhortations to it; &quot;Be patient in tribulation; be patient
    towards all men; be patient, brethren;&quot; and again, be you also patient;
    and which is enforced and exemplified in the case of the gardener, patiently
    waiting for the fruits of the earth, after much trouble, toil, and labor;
    see (Romans 12:12 1; Thessalonians 5:14; James 5:7,8).
  </p>
  <p>
    4b. The exercise of this grace is taken notice of, approved of, and
    commended by God (1 Peter 2:20), hence Christ, in his epistles to the
    churches, frequently observes, with commendation, their patience among other
    things; &quot;I know your patience&quot; (Revelation 2:2,3,19; 3:10).
  </p>
  <p>
    4c. It is commendable in the sight of good men; Solomon extols it
    (Ecclesiastes 7:8), and the apostle Paul glories in the Thessalonians for it
    (1 Thessalonians 1:3; 2 Thessalonians 1:4), a meek and patient Christian is
    not only in the sight of God of great price, but is very amiable in the
    sight of good men.
  </p>
  <p>
    4d. The patience of God exercised towards his people may be improved into an
    argument exciting to it. The Lord is patient and longsuffering towards his
    people before conversion, while they are doing those things which might
    justly provoke the eyes of his glory; fulfilling the desires of the flesh
    and of the mind, being by nature children of wrath, as others; yet he is
    patient, and bears long with them, waiting to be gracious to them, and to
    have mercy, on them (Isaiah 30:18), and after conversion, he bears with
    their many provocations, backslidings, and revoltings from him; and, indeed,
    his patience with a wicked world, in not destroying it sooner, is for the
    sake of his chosen ones, waiting until they are called and brought to
    repentance; the longsuffering of the Lord is salvation to them (2 Peter
    3:9,15).
  </p>
  <p>
    4e. The example of Christ, and of his patience, is very strong and forcible,
    and engaging to it; &quot;Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an
    example,&quot; not of sufferings only, but of patience in them, that we
    should follow his steps in the exercise of this grace, and learn patience of
    him, as well as meekness and lowliness of mind (1 Peter 2:22,23), we should
    consider him who &quot;endured the cross&quot; with so much patience, and
    the &quot;contradiction of sinners against himself&quot; with so much
    mildness and meekness; lest we be &quot;wearied, and faint in our
    minds,&quot; and grow impatient; this may animate to patience and long
    suffering.
  </p>
  <p>
    4f. The examples of the saints in all ages may serve to encourage to the
    exercise of patience; of the prophets of the Old Testament; of the apostles
    of Christ; and of the martyrs of Jesus; and of other saints; and
    particularly Job; &quot;You have heard of the patience of Job,&quot; who was
    remarkable for it, when his afflictions came so thick, and fast, and heavy
    upon him; &quot;and have seen the end of the Lord,&quot; in his afflictions,
    and how they issued (James 5:10,11), and those examples are on record to
    encourage the saints to be &quot;followers of them&quot; (Hebrews 6:12).
  </p>
  <p>
    4g. The near coming of Christ is made use of to stir up to patience; it is
    but a little while and he will come that shall come; and then there will be
    an end of all afflictions and sufferings; &quot;Be patient therefore,
    brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Again, Be you also patient, for the
    coming of the Lord draws near&quot; (James 5:7,8), redemption draws near,
    suffering times will soon be over; the summer is at band, halcyon days will
    come; peace will be like a river, and the glory of the church like a flowing
    stream!
