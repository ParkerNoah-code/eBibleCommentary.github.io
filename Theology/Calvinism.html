    The Calvinistic system especially emphasizes five distinct doctrines. These
    are technically known as “The Five Points of Calvinism,” and they are the
    main pillars upon which the superstructure rests. In this section we shall
    examine each of these, giving the Scripture basis and the arguments from
    reason which support them. We shall then consider the objections which are
    commonly brought against them.

    As will be shown, the Bible contains an abundance of material for the
    development of each of these doctrines. Furthermore, these are not isolated
    and independent doctrines but are so inter-related that they form a simple,
    harmonious, self-consistent system; and the way in which they fit together
    as component parts of a well-ordered whole has won the admiration of
    thinking men of all creeds. Prove any one of them true and all the others
    will follow as logical and necessary parts of the system. Prove any one of
    them false and the whole system must be abandoned. They are found to
    dovetail perfectly one into the other. They are so many links in the great
    chain of causes, and not one of them can be taken away without marring and
    subverting the whole Gospel plan of salvation through Christ. We cannot
    conceive of this agreement arising merely by accident, nor even being
    possible, unless these doctrines are true.

    Let it be borne in mind that in this book we do not propose to discuss in
    detail those other doctrines of the Scriptures which are accepted by
    evangelical Christendom, but to set forth and defend those which are
    peculiar to the Calvinistic system. Unless this be kept in mind much of the
    real strength and beauty of generic Calvinism will be lost and the so-called
    “Five Points of Calvinism,” — which historically and in reality are the
    obverse of what might be called the “Five Points of Arminianism,” — will
    assume undue prominence in the system. Let the reader, then, guard against a
    too close identification of the Five Points and the Calvinistic system.
    While these are essential elements, the system really includes much more. As
    stated in the Introduction, the Westminster Confession is a balanced
    statement of the Reformed Faith or Calvinism, and it gives due prominence to
    the other Christian doctrines.

    The Five Points may be more easily remembered if they are associated with
    the word T-U-L-l-P; T, Total Inability; U, Unconditional Election; L,
    Limited Atonement; l, irresistible (Efficacious) Grace; and P, Perseverance
    of the Saints.
