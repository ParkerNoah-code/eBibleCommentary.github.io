        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Definition</p>
        <p>
          Logic is the science that explains what conditions must be fulfilled
          in order that a proposition may be proved, if it admits of proof. It
          deals with qualitative propositions like those in literature,
          politics, philosophy, and the sciences so far as they are not treated
          mathematically to show how we may judge whether they are true, or
          false, or doubtful.
        </p>
        <p>Analysis of Propositions</p>
        <p>
          Logic discusses the proof or disproof, or simply the testing of
          propositions. Therefore we must look at the nature of propositions to
          understand how they work.
        </p>
        <p>Denotation and Connotation of Terms</p>
        <p>
          In treating of Deductive Logic it is usual to recognise three
          divisions of the subject: first, the doctrine of Terms, words, or
          other signs used as subjects or predicates; secondly, the doctrine of
          Propositions, analysed into terms related; and, thirdly, the doctrine
          of the Syllogism in which propositions appear as the grounds of a
          conclusion. Terms are next to be classified according to their
          Connotationâ€”that is, according to what they imply as characteristic of
          the things denoted.
        </p>
        <p>Classification of Terms and Propositions</p>
        <p>
          Logicians classify Propositions according to Quantity, Quality,
          Relation and Modality.
        </p>
        <p>Inferences</p>
        <p>
          The word Inference is used in two different senses, which are often
          confused but should be carefully distinguished. In the first sense, it
          means a process of thought or reasoning by which the mind passes from
          facts or statements presented, to some opinion or expectation. The
          data may be very vague and slight, prompting no more than a guess or
          surmise. In the second sense, 'inference' means not this process of
          guessing or opining, but the result of it; the surmise, opinion, or
          belief when formed; in a word, the conclusion: and it is in this sense
          that Inference is treated of in Logic.
        </p>
        <p>Syllogisms</p>
        <p>
          A Mediate Inference is a proposition that depends for proof upon two
          or more other propositions, so connected together by one or more terms
          (which the evidentiary propositions, or each pair of them, have in
          common) as to justify a certain conclusion, namely, the proposition in
          question. The type or (more properly) the unit of all such modes of
          proof, when of a strictly logical kind, is the Syllogism, to which we
          shall see that all other modes are reducible.
        </p>
        <p>Induction</p>
        <p>
          An Induction is an universal real proposition, based on observation,
          in reliance on the uniformity of Nature: when well ascertained, it is
          called a Law. It is proved by facts, not merely deduced from more
          general premises.
        </p>
        <p>Causation</p>
        <p>
          For the theory of Induction, the specially important aspect of the
          Uniformity of Nature is Causation. It is nothing occult, but merely a
          convenient name for phenomena in a particular relation to other
          phenomena, called their effect. Similarly, if the word 'force' is
          sometimes used for convenience in analysing causation, it means
          nothing more than something in time and space, itself moving, or
          tending to move, or hindering or accelerating other things.
        </p>
        <p>Hypotheses</p>
        <p>
          An Hypothesis, sometimes employed instead of a known law, as a premise
          in the deductive investigation of nature, is any supposition which we
          make (either without actual evidence, or on evidence avowedly
          insufficient) in order to endeavour to deduce from it conclusions in
          accordance with facts which are known to be real; under the idea that
          if the conclusions to which the hypothesis leads are known truths, the
          hypothesis itself either must be, or at least is likely to be, true.
        </p>
        <p>Probability</p>
        <p>
          Chance is the fact of coincidence without assignable cause.
          Probability is expectation based on the average frequency of its
          happening.
        </p>
        <p>Fallacies</p>
        <p>
          A Fallacy is any failure to fulfil the conditions of proof. If we
          neglect or mistake the conditions of proof unintentionally, whether in
          our private meditations or in addressing others, it is a Paralogism:
          but if we endeavour to pass off upon others evidence or argument which
          we know or suspect to be unsound, it is a Sophism. The Formal, or
          those that can be shown to conflict with one or more of the truths of
          Logic, whether Deductive or Inductive. The Material, or those that
          cannot be clearly exhibited as transgressions of any logical
          principle, but are due to superficial inquiry or confused reasoning;
          as in adopting premises on insufficient authority, or without
          examining the facts; or in mistaking the point to be proved.
