        <h2>Proofs that Scripture is the Word of God</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="Proofs/Miracles.html">Miracles</a>: A miracle is an event in
          nature, so extraordinary in itself and so coinciding with the prophecy
          or command of a religious teacher or leader, as fully to warrant the
          conviction, on the part of those who witness it, that God has wrought
          it with the design of certifying that this teacher or leader has been
          commissioned by him. The resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ—by
          which we mean his coming forth from the sepulchre in body as well as
          in spirit—is demonstrated by evidence as varied and as conclusive as
          that which proves to us any single fact of ancient history. Without it
          Christianity itself is inexplicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Proofs/Prophecy.html">Prophecy</a>: Prophecy is the
          foretelling of future events by virtue of direct communication from
          God—a foretelling, therefore, which, though not contravening any laws
          of the human mind, those laws, if fully known, would not, without this
          agency of God, be sufficient to explain. Miracles are attestations of
          revelation proceeding from divine power; prophecy is an attestation of
          revelation proceeding from divine knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Proofs/Testimony.html">Testimony</a>: The credit due to the
          testimony of witnesses depends upon: first, their ability; secondly,
          their honesty; thirdly, their number and the consistency of their
          testimony; fourthly, the conformity of their testimony with
          experience; and fifthly, the coincidence of their testimony with
          collateral circumstances. We confidently submit the New Testament
          witnesses to each and all of these tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Unity.html">Unity</a>: In spite of its variety of authorship
          and the vast separation of its writers from one another in point of
          time, there is a unity of subject, spirit, and aim throughout the
          whole. Each of these writings, whether early or late, has represented
          moral and religious ideas greatly in advance of the age in which it
          has appeared, and these ideas still lead the world. It is impossible
          to account for this unity without supposing such a supernatural
          suggestion and control that the Bible, while in its various parts
          written by human agents, is yet equally the work of a superhuman
          intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Loftiness.html">Loftiness</a>: The conception of Christ's
          person as presenting deity and humanity indissolubly united, and the
          conception of Christ's character, with its faultless and
          all-comprehending excellence, cannot be accounted for upon any other
          hypothesis than that they were historical realities. No mere human
          genius, and much less the genius of Jewish fishermen, could have
          originated this conception. Bad men invent only such characters as
          they sympathize with. But Christ's character condemns badness. Such a
          portrait could not have been drawn without supernatural aid. But such
          aid would not have been given to fabrication. The conception can be
          explained only by granting that Christ's person and character were
          historical realities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="History.html">History</a>: The rapid progress of the gospel
          in the first centuries of our era shows its divine origin. That
          Paganism should have been in three centuries supplanted by
          Christianity, is an acknowledged wonder of history. The wonder is the
          greater when we consider the obstacles to the progress of
          Christianity: The scepticism of the cultivated classes; the prejudice
          and hatred of the common people; and the persecutions set on foot by
          government.
