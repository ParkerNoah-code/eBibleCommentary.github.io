          <a href=".html">Old Testament:</a> All that is necessary to determine
          for Christians the canon of the Old Testament, is to ascertain what
          books were included in the "Scriptures" recognized by the Jews of that
          period. This is a point about which there is no reasonable doubt. The
          Jewish canon of the Old Testament included all the books and no
          others, which Protestants now recognize as constituting the Old
          Testament Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href=".html">Apocrypha:</a> These were not written in Hebrew and
          were not included in the canon of the Jews. They were, therefore, not
          recognized by Christ as the Word of God. On this ground Protestants
          reject the so-called apocryphal books. This reason is of itself
          sufficient. It is however confirmed by considerations drawn from the
          character of the books themselves. They abound in errors, and in
          statements contrary to those found in the undoubtedly canonical books.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href=".html">New Testament:</a> The principle on which the canon of
          the New Testament is determined is equally simple. Those books, and
          those only which can be proved to have been written by the Apostles,
          or to have received their sanction, are to be recognized as of divine
          authority. The reason of this rule is obvious. The Apostles were the
          duly authenticated messengers of Christ, of whom He said, "The one who
          hears you hears me, and the one who rejects you rejects me" (Lk 10:16
          ESV).
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href=".html">Establishment:</a> In this affair, the Church is a
          servant and not a mistress; a depositary and not a judge. She
          exercises the office of a minister, not of a magistrate, ministerium
          non magisterium. She delivers a testimony, not a judicial sentence.
          She discerns the canon of the Scriptures, she does not make it; she
          has recognised their authenticity, she has not given it. And as the
          men of Sichem believed in Jesus Christ by means of the impure but
          penitent woman who called them to him, we say to the Church: "Now we
          believe, not because of thy saying; for we have heard him ourselves,
          and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href=".html">Finality</a>: The Scripture is a full and perfect
          canon, containing in it all things necessary to salvation. ‘From a
          child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee
          wise unto salvation’ (2 Tim 3:15). It shows what we are to believe and
          what we are to practise. It gives us an exact model of religion, and
          perfectly instructs us in the deep things of God. By the scriptures,
          we receive 'the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints'
          (Jude 3).
