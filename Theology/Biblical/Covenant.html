    <h2>Revelation</h2>
    <p>
      Man's present peace and eternal happiness are deeply connected to
      religion. Since the fall of man, all true religion must be taught through
      divine revelation, which God has given to his Church in various parts and
      ways, causing this light to increase gradually until the entire mystery of
      his grace was fully revealed in and through Jesus Christ, in whom all the
      treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      God, who has known all his works from the beginning, has arranged the
      revelation of his will to men, his interactions with them, and all the
      works of his holy providence towards them, with respect to the fullness of
      time and the gathering of all things under the headship of Christ Jesus.
      Therefore, in all our searching for the mind of God in the holy
      Scriptures, we must conduct our inquiries with respect to Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best interpreter of the Old Testament is the Holy Spirit speaking to
      us in the New Testament because there we have the clearest light of the
      knowledge of the glory of God shining upon us in the face of Jesus Christ,
      revealing the counsels of love and grace that were hidden from former ages
      and generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the greater light of the New Testament does not diminish the
      usefulness of the Old Testament. Rather, it obligates us even more to
      study the Old Testament humbly and diligently. This is because the mystery
      of the Gospel cannot be thoroughly understood without a good understanding
      of the economy of the Law and the state of things before the Law. The Old
      and New Testaments are interconnected in such a way that neither can be
      fully understood apart from the other, and a complete system of truth, as
      it is in Jesus, can only be gathered from both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the interactions between God and men that we will encounter in this
      inquiry are of a covenantal nature, it is necessary to first discuss the
      general concept of a covenant relationship with God.
    </p>

    <h2>Covenant</h2>
    <p>
      In any covenantal transaction between God and men, God always initiates
      it. Just as Christ told his disciples that they did not choose him, but he
      chose them, we can say that man has never entered into a covenant with
      God, but rather God has entered into a covenant with man. It is solely the
      prerogative of God's sovereign majesty and the result of his infinite
      goodness to propose, as well as his wisdom to choose and order the terms
      of a covenant relationship between himself and his creatures. Therefore,
      the covenant he has made with men is often referred to in Scripture as the
      Lord's covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, there can be no covenant of mutual benefits between God and
      men, as there can be between one man and another. All creatures
      necessarily depend on and receive their existence and well-being from the
      generosity of their Creator. There is nothing that they have not received
      from him, and therefore, even the most perfect of them can only render to
      him what is already due by the law of their creation. No one can be
      profitable to God, although a righteous person may be profitable to
      himself and his neighbor. Consequently, no one can obligate God or make
      him their debtor unless he condescends to obligate himself through a
      covenant or promise.
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The general notion of any covenant of God with men, considered from God's
      perspective or as proposed by him, can be understood as a declaration of
      his sovereign pleasure concerning the benefits he will bestow on them, the
      communion they shall have with him, and the way and means by which this
      shall be enjoyed by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To better understand this general description, I shall briefly propose
      some particulars that are either included in it or are the immediate and
      necessary consequences of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. It implies a free and sovereign act of the divine will, expressed in
      condescending love and goodness. God does not enter into a covenant with
      men out of any necessity of nature, but of his own good pleasure. The
      privilege and nearness to God included in a covenant interest cannot
      immediately result from the relationship that creatures have with God,
      even as reasonable creatures in a perfect state. The Lord does not owe man
      the good promised in any covenant antecedently; man's first right to it is
      freely given by the promise of the covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The notion of a covenant adds assurance to that of a promise, as it
      implies a special bond of favor and friendship that belongs to a
      covenantal interest and relationship. A covenant is the foundation of a
      special relationship between the parties involved, and the kind and
      benefit of this relationship are determined by the covenant itself, its
      nature, promises, and end.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Therefore, the immediate and direct end of God entering into a covenant
      with man at any time (as far as it concerns man himself) is the
      advancement and betterment of his state. God has never made a covenant
      with man in which his goodness was not abundantly manifest. Such is his
      infinite bounty that he has proposed no lower end to his covenant
      transactions with men than bringing them into a blessed state in the
      eternal enjoyment of himself. When one covenant (through the weakness of
      man in his fallen state) has been found weak and unprofitable in
      accomplishing this great end, God finds fault, abolishes it, and
      introduces another that fully provides for the perfect salvation of those
      who have an interest in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. God's kindness and condescending love in entering into a covenant with
      man strengthen the bond of love and obedience that man owes to God by the
      law of his creation, adding a new obligation to it. Therefore, man's sin
      in breaking covenant with God is more severe and accompanied by greater
      aggravations than the mere transgression of a law if no such covenant
      relationship had been added.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The revelation of the counsel of God's will in a covenant proposed to
      man, far from excluding a restipulation on man's part, renders it a
      necessary duty. Unlike covenantal transactions between equals, where one
      party is at liberty to refuse the covenant offered by the other, our
      infinite distance from God as creatures, our necessary dependence upon
      him, and our duty to him by the unalterable law of our creation (as well
      as our own advantage and profit) oblige us to accept both the benefits he
      offers and the terms on which they are offered in his covenant, and to
      diligently perform what he commands and directs us to do for the purposes
      proposed therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. However, this restipulation (and consequently, the way and manner of
      obtaining and the right in which we claim covenant blessings) must
      necessarily vary according to the different nature and terms of the
      covenants that God makes with men at any time. If the covenant is of
      works, the restipulation must be by doing the things required in it, even
      by fulfilling its condition in perfect obedience to its law, and the
      reward is of debt (not absolutely, but by compact) according to the terms
      of such a covenant. But if it is a covenant of free and sovereign grace,
      the required restipulation is a humble receiving or hearty believing of
      those gratuitous promises on which the covenant is established, and
      accordingly, the reward or covenant blessing is immediately and eminently
      of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Therefore, the goodness and glory of any covenant that God makes with
      men, whether considered absolutely or in comparison with another covenant,
      is chiefly to be measured by its promises and terms. If one covenant is
      established upon better promises (i.e., either promising a more excellent
      good or in a more excellent way) than another, it is for that reason to be
      esteemed a better covenant than the other.
    </p>

    <h2>Condescension</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to these things, it may be timely to further observe that the
      holy and wise God has always dealt with the children of men in a way of
      covenant. The display of infinite goodness has always accompanied the
      discovery of his infinite glory in his dealings with men. Therefore, he
      has not acted towards them to the utmost right of his sovereignty and
      dominion over them. If he had done so, there would never have been any
      reward of future blessedness assigned and made due to their obedience, as
      there has been by covenant. Nor would they have been brought into any
      nearer relation to God than that which resulted from their creation by
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the great God has not kept such a distance from man, but has
      condescended to come to terms with him. As he has required obedience in
      some things beyond the immediate dictates of the law of nature, by
      positive institutions, he has also been pleased to oblige himself, beyond
      the debt of a Creator, by the promise of a bountiful reward. Hence, it
      follows that:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. All the worship and obedience that God has required of and accepted
      from the children of men have been upon covenant terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Their ability, or moral capacity, to walk in a manner pleasing to him
      has been given to them or worked in them towards the end of having a
      covenant relationship with him, and must therefore be an inseparable part
      of that covenant interest in which they have been established.
    </p>
    <p>The consequences of this are:</p>
    <p>
      1. Persons who have fallen under the guilt of breaking a covenant are, by
      their own fault, utterly disabled from yielding any acceptable obedience
      to God upon the terms of that covenant which they have violated. They
      remain under the penal sanction of the covenant but are utterly deprived
      of the strength to answer its ends and have wholly lost their right to its
      reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. If they are without strength with respect to the condition and end of
      the covenant in which they once had an interest and principles suited to,
      then they are even more, while they remain in their fallen state, beholden
      to the terms of another covenant that is more excellent, mysterious, and
      wholly supernatural in its doctrine and terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Spiritual strength and the ability to please God can only be restored
      to them by a new covenant interest and the new creation that is the result
      thereof.
    </p>

    <h2>Federal Head</h2>
    <p>
      It is also noteworthy that in the covenants God has made, in which either
      mankind in general or a select number of men, in particular, have been
      concerned, it has pleased him to first transact with some public person,
      head, or representative for all others who should be involved in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the case in the covenant of creation, which God made with Adam in
      his upright state and with all mankind in him, as well as in the Noahic
      covenant. The same is observed in the covenants made with Abraham,
      considered either as the father of believers or of the Israelite nation.
      In the interest of a spiritual relationship to him, believers claim the
      blessings of the covenant of grace made with him. In the interest of a
      natural relationship to him, his offspring according to the flesh claimed
      the rights and privileges of the covenant first peculiarity made with him
      as the head of that separate people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most eminently, the covenant of grace is established in Christ as its
      head. All its promises were first given to him, and in him, they are all
      "Yes" and "Amen." It is by union with him that believers obtain a new
      covenant interest, and from him, they derive a new life, grace, and
      strength to answer the ends of the new covenant.

    <h2>Adam</h2>
    <p>
      The interactions between God and Adam, the relationship Adam had with God,
      and the outcomes and consequences of those interactions are of the utmost
      importance to all of us. A correct understanding of these matters is not
      only necessary for, but also forms the very foundation of all useful
      knowledge about ourselves and God's intentions revealed to humanity in
      subsequent ages, whether before, during, or after the law of Moses, or
      through the teachings of the Gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rightly understanding these things is not only necessary for, but lies at
      the very foundation of all useful knowledge of ourselves and of the mind
      of God in all the revelations he has made of his will and counsel to the
      children of men in subsequent ages, whether before or in the Law of Moses,
      or by the word of the Gospel. The ignorance of this that was in them is
      apparently the reason for the blindness and miserable mistakes of even the
      wisest heathen philosophers in a thousand other matters of the greatest
      importance. If one misses the right account of this, he is certainly
      bewildered in all subsequent searches for the truth that it most concerns
      him to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, it is crucial that we diligently observe what the Holy Spirit
      has recorded for our instruction in this regard. The discussion of this
      subject can be divided into three main points:
    </p>
    <p>1. The state of Adam before he sinned.</p>
    <p>2. His sin and its immediate consequences.</p>
    <p>3. How God dealt with him in his fallen state.</p>

    <h2>Original State</h2>
    <p>
      God created man as a rational being and endowed him with original
      righteousness necessary for enabling him to fulfill the purpose of his
      creation. In this respect, he is notably said to be created "in the image
      of God" (Gen 1:26-27) and to be "made upright" (Eccl 7:29). This
      uprightness or rectitude of nature consisted of the perfect harmony of his
      soul with the law of God, which he was created under and subject to.
    </p>
    <p>This law was:</p>
    <p>
      1. An eternal and invariable rule of righteousness, requiring things
      agreeable to the holiness and rectitude of the divine nature and
      prohibiting whatever is contrary to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Internal and subjective to Adam, being communicated to him with his
      rational nature and written in his heart, so that he needed no external
      revelation to perfect his knowledge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, in the account of his creation, there is no other mention of it
      except that he was made "in the image of God," which, as the Apostle
      teaches us, consists of "righteousness and true holiness" (Eph 4:24). The
      essence of this law was later given in the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai
      and summarized even more concisely by Christ, who reduced it to two great
      commands concerning our duty to God and our neighbor (Mat 22:37-40).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the eternal law, it pleased the divine majesty of Heaven to
      add a positive precept, forbidding man from eating the fruit of one tree
      in the midst of the Garden of Eden, called "The Tree of the Knowledge of
      Good and Evil" (Gen 2:16-17; 3:3). Eating this fruit was not evil in
      itself but was made so by divine prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, it was necessary for God's will concerning this to be expressly
      communicated to man, who otherwise, by the light of nature, would have had
      no more reason to abstain from the fruit of this tree than from any other
      in the garden, nor would he have been under any obligation to do so.
      However, once the command was given, this positive law had its foundations
      firmly laid in the law of nature, as it is an immutable principle that it
      is most righteous and reasonable for man to obey God and for the will of
      the creature to always be subject to the will of the Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, the heart of an upright man could not help but naturally
      embrace and submit to the will of God, made known to him by any means. And
      there can be no transgression of a positive precept without also violating
      the eternal law written in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      This law was safeguarded by a sanction, threatening death for its
      transgression (Gen 2:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      This sanction applied not only to the positive precept to which it was
      expressly attached but also to the law of nature, the transgression of
      which man knows to be deserving of punishment by the same light that
      reveals the law itself to him. This is confirmed by the experience of
      mankind, even in their fallen state, as they not only find within
      themselves some remaining notions of the difference between good and evil
      and a sense of their duty to embrace the former and shun the latter, but
      also have a conscience of punishment due for transgressing these dictates
      of reason. These notions are innate to them and, therefore, can be
      observed both in those who do not have the light of a written law to guide
      them and in those who do (Romans 1:32; 2:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam was not only under the threat of death in case of disobedience but
      also had the promise of an eternal reward on the condition of his perfect
      obedience to these laws. If he had fulfilled this condition, the reward
      would have been due to him by virtue of this compact that God was pleased
      to condescend to for the encouragement of man's obedience and the
      manifestation of His own bounty and goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a promise of reward was indeed given to Adam can be concluded from:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The state and capacity in which God placed Adam, which was a state of
      trial in the way to eternal happiness, under a law of works and the
      exercise of obedience. This cannot be conceived of except as being in
      order to some reward and highest end, proposed to him and attainable by
      him in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The natural inclination of men to expect the reward of eternal
      blessedness for their obedience to God's law and to stand before Him on
      the terms of a covenant of works. This must necessarily presuppose Adam's
      relation to God in such a covenant, to which the promise of such a reward
      belonged, and the knowledge of these covenant terms communicated to him
      along with the law of his creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The sacramental use of the Tree of Life in the midst of the Garden of
      Eden, which was instituted by God as a sign and pledge of the eternal life
      that Adam would have obtained by his own personal and perfect obedience to
      God's law, had he continued in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this tree was appointed by God for such a use and end is inferred
      from:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Christ's allusion to it in the New Testament (Revelation 2:7), where He
      promises an eternal reward to the one who overcomes, stating, "I will give
      him to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midst of the paradise of
      God." The reason for this is taken from God's appointment of this tree to
      be an assurance of eternal life to Adam upon the terms and condition of a
      covenant of works, and the analogy of that reward which Christ gives to
      His faithful ones upon the terms of another covenant. This analogy
      consists in the general nature of an eternal reward promised, though there
      may not be an identity or perfect agreement in the degree or particular
      kind thereof. It seems reasonable to conclude that it was in some respects
      inferior to the glory we are called to by Jesus Christ, though both agree
      in the notion of an eternal and, in its kind, perfect happiness.
      Therefore, the one is expressed by terms that relate to a former assurance
      of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. From the way God dealt with Adam regarding the Tree of Life after he
      had sinned, and the reason God Himself assigned for it: "Lest he put forth
      his hand, and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live for ever"
      (Gen 3:22). We should not suppose that Adam could have actually obtained
      eternal life by eating from the Tree of Life after he had sinned against
      God; rather, the entire discourse is ironic. Just as the preceding words,
      "Behold, the man has become like one of us," are a holy rebuke of man's
      folly in aspiring to such a state by breaking God's law based on the
      devil's suggestion, these words also indicate a further delusion that
      fallen man was in danger of entertaining—the opinion (which vain man is
      ready to nurture in himself on any pretext) that he still has the capacity
      to recover his forfeited happiness this way or by any other work of his
      own. Nevertheless, they teach us the original use and purpose of this
      tree, as well as the fact that Adam was not ignorant of it, though he was
      now to be taught the utter impossibility of obtaining life by a broken
      covenant, as access to the tree was guarded and prohibited by the
      cherubim's flaming sword that turned every way to keep the way to the Tree
      of Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It must not be forgotten that Moses's Law included the Covenant of
      Creation to some extent and served as a reminder of it, which affected all
      of humanity by its curse. The Law not only had the sanction of a curse
      denounced against the disobedient but also promised the reward of life to
      the obedient. Since the moral precepts of Moses's Law were the same as
      those of the Law of Creation, the reward proposed in this respect was not
      a new reward but the same one that Adam would have been entitled to by
      compact if he had perfectly obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what has been said, I believe it is clear that Adam was set on his
      way but not actually brought to his eternal rest in the state in which he
      was created. He was capable of and made for a greater degree of happiness
      than he initially enjoyed, which was set before him as the reward for his
      obedience according to the covenant by which he was to walk with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding this reward set before him, the following points should be
      noted:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Although the law of Adam's creation included both a promise of reward
      and a threat of punishment, the reasons for these are not the same or
      equally necessary. The reward is solely due to God's sovereign bounty and
      goodness and therefore could have been less, more, or not proposed at all
      without causing any injustice. However, the threatened punishment is a
      debt to justice and results directly from the nature of sin in relation to
      God, without the need for any compact. It is due to the transgression of a
      divine law as such and is therefore still due for every transgression of
      it, even by those who are already cut off from hope of reward due to a
      previous breach of the covenant. Just as the punishment may not exceed
      what the offense deserves without injuring man, it also may not be less
      without diminishing the glory of justice, which always measures it
      strictly. Therefore, the death threatened in the curse is, in a strict and
      proper sense, the wages of sin (Romans 6:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In the biblical account of this event, which the Holy Spirit recorded
      for our instruction, the threatened curse is mentioned more particularly
      and explicitly than the promised reward. As a result, we have a clearer
      understanding of the curse than of the reward, although we have reason to
      believe that Adam knew both with equal clarity. This may be because it is
      more important for us to be thoroughly humbled by an awareness of the
      present misery of humanity in their fallen state than to curiously inquire
      about the specific nature or degree of the blessedness that was once
      offered but can never be obtained by us under the terms of that original
      covenant, which first gave man the right to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. In this interaction between God and Adam, Adam should not be regarded
      as acting in a private capacity or as being solely concerned with himself.
      Instead, God dealt with him as the common root and representative of all
      humanity that would descend from him through the natural course of
      procreation. At that time, all of humanity was considered to be in Adam,
      both as a natural and federal root. Therefore, when Adam stood, all of
      humanity stood, and when he fell, they all sinned and fell in him, for "by
      the disobedience of one, many were made sinners" (Romans 5). In this
      respect, Adam is said to be the type, and Christ the antitype, or "the
      figure of him that was to come." This is because, just as Adam's sin is
      imputed to all who were in him, and thus judgment has come upon all for
      condemnation who were represented by him, so also the obedience of Christ
      is imputed to all who are in him. The free gift comes upon them for the
      justification of life by virtue of their union with and communion with
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these points, it is clear that God dealt with Adam not only on the
      terms of a law but also in the form of a covenant, and that this
      interaction with him was of a federal nature. Although this arrangement is
      not explicitly called a covenant in Scripture, it possesses the essential
      characteristics of a covenant. There is no reason to quibble over
      terminology when the concept itself is sufficiently revealed to us. For
      example, there is no explicit mention of a covenant of grace before
      Abraham's time, yet it is certain and clearly revealed in Scripture that
      all who were saved before his time were included in such a covenant and
      saved only by its grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence of Adam's covenant relationship with God can be summarized as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. It is probable, given that God placed Adam not only under the necessary
      law of his creation but also added a positive law, which we may observe in
      all of God's subsequent dealings with people as an adjunct to a covenant
      transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is certainly concluded from the promise of reward and its assurance
      given to Adam, which he could only have obtained by God condescending to
      deal with him on the terms of a covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. It could only be on account of such a covenant that Adam's posterity
      would be affected by his standing or falling. If the first point is
      denied, the latter becomes entirely inexplicable. If Adam had only been
      under a law to God, his sin would have remained upon himself and could not
      have been imputed to all of humanity, as it now is by just imputation.
      This is no more possible than the sin of any particular person being
      imputed to another person who is not actually guilty of it, or at least
      the sins of immediate parents being imputed to their children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herein lies the mystery of God's first interaction with man and man's
      resulting relationship with God, which did not arise directly from the law
      of his creation but from the arrangement of a covenant according to the
      free, sovereign, and wise counsel of God's will. Therefore, although the
      law of creation is easily understood by people and there is little
      controversy about it among those who are not degenerate from all
      principles of reason and humanity, the covenant of creation, the
      involvement of Adam's posterity with him in it, and the guilt of original
      sin imputed to them thereby, is not acknowledged by the majority of
      humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can only be understood by the light of divine revelation, and the heart
      of man is only humbled to properly acknowledge it through a deep
      conviction by the work of the Holy Spirit. As long as people try to
      measure this counsel of God by their own narrow and obscure reasoning and
      refuse to submit their opinions about it to the revelation of his
      sovereign pleasure, inscrutable will, and wisdom, they will inevitably
      fall into grievous errors and fill the world with fruitless contentions by
      obscuring counsel with words without knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      This covenant that God made with Adam, and all of humanity in him, was a
      covenant of works in terms of its conditions. With respect to immediate
      privilege and relationship, it was a covenant of friendship, and with
      regard to the promised reward, it was a covenant of rich bounty and
      goodness. However, it did not include or imply the slightest hint of
      pardoning mercy. While perfect observance of its law elevated man to a
      degree close to the blessed angels, the breach of that law inevitably
      brought him under the curse that sank him to the society of apostate
      devils and left him in a misery like theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this covenant, man was left to the freedom of his own will. It was
      in his own power and choice to either obey and be eternally happy or to
      sin and expose himself to eternal death. He was not so confirmed in grace
      that he could not sin and die, but he was endowed with the power and
      rectitude of nature to not sin and never die. Although he did not have an
      inability to sin and thus an inability to die, he had an ability to not
      sin and thus an ability to not die.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a perfect, though mutable, creature and had every possible
      advantage of moral persuasion to keep him constant in his obedience. He
      could not be without a clear conviction of the greatest obligation to
      obey, both in terms of duty and gratitude towards his Creator and covenant
      God. He had present happiness and future hope in the way of his duty, and
      fair warning of the misery that sin would bring upon him, as denounced in
      the curse that was the sanction of the law given to him. Yet, when the
      time of trial came, all this did not prevail against the temptation. His
      mutability became the origin of that original sin, whereby he and all of
      humanity in him were ruined and made subject to death.
    </p>

    <h2>Sin and its Consequences</h2>
    <p>
      The next thing to be examined is the sin of our first parents and their
      resulting state and condition. Regarding their sin, their transgression
      was actually completed by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of
      good and evil, concerning which the Lord had commanded them not to eat
      (Genesis 3:6).
    </p>
    <p>With respect to this, let it be observed:</p>
    <p>
      1. Mankind was lost through the breach of a positive law. This was the
      door through which sin and all the miseries resulting from it invaded and,
      by their entrance, ruined this lower world.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Since man fell by transgressing this positive precept, his breach of
      covenant with God was all the more conspicuous, inasmuch as this precept
      did not belong immediately and necessarily to the law of his creation but
      was added to it as a special term and condition of his covenant
      relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The breach of this positive law supposes and necessarily infers a
      violation of the eternal law of his creation. This transgression was a
      total apostasy from God, and in it all conceivable wickedness was
      included, even "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride
      of life" (1 Jn 2:16). Indeed, all the villanies that have been or ever
      will be perpetrated in the world to this day are the genuine fruit of this
      sin, and upon close examination, its aggravations will be found to be
      incalculable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having broken the covenant with God in this manner, by a wicked and
      willful transgression of his holy law, he thereby utterly forfeited and
      lost all covenant interest in God. He could no longer claim a right to or
      hope for the reward promised on the condition of his perfect obedience to
      the law of that covenant which God had made with him. Instead, he
      immediately fell under guilt, being bound over to punishment by the
      sentence of his own conscience, under the just wrath of the Almighty.
      Therefore, he dreaded nothing more than the approach of God to him (Gen
      3:8-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      He not only forfeited his right and present relation to God by this sin
      but moreover was thereby rendered incapable of true happiness, inasmuch as
      he had now apostatized from a covenant of friendship to a state of enmity
      against God and alienation from him, which is the necessary adjunct of
      wickedness. He fell under the dominion of sin, and that image of God in
      which he was created was in a manner wholly defaced. He "sinned and fell
      short of the glory of God" (Rom 3:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of that original righteousness with which he was at first
      beautified, there was nothing to be found in him but abominable filthiness
      and horrid deformity. His mind was covered over, even possessed with
      hellish darkness, hatred of God reigned in his heart, and his affections
      were no longer subject to right reason but became vile and rebellious. In
      this state, it is evident that he must be utterly incapable of communion
      with God and of the fruition of him, wherein alone the true happiness of a
      reasonable creature consists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curse of the law in its utmost rigor and primary intention was
      immediately and only due to him, and he was to expect nothing less than
      its full execution at every moment. That curse was death, even the worst
      of deaths: eternal death, that eternal destruction of soul and body by the
      wrathful vengeance of a provoked Deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, that this was the primary intention of the threatening might be
      proven by many reasons, but at present I shall content myself with
      mentioning only two:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. This punishment will be inflicted on many of the ungodly posterity of
      Adam who have been guilty of no other transgression but that of the light
      and law of nature, such as those wicked heathens that Paul speaks of in
      Romans 1:20 and 2:6-16. Though they never had the written law or knew of
      any repeated promulgation of it (and therefore we may conclude them much
      less likely to be acquainted with the new covenant and its terms), yet
      being a law to themselves, they were liable to this punishment for
      transgressing this law. This punishment must be the fruit of that curse
      which is the sanction of the law they were under and which they
      transgressed, which was the law of creation, the same law that Adam was
      made under. If the law is the same, the same penalty was incurred by
      transgressing it, and if they are liable to eternal death for
      transgressing this law, there is no rational doubt that Adam was also
      liable.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. If the just demerit and wages of sin were contained in the threatening
      (as no doubt they were), it could be no less than an eternal punishment
      that was threatened. For if that is not the desert of every sin, it cannot
      be due to any sin. The reason why the punishment of any sin is eternal is
      so that the penalty inflicted on the sinner may be adequate to the
      offense. Therefore, the punishment due to Adam for sin against God could
      be no other or no less than eternal death, which is what was intended in
      the sanction of the law given to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole creation of this visible world became liable to destruction with
      fallen man, as an inheritance forfeited by his treason against the supreme
      majesty. By man's sin, the frame of earth and the heavens made for his
      service and delight was loosed, and their foundations so shaken that it
      would have issued in utter ruin, had not Christ interposed and "upheld the
      pillars thereof" (cf. Ps 75:3 with Heb 1:3). If the curse had been
      immediately executed in its rigor, with these desolations following
      thereupon, there would have been a hell ready prepared for man. Suppose, I
      pray you, all the lights of heaven to be put out, the whole order,
      symmetry, and beauty of the creation to be destroyed, and, with the
      burning wrath of God kindled upon him, man be burned to ashes by the
      eternal fire of God and consumed by worms. Think of this most dreadful
      state of which man stood at the very brink.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this condition, man was altogether helpless and without strength, being
      utterly disabled to stand before God upon the terms of a covenant of
      works, and equally incapable of bringing himself upon other terms with
      God. For he was not able to move one step towards reconciliation with God
      or to ransom himself out of these miseries. The door of repentance was not
      opened to him by the covenant of creation, or if it had been, there was
      now in him neither power nor will to enter through it. He was utterly
      disabled from obeying God acceptably upon any terms until made a new
      creature. Therefore, it was impossible not only for this now-broken
      covenant to be renewed with him or any of his posterity for the same ends
      and in the same manner as it was first made with upright man, but moreover
      for any covenant to be immediately struck with him or them, wherein fallen
      man would have been the first and immediate covenanter with God for
      himself, as Adam was in his state of integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus miserable (indeed, more than we have expressed or can express) was
      the state of fallen man. Let us now see how the boundless mercy of God was
      revealed to him when he was thus lost and miserably ruined by his own sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a better understanding of what follows, I shall premise two things
      that are necessary to keep in view:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The infinitely wise and gracious God, who from eternity foresaw the
      fall of man, had also from eternity a gracious purpose in himself,
      according to the counsel of his own will, to redeem and save a remnant of
      lost mankind from their lapsed and fallen state. By his all-powerful grace
      through the merits of Christ, he purposed to recover them from misery to
      the inheritance of a kingdom and glory far greater than that set before
      Adam in his integrity. These eternal counsels that were hidden with him
      were transacted in a way of covenant between the Father and the Son, even
      in a covenant of redemption now revealed in the Scriptures of truth. To
      this covenant belong all the promises of the Father to the Mediator and
      the reciprocal engagements of the Redeemer concerning the salvation of
      sinners and the way and method of its accomplishment. With respect to
      these counsels, the Son of God is said to be the Father's delight, and he
      himself also had his delights in the habitable world when the head of its
      dust was formed (Prov 8:22-31). In this context, the mutual acquiescence
      of both the Father and the Son in this admirable plan of infinite grace
      and wisdom is not obscurely set forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In pursuance of this covenant of redemption and the suretyship of
      Christ therein, upon the fall of man, the government of the world was
      actually put into the hands of the Son of God, the designated Mediator,
      who interposed himself to prevent its present and utter ruin. All future
      transactions for the good of man were managed by him, and all discoveries
      of grace and mercy were made to the children of men in and by him. All
      things in heaven and earth were brought into an order subservient to the
      ends of the new creation and the redemption of lost man, to be
      accomplished in the fullness of time by the incarnate Son of God. Fallen
      man could have no more dealings with God, nor God with him in a way of
      kindness, except through a Mediator.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from this design of love and mercy that, when the Lord God came to
      fallen man in the garden in the cool of the day and found him filled with
      horror and shame in the conscience of his own guilt, he did not execute
      the rigor of the law upon him but held a treaty with him, which resulted
      in a discovery of grace. Thereby a door of hope was opened to him, by
      laying a new foundation for his acceptance with God and walking in a
      pleasing manner before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sentence passed upon the serpent (which principally concerned the
      devil, whose instrument he had been in tempting man, and who probably was
      made to abide in his possession of the serpent until he had received this
      doom; Gen 3:15), there was couched a blessed promise of redemption and
      salvation for man, which was to be accomplished by the Son of God made of
      a woman, and so her seed. This promised salvation man was to receive by
      faith and hope in it, for in this implied promise was laid the first
      foundation of the church after the fall of man, which was to be raised up
      out of the ruins of the devil's kingdom by the destruction of his work by
      Jesus Christ (1 Jn 3:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this commination of the serpent there is not only implied a promise of
      raising up a Savior of the seed of the woman and sending him into the
      world to break the serpent's head, that is, to perfectly conquer Satan and
      his kingdom, but also of propagating and preserving a church in the world
      that would be heirs of that salvation and would maintain a spiritual war
      with Satan and his kingdom, which on their part would end in perfect
      conquest and victory. The God of peace would bruise Satan under their
      feet, while he is nibbling at their heel, and make them more than
      conquerors through him who loved them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seed of the woman is to be understood collectively of Christ and his
      members (as the seed of the serpent includes all wicked men), though it
      has a principal respect to Christ personally, who alone has obtained the
      victory over the infernal power and destroyed the works of the devil. But
      although this was done by himself alone, it was not for himself only but
      for his body the church, of which every true believer is a member and
      shall certainly obtain victory through faith in his name. Against this
      church the gates of Hades can never prevail. A church there ever shall be
      in the world, so long as the world continues, and ever was since the first
      promise, though maligned and persecuted by the devil and wicked men, as
      early appears in that instance of Cain and Abel (Gen 4; cf. 1 Jn 3:12).
      Something of this nature is intimated in the name of Seth and the reason
      given by Eve for imposing that name (Gen 4:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore there was a present restraint and modification of the curse in
      the sentence pronounced upon Adam and Eve (Gen 3:16-19), whereby, although
      they and their offspring were necessarily subjected to many evils and
      miseries while they lived, and dissolution by a temporal death at last,
      they were not immediately laid under a sentence of eternal death, which
      was the punishment they had deserved.
    </p>
    <p>Concerning this sentence, we may further observe:</p>
    <p>
      1. The promise of breaking the serpent's head, which was revealed to our
      first parents, did not give them a deliverance from all misery, but only
      an exemption from eternal death. Notwithstanding this promise and all that
      Christ has now done for its full accomplishment, it is the will of God
      that all men, even believers as well as others, shall in this world be
      exercised with miseries and remain subject to temporal death, or
      dissolution of the body into dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Man's corruptibility, all the miseries he is subject to while he lives,
      and temporal death at last, are the fruits of sin and of the curse due to
      it, as they are natural evils or punishments. However, they are not the
      fruit or result of the curse only, nor the full wages of sin. As they are
      evil, they flow from the curse, but as temporal only, their evil is
      limited and thus modified by mercy, or compassionate goodness at least.
      The imposition of temporal death indeed concludes that sin is in the
      world, but this limitation of death also proves that there is mercy
      reserved for some, and that such as do not obtain mercy must be brought to
      an after reckoning, inasmuch as the fruit of their doings has not been
      fully repaid to them in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. All of these evils are capable of a change, as to their penal nature,
      together with the change of that man's state upon whom they come. For
      though they fall as so many drops of wrath that bode a dreadful storm
      coming upon the wicked, they are all sanctified to a believer and turned
      into real blessings, a change which the utmost execution of the curse is
      not capable of, for an eternal punishment can never be turned into a
      blessing upon any. Indeed, supposing (as there is reason to do) that God
      not only promised a Redeemer to Adam before he pronounced this sentence,
      but also gave him faith in the promise, it came upon him immediately as a
      fatherly chastisement, and not as a fruit of unpacified anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also true on the other side that the goodness and forbearance of God
      is, through the wickedness of man, turned into a judgment upon the ungodly
      and impenitent, who abuse the day of his patience unto the treasuring up
      of wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment
      of God (Romans 2:5). So both temporal mercies and temporal evils are
      wholly subservient to the design of God's glory in the future and eternal
      state of man, and we may conclude there would have been no such thing as
      temporal death if there had not been patience on the part of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is more than probable that at the same time, or immediately after, God
      instituted those bloody sacrifices that were offered to him from then on
      and accepted by him when offered in faith, for the further instruction of
      man in the general notion of the way of his redemption by the promised
      seed, and for the help and confirmation of his faith in the promise.
      Indeed, even the coats of skins which the Lord made, and with which he
      clothed Adam and Eve, then confounded with the shame of their own
      nakedness, seem to be designed by God not only for a natural but also a
      mystical use, for their instruction concerning that imputed righteousness
      in which they must now stand before him, and without which they could find
      no acceptance with him. Especially if these coats were made of the skins
      of those beasts that Adam was then directed to offer in sacrifice to God
      (as some conjecture they were), we can hardly imagine less to be intended
      thereby, for no doubt with the institution of sacrifices, something of
      their use and end was revealed to Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must also be noted that although the covenant of grace was thus far
      revealed to Adam as we have heard, yet in all this, there was no formal
      and express covenant transaction with him, much less was the covenant of
      grace established with him as a public person or representative in any
      kind. As he obtained interest for himself alone in the grace of God thus
      revealed, by his own faith, so must those of his posterity who are saved
      thereby. Therefore, although the corruption of fallen Adam and the guilt
      of his fall are derived from him to all his offspring, because they were
      in him as a public person and federal root when he fell, they cannot
      derive from him any interest in his renewed state or in its grace or
      holiness, seeing that with respect to that, God dealt with him only as a
      private person. The good of the promise now given out was no more
      entrusted with him than with his posterity, or any of them in particular.
    </p>

    <h2>Fallen State</h2>
    <p>
      The state and condition that the world of Adam's posterity are now in is
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. They are all born in original sin, in the image of the first Adam
      fallen, and so under a broken covenant, being by nature children of wrath,
      unholy, and without strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Yet they are necessarily under the obligation of a law to obey,
      worship, and serve their Creator, though they have no covenant interest in
      him. For it is impossible and implies a contradiction that reasonable
      creatures should be brought forth into the world and not be subject to the
      law of their Creator, or that eternal death should not be due to their
      breach of that law. The law of creation binds, even when the covenant of
      creation is broken; though man's transgression has forfeited his interest
      in the covenant, it cannot dissolve the obligation of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. But yet the world is set under a general reprieve, and the full
      execution of the deserved curse is delayed until the day of judgment.
      Until that time, the children of men are under a dispensation of goodness
      and sparing mercy, and so in a remote capacity or possibility of obtaining
      salvation by Christ, where it pleases God to send the gospel, the
      dispensation of which is made effectual for the salvation of all the
      elect, who are thereby gathered into the kingdom of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The Lord Christ has undertaken, at the close of his mediatorial
      kingdom, when all his sheep are brought into his fold (for whose sake
      alone the day of his patience is lengthened out to the world), to raise
      believers into incorruptible state, prepared for that eternal duration for
      which they were designed in their first creation. Then he will glorify all
      those with himself for whom he has satisfied the justice of God, borne the
      curse of the law, and wrought out everlasting righteousness, who have also
      been called by his grace to a participation of these benefits through
      faith. Others he will raise and deliver up by a righteous sentence to the
      full execution upon them of that curse in its utmost rigor, which until
      then, for the aforementioned ends, was suspended.

      The first revelation of God's grace to sinners was given in the promise
      mentioned in Genesis 3:15. From that moment, those redeemed by the Lord
      entered into a new relationship with God through Christ, the promised
      seed, by faith in him as revealed in that promise. As a result, their
      obedience and religious service were established and accepted by God on a
      new foundation: that of pardoning mercy and forgiveness through the
      Redeemer (Ps 130:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      They were no longer under the terms of personal and perfect obedience to
      the law, but under the terms of faith, or believing in a gracious promise.
      This completely changed the way they were accepted by God. Under the
      covenant of creation, obedience was required to maintain the relationship
      and secure acceptance with God. However, under the covenant of grace and
      redemption, the relationship and prior acceptance of the person in Christ
      was the reason for the acceptance of all their sincere, though imperfect,
      obedience, which now sprang from faith. This is why Hebrews 11:4 states
      that God first had respect for Abel and then for his offering. This order
      and way of salvation, in its general nature, has always been and must
      always be the same and unchanging in all ages and under all different
      dispensations of God towards his church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as holy men lived by faith, they also had the object of faith with
      them, which was the revelation of God's counsel through his word. Although
      the word was not written until the time of Moses, the church was never
      without God's oracles, which in those days were made known to it by the
      ways and means chosen by God's infinite wisdom and goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be seen in the first promise and in the institution of
      sacrifices, which could not have been offered in faith, as Abel's was, if
      God had not commanded and appointed them. It also appears that God had
      given them specific directions regarding which animals they could offer in
      sacrifice and which they could not, for in Noah's time, the distinction
      between clean and unclean animals is mentioned as something well known
      before (see Gen 7:2-3, 8:20). Additionally, at least some of the names in
      Seth's lineage were given by a spirit of prophecy. Enoch was a prophet,
      and Noah was a preacher of righteousness. All of this implies a revelation
      of God's mind and counsel to the church, distinct from and transcending
      the light and law of nature, although it must be acknowledged that this
      light did not shine upon them with the same clarity as it did in later
      ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extraordinary dispensation of God's grace towards Enoch, who by faith
      walked with God and was then translated to the heavenly inheritance
      without being subject to the common fate of mankind in death, was not only
      a singular favor to himself but also an eminent revelation to the rest of
      the believers of that age. It showed that the right of adoption and claim
      to an inheritance in light by faith was restored to them in the promised
      seed. This greatly encouraged their faith and hope in expecting a glorious
      state for soul and body to be enjoyed in blessed immortality and eternal
      life hereafter, of which they had a foretaste in the present enjoyment of
      one member of the body to which they were all united (see Gen 4:24; Heb
      11:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      The timing of this event also sheds further light on its mystical
      significance. Enoch was the seventh from Adam, and this number seven is
      famous in Scripture for its mystical signification of the perfect rest or
      Sabbath that Christ would bring his church into. This is why in Matthew's
      Gospel, the genealogy of Christ is counted by generations of seven.
      Furthermore, Enoch's translation happened soon after the death of Adam,
      the first whose natural death is mentioned in Scripture. In the seventh
      generation, Enoch was translated so that he would not see death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they had seen the fruit of the curse exemplified in Adam's death,
      they also saw the life that the promise gives exemplified in Enoch's
      translation. Before he was translated, Enoch walked with God, or as the
      Apostle puts it, had the testimony that he pleased God. The Hebrew phrase
      used in Genesis 5:22 signifies not only integrity and eminent holiness in
      a private capacity but also is often used for a pleasing administration of
      office before God. In this respect, Enoch was a special figure of Christ,
      and his translation foreshadowed Christ's entering into heaven as a
      forerunner for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three hundred years, the church had enjoyed Enoch's ministry, and
      seven patriarchs were left alive as witnesses of his translation, so that
      all the sons of God benefited from and were comforted by this instruction.
      Enoch prophesied about the destruction of wicked men and summed up his
      prophecy in the name he gave to his son Methuselah, which can be
      interpreted as "they die by a dart," "he dies, and then is the dart"
      (i.e., the dart of divine vengeance in punishing the ungodly), or "he dies
      and then it is sent." This prophecy was made almost 1000 years before the
      flood but was precisely fulfilled, as Methuselah died about one month
      before the flood came. This prophecy is more fully recorded in Jude 15
      (which can be taken as a divine paraphrase of this prophetic name, like
      Daniel's interpretation of the writing on the wall) and applied
      analogically to the sinners of his time. Just as this first judgment was a
      type of future judgments upon wicked men, especially the destruction of
      Sodom and Gomorrah by the eternal fire of God's wrath, and each of these
      was a prelude to the general judgment of the world, so the threatening of
      this first judgment to the ungodly then living was also a denunciation of
      judgment against all ungodly sinners in future times.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these early ages of the church, the revelation of God was generally
      propagated through the lineage of the promised seed. However, there was no
      partition wall set up between one family and another, and anyone who
      wished to could freely associate themselves and join with the true
      worshippers of God. It is even possible that some of the cursed line and
      race of Cain might have done so, while on the other hand, it is more than
      probable that other children of Adam besides Cain revolted with him from
      all true religion and holiness, openly contemptuous of and rebellious
      against God. Nonetheless, the nature and necessity of religious worship
      and the obedience due to God obliged his servants to keep themselves
      distinct and separate from the rest of the world. As long as they did so,
      the general defection of mankind was prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
      But towards the end of the old world, things grew worse and worse (Gen
      6:5, 12-13). The violence and corruption of mankind abounded, and even the
      sons of God were tempted by sensual delights. Those who had formerly
      maintained a pure and distinct communion for the solemn worship of God by
      calling upon his name, and were therefore called the sons of God (Genesis
      4:26), now lost their sense of religion. They broke the bounds of their
      proper separation and mingled themselves with the daughters of men (Gen
      6:2, 4), the women of Cain's offspring or confederacy with his seed, whose
      beauty entangled them as they cared more about gratifying their lust than
      the true ends of marriage. Being thus entangled, they were drawn into
      partnership with the women in their abominations, so that by the time of
      the flood, the pure worship of God was maintained only in the family of
      Noah, who found grace in God's sight (Gen 6:1-11) and was preserved in the
      ark, so that he and his sons could replenish the earth with inhabitants
      after the foundation of the wicked had been destroyed by the flood (Job
      22:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      In God's dealings with Noah, some things call for our careful attention,
      as they further the revelation of grace and redemption through Christ and
      thus further establish the church in its expectation of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ark that Noah built by God's special direction to save himself and his
      household of eight souls (1 Pet 3:20) not only provided them with temporal
      deliverance from the flood waters by which God in his wrath swept away a
      disobedient world, but also served a typical purpose for their further
      instruction about the redemption of man from the floods of divine
      vengeance to be poured out in wrath upon the world of unbelievers. It
      should be noted that before Christ came in the flesh, the gospel was
      preached to the church through types and dark shadows, and this kind of
      instruction was provided not only by the established ordinances of
      ceremonial worship but also by many extraordinary works of providence,
      which were ordered by divine wisdom to bear a typical respect to and aptly
      represent spiritual things.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be observed in many instances in the history of Abraham and his
      offspring, the children of Israel. For this reason, the manna they ate in
      the wilderness is called spiritual food, the water from the rock they
      drank is called spiritual drink, and the rock is called Christ (1 Cor
      10:3-4), even though we read of no special ordination or appointment of
      these things for such a purpose beyond what they had from the order and
      voice of providence and the particular circumstances of the people
      involved. Noah's ark should be considered in this light as well, as either
      a type of Christ (like the ark in the Jewish sanctuary) or of the church
      guarded by his salvation, which ultimately amounts to nearly the same
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type is made all the more vivid by the form of structure that God
      commanded and by the unusual use of one term in the direction given for
      securing the preservation of those who were to enter the ark:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The form of the ark, in the proportion of its dimensions, most closely
      resembles a human body, being 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30
      cubits high. Its figure was shaped like a coffin, and entering it
      resembled burial, while exiting it resembled resurrection. For this
      reason, the Apostle Peter makes baptism the antitype of the ark (1 Pet
      3:19-20). Thus, the ark was an extraordinary sacrament or prefiguration of
      the church's redemption and salvation through the death and resurrection
      of Christ, and of her union and communion with him who died and rose
      again, so as to enjoy all the benefits of his death and resurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In the directions given for building the ark, Noah is commanded to
      "pitch it with pitch both within and without" (Gen 6:14). In Hebrew, the
      words are "Caphartà Baccophèr." The primary sense of the verb is "to
      cover," and metaphorically it signifies "to expiate" or "make atonement,"
      because just as covered things are hidden from sight, expiated sin is
      blotted out and no longer remembered against the sinner. The noun "Cophèr"
      is never used in this sense elsewhere in the Bible, as the Hebrews have
      other words that properly signify the kind of material to be used here
      (see Exod 2:3). In the law, however, it is often used for the covering of
      or propitiation for sin. These terms seem to be especially adapted by the
      Holy Spirit to the typical significance of the ark, which was to prefigure
      the salvation of the church through the expiation of sin and atonement
      made by the death of Christ, in the merit of whose blood is her only
      defense against the swelling waters of divine wrath and the curse of the
      law, under which the whole world of unbelievers must inevitably perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we have no reason to think that these things could be apprehended
      as distinctly and clearly then as we now see them in the light of the New
      Testament, we have good reason to believe that some general knowledge of
      them was conveyed to the minds of the faithful at the time of this type
      and by means of it. This explains how Noah became an heir of the
      righteousness of faith by building the ark and entering it (Heb 11:7),
      since it was not only a demonstration of his obedience, by which the truth
      of his faith was manifested, but his faith also reached and to some degree
      apprehended the mystical significance of the ark he was building. While
      his hands were occupied with the external work of building it and his life
      was secured by staying in it, his faith was exercised in the spiritual and
      eternal salvation that was shadowed and typically represented by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Noah entered the ark and also when he came out of it, God is
      mentioned as establishing his covenant with him (see Gen 6:18, 9:11). This
      is the first place and occasion in Scripture where a covenant is
      explicitly mentioned, and therefore we are obliged to seriously inquire
      into the true nature and significance of this covenant. We will make some
      observations about it based on the order in which things are narrated by
      Moses, but first let it be noted that although God's establishment of a
      covenant with Noah is mentioned at two different times in the
      aforementioned texts, they are not two different covenants but
      substantially one and the same covenant, the benefits of which are first
      expressed more generally and then more particularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Genesis 6:18, God says, "But with thee will I establish my Covenant,
      and thou shalt come into the Ark." God's making of a covenant is the
      establishment of it, because his promise is a full and sufficient
      assurance that he will carry out to the end what is pledged in it. The
      benefit immediately promised is the preservation of Noah and all who were
      with him in the ark, and the restipulation required of him was a believing
      resignation of himself to God in an obedient use of the means of safety
      that God had ordained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first glance, this seems to imply nothing more than an outward and
      temporal favor, but upon closer examination, we will discern:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. In this benefit of Noah's covenant, not only was temporal salvation
      secured for him and his household, but also his eternal salvation, indeed,
      the salvation of the entire church was included in it and wholly depended
      on it. Since the promised seed who would crush the serpent's head had not
      yet been brought forth, if all mankind had been destroyed at this time,
      that first and great promise (which was a revelation of the essence of the
      covenant of redemption) would have failed, and thus the entire covenant to
      which it belonged would have been invalidated and made of no effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. With respect to this, as well as to its inherent certainty, the promise
      given here to Noah in a covenantal way is aptly said to be an
      establishment of God's covenant with Noah, since this covenant was made
      with him pursuant to that gracious design of man's redemption previously
      revealed, which, as it was never suspended on man's worthiness, God
      assures Noah by covenant that its fulfillment would never be prevented by
      man's wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. If we add to this the typical significance of the ark, we will discern
      that under this covenant was implied and darkly foreshadowed the covenant
      of eternal salvation through Christ, just as the promise of the heavenly
      inheritance to believers was later embedded in the promise of Canaan to
      Abraham and his seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened after Noah came out of the ark is recorded in Genesis 8:20
      to the end of the chapter and in chapter 9. In this account, we may
      observe:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Before any further interaction between God and Noah, Noah offered a
      sacrifice to the Lord, in which the Lord "smelled a sweet savour," or a
      "savour of rest" (Gen 8:21). The phrase "smelling a sweet savour"
      signifies the acceptance of his offering, and this savour arose from the
      typical significance of this offering to the sacrifice of Christ (compare
      Eph 5:2) and the faith of the one who sacrificed, which was directed
      through it to the same object. This informs us that all that follows was
      transacted in the interest of this sacrifice and is in some way to be
      referred to its purposes. From this passage, you can look back to Genesis
      5:29 and find the reason for Lamech giving his son the name Noah explained
      by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The blessings of Noah's covenant are first conceived in a gracious
      purpose of God's heart: "And the Lord said in his heart, I will not again
      curse," and are afterwards put into the promises of the covenant in which
      God pledges himself to bestow them (Gen 9:8-9). This is considered
      equivalent to an oath, as in Isaiah 54:9: "I have sworn that the waters of
      Noah should no more go over the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The particular benefits and blessings given to mankind by this covenant
      were: 1. Fruitfulness for repopulating the earth. 2. Dominion over the
      creatures and the free use of them for food. 3. Assurance that the
      judgment they had now escaped would not be repeated, despite the
      likelihood that future generations would prove as wicked as those that had
      gone before them, since the same root and spring of corruption remained in
      them (Gen 8:21). The rainbow was appointed to be the visible sign and
      token of this covenant (Gen 9:12-17).
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, we should note:</p>
    <p>
      1. The dispensation of goodness and forbearance that the world was placed
      under by the first promise was now ratified by a solemn covenant, which
      also ensured the successive generation of mankind for the production of
      the promised seed, both personally and collectively. This assurance raised
      the faith of the church one degree higher than it had previously attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. This covenant also had a mystical significance for the faithful,
      foreshadowing the covenant of grace through Christ and its ratification in
      the blood of his sacrifice, by which we are saved from the curse and
      restored to a sanctified right in creature comforts and the hope of
      eternal life. The sovereignty of God's goodness and the absoluteness of
      his promise in this covenant are cited as a singular encouragement to the
      faith of the church regarding the promise of the grace that reigns in the
      new covenant (Isa 54:9). The token of this covenant is made the emblem of
      the steadfastness and eternal memorial of the other (Rev 4:3), so that in
      the typical significance of this covenant, the light of divine grace and
      mercy dawned upon the church with somewhat more clarity than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      This covenant is said to be made with Noah, his sons, and their
      descendants after them for perpetual generations. The terms are parallel
      to those we encounter in chapter 17 in the covenant made with Abraham for
      his descendants in their generations. Yet here two things are evident:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Remote generations to the end of the world are as much involved in this
      covenant as their immediate offspring with whom it was first made, and
      have an equal claim to its blessings without any consideration of their
      immediate parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Although the grace of the new covenant was mystically foreshadowed in
      this covenant with Noah, which was thus made with him for all his
      posterity, the grace and blessings of it were not by this means entailed
      upon all mankind. They all, indeed, have an interest in that covenant that
      signified and in some ways included spiritual blessings, but those
      blessings do not appertain to all who have the signs of them. Rather, they
      remain the peculiar right of those who receive them by faith, "who are
      born not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,
      but of God" (Jn 1:13).
    </p>
    <p>In the history following Genesis 9:25, we may observe:</p>
    <p>
      1. The curse of Ham upon his son Canaan prepared the way for the blessing
      of Shem in his posterity through Abraham, for by the execution of this
      curse, the Canaanites were later disinherited and Israel was planted in
      their place. In this prophetic curse on Canaan and blessing on Shem, you
      may read what Moses later noted in Deuteronomy 32:8. It is also worth
      noting that the seal of Israel's covenant, by virtue of which they
      inherited the land of Canaan, kept alive the remembrance of Ham's
      wickedness and was a perpetual warning to them not to degenerate into his
      ways. He was condemned to servitude for looking upon his father's
      nakedness, and they were circumcised in the foreskin of their flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In the blessing of Shem, special regard is given to the Messiah, whose
      coming into the world was now limited to the line of Shem, and therefore
      in his blessing is also the spring of Japheth's blessing. Shem is the
      first of whom it is expressly said that the Lord was his God, and by "the
      Lord God of Shem," Christ, who is now over all, God blessed forever, is
      intended. His name is celebrated here by Noah as the only hope and
      salvation of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The blessing of Japheth in the interest of Shem's blessing signifies
      not only his personal interest in the Messiah who was to come from Shem,
      but also the calling of the Gentiles of his posterity to be joint heirs
      with the Jews in the blessings of the new covenant. Moreover, his dwelling
      in the tents of Shem intimates the succession of the Gentile church to the
      church of the Jews, who were to be disinherited of all covenant interest
      for their rejection of the Messiah. In the passage "God shall persuade
      Japheth," there is an allusion to his name, and the calling of the Gentile
      church is prophesied in similar terms in Hosea 2:14-15.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after these things, around the fourth generation, we find that
      according to the blessing of God upon Noah and his sons (Gen 9:1), there
      was a very great increase of people in the world. As they increased, they
      evidently drew upon themselves the same charge that was laid upon the old
      world, namely, that the imagination of their heart was evil from their
      youth. In the days of Peleg, there was a very general conspiracy and
      rebellion against God, carried out by the children of men at Babel. In
      pursuance of this, they began to build a tower there (Gen 11:1-9). It is
      very probable that Nimrod, that mighty hunter, was a chief participant in
      this matter, for defection from the true religion and tyrannous oppression
      usually go hand in hand. But this rebellious enterprise of theirs was
      interrupted by the confusion of languages that God brought upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, the language, which had previously been universal, was now
      Hebrew with the family of Eber (from whom it also had its particular
      name). On this occasion, Eber is given a special honor, as you may gather
      from Genesis 10:21, where Shem is said in a particular manner to be the
      father of all the children of Eber. Abraham and his posterity, the heirs
      of Shem's blessing, are called Hebrews after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confusion of languages caused the children of men to fall under a
      greater evil than we might initially realize. It not only frustrated their
      present design and made the means of their civil interaction difficult for
      the future, as well as making the attainment of all knowledge in natural
      things full of labor and toil, but far more significantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. It was virtually a kind of excommunication from the church then in
      existence, with whom the Hebrew tongue remained, which from this time was
      unintelligible to most of the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In God's later dealings with the Hebrews, this difference between their
      language and that of the rest of the world served as a natural
      fortification in addition to the wall of separation by which the nations
      were excluded from the privileges of the church and left destitute of the
      blessing of having the oracles of God, which were committed to the Hebrews
      in the Hebrew tongue (the greatest blessing Israel had; Rom 3:1-2). As a
      result, for many ages they remained strangers to the covenant of promise
      (Eph 2:12), living in the darkest cloud of ignorance and idolatry, without
      hope and without God in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. This dismal effect of the present judgment generally remained upon them
      until the times of restitution and refreshing, even until the last days,
      when God would persuade Japheth and bring him into the tents of Shem. Then
      a door was opened for the breaking up of light to the Gentiles by the gift
      of tongues at Jerusalem, whereby the apostles and prophets of the New
      Testament were enabled to preach the gospel to all nations in their own
      language. Thus, the salvation of God in Zion became a light to the
      Gentiles, whose darkness was originally brought upon them by the confusion
      of tongues at Babel.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The judgment of God upon this evil generation did not stop there, for
      their days were also shortened and cut off in anger for their sin, and
      that to half of them. You may observe in the genealogy of Genesis 11 that
      not only did none who were born after the flood attain to the years of
      those who lived before it, but most manifestly the ordinary age of man was
      again shortened from the time of this defection at Babel, insomuch that
      none of the generations after Eber attained to more than about half the
      number of his years.
