    <h2>Revelation</h2>
    <p>
      Man's present peace and eternal happiness are deeply connected to
      religion. Since the fall of man, all true religion must be taught through
      divine revelation, which God has given to his Church in various parts and
      ways, causing this light to increase gradually until the entire mystery of
      his grace was fully revealed in and through Jesus Christ, in whom all the
      treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      God, who has known all his works from the beginning, has arranged the
      revelation of his will to men, his interactions with them, and all the
      works of his holy providence towards them, with respect to the fullness of
      time and the gathering of all things under the headship of Christ Jesus.
      Therefore, in all our searching for the mind of God in the holy
      Scriptures, we must conduct our inquiries with respect to Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best interpreter of the Old Testament is the Holy Spirit speaking to
      us in the New Testament because there we have the clearest light of the
      knowledge of the glory of God shining upon us in the face of Jesus Christ,
      revealing the counsels of love and grace that were hidden from former ages
      and generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the greater light of the New Testament does not diminish the
      usefulness of the Old Testament. Rather, it obligates us even more to
      study the Old Testament humbly and diligently. This is because the mystery
      of the Gospel cannot be thoroughly understood without a good understanding
      of the economy of the Law and the state of things before the Law. The Old
      and New Testaments are interconnected in such a way that neither can be
      fully understood apart from the other, and a complete system of truth, as
      it is in Jesus, can only be gathered from both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the interactions between God and men that we will encounter in this
      inquiry are of a covenantal nature, it is necessary to first discuss the
      general concept of a covenant relationship with God.
    </p>

    <h2>Covenant</h2>
    <p>
      In any covenantal transaction between God and men, God always initiates
      it. Just as Christ told his disciples that they did not choose him, but he
      chose them, we can say that man has never entered into a covenant with
      God, but rather God has entered into a covenant with man. It is solely the
      prerogative of God's sovereign majesty and the result of his infinite
      goodness to propose, as well as his wisdom to choose and order the terms
      of a covenant relationship between himself and his creatures. Therefore,
      the covenant he has made with men is often referred to in Scripture as the
      Lord's covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, there can be no covenant of mutual benefits between God and
      men, as there can be between one man and another. All creatures
      necessarily depend on and receive their existence and well-being from the
      generosity of their Creator. There is nothing that they have not received
      from him, and therefore, even the most perfect of them can only render to
      him what is already due by the law of their creation. No one can be
      profitable to God, although a righteous person may be profitable to
      himself and his neighbor. Consequently, no one can obligate God or make
      him their debtor unless he condescends to obligate himself through a
      covenant or promise.
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The general notion of any covenant of God with men, considered from God's
      perspective or as proposed by him, can be understood as a declaration of
      his sovereign pleasure concerning the benefits he will bestow on them, the
      communion they shall have with him, and the way and means by which this
      shall be enjoyed by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To better understand this general description, I shall briefly propose
      some particulars that are either included in it or are the immediate and
      necessary consequences of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. It implies a free and sovereign act of the divine will, expressed in
      condescending love and goodness. God does not enter into a covenant with
      men out of any necessity of nature, but of his own good pleasure. The
      privilege and nearness to God included in a covenant interest cannot
      immediately result from the relationship that creatures have with God,
      even as reasonable creatures in a perfect state. The Lord does not owe man
      the good promised in any covenant antecedently; man's first right to it is
      freely given by the promise of the covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The notion of a covenant adds assurance to that of a promise, as it
      implies a special bond of favor and friendship that belongs to a
      covenantal interest and relationship. A covenant is the foundation of a
      special relationship between the parties involved, and the kind and
      benefit of this relationship are determined by the covenant itself, its
      nature, promises, and end.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Therefore, the immediate and direct end of God entering into a covenant
      with man at any time (as far as it concerns man himself) is the
      advancement and betterment of his state. God has never made a covenant
      with man in which his goodness was not abundantly manifest. Such is his
      infinite bounty that he has proposed no lower end to his covenant
      transactions with men than bringing them into a blessed state in the
      eternal enjoyment of himself. When one covenant (through the weakness of
      man in his fallen state) has been found weak and unprofitable in
      accomplishing this great end, God finds fault, abolishes it, and
      introduces another that fully provides for the perfect salvation of those
      who have an interest in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. God's kindness and condescending love in entering into a covenant with
      man strengthen the bond of love and obedience that man owes to God by the
      law of his creation, adding a new obligation to it. Therefore, man's sin
      in breaking covenant with God is more severe and accompanied by greater
      aggravations than the mere transgression of a law if no such covenant
      relationship had been added.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The revelation of the counsel of God's will in a covenant proposed to
      man, far from excluding a restipulation on man's part, renders it a
      necessary duty. Unlike covenantal transactions between equals, where one
      party is at liberty to refuse the covenant offered by the other, our
      infinite distance from God as creatures, our necessary dependence upon
      him, and our duty to him by the unalterable law of our creation (as well
      as our own advantage and profit) oblige us to accept both the benefits he
      offers and the terms on which they are offered in his covenant, and to
      diligently perform what he commands and directs us to do for the purposes
      proposed therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. However, this restipulation (and consequently, the way and manner of
      obtaining and the right in which we claim covenant blessings) must
      necessarily vary according to the different nature and terms of the
      covenants that God makes with men at any time. If the covenant is of
      works, the restipulation must be by doing the things required in it, even
      by fulfilling its condition in perfect obedience to its law, and the
      reward is of debt (not absolutely, but by compact) according to the terms
      of such a covenant. But if it is a covenant of free and sovereign grace,
      the required restipulation is a humble receiving or hearty believing of
      those gratuitous promises on which the covenant is established, and
      accordingly, the reward or covenant blessing is immediately and eminently
      of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Therefore, the goodness and glory of any covenant that God makes with
      men, whether considered absolutely or in comparison with another covenant,
      is chiefly to be measured by its promises and terms. If one covenant is
      established upon better promises (i.e., either promising a more excellent
      good or in a more excellent way) than another, it is for that reason to be
      esteemed a better covenant than the other.
    </p>

    <h2>Condescension</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to these things, it may be timely to further observe that the
      holy and wise God has always dealt with the children of men in a way of
      covenant. The display of infinite goodness has always accompanied the
      discovery of his infinite glory in his dealings with men. Therefore, he
      has not acted towards them to the utmost right of his sovereignty and
      dominion over them. If he had done so, there would never have been any
      reward of future blessedness assigned and made due to their obedience, as
      there has been by covenant. Nor would they have been brought into any
      nearer relation to God than that which resulted from their creation by
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the great God has not kept such a distance from man, but has
      condescended to come to terms with him. As he has required obedience in
      some things beyond the immediate dictates of the law of nature, by
      positive institutions, he has also been pleased to oblige himself, beyond
      the debt of a Creator, by the promise of a bountiful reward. Hence, it
      follows that:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. All the worship and obedience that God has required of and accepted
      from the children of men have been upon covenant terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Their ability, or moral capacity, to walk in a manner pleasing to him
      has been given to them or worked in them towards the end of having a
      covenant relationship with him, and must therefore be an inseparable part
      of that covenant interest in which they have been established.
    </p>
    <p>The consequences of this are:</p>
    <p>
      1. Persons who have fallen under the guilt of breaking a covenant are, by
      their own fault, utterly disabled from yielding any acceptable obedience
      to God upon the terms of that covenant which they have violated. They
      remain under the penal sanction of the covenant but are utterly deprived
      of the strength to answer its ends and have wholly lost their right to its
      reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. If they are without strength with respect to the condition and end of
      the covenant in which they once had an interest and principles suited to,
      then they are even more, while they remain in their fallen state, beholden
      to the terms of another covenant that is more excellent, mysterious, and
      wholly supernatural in its doctrine and terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Spiritual strength and the ability to please God can only be restored
      to them by a new covenant interest and the new creation that is the result
      thereof.
    </p>

    <h2>Federal Head</h2>
    <p>
      It is also noteworthy that in the covenants God has made, in which either
      mankind in general or a select number of men, in particular, have been
      concerned, it has pleased him to first transact with some public person,
      head, or representative for all others who should be involved in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the case in the covenant of creation, which God made with Adam in
      his upright state and with all mankind in him, as well as in the Noahic
      covenant. The same is observed in the covenants made with Abraham,
      considered either as the father of believers or of the Israelite nation.
      In the interest of a spiritual relationship to him, believers claim the
      blessings of the covenant of grace made with him. In the interest of a
      natural relationship to him, his offspring according to the flesh claimed
      the rights and privileges of the covenant first peculiarity made with him
      as the head of that separate people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most eminently, the covenant of grace is established in Christ as its
      head. All its promises were first given to him, and in him, they are all
      "Yes" and "Amen." It is by union with him that believers obtain a new
      covenant interest, and from him, they derive a new life, grace, and
      strength to answer the ends of the new covenant.

    <h2>Adam</h2>
    <p>
      The interactions between God and Adam, the relationship Adam had with God,
      and the outcomes and consequences of those interactions are of the utmost
      importance to all of us. A correct understanding of these matters is not
      only necessary for, but also forms the very foundation of all useful
      knowledge about ourselves and God's intentions revealed to humanity in
      subsequent ages, whether before, during, or after the law of Moses, or
      through the teachings of the Gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rightly understanding these things is not only necessary for, but lies at
      the very foundation of all useful knowledge of ourselves and of the mind
      of God in all the revelations he has made of his will and counsel to the
      children of men in subsequent ages, whether before or in the Law of Moses,
      or by the word of the Gospel. The ignorance of this that was in them is
      apparently the reason for the blindness and miserable mistakes of even the
      wisest heathen philosophers in a thousand other matters of the greatest
      importance. If one misses the right account of this, he is certainly
      bewildered in all subsequent searches for the truth that it most concerns
      him to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, it is crucial that we diligently observe what the Holy Spirit
      has recorded for our instruction in this regard. The discussion of this
      subject can be divided into three main points:
    </p>
    <p>1. The state of Adam before he sinned.</p>
    <p>2. His sin and its immediate consequences.</p>
    <p>3. How God dealt with him in his fallen state.</p>

    <h2>Original State</h2>
    <p>
      God created man as a rational being and endowed him with original
      righteousness necessary for enabling him to fulfill the purpose of his
      creation. In this respect, he is notably said to be created "in the image
      of God" (Gen 1:26-27) and to be "made upright" (Eccl 7:29). This
      uprightness or rectitude of nature consisted of the perfect harmony of his
      soul with the law of God, which he was created under and subject to.
    </p>
    <p>This law was:</p>
    <p>
      1. An eternal and invariable rule of righteousness, requiring things
      agreeable to the holiness and rectitude of the divine nature and
      prohibiting whatever is contrary to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Internal and subjective to Adam, being communicated to him with his
      rational nature and written in his heart, so that he needed no external
      revelation to perfect his knowledge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, in the account of his creation, there is no other mention of it
      except that he was made "in the image of God," which, as the Apostle
      teaches us, consists of "righteousness and true holiness" (Eph 4:24). The
      essence of this law was later given in the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai
      and summarized even more concisely by Christ, who reduced it to two great
      commands concerning our duty to God and our neighbor (Mat 22:37-40).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the eternal law, it pleased the divine majesty of Heaven to
      add a positive precept, forbidding man from eating the fruit of one tree
      in the midst of the Garden of Eden, called "The Tree of the Knowledge of
      Good and Evil" (Gen 2:16-17; 3:3). Eating this fruit was not evil in
      itself but was made so by divine prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, it was necessary for God's will concerning this to be expressly
      communicated to man, who otherwise, by the light of nature, would have had
      no more reason to abstain from the fruit of this tree than from any other
      in the garden, nor would he have been under any obligation to do so.
      However, once the command was given, this positive law had its foundations
      firmly laid in the law of nature, as it is an immutable principle that it
      is most righteous and reasonable for man to obey God and for the will of
      the creature to always be subject to the will of the Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, the heart of an upright man could not help but naturally
      embrace and submit to the will of God, made known to him by any means. And
      there can be no transgression of a positive precept without also violating
      the eternal law written in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      This law was safeguarded by a sanction, threatening death for its
      transgression (Gen 2:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      This sanction applied not only to the positive precept to which it was
      expressly attached but also to the law of nature, the transgression of
      which man knows to be deserving of punishment by the same light that
      reveals the law itself to him. This is confirmed by the experience of
      mankind, even in their fallen state, as they not only find within
      themselves some remaining notions of the difference between good and evil
      and a sense of their duty to embrace the former and shun the latter, but
      also have a conscience of punishment due for transgressing these dictates
      of reason. These notions are innate to them and, therefore, can be
      observed both in those who do not have the light of a written law to guide
      them and in those who do (Romans 1:32; 2:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam was not only under the threat of death in case of disobedience but
      also had the promise of an eternal reward on the condition of his perfect
      obedience to these laws. If he had fulfilled this condition, the reward
      would have been due to him by virtue of this compact that God was pleased
      to condescend to for the encouragement of man's obedience and the
      manifestation of His own bounty and goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a promise of reward was indeed given to Adam can be concluded from:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The state and capacity in which God placed Adam, which was a state of
      trial in the way to eternal happiness, under a law of works and the
      exercise of obedience. This cannot be conceived of except as being in
      order to some reward and highest end, proposed to him and attainable by
      him in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The natural inclination of men to expect the reward of eternal
      blessedness for their obedience to God's law and to stand before Him on
      the terms of a covenant of works. This must necessarily presuppose Adam's
      relation to God in such a covenant, to which the promise of such a reward
      belonged, and the knowledge of these covenant terms communicated to him
      along with the law of his creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The sacramental use of the Tree of Life in the midst of the Garden of
      Eden, which was instituted by God as a sign and pledge of the eternal life
      that Adam would have obtained by his own personal and perfect obedience to
      God's law, had he continued in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this tree was appointed by God for such a use and end is inferred
      from:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Christ's allusion to it in the New Testament (Revelation 2:7), where He
      promises an eternal reward to the one who overcomes, stating, "I will give
      him to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midst of the paradise of
      God." The reason for this is taken from God's appointment of this tree to
      be an assurance of eternal life to Adam upon the terms and condition of a
      covenant of works, and the analogy of that reward which Christ gives to
      His faithful ones upon the terms of another covenant. This analogy
      consists in the general nature of an eternal reward promised, though there
      may not be an identity or perfect agreement in the degree or particular
      kind thereof. It seems reasonable to conclude that it was in some respects
      inferior to the glory we are called to by Jesus Christ, though both agree
      in the notion of an eternal and, in its kind, perfect happiness.
      Therefore, the one is expressed by terms that relate to a former assurance
      of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. From the way God dealt with Adam regarding the Tree of Life after he
      had sinned, and the reason God Himself assigned for it: "Lest he put forth
      his hand, and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live for ever"
      (Gen 3:22). We should not suppose that Adam could have actually obtained
      eternal life by eating from the Tree of Life after he had sinned against
      God; rather, the entire discourse is ironic. Just as the preceding words,
      "Behold, the man has become like one of us," are a holy rebuke of man's
      folly in aspiring to such a state by breaking God's law based on the
      devil's suggestion, these words also indicate a further delusion that
      fallen man was in danger of entertaining—the opinion (which vain man is
      ready to nurture in himself on any pretext) that he still has the capacity
      to recover his forfeited happiness this way or by any other work of his
      own. Nevertheless, they teach us the original use and purpose of this
      tree, as well as the fact that Adam was not ignorant of it, though he was
      now to be taught the utter impossibility of obtaining life by a broken
      covenant, as access to the tree was guarded and prohibited by the
      cherubim's flaming sword that turned every way to keep the way to the Tree
      of Life.
