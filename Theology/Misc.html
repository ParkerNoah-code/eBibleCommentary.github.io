  <h1>Nicaea</h1>
  <p>
    The Council of Nicaea, held in 325 AD, was a pivotal moment in the history
    of Christianity. It was the first ecumenical council of the Christian
    Church, convened by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in Nicaea (present-day
    Iznik, Turkey). This council was primarily called to resolve the Arian
    controversy and to achieve unity in the Christian Church.
  </p>
  <h2>History Behind the Council</h2>
  <p>
    Before the Council of Nicaea, Christianity was heavily persecuted within the
    Roman Empire. However, the conversion of Constantine I to Christianity and
    his subsequent Edict of Milan in 313 AD granted religious tolerance
    throughout the empire, dramatically changing Christianity&#x27;s status and
    setting the stage for the Council.
  </p>
  <p>
    The immediate cause of the Council was the Arian controversy, which began in
    Alexandria when Arius, a presbyter, taught that the Son of God (Jesus
    Christ) was not co-eternal with the Father, suggesting there was a time when
    the Son did not exist. This teaching challenged the traditional
    understanding of the Trinity and created significant theological division
    within the Church.
  </p>
  <h2>The Council of Nicaea</h2>
  <p>
    In response to the Arian controversy, Constantine summoned the council,
    which was attended by approximately 300 bishops from different regions of
    the empire. The primary objective was to address the relationship between
    the Father and the Son (Christ) within the Holy Trinity, which Arius had put
    into question.
  </p>
  <p>
    The council ultimately condemned Arius and his teachings as heretical,
    leading to the formulation of the Nicene Creed, a statement of faith that
    affirmed the co-eternity and consubstantiality (of the same substance) of
    the Son with the Father. The Creed became a central element of Christian
    orthodoxy.
  </p>
  <h2>After the Council</h2>
  <p>
    The Council of Nicaea did not immediately end the Arian controversy. In the
    years that followed, Arianism continued to have supporters, especially among
    the Gothic tribes and in certain imperial circles. The debate over the
    nature of Christ and the Trinity persisted through several subsequent
    councils.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Nicene Creed itself underwent further development, particularly at the
    First Council of Constantinople in 381 AD, which expanded the section on the
    Holy Spirit and affirmed the Nicene faith against ongoing Arianism.
  </p>
  <h1>Arianism</h1>
  <p>"there was a time when He was not"</p>
  <p>
    <b>Subordinationism</b>: Arius, a presbyter in Alexandria, espoused a form
    of subordinationism. He argued that the Son (Jesus Christ) was created by
    the Father and, therefore, was not co-eternal or of the same essence as the
    Father. Arius used the term "there was a time when He was not" to emphasize
    that the Son did not exist before being begotten by the Father. This view
    implied a hierarchy within the Trinity, with the Son being subordinate to
    the Father.
  </p>
  <h2>Never Not the Son</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Consubstantiality</b>: The opposing view, which came to be recognized as
    orthodox, argued that the Son was "consubstantial" (homoousios) with the
    Father, meaning of the same essence or substance. This term was crucial in
    expressing the belief that the Son was not a created being but eternally
    begotten of the Father, thus sharing the same divine nature.
  </p>
  <h2>Greek</h2>
  <p>
    The term "homoousios" (ὁμοούσιος) was adopted by the Council of Nicaea to
    affirm that the Son is of the same essence (ousia) as the Father, directly
    opposing Arianism, which proposed a different nature of Christ in relation
    to God the Father.
  </p>
  <p>
    Homoiousios (ὁμοιούσιος): This term means "of similar essence" or "of like
    substance." While it might seem like a minor linguistic difference from
    "homoousios," the implication is significant. "Homoiousios" suggests that
    the Son is similar to, but not exactly the same as, the Father, implying a
    sort of subordination or difference in essence that could align with Arian
    views, though not as radically separated as Arianism suggested. This term
    was preferred by those who sought a middle ground, attempting to maintain a
    notion of the Son's divinity while also addressing concerns about asserting
    too direct a parity with the Father, which some feared could imply two
    co-equal gods and thus challenge monotheism.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The Council's decision to use "homoousios" was pivotal, marking a clear
    doctrinal stance against Arianism by affirming the full divinity of the Son,
    equal to that of the Father, thereby maintaining the unity and co-eternality
    of the Godhead. This choice underscored the rejection of any form of
    subordinationism or suggestion that the Son was a lesser or different kind
    of divine being than the Father. The debate over these terms was not merely
    semantic but touched on the very heart of Christian understanding of the
    nature of God, the relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
    and the mystery of the Incarnation.

  <h1>Manuscipts</h1>
  <p>
    Homer’s Iliad: One of the best-attested ancient texts outside the New
    Testament, with about 1,757 surviving manuscripts. However, the earliest
    complete copies of the Iliad are from the 10th century AD, almost 500 years
    after the New Testament&#x27;s earliest manuscripts, and over 2,000 years
    after the Iliad was composed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Works of Plato: There are fewer than 210 manuscripts, with the earliest
    copies dating from about 900 years after the original compositions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tacitus’ Annals: Only two major manuscripts that contain portions of
    Tacitus’ work, with the earliest from the 9th century, which is about 700
    years after Tacitus wrote.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caesar’s Gallic Wars: About ten manuscripts are known, with the earliest
    copies dating to 900 years after Caesar&#x27;s time.
  </p>
  <h2>NT</h2>
  <p>
    P52 (Rylands Library Papyrus P52): Dated to around 125 AD, this small
    fragment contains parts of John 18:31-33, 37-38. It is the earliest known NT
    manuscript, providing a crucial link to the text&#x27;s original form.
  </p>
  <p>
    P66 (Papyrus Bodmer II): From around 200 AD, this nearly complete codex
    contains a large part of the Gospel of John. It is written in a professional
    hand and demonstrates the transition from scroll to codex form.
  </p>
  <p>
    P46 (Chester Beatty Papyrus II): Dated to around 200 AD, it is one of the
    oldest manuscripts of the epistles of Paul, containing almost all of them
    with some lacunae.
  </p>
  <h2>Preservation</h2>
  <p>
    Quantity: There are over 5,800 known Greek manuscripts of the New Testament,
    in addition to thousands more in Latin, Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, and other
    languages. This makes the New Testament the best-attested ancient document.
  </p>
  <p>
    Time Gap: The earliest New Testament manuscript fragments date from about
    125 AD, with significant portions of the New Testament available from the
    3rd and 4th centuries. This is within 100 years of the original compositions
    for the earliest fragments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quality: The quality of the manuscripts varies, with some being partial or
    fragmentary and others being more complete. Significant efforts have been
    made over the centuries to preserve, copy, and correct these manuscripts.
  </p>
  <h2>OT</h2>
  <h2>Masoretic</h2>
  <p>
    The most authoritative Hebrew text of the Old Testament is the Masoretic
    Text (MT), compiled and preserved by Jewish scribes known as Masoretes
    between the 7th and 10th centuries CE. The Masoretes not only copied the
    text with meticulous care but also developed a system of vocalization
    (adding vowels to the previously consonant-only text) and cantillation marks
    for pronunciation and syntax. They added marginal notes called "Masorah" to
    preserve details about the text's pronunciation, spelling, and usage. The
    Leningrad Codex (circa 1008 CE) and the Aleppo Codex (circa 920 CE) are
    among the oldest and most complete manuscripts of the Masoretic Text.
  </p>
  <h2>Dead Sea</h2>
  <p>
    The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the mid-20th century at Qumran,
    near the Dead Sea, significantly impacted the study of the Old Testament.
    Dating from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE, these scrolls include
    the oldest known manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible. They contain partial or
    complete copies of almost every book in the Hebrew Bible, plus other texts
    not included in the canonical Hebrew Bible. The Dead Sea Scrolls have
    provided valuable insights into the textual diversity and development of the
    Old Testament before the standardization of the Masoretic Text.
  </p>
  <h2>Septuagint</h2>
  <p>
    The Septuagint (LXX) is a significant ancient Greek translation of the
    Hebrew Bible, completed by Jewish scholars in Alexandria, Egypt, between the
    3rd and 1st centuries BCE. It includes translations of all the books found
    in the Hebrew Bible, along with additional texts not included in the canon
    of the Hebrew Bible but recognized in various Christian Old Testament
    canons. The Septuagint is a crucial source for understanding the text of the
    Old Testament, especially where it preserves readings older or divergent
    from the Masoretic Text.
