        <h2>The Doctrine of the Word of God</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="Scripture/Purpose.html">Purpose</a>: Nature shows God's
          attributes, but not enough for salvation. Thus, God revealed Himself
          in various ways, and the Bible provides all necessary knowledge for
          God's glory, salvation, and living in faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Scripture/Attributes.html">Attributes</a>: The Bible,
          consisting of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired and
          infallible Word of God, authoritative in matters of faith and
          practice, clear to understand with the Holy Spirit's aid, and without
          the need for any infallible human interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Scripture/Canon.html">Canon</a>: The Bible, the written Word
          of God, contains the Old and New Testaments. The books commonly called
          the Apocrypha were not inspired and are not part of the Bible canon.
          Therefore, they should be viewed and used as other merely human
          writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Scripture/Proofs.html">Proofs</a>: Belief in the Bible's
          divine origin is due to the Holy Spirit's testimony within us,
          supported by the church's testimony, its heavenly content, effective
          teachings, stylistic majesty, harmonious parts, focus on God's glory,
          and many other incomparable qualities and complete perfections.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Scripture/SolaScriptura.html">Rule of Faith</a>: The Bible
          alone is the complete revelation from God intended to be the standard
          for faith and practice. This excludes all unwritten traditions and
          decrees of the visible Church; all resolutions of conventions, or
          other public bodies, declaring this or that to be right or wrong, true
          or false.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Scripture/Hermeneutics.html">Hermeneutics</a>: The words of
          Scripture are to be taken in the sense attached to them in the age and
          by the people to whom they were addressed, and under the Holy Spirit's
          guidance. God cannot teach in one place anything which is inconsistent
          with what He teaches in another.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Scripture/Translation.html">Translation</a>: The Bible was
          written in Hebrew and Greek, preserved by God over time, and should be
          translated into all languages. This way, the Bible can dwell richly in
          everyone, and everyone can both worship God acceptably and have hope
          through the patience and comfort of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Scripture/TextualCriticism.html">Textual Criticism</a>: The
          Church acknowledges that translations and existing copies of original
          texts are not verbally infallible and do contain discrepancies, yet
          these do not compromise essential Christian doctrines. Modern textual
          criticism seeks to restore the most accurate text.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Scripture/Objections.html">Objections</a>: Difficulties in
          understanding the Bible are expected and do not invalidate its divine
          inspiration, no more than mysteries in nature disprove divine
          creation. Many of these challenges diminish over time, are solved, but
          some remain that serve to deepen inquiry and faith.
