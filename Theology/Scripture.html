    <h2>2 Timothy 3:16-17</h2>
    <p>
      "Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof,
      for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that each person who
      belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."
    </p>
    <h2>Hebrews 4:12–13</h2>
    <p>
      "For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged
      sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints
      and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the
      heart. There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things
      are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we must give an
      account."
    </p>
    <h2>2 Peter 1:19–21</h2>
    <p>
      "We have the more sure word of prophecy; and you do well that you heed it
      as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning
      star arises in your hearts, knowing this first, that no prophecy of
      Scripture is of private interpretation. For no prophecy ever came by the
      will of man, but holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit."
    </p>
    <h2>Romans 15:4</h2>
    <p>
      "For whatever things were written before were written for our learning,
      that through perseverance and through encouragement of the Scriptures we
      might have hope."
    </p>
    <h2>Matthew 24:35</h2>
    <p>"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."</p>
    <h2>Isaiah 55:10-11</h2>
    <p>
      "For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky, and doesn’t return
      there, but waters the earth, and makes it grow and bud, and gives seed to
      the sower and bread to the eater; so is my word that goes out of my mouth:
      it will not return to me void, but it will accomplish that which I please,
      and it will prosper in the thing I sent it to do."

        >1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy</a
      >:
    </p>
    <h2>A Short Statement</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b>
      God, who is Himself Truth and speaks truth only, has inspired Holy
      Scripture in order thereby to reveal Himself to lost mankind through Jesus
      Christ as Creator and Lord, Redeemer and Judge. Holy Scripture is God’s
      witness to Himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b>
      Holy Scripture, being God’s own Word, written by men prepared and
      superintended by His Spirit, is of infallible divine authority in all
      matters upon which it touches: it is to be believed, as God’s instruction,
      in all that it affirms; obeyed, as God’s command, in all that it requires;
      embraced, as God’s pledge, in all that it promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b>
      The Holy Spirit, Scripture’s divine Author, both authenticates it to us by
      His inward witness and opens our minds to understand its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4.</b>
      Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault
      in all its teaching, no less in what it states about God’s acts in
      creation, about the events of world history, and about its own literary
      origins under God, than in its witness to God’s saving grace in individual
      lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5.</b> The authority of Scripture is inescapably impaired if this total
      divine inerrancy is in any way limited or disregarded, or made relative to
      a view of truth contrary to the Bible’s own; and such lapses bring serious
      loss to both the individual and the Church.
    </p>

    <h2>Articles of Affirmation and Denial</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Article I</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that the Holy Scriptures are to be received as the authoritative
      Word of God. We deny that the Scriptures receive their authority from the
      Church, tradition, or any other human service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article II</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that the Scriptures are the supreme written norm by which God
      binds the conscience, and that the authority of the Church is subordinate
      to that of Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that Church creeds, councils, or declarations have authority
      greater than or equal to the authority of the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article III</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that the written Word in its entirety is revelation given by
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that the Bible is merely a witness to revelation, or only becomes
      revelation in encounter, or depends on the responses of men for its
      validity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article IV</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that God who made mankind in His image has used language as a
      means of revelation. We deny that human language is so limited by our
      creatureliness that it is rendered inadequate as a vehicle for divine
      revelation. We further deny that the corruption of human culture and
      language through sin has thwarted God’s work of inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article V</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that God’s revelation within the Holy Scriptures was
      progressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that later revelation, which may fulfill earlier revelation, ever
      corrects or contradicts it. We further deny that any normative revelation
      has been given since the completion of the New Testament writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article VI</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that the whole of Scripture and all its parts, down to the very
      words of the original, were given by divine inspiration. We deny that the
      inspiration of Scripture can rightly be affirmed of the whole without the
      parts, or of some parts but not the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article VII</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that inspiration was the work in which God by His Spirit,
      through human writers, gave us His Word. The origin of Scripture is
      divine. The mode of divine inspiration remains largely a mystery to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that inspiration can be reduced to human insight, or to heightened
      states of consciousness of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article VIII</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that God in His work of inspiration utilized the distinctive
      personalities and literary styles of the writers whom He had chosen and
      prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that God, in causing these writers to use the very words that He
      chose, overrode their personalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article IX</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that inspiration, though not conferring omniscience, guaranteed
      true and trustworthy utterance on all matters of which the Biblical
      authors were moved to speak and write.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that the finitude of fallenness of these writers, by necessity or
      otherwise, introduced distortion or falsehood into God’s Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article X</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that inspiration, strictly speaking, applies only to the
      autographic text of Scripture, which in the providence of God can be
      ascertained from available manuscripts with great accuracy. We further
      affirm that copies and translations of Scripture are the Word of God to
      the extent that they faithfully represent the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that any essential element of the Christian faith is affected by
      the absence of the autographs. We further deny that this absence renders
      the assertion of Biblical inerrancy invalid or irrelevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article XI</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that Scripture, having been given by divine inspiration, is
      infallible, so that, far from misleading us, it is true and reliable in
      all the matters it addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that it is possible for the Bible to be at the same time
      infallible and errant in its assertions. Infallibility and inerrancy may
      be distinguished, but not separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article XII</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that Scripture in its entirety is inerrant, being free from all
      falsehood, fraud, or deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to
      spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the
      fields of history and science. We further deny that scientific hypotheses
      about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of
      Scripture on creation and the flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article XIII</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm the propriety of using inerrancy as a theological term with
      reference to the complete truthfulness of Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that it is proper to evaluate Scripture according to standards of
      truth and error that are alien to its usage or purpose. We further deny
      that inerrancy is negated by Biblical phenomena such as a lack of modern
      technical precision, irregularities of grammar or spelling, observational
      descriptions of nature, the reporting of falsehoods, the use of hyperbole
      and round numbers, the topical arrangement of material, variant selections
      of material in parallel accounts, or the use of free citations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article XIV</b>
    </p>
    <p>We affirm the unity and internal consistency of Scripture.</p>
    <p>
      We deny that alleged errors and discrepancies that have not yet been
      resolved vitiate the truth claims of the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article XV</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy is ground in the teaching of the
      Bible about inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that Jesus’ teaching about Scripture may be dismissed by appeals
      to accommodation or to any natural limitation of His humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article XVI</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy has been integral to the Church’s
      faith throughout its history.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that inerrancy is a doctrine invented by scholastic Protestantism,
      or is a reactionary position postulated in response to negative higher
      criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article XVII</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that the Holy Spirit bears witness to the Scriptures, assuring
      believers of the truthfulness of God’s written Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that this witness of the Holy Spirit operates in isolation from or
      against Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article XVIII</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that the text of Scripture is to be interpreted by
      grammatico-historical exegesis, taking account of its literary forms and
      devices, and that Scripture is to interpret Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny the legitimacy of any treatment of the text or quest for sources
      lying behind it that leads to relativizing, dehistoricizing, or
      discounting its teaching, or rejecting its claims to authorship.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article XIX</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm that a confession of the full authority, infallibility, and
      inerrancy of Scripture is vital to a sound understanding of the whole of
      the Christian faith. We further affirm that such confession should lead to
      increasing conformity to the image of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deny that such confession is necessary for salvation. However, we
      further deny that inerrancy can be rejected without grave consequences,
      both to the individual and to the Church.

    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 1. Of the Holy Scriptures</h2>
    <h2>1. Purpose of the Bible</h2>
    <p>
      The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of
      all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience.<sup>1</sup> Although the light
      of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the
      goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are
      they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and his will which is
      necessary unto salvation.<sup>2</sup> Therefore it pleased the Lord at
      sundry times and in divers manners to reveal himself, and to declare that
      his will unto his church;<sup>3</sup> and afterward for the better
      preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure
      establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the
      flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same
      wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most
      necessary, those former ways of God's revealing his will unto his people
      being now ceased.<sup>4</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      1. 2 Timothy 3:15-17; Isaiah 8:20; Luke 16:29, 31; Ephesians 2:20
      <br />2. Romans 1:19-21; Romans 2:14-15; Psalms 19:1-3 <br />3. Hebrews
      1:1 <br />4. Proverbs 22:19-21; Romans 15:4; 2 Peter 1:19-20
    </p>
    <h2>2. Scriptural Canon</h2>
    <p>
      Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now
      contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are these:
    </p>
    <p>OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</p>
    <p>
      Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, I
      Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, II Kings, I Chronicles, II Chronicles, Ezra,
      Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, The Song of
      Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel,
      Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,
      Zechariah, Malachi
    </p>
    <p>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</p>
    <p>
      Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts of the Apostles, Paul's Epistle to the
      Romans, I Corinthians, II Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians,
      Colossians, I Thessalonians, II Thessalonians, I Timothy, II Timothy, To
      Titus, To Philemon, The Epistle to the Hebrews, Epistle of James, The
      first and second Epistles of Peter, The first, second, and third Epistles
      of John, The Epistle of Jude, The Revelation All of which are given by the
      inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.<sup>5</sup>
    </p>
    <p>5. 2 Timothy 3:16</p>
    <h2>3. The Apocrypha</h2>
    <p>
      The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are
      no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no
      authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made
      use of than other human writings.<sup>6</sup>
    </p>
    <p>6. Luke 24:27, 44; Romans 3:2</p>
    <h2>4. Biblical Authority</h2>
    <p>
      The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed,
      dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God
      (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received
      because it is the Word of God.<sup>7</sup>
    </p>
    <p>7. 2 Peter 1:19-21; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 John 5:9</p>
    <h2>5. Proofs of Divine Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God to an
      high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of
      the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style,
      the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all
      glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's
      salvation, and many other incomparable excellencies, and entire
      perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence
      itself to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and
      assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from
      the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in
      our hearts.<sup>8</sup>
    </p>
    <p>8. John 16:13-14; 1 Corinthians 2:10-12; 1 John 2:20, 27</p>
    <h2>6. Biblical Sufficiency</h2>
    <p>
      The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own
      glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down or
      necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at any
      time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the Spirit, or
      traditions of men.<sup>9</sup> Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward
      illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving
      understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word,<sup>10</sup> and
      that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and
      government of the church, common to human actions and societies, which are
      to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to
      the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.<sup
        >11</sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      9. 2 Timothy 3:15-17; Galatians 1:8-9
      <br />10. John 6:45; 1 Corinthians 2:9-12 <br />11. 1 Corinthians
      11:13-14; 1 Corinthians 14:26,40
    </p>
    <h2>7. Clarity of the Bible</h2>
    <p>
      All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear
      unto all;<sup>12</sup> yet those things which are necessary to be known,
      believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened
      in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the
      unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a sufficient
      understanding of them.<sup>13</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      12. 2 Peter 3:16
      <br />13. Psalms 19:7; Psalms 119:130
    </p>
    <h2>8. Bible Translation</h2>
    <p>
      The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people
      of God of old),<sup>14</sup> and the New Testament in Greek (which at the
      time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being
      immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept
      pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all controversies of
      religion, the church is finally to appeal to them.<sup>15</sup> But
      because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who
      have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in
      the fear of God to read,<sup>16</sup> and search them,<sup>17</sup>
      therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every
      nation unto which they come,<sup>18</sup> that the Word of God dwelling
      plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and
      through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.<sup>19</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Romans 3:2
      <br />15. Isaiah 8:20 <br />16. Acts 15:15 <br />17. John 5:39 <br />18. 1
      Corinthians 14:6, 9, 11-12, 24, 28 <br />19. Colossians 3:16
    </p>
    <h2>9. Scripture interprets Scripture</h2>
    <p>
      The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture
      itself; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full
      sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be
      searched by other places that speak more clearly.<sup>20</sup>
    </p>
    <p>20. 2 Peter 1:20-21; Acts 15:15-16</p>
    <h2>10. Sola Scriptura</h2>
    <p>
      The supreme judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be
      determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers,
      doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose
      sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture delivered
      by the Spirit, into which Scripture so delivered, our faith is finally
      resolved.<sup>21</sup>

      inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.<sup>5</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      All which are given by inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and
      life.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. Luke 16:29, 31; Eph 2:20; 2 Tim 3:16; Rev 22:18-19.</p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b> The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine
      inspiration, are no part of the Canon of the Scripture; and therefore are
      of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or
      made use of, than other human writings.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. Luke 24:27, 44; Rom 3:2; 2 Pet 1:21.</p>
    <p>
      <b>4.</b> The authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be
      believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or
      church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof; and
      therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. 1 Thes 2:13; 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:19, 21; 1 John 5:9.</p>
    <p>
      <b>5.</b> We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church to an
      high and reverent esteem of the holy Scripture;<sup>a</sup> and the
      heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of
      the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is
      to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of
      man’s salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the entire
      perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence
      itself to be the Word of God; yet, notwithstanding, our full persuasion
      and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is
      from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the
      Word in our hearts.<sup>b</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. 1 Tim 3:15. • b. Isa 59:21; John 16:13-14; 1 Cor 2:10-12; 1 John 2:20,
      27.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6.</b> The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary for
      his own glory, man’s salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set
      down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced
      from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by
      new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.<sup>a</sup>
      Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God
      to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are
      revealed in the Word;<sup>b</sup> and that there are some circumstances
      concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church, common to
      human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of
      nature and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word,
      which are always to be observed.<sup>c</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. Gal 1:8-9; 2 Thes 2:2; 2 Tim 3:15-17. • b. John 6:45; 1 Cor 2:9-12. •
      c. 1 Cor 11:13-14; 14:26, 40.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.</b> All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor
      alike clear unto all;<sup>a</sup> yet those things which are necessary to
      be known, believed, and observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded
      and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned,
      but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a
      sufficient understanding of them.<sup>b</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. 2 Pet 3:16. • b. Psa 119:105, 130.</p>
    <p>
      <b>8.</b> The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of
      the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the
      time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being
      immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept
      pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;<sup>a</sup> so as in all
      controversies of religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them.<sup
        >b</sup
      >
      But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God
      who have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in
      the fear of God, to read and search them,<sup>c</sup> therefore they are
      to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they
      come,<sup>d</sup> that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they
      may worship him in an acceptable manner,<sup>e</sup> and, through patience
      and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.<sup>f</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. Mat 5:18. • b. Isa 8:20; John 5:39, 46; Acts 15:15. • c. John 5:39. •
      d. 1 Cor 14:6, 9, 11-12, 24, 27-28. • e. Col 3:16. • f. Rom 15:4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>9.</b> The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the
      Scripture itself; and therefore, when there is a question about the true
      and full sense of any scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must
      be searched and known by other places that speak more clearly.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. Acts 15:15; 2 Pet 1:20-21.</p>
    <p>
      <b>10.</b> The Supreme Judge, by which all controversies of religion are
      to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient
      writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in
      whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit
      speaking in the Scripture.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. Mat 22:29, 31; Eph 2:20 with Acts 28:25.</p>
