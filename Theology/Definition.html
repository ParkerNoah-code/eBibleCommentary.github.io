        <h2>What is theology?</h2>
        <p>
          The word "theology" is commonly used to describe a more theoretical
          displine looking at the existence and sovereignty of God, creation,
          and other similar topics. Christian theology considers matters from
          the vantage point of Scripture and is concerned with a broader range
          of topics like ethics, Bible translation, and redemption:
        </p>
        <p>
          Theology is the science of God and of the relations between God and
          the creation. Theology is the science of the sciences because it
          reveals the underlying ground which all other sciences require for
          their complete explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian theology is the application of Scripture by believers to all
          aspects of life.<sup>1</sup> This includes the normative commands of
          Scripture, the existential experiences of man, and the situational
          application of Scritpure to varying aspects of life. It's goal is to
          allow us to know and serve God, meet the spiritual needs of his people
          and the world, and to promote godliness.

          1. This definition of theology and the perspectival notion of theology
          is based on the work of John Frame in
          <em>Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</em>
          (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R, 2013), Ch. 1. John Frame is “seeking to
          discourage the notion that theology is 'properly' something
          theoretical, something academic, as opposed to the practical teaching
          that goes on in preaching, counselling, and Christian friendship,”
          <em>The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God</em> (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R,
          1987), pp. 81-85. Theology has to do with the good, the truth and the
          beautiful; it involves the head, the heart, and the hands; it starts
          with the God's calling and election, we respond in faith, and the
          result is that Christ is proclaimed to a lost world in need of a
          saviour.
