        <h2>What is theology?</h2>
        <p>
          The word "theology" is commonly used to describe a more theoretical
          displine looking at the existence and providence of God, creation, and
          other similar topics. Christian theology considers matters from the
          vantage point of Scripture and is concerned with a broader range of
          topics like ethics, translation, and redemption:
        </p>
        <p>
          Theology is the science of God and of the relations between God and
          the creation. Theology is the science of the sciences because it
          reveals the underlying ground which all other sciences require for
          their complete explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian theology is the application of Scripture by people to all
          aspects of life.<sup>1</sup> This includes the normative commands of
          Scripture, the existential experiences of man, and the situational
          application of Scritpure to varying aspects of life.
