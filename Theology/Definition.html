        <h2>What is Theology?</h2>
        <p>
          The word "theology" is commonly used to describe a more theoretical
          displine looking at the existence and sovereignty of God, creation,
          and other similar topics. Christian theology considers matters from
          the vantage point of Scripture and is concerned with a broader range
          of topics like ethics, Bible translation, and redemption:
        </p>
        <p>
          Theology is the science of God and of the relations between God and
          the creation. Theology is the science of the sciences because it
          reveals the underlying ground which all other sciences require for
          their complete explanation. Theology binds and orients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian theology is the application of Scripture by believers to all
          aspects of life.<sup>1</sup> Theology has to do with the good, the
          truth, and the beautiful. It involves the whole of the believer: the
          head, the heart, and the hands (what we think, how we feel, and what
          we do). It's goal is to allow us to know and serve God, to meet the
          spiritual needs of his people and the world, and to promote godliness.
        </p>
        <h2>Scripture</h2>
        <p>
          "Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for
          reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that
          each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped
          for every good work." (2 Tim 3:16-17).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ,
          let’s press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of
          repentance from dead works, of faith toward God, of the teaching of
          baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of
          eternal judgment. This will we do, if God permits." (Heb 6:1-3).
        </p>
        <p>
          "The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are
          revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all
          the words of this law." (Deut 29:29).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason
          concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear, having a
          good conscience. Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they
          may be disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ." (1 Pet
          3:15-16).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord
          that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of
          those who hear. Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a
          workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of
          Truth. But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,
          and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and
          Philetus: men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the
          resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.
          However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: 'The Lord
          knows those who are his,' and, 'Let every one who names the name of
          the Lord depart from unrighteousness.'" (2 Tim 2:14-19).

        <h2>Methodological Points</h2>
        <p>
          Theology must be centered on the Bible and its application. Adequate
          theological arguments must show their biblical basis to be persuasive
          and authoritative within the Christian community. Without this
          connection, theological ideas risk becoming disconnected from the
          foundational truths of the Christian faith. Biblical application
          involves discerning how biblical truths speak to contemporary issues,
          guide moral decisions, and shape Christian living.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Bible is the primary source for Christian theology,
          understanding it fully often requires insights from various other
          fields of knowledge. For example, knowledge of the biblical languages
          (Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek) is significant for accurate
          interpretation of the biblical texts. Similarly, understanding the
          cultural and historical context of the Bible enhances our ability to
          grasp its meaning. Creeds and confessions are distilled reflections of
          centuries of theological thought and debate. Fields such as
          psychology, sociology, politics, and the natural sciences provide
          insights into the human condition and the world that can inform how
          theology is applied today
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent times, there has been a tendency in theological scholarship
          to prioritize historical and philosophical analysis over direct
          engagement with Scripture. This shift has led to a form of theology
          that is more concerned with understanding past theological thought or
          engaging with contemporary philosophical ideas than with directly
          applying biblical truths to life. Theologians should ensure that they
          remain rooted and grounded in the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current system for training theologians, particularly in liberal
          universities, emphasizes autonomous reasoning over the application of
          Scripture, leading to a disconnect between academic theology and the
          needs of the church. Evangelical theologians who are trained in such
          environments may struggle to reconcile their academic training with
          the expectations of the church. This tension can contribute to
          doctrinal drift within evangelical institutions, as the pressures to
          conform to secular academic norms may overshadow the commitment to
          biblical fidelity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evangelical institutions should develop new methods for training
          theologians which prioritize deep engagement with the Bible. This
          would involve a shift away from the current focus on auxiliary
          disciplines and toward a more Scripture-centered approach. To achieve
          this, evangelical institutions may need to distance themselves from
          the secular academic establishment, including potentially rejecting
          the standards and accreditation systems that require conformity to
          secular academic norms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, while academic rigor is important in theology, it is not
          sufficient on its own. The task of applying Scripture requires more
          than intellectual ability; it demands a personal relationship with
          Jesus Christ, characterized by love, devotion, and a desire to follow
          Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          A theologian must also possess a prayerful spirit, meaning they should
          approach their work with humility and dependence on God, seeking His
          guidance in understanding and applying His Word. Additionally, they
          must be attuned to the needs of the people they serve, understanding
          the real-life issues and struggles that believers face.
        </p>
        <p>
          This holistic approach to theology recognizes that true wisdom comes
          from both the mind and the heart and leads to action. The best
          theological work is done by those who not only understand the Bible
          intellectually but who also live out its teachings in their own lives
          and seek to help others do the same. This ensures that theology
          remains relevant and practical, serving the church and its mission in
          the world.

          1. This definition of theology and the perspectival notion of theology
          is based on the work of John Frame in
          <em>Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</em>
          (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R, 2013), Ch. 1. John Frame is “seeking to
          discourage the notion that theology is 'properly' something
          theoretical, something academic, as opposed to the practical teaching
          that goes on in preaching, counselling, and Christian friendship,”
          <em>The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God</em> (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R,
          1987), pp. 81-85.
