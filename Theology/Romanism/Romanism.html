    <h2>Sola Ecclesia</h2>
    <p>
      The Roman church claims far-reaching authority for itself as the only
      proper identifier and interpreter of Scripture and Tradition, which is
      considered to be the written and unwritten Word of God respectively. It
      teaches that those who presume to be able to interpret Scripture or the
      Fathers for themselves are mistaken; it belongs to the church alone to
      judge the true sense and interpretation of such writings. In terms of
      ultimate authority, this represents Sola Ecclesia, the belief that the
      Roman church alone is the supreme authority for all Christian faith and
      practice in contrast to the Protestant belief in Sola Scriptura, that the
      Scriptures alone are the sole sufficient and infallible grounds for all
      Christian faith and practice.

        Furthermore, to check unbridled spirits, it decrees that no one relying
        on his own judgment shall, in matters of faith and morals pertaining to
        the edification of Christian doctrine, distorting the Holy Scriptures in
        accordance with his own conceptions, presume to interpret them contrary
        to that sense which holy mother Church, to whom it belongs to judge of
        their true sense and interpretation, has held and holds, or even
        contrary to the unanimous teaching of the Fathers, even though such
        interpretations should never at any time be published. Those who act
        contrary to this shall be made known by the ordinaries and punished in
        accordance with the penalties prescribed by the law.

        But the task of authentically interpreting the word of God, whether
        written or handed on, has been entrusted exclusively to the living
        teaching office of the Church, whose authority is exercised in the name
        of Jesus Christ. This teaching office is not above the word of God, but
        serves it, teaching only what has been handed on, listening to it
        devoutly, guarding it scrupulously and explaining it faithfully in
        accord with a divine commission and with the help of the Holy Spirit, it
        draws from this one deposit of faith everything which it presents for
        belief as divinely revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is clear, therefore, that sacred tradition, Sacred Scripture and the
        teaching authority of the Church, in accord with God's most wise design,
        are so linked and joined together that one cannot stand without the
        others, and that all together and each in its own way under the action
        of the one Holy Spirit contribute effectively to the salvation of souls.
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic Church (RCC) points to Scripture and Tradition to
      defend its complete and comprehensive authority over the Church. However,
      when one looks in Scripture, no teaching about an infallible teaching
      office can be found. The RCC also forbids its people from interpreting the
      Bible in any way contrary to its official declarations. The faithful
      Papist looks at the text of Scripture and only finds support for the RCC's
      authority claims because they are forbidden from any other interpretation 
      and only allowed to follow what the RCC says
      it says. A similar analysis holds for Tradition. The RCC defines what
      counts and does not count as Tradition and arrogates only to itself the
      right to interpret said Tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, defenses of Roman Catholicism and its beliefs and practices always
      boil down to, "Because the RCC says so." Rather than being a three-legged
      stool based on church heirarchy, Tradition, and Scripture, the RCC is a
      leaning tower of Piza held up solely by weak and baseless authority
      claims. The fundamental difference between Protestants and Catholics is
      not based on what the text of Scripture actually says or what we actually
      find in church history. Both of those clearly contradict the claims of the
      Papists. The real dividing line is one's ultimate authority and
      allegiance: one must either follow Scripture above all else or follow the
      teachings of the Popes above all else. One cannot follow both.

    <h2>How Tradition Nullifies Scripture</h2>
    <p>
      We give credit to Rome for this: she professes to hold that the Bible is
      the Word of God. She repudiates and denounces modernism, which in reality
      is a more or less consistent denial of the supernatural throughout the
      Christian system and which unfortunately has come to have a strong
      influence in some Protestant churches. Modernists seek to reduce some of
      the historical accounts of the Bible, as for example those of the creation
      of man and of the fall, to mere myths or legends. Also, modernists usually
      say that the Bible <em>contains</em> the Word of God, but deny that it is
      in all its parts actually the Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But having said that, we must point out how Rome also nullifies or
      destroys the Word. She maintains that alongside of the written Word there
      is also an unwritten Word, an oral tradition, which was taught by Christ
      and the apostles but which is not in the Bible, which rather was handed
      down generation after generation by word of mouth. This unwritten Word of
      God, it is said, comes to expression in the pronouncements of the church
      councils and in papal decrees. It takes precedence over the written Word
      and interprets it. The pope, as God’s personal representative on the
      earth, can legislate for things additional to the Bible as new situations
      arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council of Trent, the most authoritative of all Roman councils and the
      one of greatest historical importance, in the year 1546, declared that the
      Word of God is contained both in the Bible and in tradition, that the two
      are of equal authority, and that it is the duty of every Christian to
      accord them equal veneration and respect. Thus, while modernism takes away
      from the Word of God, Romanism adds to it. Both are in error, and each
      would seem to be about equally bad. It would be hard to say which has done
      more to undermine true religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The untrustworthiness of oral tradition, however, is apparent for several
      reasons. In the first place, the early Christians, who were closest to
      Christ and the apostles, and whose testimony therefore would have been
      most valuable, wrote but very little because of the persecutions to which
      they were exposed. And what is found in the writings of the second and
      third centuries has but little reference to the doctrines which at present
      are in dispute between Protestants and Roman Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradition, therefore, for hundreds of years allegedly was transmitted by
      mere <em>report</em>. And it is this which Rome receives as of equal
      authority with the written Word. But so unreliable is report that it has
      become a proverb that “a story never loses in its carriage.” In other
      words, a story seldom retains its original character without addition and
      exaggeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, we have a remarkable instance in the New Testament itself in
      which report or tradition circulated a falsehood, showing how easily oral
      tradition can become corrupted, how in a particular instance it did become
      corrupted even in the apostolic age. In John 21:21-23 we read: “Peter
      therefore seeing him (John) saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man
      do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
      that to thee? follow thou me. This saying therefore went forth among the
      brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him,
      that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
      that to thee?” Surely we cannot build a church on such an insecure
      foundation as oral tradition!
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, that the body of tradition is not of divine origin nor
      apostolic is proved by the fact that some traditions contradict others.
      The church fathers repeatedly contradict one another. When a Roman
      Catholic priest is ordained, he solemnly vows to interpret the Scriptures
      only according to “the unanimous consent of the fathers.” But such
      “unanimous consent” is purely a myth. The fact is they scarcely agree on
      any doctrine. They contradict each other, and even contradict themselves
      as they change their minds and affirm what they previously had denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustine, the greatest of the fathers, in his later life wrote a special
      book in which he set forth his <em>Retractions</em>. Some of the fathers
      of the second century held that Christ would return shortly and that He
      would reign personally in Jerusalem for a thousand years. But two of the
      best known scholars of the early church, Origen (185-254), and Augustine
      (354-430), wrote against that view. The early fathers condemned the use of
      images in worship, while later ones approved such use. The early fathers
      almost unanimously advocated the reading and free use of the Scriptures,
      while the later ones restricted such reading and use. Gregory the Great,
      bishop of Rome and the greatest of the early bishops, denounced the
      assumption of the title of Universal Bishop as anti-Christian. But later
      popes even to the present day have been very insistent on using that and
      similar titles which assert universal authority. Where, then, is the
      universal tradition and unanimous consent of the fathers to papal
      doctrine?
    </p>
    <p>
      The men who wrote the books of the Bible were inspired by the Holy Spirit
      and so were preserved from error. But the traditions of the church
      fathers, the church councils, and the popes are of a lower order and
      contain many errors and contradictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellarmine (1542-1621), a Jesuit and a noted Roman Catholic writer,
      divides tradition into three classes—divine, apostolic, and
      ecclesiastical. Divine traditions are those which it is alleged Christ
      Himself taught or ordained, which were not written but were handed down
      generation after generation by word of mouth. Apostolic traditions are
      those which were taught by the apostles but not written. And
      ecclesiastical traditions are those council pronouncements and papal
      decrees which have accumulated through the centuries. We insist, however,
      that it would have been utterly impossible for those traditions to have
      been handed down with accuracy generation after generation by word of
      mouth and in an atmosphere dark with superstition and immorality such as
      characterized the entire church, laity and priesthood alike, through long
      periods of its history. And we assert that there is no proof whatever that
      they were so transmitted. Clearly the bulk of those traditions originated
      with the monks during the Middle Ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the leaders of the Reformation appealed to Scripture and thundered
      against the errors of the Roman Church, that church had to defend herself.
      And since she could not do so from the Bible alone, she resorted to these
      other writings. The result is that the most prominent doctrines and
      practices of the Roman Church, such as purgatory, the priesthood, the
      mass, transubstantiation, prayers for the dead, indulgences, penance,
      worship of the Virgin Mary, the use of images in worship, holy water,
      rosary beads, celibacy of priests and nuns, the papacy itself, and
      numerous others, are founded solely on tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is on such a basis as this that the Roman Church seeks to establish
      herself as “the only true church.” But when the Roman Catholic layman
      searches his Bible for confirmation of the distinctive doctrines of his
      church, he finds either absolute silence or a distinct negative. The
      Bible, for instance, has nothing to say about the pope or the papacy as an
      institution, and it is emphatic and uncompromising in its commands against
      the use of images or idols in worship. It is natural that the Roman Church
      does not want to give up tradition. It cannot. If it were to give up
      tradition the whole system would fall to the ground, so much of its
      doctrine and practice has no other foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technically, the Roman Church does not claim that the pope receives new
      revelations or that he is inspired by the Holy Spirit as were the prophets
      and apostles when they wrote Scripture. In fact it denies that it
      formulates any new doctrines at all. Rather it insists that in
      <em>ex cathedra</em>
      pronouncements the Holy Spirit enables the pope to draw out and proclaim
      what belonged to the original revelation. But it does claim a divine
      presence of the Holy Spirit in the giving of
      <em>ex cathedra</em> pronouncements and in the formulation of traditions—
      which we would say is precisely the same in principle as claiming
      inspiration. At any rate, by this device it professes to maintain the
      unchangeability of the church while in reality it adds new doctrines.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is obvious how inaccessible the Roman rule of faith is. No priest has
      the rule of his faith, which he vows to accept at ordination, unless he
      has all these numerous and ponderous volumes. No one could possibly master
      such a mass of materials, even if they contained no contradictions. And
      such a rule of faith is utterly beyond the reach of the laity.

    <h2>Romanism an Age-Long Development</h2>
    <p>
      One of the first things that we want to point out in this study is that
      the Roman Catholic Church has not always been what it is today. Rather, it
      has reached its present state as the result of along, slow process of
      development as through the centuries one new doctrine, or ritual, or
      custom after another has been added. Even a superficial reading of the
      following list will make clear that most of the distinctive features of
      the system were unknown to Apostolic Christianity, and that one can hardly
      recognize in present day Romanism the original Christian doctrines. Not
      all dates can be given with exactness since some doctrines and rituals
      were debated or practiced over a period of time before their formal
      acceptance.

    </p>
    <p>
      There you have it—the melancholy evidence of Rome’s steadily increasing
      departure from the simplicity of the Gospel, a departure so radical and
      far-reaching at the present time that it has produced a drastically
      anti-evangelical church. It is clear beyond possibility of doubt that the
      Roman Catholic religion as now practiced is the outgrowth of centuries of
      error. Human inventions have been substituted for Bible truth and
      practice. Intolerance and arrogance have replaced the love and kindness
      and tolerance that were the distinguishing qualities of the first century
      Christians, so that now in Roman Catholic countries Protestants and others
      who are sincere believers in Christ but who do not acknowledge the
      authority of the pope are subject to all kinds of restrictions and in some
      cases even forbidden to practice their religion. The distinctive attitude
      of the present day Roman Church was fixed largely by the Council of Trent
      (1545-1563), with its more than 100 anathemas or curses pronounced against
      all who then or in the future would dare to differ with its decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think what all of this means! Each of the above doctrines or practices can
      be pin-pointed to the exact or approximate date at which it became a part
      of the system. And no single one of them became a part of the system until
      centuries after the time of Christ! Most of these doctrines and practices
      are binding on all Roman Catholics, for they have been proclaimed by a
      supposedly infallible pope or church council. To deny any doctrine or
      practice so proclaimed involves one in mortal sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      What will be next? Indications are that it will be another proclamation
      concerning Mary. Two new doctrines are under discussion: Mary as
      Mediatrix, and Mary as Co-redemptrix. Important Roman Catholic authorities
      have already indicated that these will be the next doctrines officially
      proclaimed. Mary is being presented in current Roman teaching as a
      Mediator along with Christ. She is said to be the “Mediatrix of all
      graces,” and the people are being told that the way to approach Christ is
      through His mother. “To Christ through Mary,” is the slogan. Her images
      outnumber those of Christ, and more prayer is offered to her than to
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also being said that Mary’s sufferings, particularly those at the
      cross, were redemptive in the same sense that Christ’s sufferings were
      redemptive. It would seem that these two doctrines, if adopted, would in
      effect place Mary as a fourth member of the Godhead, along with the
      Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And presumably these doctrines, if adopted,
      will be officially announced by the pope, for he was proclaimed infallible
      in this regard in 1870 and therefore no longer needs the authority of an
      ecumenical council.

      And still the Roman Church boasts that she never changes or teaches new
      doctrines! <em>Semper idem</em> —“Always the same”—is her motto! The fact
      that not one of the doctrines in the above list has any support in the
      Bible disproves conclusively the claim of the priests that their religion
      is the same as that taught by Christ and that the popes have been the
      faithful custodians of that truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that many of the above listed rites and ceremonies were taken
      directly from paganism or from Old Testament Judaism. Some scholars say
      that as much as 75 percent of the Roman ritual is of pagan origin. John
      Henry Newman, later cardinal, in his book,
      <em>The Development of the Christian Religion</em>, admits that “Temples,
      incense, oil lamps, votive offerings, holy water, holy days and seasons of
      devotion, processions, blessings of fields, sacerdotal vestments, the
      tonsure (of priests, monks, and nuns), images, etc., are all of pagan
      origin” (p. 359).

      While the Roman Church has been so free to hurl the name “heretic” at all
      who differ with her, the above list shows that the real heretics are the
      Roman Catholics themselves, and that the true orthodox are the evangelical
      Christians. Says the Scripture:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But in vain do they worship me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts
      of men. ... Making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have
      delivered: and many such like things ye do” (Mark 7:7,13).
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according to this
      word, surely there is no morning for them” (Isaiah 8:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely the Apostle Paul knew the human tendency to add to the Word of God
      when he gave this warning to the early church:
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you,
      not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves shall men arise,
      speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them” (Acts
      20:29-30). And even more strongly: “But though we, or an angel from
      heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we
      preached unto you, let him be anathema” (Galatians 1:8).
