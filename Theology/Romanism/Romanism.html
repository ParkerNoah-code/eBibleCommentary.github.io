    <h2>Sola Ecclesia</h2>
    <p>
      The Roman church claims far-reaching authority for itself as the only
      proper identifier and interpreter of Scripture and Tradition, which is
      considered to be the written and unwritten Word of God respectively. It
      teaches that those who presume to be able to interpret Scripture or the
      Fathers for themselves are mistaken; it belongs to the church alone to
      judge the true sense and interpretation of such writings. In terms of
      ultimate authority, this represents Sola Ecclesia, the belief that the
      Roman church alone is the supreme authority for all Christian faith and
      practice in contrast to the Protestant belief in Sola Scriptura, that the
      Scriptures alone are the sole sufficient and infallible grounds for all
      Christian faith and practice.

        Furthermore, to check unbridled spirits, it decrees that no one relying
        on his own judgment shall, in matters of faith and morals pertaining to
        the edification of Christian doctrine, distorting the Holy Scriptures in
        accordance with his own conceptions, presume to interpret them contrary
        to that sense which holy mother Church, to whom it belongs to judge of
        their true sense and interpretation, has held and holds, or even
        contrary to the unanimous teaching of the Fathers, even though such
        interpretations should never at any time be published. Those who act
        contrary to this shall be made known by the ordinaries and punished in
        accordance with the penalties prescribed by the law.

      Second Vatican Council,
      <a

        >Dei Verbum</a
      >, 1965:

        But the task of authentically interpreting the word of God, whether
        written or handed on, has been entrusted exclusively to the living
        teaching office of the Church, whose authority is exercised in the name
        of Jesus Christ. This teaching office is not above the word of God, but
        serves it, teaching only what has been handed on, listening to it
        devoutly, guarding it scrupulously and explaining it faithfully in
        accord with a divine commission and with the help of the Holy Spirit, it
        draws from this one deposit of faith everything which it presents for
        belief as divinely revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is clear, therefore, that sacred tradition, Sacred Scripture and the
        teaching authority of the Church, in accord with God's most wise design,
        are so linked and joined together that one cannot stand without the
        others, and that all together and each in its own way under the action
        of the one Holy Spirit contribute effectively to the salvation of souls.

      The Roman Catholic Church (RCC) points to Scripture and Tradition to
      defend its complete and comprehensive authority over the Church. However,
      when one looks in Scripture, no teaching about an infallible teaching
      office can be found. The RCC also forbids its people from interpreting the
      Bible in any way contrary to its official declarations. The faithful
      Papist looks at the text of Scripture and only finds support for the RCC's
      authority claims because they are forbidden from any other interpretation
      and only allowed to follow what the RCC says it says. A similar analysis
      holds for Tradition. The RCC defines what counts and does not count as
      Tradition and arrogates only to itself the right to interpret said
      Tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, defenses of Roman Catholicism and its beliefs and practices always
      boil down to, "Because the RCC says so." Rather than being a three-legged
      stool based on church heirarchy, Tradition, and Scripture, the RCC is a
      leaning tower of Piza held up solely by weak and baseless authority
      claims. The fundamental difference between Protestants and Catholics is
      not based on what the text of Scripture actually says or what we actually
      find in church history. Both of those clearly contradict the claims of the
      Papists. The real dividing line is one's ultimate authority and
      allegiance: one must either follow Scripture above all else or follow the
      teachings of the Popes above all else. One cannot follow both.
