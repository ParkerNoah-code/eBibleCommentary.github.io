    <p><b>QUESTION 23</b></p>
    <p>Of Predestination (In Eight Articles)</p>
    <p>
      After consideration of divine providence, we must treat of predestination
      and the book of life. Concerning predestination there are eight points of
      inquiry:
    </p>
    <p>(1) Whether predestination is suitably attributed to God?</p>
    <p>
      (2) What is predestination, and whether it places anything in the
      predestined?
    </p>
    <p>(3) Whether to God belongs the reprobation of some men?</p>
    <p>
      (4) On the comparison of predestination to election; whether, that is to
      say, the predestined are chosen?
    </p>
    <p>
      (5) Whether merits are the cause or reason of predestination, or
      reprobation, or election?
    </p>
    <p>
      (6) Of the certainty of predestination; whether the predestined will
      infallibly be saved?
    </p>
    <p>(7) Whether the number of the predestined is certain?</p>
    <p>
      (8) Whether predestination can be furthered by the prayers of the saints?
    </p>
    <p>FIRST ARTICLE [I, Q. 23, Art. 1]</p>
    <p>Whether Men Are Predestined by God?</p>
    <p>
      Objection 1: It seems that men are not predestined by God, for Damascene
      says (De Fide Orth. ii, 30): &quot;It must be borne in mind that God
      foreknows but does not predetermine everything, since He foreknows all
      that is in us, but does not predetermine it all.&quot; But human merit and
      demerit are in us, forasmuch as we are the masters of our own acts by free
      will. All that pertains therefore to merit or demerit is not predestined
      by God; and thus man&#x27;s predestination is done away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 2: Further, all creatures are directed to their end by divine
      providence, as was said above (Q. 22, AA. 1, 2). But other creatures are
      not said to be predestined by God. Therefore neither are men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 3: Further, the angels are capable of beatitude, as well as men. But
      predestination is not suitable to angels, since in them there never was
      any unhappiness (miseria); for predestination, as Augustine says (De
      praedest. sanct. 17), is the &quot;purpose to take pity [miserendi]&quot;
      [*See Q. 22, A. 3]. Therefore men are not predestined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 4: Further, the benefits God confers upon men are revealed by the
      Holy Ghost to holy men according to the saying of the Apostle (1 Cor.
      2:12): &quot;Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the
      Spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that are given us from
      God.&quot; Therefore if man were predestined by God, since predestination
      is a benefit from God, his predestination would be made known to each
      predestined; which is clearly false.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>On the contrary</em>, It is written (Rom. 8:30): &quot;Whom He
      predestined, them He also called.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I answer that</em>, It is fitting that God should predestine men. For
      all things are subject to His providence, as was shown above (Q. 22, A.
      2). Now it belongs to providence to direct things towards their end, as
      was also said (Q. 22, AA. 1, 2). The end towards which created things are
      directed by God is twofold; one which exceeds all proportion and faculty
      of created nature; and this end is life eternal, that consists in seeing
      God which is above the nature of every creature, as shown above (Q. 12, A.
      4). The other end, however, is proportionate to created nature, to which
      end created being can attain according to the power of its nature. Now if
      a thing cannot attain to something by the power of its nature, it must be
      directed thereto by another; thus, an arrow is directed by the archer
      towards a mark. Hence, properly speaking, a rational creature, capable of
      eternal life, is led towards it, directed, as it were, by God. The reason
      of that direction pre-exists in God; as in Him is the type of the order of
      all things towards an end, which we proved above to be providence. Now the
      type in the mind of the doer of something to be done, is a kind of
      pre-existence in him of the thing to be done. Hence the type of the
      aforesaid direction of a rational creature towards the end of life eternal
      is called predestination. For to destine, is to direct or send. Thus it is
      clear that predestination, as regards its objects, is a part of
      providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 1: Damascene calls predestination an imposition of necessity,
      after the manner of natural things which are predetermined towards one
      end. This is clear from his adding: &quot;He does not will malice, nor
      does He compel virtue.&quot; Whence predestination is not excluded by Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 2: Irrational creatures are not capable of that end which
      exceeds the faculty of human nature. Whence they cannot be properly said
      to be predestined; although improperly the term is used in respect of any
      other end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 3: Predestination applies to angels, just as it does to men,
      although they have never been unhappy. For movement does not take its
      species from the term <em>wherefrom</em> but from the term
      <em>whereto</em>. Because it matters nothing, in respect of the notion of
      making white, whether he who is made white was before black, yellow or
      red. Likewise it matters nothing in respect of the notion of
      predestination whether one is predestined to life eternal from the state
      of misery or not. Although it may be said that every conferring of good
      above that which is due pertains to mercy; as was shown previously (Q. 21,
      AA. 3, 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 4: Even if by a special privilege their predestination were
      revealed to some, it is not fitting that it should be revealed to
      everyone; because, if so, those who were not predestined would despair;
      and security would beget negligence in the predestined.
      _______________________
    </p>
    <p>SECOND ARTICLE [I, Q. 23, Art. 2]</p>
    <p>Whether Predestination Places Anything in the Predestined?</p>
    <p>
      Objection 1: It seems that predestination does place something in the
      predestined. For every action of itself causes passion. If therefore
      predestination is action in God, predestination must be passion in the
      predestined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 2: Further, Origen says on the text, &quot;He who was
      predestined,&quot; etc. (Rom. 1:4): &quot;Predestination is of one who is
      not; destination, of one who is.&quot; And Augustine says (De Praed.
      Sanct.): &quot;What is predestination but the destination of one who
      is?&quot; Therefore predestination is only of one who actually exists; and
      it thus places something in the predestined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 3: Further, preparation is something in the thing prepared. But
      predestination is the preparation of God&#x27;s benefits, as Augustine
      says (De Praed. Sanct. ii, 14). Therefore predestination is something in
      the predestined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 4: Further, nothing temporal enters into the definition of eternity.
      But grace, which is something temporal, is found in the definition of
      predestination. For predestination is the preparation of grace in the
      present; and of glory in the future. Therefore predestination is not
      anything eternal. So it must needs be that it is in the predestined, and
      not in God; for whatever is in Him is eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>On the contrary</em>, Augustine says (De Praed. Sanct. ii, 14) that
      &quot;predestination is the foreknowledge of God&#x27;s benefits.&quot;
      But foreknowledge is not in the things foreknown, but in the person who
      foreknows them. Therefore, predestination is in the one who predestines,
      and not in the predestined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I answer that</em>, Predestination is not anything in the predestined;
      but only in the person who predestines. We have said above that
      predestination is a part of providence. Now providence is not anything in
      the things provided for; but is a type in the mind of the provider, as was
      proved above (Q. 22, A. 1). But the execution of providence which is
      called government, is in a passive way in the thing governed, and in an
      active way in the governor. Whence it is clear that predestination is a
      kind of type of the ordering of some persons towards eternal salvation,
      existing in the divine mind. The execution, however, of this order is in a
      passive way in the predestined, but actively in God. The execution of
      predestination is the calling and magnification; according to the Apostle
      (Rom. 8:30): &quot;Whom He predestined, them He also called and whom He
      called, them He also magnified [Vulg. &#x27;justified&#x27;].&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 1: Actions passing out to external matter imply of themselves
      passion—for example, the actions of warming and cutting; but not so
      actions remaining in the agent, as understanding and willing, as said
      above (Q. 14, A. 2; Q. 18, A. 3, ad 1). Predestination is an action of
      this latter class. Wherefore, it does not put anything in the predestined.
      But its execution, which passes out to external things, has an effect in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 2: Destination sometimes denotes a real mission of someone to a
      given end; thus, destination can only be said of someone actually
      existing. It is taken, however, in another sense for a mission which a
      person conceives in the mind; and in this manner we are said to destine a
      thing which we firmly propose in our mind. In this latter way it is said
      that Eleazar &quot;determined not to do any unlawful things for the love
      of life&quot; (2 Macc. 6:20). Thus destination can be of a thing which
      does not exist. Predestination, however, by reason of the antecedent
      nature it implies, can be attributed to a thing which does not actually
      exist; in whatsoever way destination is accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 3: Preparation is twofold: of the patient in respect to passion
      and this is in the thing prepared; and of the agent to action, and this is
      in the agent. Such a preparation is predestination, and as an agent by
      intellect is said to prepare itself to act, accordingly as it preconceives
      the idea of what is to be done. Thus, God from all eternity prepared by
      predestination, conceiving the idea of the order of some towards
      salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 4: Grace does not come into the definition of predestination,
      as something belonging to its essence, but inasmuch as predestination
      implies a relation to grace, as of cause to effect, and of act to its
      object. Whence it does not follow that predestination is anything
      temporal. _______________________
    </p>
    <p>THIRD ARTICLE [I, Q. 23, Art. 3]</p>
    <p>Whether God Reprobates Any Man?</p>
    <p>
      Objection 1: It seems that God reprobates no man. For nobody reprobates
      what he loves. But God loves every man, according to (Wis. 11:25):
      &quot;Thou lovest all things that are, and Thou hatest none of the things
      Thou hast made.&quot; Therefore God reprobates no man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 2: Further, if God reprobates any man, it would be necessary for
      reprobation to have the same relation to the reprobates as predestination
      has to the predestined. But predestination is the cause of the salvation
      of the predestined. Therefore reprobation will likewise be the cause of
      the loss of the reprobate. But this false. For it is said (Osee 13:9):
      &quot;Destruction is thy own, O Israel; Thy help is only in Me.&quot; God
      does not, then, reprobate any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 3: Further, to no one ought anything be imputed which he cannot
      avoid. But if God reprobates anyone, that one must perish. For it is said
      (Eccles. 7:14): &quot;Consider the works of God, that no man can correct
      whom He hath despised.&quot; Therefore it could not be imputed to any man,
      were he to perish. But this is false. Therefore God does not reprobate
      anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>On the contrary</em>, It is said (Malachi 1:2,3): &quot;I have loved
      Jacob, but have hated Esau.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I answer that</em>, God does reprobate some. For it was said above (A.
      1) that predestination is a part of providence. To providence, however, it
      belongs to permit certain defects in those things which are subject to
      providence, as was said above (Q. 22, A. 2). Thus, as men are ordained to
      eternal life through the providence of God, it likewise is part of that
      providence to permit some to fall away from that end; this is called
      reprobation. Thus, as predestination is a part of providence, in regard to
      those ordained to eternal salvation, so reprobation is a part of
      providence in regard to those who turn aside from that end. Hence
      reprobation implies not only foreknowledge, but also something more, as
      does providence, as was said above (Q. 22, A. 1). Therefore, as
      predestination includes the will to confer grace and glory; so also
      reprobation includes the will to permit a person to fall into sin, and to
      impose the punishment of damnation on account of that sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 1: God loves all men and all creatures, inasmuch as He wishes
      them all some good; but He does not wish every good to them all. So far,
      therefore, as He does not wish this particular good—namely, eternal
      life—He is said to hate or reprobated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 2: Reprobation differs in its causality from predestination.
      This latter is the cause both of what is expected in the future life by
      the predestined—namely, glory—and of what is received in this life—namely,
      grace. Reprobation, however, is not the cause of what is in the
      present—namely, sin; but it is the cause of abandonment by God. It is the
      cause, however, of what is assigned in the future—namely, eternal
      punishment. But guilt proceeds from the free-will of the person who is
      reprobated and deserted by grace. In this way, the word of the prophet is
      true—namely, &quot;Destruction is thy own, O Israel.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 3: Reprobation by God does not take anything away from the
      power of the person reprobated. Hence, when it is said that the reprobated
      cannot obtain grace, this must not be understood as implying absolute
      impossibility: but only conditional impossibility: as was said above (Q.
      19, A. 3), that the predestined must necessarily be saved; yet a
      conditional necessity, which does not do away with the liberty of choice.
      Whence, although anyone reprobated by God cannot acquire grace,
      nevertheless that he falls into this or that particular sin comes from the
      use of his free-will. Hence it is rightly imputed to him as guilt.
      _______________________
    </p>
    <p>FOURTH ARTICLE [I, Q. 23, Art. 4]</p>
    <p>Whether the Predestined Are Chosen by God? [*&quot;Eligantur.&quot;]</p>
    <p>
      Objection 1: It seems that the predestined are not chosen by God. For
      Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv, 1) that as the corporeal sun sends his rays
      upon all without selection, so does God His goodness. But the goodness of
      God is communicated to some in an especial manner through a participation
      of grace and glory. Therefore God without any selection communicates His
      grace and glory; and this belongs to predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 2: Further, election is of things that exist. But predestination from
      all eternity is also of things which do not exist. Therefore, some are
      predestined without election.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 3: Further, election implies some discrimination. Now God &quot;wills
      all men to be saved&quot; (1 Tim. 2:4). Therefore, predestination which
      ordains men towards eternal salvation, is without election.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>On the contrary</em>, It is said (Eph. 1:4): &quot;He chose us in Him
      before the foundation of the world.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I answer that</em>, Predestination presupposes election in the order
      of reason; and election presupposes love. The reason of this is that
      predestination, as stated above (A. 1), is a part of providence. Now
      providence, as also prudence, is the plan existing in the intellect
      directing the ordering of some things towards an end; as was proved above
      (Q. 22, A. 2). But nothing is directed towards an end unless the will for
      that end already exists. Whence the predestination of some to eternal
      salvation presupposes, in the order of reason, that God wills their
      salvation; and to this belong both election and love:—love, inasmuch as He
      wills them this particular good of eternal salvation; since to love is to
      wish well to anyone, as stated above (Q. 20, AA. 2 ,3):—election, inasmuch
      as He wills this good to some in preference to others; since He reprobates
      some, as stated above (A. 3). Election and love, however, are differently
      ordered in God, and in ourselves: because in us the will in loving does
      not cause good, but we are incited to love by the good which already
      exists; and therefore we choose someone to love, and so election in us
      precedes love. In God, however, it is the reverse. For His will, by which
      in loving He wishes good to someone, is the cause of that good possessed
      by some in preference to others. Thus it is clear that love precedes
      election in the order of reason, and election precedes predestination.
      Whence all the predestinate are objects of election and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 1: If the communication of the divine goodness in general be
      considered, God communicates His goodness without election; inasmuch as
      there is nothing which does not in some way share in His goodness, as we
      said above (Q. 6, A. 4). But if we consider the communication of this or
      that particular good, He does not allot it without election; since He
      gives certain goods to some men, which He does not give to others. Thus in
      the conferring of grace and glory election is implied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 2: When the will of the person choosing is incited to make a
      choice by the good already pre-existing in the object chosen, the choice
      must needs be of those things which already exist, as happens in our
      choice. In God it is otherwise; as was said above (Q. 20, A. 2). Thus, as
      Augustine says (De Verb. Ap. Serm. 11): &quot;Those are chosen by God, who
      do not exist; yet He does not err in His choice.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 3: God wills all men to be saved by His antecedent will, which
      is to will not simply but relatively; and not by His consequent will,
      which is to will simply. _______________________
    </p>
    <p>FIFTH ARTICLE [I, Q. 23, Art. 5]</p>
    <p>Whether the Foreknowledge of Merits Is the Cause of Predestination?</p>
    <p>
      Objection 1: It seems that foreknowledge of merits is the cause of
      predestination. For the Apostle says (Rom. 8:29): &quot;Whom He foreknew,
      He also predestined.&quot; Again a gloss of Ambrose on Rom. 9:15: &quot;I
      will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy&quot; says: &quot;I will give
      mercy to him who, I foresee, will turn to Me with his whole heart.&quot;
      Therefore it seems the foreknowledge of merits is the cause of
      predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 2: Further, Divine predestination includes the divine will, which by
      no means can be irrational; since predestination is &quot;the purpose to
      have mercy,&quot; as Augustine says (De Praed. Sanct. ii, 17). But there
      can be no other reason for predestination than the foreknowledge of
      merits. Therefore it must be the cause of reason of predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 3: Further, &quot;There is no injustice in God&quot; (Rom. 9:14). Now
      it would seem unjust that unequal things be given to equals. But all men
      are equal as regards both nature and original sin; and inequality in them
      arises from the merits or demerits of their actions. Therefore God does
      not prepare unequal things for men by predestinating and reprobating,
      unless through the foreknowledge of their merits and demerits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>On the contrary</em>, The Apostle says (Titus 3:5): &quot;Not by works
      of justice which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved
      us.&quot; But as He saved us, so He predestined that we should be saved.
      Therefore, foreknowledge of merits is not the cause or reason of
      predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I answer that</em>, Since predestination includes will, as was said
      above (A. 4), the reason of predestination must be sought for in the same
      way as was the reason of the will of God. Now it was shown above (Q. 19,
      A. 5), that we cannot assign any cause of the divine will on the part of
      the act of willing; but a reason can be found on the part of the things
      willed; inasmuch as God wills one thing on account of something else.
      Wherefore nobody has been so insane as to say that merit is the cause of
      divine predestination as regards the act of the predestinator. But this is
      the question, whether, as regards the effect, predestination has any
      cause; or what comes to the same thing, whether God pre-ordained that He
      would give the effect of predestination to anyone on account of any
      merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly there were some who held that the effect of predestination was
      pre-ordained for some on account of pre-existing merits in a former life.
      This was the opinion of Origen, who thought that the souls of men were
      created in the beginning, and according to the diversity of their works
      different states were assigned to them in this world when united with the
      body. The Apostle, however, rebuts this opinion where he says (Rom.
      9:11,12): &quot;For when they were not yet born, nor had done any good or
      evil . . . not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was said of her: The
      elder shall serve the younger.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Others said that pre-existing merits in this life are the reason and cause
      of the effect of predestination. For the Pelagians taught that the
      beginning of doing well came from us; and the consummation from God: so
      that it came about that the effect of predestination was granted to one,
      and not to another, because the one made a beginning by preparing, whereas
      the other did not. But against this we have the saying of the Apostle (2
      Cor. 3:5), that &quot;we are not sufficient to think anything of ourselves
      as of ourselves.&quot; Now no principle of action can be imagined previous
      to the act of thinking. Wherefore it cannot be said that anything begun in
      us can be the reason of the effect of predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so others said that merits following the effect of predestination are
      the reason of predestination; giving us to understand that God gives grace
      to a person, and pre-ordains that He will give it, because He knows
      beforehand that He will make good use of that grace, as if a king were to
      give a horse to a soldier because he knows he will make good use of it.
      But these seem to have drawn a distinction between that which flows from
      grace, and that which flows from free will, as if the same thing cannot
      come from both. It is, however, manifest that what is of grace is the
      effect of predestination; and this cannot be considered as the reason of
      predestination, since it is contained in the notion of predestination.
      Therefore, if anything else in us be the reason of predestination, it will
      outside the effect of predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there is no distinction between what flows from free will, and what is
      of predestination; as there is not distinction between what flows from a
      secondary cause and from a first cause. For the providence of God produces
      effects through the operation of secondary causes, as was above shown (Q.
      22, A. 3). Wherefore, that which flows from free-will is also of
      predestination. We must say, therefore, that the effect of predestination
      may be considered in a twofold light—in one way, in particular; and thus
      there is no reason why one effect of predestination should not be the
      reason or cause of another; a subsequent effect being the reason of a
      previous effect, as its final cause; and the previous effect being the
      reason of the subsequent as its meritorious cause, which is reduced to the
      disposition of the matter. Thus we might say that God pre-ordained to give
      glory on account of merit, and that He pre-ordained to give grace to merit
      glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another way, the effect of predestination may be considered in general.
      Thus, it is impossible that the whole of the effect of predestination in
      general should have any cause as coming from us; because whatsoever is in
      man disposing him towards salvation, is all included under the effect of
      predestination; even the preparation for grace. For neither does this
      happen otherwise than by divine help, according to the prophet Jeremias
      (Lam. 5:21): &quot;convert us, O Lord, to Thee, and we shall be
      converted.&quot; Yet predestination has in this way, in regard to its
      effect, the goodness of God for its reason; towards which the whole effect
      of predestination is directed as to an end; and from which it proceeds, as
      from its first moving principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 1: The use of grace foreknown by God is not the cause of
      conferring grace, except after the manner of a final cause; as was
      explained above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 2: Predestination has its foundation in the goodness of God as
      regards its effects in general. Considered in its particular effects,
      however, one effect is the reason of another; as already stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 3: The reason for the predestination of some, and reprobation
      of others, must be sought for in the goodness of God. Thus He is said to
      have made all things through His goodness, so that the divine goodness
      might be represented in things. Now it is necessary that God&#x27;s
      goodness, which in itself is one and undivided, should be manifested in
      many ways in His creation; because creatures in themselves cannot attain
      to the simplicity of God. Thus it is that for the completion of the
      universe there are required different grades of being; some of which hold
      a high and some a low place in the universe. That this multiformity of
      grades may be preserved in things, God allows some evils, lest many good
      things should never happen, as was said above (Q. 22, A. 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us then consider the whole of the human race, as we consider the whole
      universe. God wills to manifest His goodness in men; in respect to those
      whom He predestines, by means of His mercy, as sparing them; and in
      respect of others, whom he reprobates, by means of His justice, in
      punishing them. This is the reason why God elects some and rejects others.
      To this the Apostle refers, saying (Rom. 9:22, 23): &quot;What if God,
      willing to show His wrath [that is, the vengeance of His justice], and to
      make His power known, endured [that is, permitted] with much patience
      vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction; that He might show the riches of
      His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He hath prepared unto glory&quot;
      and (2 Tim. 2:20): &quot;But in a great house there are not only vessels
      of gold and silver; but also of wood and of earth; and some, indeed, unto
      honor, but some unto dishonor.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet why He chooses some for glory, and reprobates others, has no reason,
      except the divine will. Whence Augustine says (Tract. xxvi. in Joan.):
      &quot;Why He draws one, and another He draws not, seek not to judge, if
      thou dost not wish to err.&quot; Thus too, in the things of nature, a
      reason can be assigned, since primary matter is altogether uniform, why
      one part of it was fashioned by God from the beginning under the form of
      fire, another under the form of earth, that there might be a diversity of
      species in things of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet why this particular part of matter is under this particular form, and
      that under another, depends upon the simple will of God; as from the
      simple will of the artificer it depends that this stone is in part of the
      wall, and that in another; although the plan requires that some stones
      should be in this place, and some in that place. Neither on this account
      can there be said to be injustice in God, if He prepares unequal lots for
      not unequal things. This would be altogether contrary to the notion of
      justice, if the effect of predestination were granted as a debt, and not
      gratuitously. In things which are given gratuitously, a person can give
      more or less, just as he pleases (provided he deprives nobody of his due),
      without any infringement of justice. This is what the master of the house
      said: &quot;Take what is thine, and go thy way. Is it not lawful for me to
      do what I will?&quot; (Matt. 20:14,15). _______________________

    <p>SIXTH ARTICLE [I, Q. 23, Art. 6]</p>
    <p>Whether Predestination Is Certain?</p>
    <p>
      Objection 1: It seems that predestination is not certain. Because on the
      words &quot;Hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy
      crown,&quot; (Rev 3:11), Augustine says (De Corr. et Grat. 15):
      &quot;Another will not receive, unless this one were to lose it.&quot;
      Hence the crown which is the effect of predestination can be both acquired
      and lost. Therefore predestination cannot be certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 2: Further, granted what is possible, nothing impossible follows. But
      it is possible that one predestined—e.g. Peter—may sin and then be killed.
      But if this were so, it would follow that the effect of predestination
      would be thwarted. This then, is not impossible. Therefore predestination
      is not certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 3: Further, whatever God could do in the past, He can do now. But He
      could have not predestined whom He hath predestined. Therefore now He is
      able not to predestine him. Therefore predestination is not certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>On the contrary</em>, A gloss on Rom. 8:29: &quot;Whom He foreknew, He
      also predestinated&quot;, says: &quot;Predestination is the foreknowledge
      and preparation of the benefits of God, by which whosoever are freed will
      most certainly be freed.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I answer that</em>, Predestination most certainly and infallibly takes
      effect; yet it does not impose any necessity, so that, namely, its effect
      should take place from necessity. For it was said above (A. 1), that
      predestination is a part of providence. But not all things subject to
      providence are necessary; some things happening from contingency,
      according to the nature of the proximate causes, which divine providence
      has ordained for such effects. Yet the order of providence is infallible,
      as was shown above (Q. 22, A. 4). So also the order of predestination is
      certain; yet free-will is not destroyed; whence the effect of
      predestination has its contingency. Moreover all that has been said about
      the divine knowledge and will (Q. 14, A. 13; Q. 19, A. 4) must also be
      taken into consideration; since they do not destroy contingency in things,
      although they themselves are most certain and infallible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 1: The crown may be said to belong to a person in two ways;
      first, by God&#x27;s predestination, and thus no one loses his crown:
      secondly, by the merit of grace; for what we merit, in a certain way is
      ours; and thus anyone may lose his crown by mortal sin. Another person
      receives that crown thus lost, inasmuch as he takes the former&#x27;s
      place. For God does not permit some to fall, without raising others;
      according to Job 34:24: &quot;He shall break in pieces many and
      innumerable, and make others to stand in their stead.&quot; Thus men are
      substituted in the place of the fallen angels; and the Gentiles in that of
      the Jews. He who is substituted for another in the state of grace, also
      receives the crown of the fallen in that in eternal life he will rejoice
      at the good the other has done, in which life he will rejoice at all good
      whether done by himself or by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 2: Although it is possible for one who is predestinated
      considered in himself to die in mortal sin; yet it is not possible,
      supposed, as in fact it is supposed. that he is predestinated. Whence it
      does not follow that predestination can fall short of its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 3: Since predestination includes the divine will as stated
      above (A. 4): and the fact that God wills any created thing is necessary
      on the supposition that He so wills, on account of the immutability of the
      divine will, but is not necessary absolutely; so the same must be said of
      predestination. Wherefore one ought not to say that God is able not to
      predestinate one whom He has predestinated, taking it in a composite
      sense, thought, absolutely speaking, God can predestinate or not. But in
      this way the certainty of predestination is not destroyed.

    </p>
    <p>SEVENTH ARTICLE [I, Q. 23, Art. 7]</p>
    <p>Whether the Number of the Predestined Is Certain?</p>
    <p>
      Objection 1: It seems that the number of the predestined is not certain.
      For a number to which an addition can be made is not certain. But there
      can be an addition to the number of the predestined as it seems; for it is
      written (Deut. 1:11): &quot;The Lord God adds to this number many
      thousands,&quot; and a gloss adds, &quot;fixed by God, who knows those who
      belong to Him.&quot; Therefore the number of the predestined is not
      certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 2: Further, no reason can be assigned why God pre-ordains to
      salvation one number of men more than another. But nothing is arranged by
      God without a reason. Therefore the number to be saved pre-ordained by God
      cannot be certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 3: Further, the operations of God are more perfect than those of
      nature. But in the works of nature, good is found in the majority of
      things; defect and evil in the minority. If, then, the number of the saved
      were fixed by God at a certain figure, there would be more saved than
      lost. Yet the contrary follows from Matt. 7:13,14: &quot;For wide is the
      gate, and broad the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are
      who go in thereat. How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that
      leadeth to life; and few there are who find it!&quot; Therefore the number
      of those pre-ordained by God to be saved is not certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>On the contrary</em>, Augustine says (De Corr. et Grat. 13): &quot;The
      number of the predestined is certain, and can neither be increased nor
      diminished.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I answer that</em>, The number of the predestined is certain. Some
      have said that it was formally, but not materially certain; as if we were
      to say that it was certain that a hundred or a thousand would be saved;
      not however these or those individuals. But this destroys the certainty of
      predestination; of which we spoke above (A. 6). Therefore we must say that
      to God the number of the predestined is certain, not only formally, but
      also materially. It must, however, be observed that the number of the
      predestined is said to be certain to God, not by reason of His knowledge,
      because, that is to say, He knows how many will be saved (for in this way
      the number of drops of rain and the sands of the sea are certain to God);
      but by reason of His deliberate choice and determination. For the further
      evidence of which we must remember that every agent intends to make
      something finite, as is clear from what has been said above when we
      treated of the infinite (Q. 7, AA. 2 ,3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now whosoever intends some definite measure in his effect thinks out some
      definite number in the essential parts, which are by their very nature
      required for the perfection of the whole. For of those things which are
      required not principally, but only on account of something else, he does
      not select any definite number per se; but he accepts and uses them in
      such numbers as are necessary on account of that other thing. For
      instance, a builder thinks out the definite measurements of a house, and
      also the definite number of rooms which he wishes to make in the house;
      and definite measurements of the walls and roof; he does not, however,
      select a definite number of stones, but accepts and uses just so many as
      are sufficient for the required measurements of the wall. So also must we
      consider concerning God in regard to the whole universe, which is His
      effect. For He pre-ordained the measurements of the whole of the universe,
      and what number would befit the essential parts of that universe—that is
      to say, which have in some way been ordained in perpetuity; how many
      spheres, how many stars, how many elements, and how many species.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individuals, however, which undergo corruption, are not ordained as it
      were chiefly for the good of the universe, but in a secondary way,
      inasmuch as the good of the species is preserved through them. Whence,
      although God knows the total number of individuals, the number of oxen,
      flies and such like, is not pre-ordained by God per se; but divine
      providence produces just so many as are sufficient for the preservation of
      the species. Now of all creatures the rational creature is chiefly
      ordained for the good of the universe, being as such incorruptible; more
      especially those who attain to eternal happiness, since they more
      immediately reach the ultimate end. Whence the number of the predestined
      is certain to God; not only by way of knowledge, but also by way of a
      principal pre-ordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not exactly the same thing in the case of the number of the
      reprobate, who would seem to be pre-ordained by God for the good of the
      elect, in whose regard &quot;all things work together unto good&quot;
      (Rom. 8:28). Concerning the number of all the predestined, some say that
      so many men will be saved as angels fell; some, so many as there were
      angels left; others, as many as the number of angels created by God. It
      is, however, better to say that, &quot;to God alone is known the number
      for whom is reserved eternal happiness [*From the &#x27;secret&#x27;
      prayer of the missal, &#x27;pro vivis et defunctis.&#x27;]&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 1: These words of Deuteronomy must be taken as applied to those
      who are marked out by God beforehand in respect to present righteousness.
      For their number is increased and diminished, but not the number of the
      predestined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 2: The reason of the quantity of any one part must be judged
      from the proportion of that part of the whole. Thus in God the reason why
      He has made so many stars, or so many species of things, or predestined so
      many, is according to the proportion of the principal parts to the good of
      the whole universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 3: The good that is proportionate to the common state of nature
      is to be found in the majority; and is wanting in the minority. The good
      that exceeds the common state of nature is to be found in the minority,
      and is wanting in the majority. Thus it is clear that the majority of men
      have a sufficient knowledge for the guidance of life; and those who have
      not this knowledge are said to be half-witted or foolish; but they who
      attain to a profound knowledge of things intelligible are a very small
      minority in respect to the rest. Since their eternal happiness, consisting
      in the vision of God, exceeds the common state of nature, and especially
      in so far as this is deprived of grace through the corruption of original
      sin, those who are saved are in the minority. In this especially, however,
      appears the mercy of God, that He has chosen some for that salvation, from
      which very many in accordance with the common course and tendency of
      nature fall short. _______________________
    </p>
    <p>EIGHTH ARTICLE [I, Q. 23, Art. 8]</p>
    <p>Whether Predestination Can Be Furthered by the Prayers of the Saints?</p>
    <p>
      Objection 1: It seems that predestination cannot be furthered by the
      prayers of the saints. For nothing eternal can be preceded by anything
      temporal; and in consequence nothing temporal can help towards making
      something else eternal. But predestination is eternal. Therefore, since
      the prayers of the saints are temporal, they cannot so help as to cause
      anyone to become predestined. Predestination therefore is not furthered by
      the prayers of the saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 2: Further, as there is no need of advice except on account of
      defective knowledge, so there is no need of help except through defective
      power. But neither of these things can be said of God when He predestines.
      Whence it is said: &quot;Who hath helped the Spirit of the Lord? [*Vulg.:
      &#x27;Who hath known the mind of the Lord?&#x27;] Or who hath been His
      counsellor?&quot; (Rom. 11:34). Therefore predestination cannot be
      furthered by the prayers of the saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 3: Further, if a thing can be helped, it can also be hindered. But
      predestination cannot be hindered by anything. Therefore it cannot be
      furthered by anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>On the contrary</em>, It is said that &quot;Isaac besought the Lord
      for his wife because she was barren; and He heard him and made Rebecca to
      conceive&quot; (Gen. 25:21). But from that conception Jacob was born, and
      he was predestined. Now his predestination would not have happened if he
      had never been born. Therefore predestination can be furthered by the
      prayers of the saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I answer that</em>, Concerning this question, there were different
      errors. Some, regarding the certainty of divine predestination, said that
      prayers were superfluous, as also anything else done to attain salvation;
      because whether these things were done or not, the predestined would
      attain, and the reprobate would not attain, eternal salvation. But against
      this opinion are all the warnings of Holy Scripture, exhorting us to
      prayer and other good works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others declared that the divine predestination was altered through prayer.
      This is stated to have the opinion of the Egyptians, who thought that the
      divine ordination, which they called fate, could be frustrated by certain
      sacrifices and prayers. Against this also is the authority of Scripture.
      For it is said: &quot;But the triumpher in Israel will not spare and will
      not be moved to repentance&quot; (1 Kings 15:29); and that &quot;the gifts
      and the calling of God are without repentance&quot; (Rom. 11:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherefore we must say otherwise that in predestination two things are to
      be considered—namely, the divine ordination; and its effect. As regards
      the former, in no possible way can predestination be furthered by the
      prayers of the saints. For it is not due to their prayers that anyone is
      predestined by God. As regards the latter, predestination is said to be
      helped by the prayers of the saints, and by other good works; because
      providence, of which predestination is a part, does not do away with
      secondary causes but so provides effects, that the order of secondary
      causes falls also under providence. So, as natural effects are provided by
      God in such a way that natural causes are directed to bring about those
      natural effects, without which those effects would not happen; so the
      salvation of a person is predestined by God in such a way, that whatever
      helps that person towards salvation falls under the order of
      predestination; whether it be one&#x27;s own prayers or those of another;
      or other good works, and such like, without which one would not attain to
      salvation. Whence, the predestined must strive after good works and
      prayer; because through these means predestination is most certainly
      fulfilled. For this reason it is said: &quot;Labor more that by good works
      you may make sure your calling and election&quot; (2 Pet. 1:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 1: This argument shows that predestination is not furthered by
      the prayers of the saints, as regards the preordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 2: One is said to be helped by another in two ways; in one way,
      inasmuch as he receives power from him: and to be helped thus belongs to
      the weak; but this cannot be said of God, and thus we are to understand,
      &quot;Who hath helped the Spirit of the Lord?&quot; In another way one is
      said to be helped by a person through whom he carries out his work, as a
      master through a servant. In this way God is helped by us; inasmuch as we
      execute His orders, according to 1 Cor. 3:9: &quot;We are God&#x27;s
      co-adjutors.&quot; Nor is this on account of any defect in the power of
      God, but because He employs intermediary causes, in order that the beauty
      of order may be preserved in the universe; and also that He may
      communicate to creatures the dignity of causality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 3: Secondary causes cannot escape the order of the first
      universal cause, as has been said above (Q. 19, A. 6), indeed, they
      execute that order. And therefore predestination can be furthered by
      creatures, but it cannot be impeded by them.

    <p>Of God's Knowledge (In Sixteen Articles)</p>
    <p>
      Having considered what belongs to the divine substance, we have now to
      treat of God's operation. And since one kind of operation is immanent, and
      another kind of operation proceeds to the exterior effect, we treat first
      of knowledge and of will (for understanding abides in the intelligent
      agent, and will is in the one who wills); and afterwards of the power of
      God, the principle of the divine operation as proceeding to the exterior
      effect. Now because to understand is a kind of life, after treating of the
      divine knowledge, we consider the divine life. And as knowledge concerns
      truth, we consider truth and falsehood. Further, as everything known is in
      the knower, and the types of things as existing in the knowledge of God
      are called ideas, to the consideration of knowledge will be added the
      treatment of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>Concerning knowledge, there are sixteen points for inquiry:</p>
    <p>(1) Whether there is knowledge in God?</p>
    <p>(2) Whether God understands Himself?</p>
    <p>(3) Whether He comprehends Himself?</p>
    <p>(4) Whether His understanding is His substance?</p>
    <p>(5) Whether He understands other things besides Himself?</p>
    <p>(6) Whether He has a proper knowledge of them?</p>
    <p>(7) Whether the knowledge of God is discursive?</p>
    <p>(8) Whether the knowledge of God is the cause of things?</p>
    <p>(9) Whether God has knowledge of non-existing things?</p>
    <p>(10) Whether He has knowledge of evil?</p>
    <p>(11) Whether He has knowledge of individual things?</p>
    <p>(12) Whether He knows the infinite?</p>
    <p>(13) Whether He knows future contingent things?</p>
    <p>(14) Whether He knows enunciable things?</p>
    <p>(15) Whether the knowledge of God is variable?</p>
    <p>(16) Whether God has speculative or practical knowledge of things?</p>
    <p>THIRTEENTH ARTICLE [I, Q. 14, Art. 13]</p>
    <p>Whether the Knowledge of God Is of Future Contingent Things?</p>
    <p>
      Objection 1: It seems that the knowledge of God is not of future
      contingent things. For from a necessary cause proceeds a necessary effect.
      But the knowledge of God is the cause of things known, as said above (A.
      8). Since therefore that knowledge is necessary, what He knows must also
      be necessary. Therefore the knowledge of God is not of contingent things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 2: Further, every conditional proposition of which the antecedent is
      absolutely necessary must have an absolutely necessary consequent. For the
      antecedent is to the consequent as principles are to the conclusion: and
      from necessary principles only a necessary conclusion can follow, as is
      proved in Poster. i. But this is a true conditional proposition, &quot;If
      God knew that this thing will be, it will be,&quot; for the knowledge of
      God is only of true things. Now the antecedent conditional of this is
      absolutely necessary, because it is eternal, and because it is signified
      as past. Therefore the consequent is also absolutely necessary. Therefore
      whatever God knows, is necessary; and so the knowledge of God is not of
      contingent things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obj. 3: Further, everything known by God must necessarily be, because even
      what we ourselves know, must necessarily be; and, of course, the knowledge
      of God is much more certain than ours. But no future contingent things
      must necessarily be. Therefore no contingent future thing is known by God.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>On the contrary</em>, It is written (Ps. 32:15), &quot;He Who hath
      made the hearts of every one of them; Who understandeth all their
      works,&quot; i.e. of men. Now the works of men are contingent, being
      subject to free will. Therefore God knows future contingent things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I answer that</em>, Since as was shown above (A. 9), God knows all
      things; not only things actual but also things possible to Him and
      creature; and since some of these are future contingent to us, it follows
      that God knows future contingent things.
    </p>
    <p>
      In evidence of this, we must consider that a contingent thing can be
      considered in two ways; first, in itself, in so far as it is now in act:
      and in this sense it is not considered as future, but as present; neither
      is it considered as contingent (as having reference) to one of two terms,
      but as determined to one; and on account of this it can be infallibly the
      object of certain knowledge, for instance to the sense of sight, as when I
      see that Socrates is sitting down. In another way a contingent thing can
      be considered as it is in its cause; and in this way it is considered as
      future, and as a contingent thing not yet determined to one; forasmuch as
      a contingent cause has relation to opposite things: and in this sense a
      contingent thing is not subject to any certain knowledge. Hence, whoever
      knows a contingent effect in its cause only, has merely a conjectural
      knowledge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now God knows all contingent things not only as they are in their causes,
      but also as each one of them is actually in itself. And although
      contingent things become actual successively, nevertheless God knows
      contingent things not successively, as they are in their own being, as we
      do but simultaneously. The reason is because His knowledge is measured by
      eternity, as is also His being; and eternity being simultaneously whole
      comprises all time, as said above (Q. 10, A. 2). Hence all things that are
      in time are present to God from eternity, not only because He has the
      types of things present within Him, as some say; but because His glance is
      carried from eternity over all things as they are in their presentiality.
      Hence it is manifest that contingent things are infallibly known by God,
      inasmuch as they are subject to the divine sight in their presentiality;
      yet they are future contingent things in relation to their own causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 1: Although the supreme cause is necessary, the effect may be
      contingent by reason of the proximate contingent cause; just as the
      germination of a plant is contingent by reason of the proximate contingent
      cause, although the movement of the sun which is the first cause, is
      necessary. So likewise things known by God are contingent on account of
      their proximate causes, while the knowledge of God, which is the first
      cause, is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 2: Some say that this antecedent, &quot;God knew this
      contingent to be future,&quot; is not necessary, but contingent; because,
      although it is past, still it imports relation to the future. This however
      does not remove necessity from it; for whatever has had relation to the
      future, must have had it, although the future sometimes does not follow.
      On the other hand some say that this antecedent is contingent, because it
      is a compound of necessary and contingent; as this saying is contingent,
      &quot;Socrates is a white man.&quot; But this also is to no purpose; for
      when we say, &quot;God knew this contingent to be future,&quot; contingent
      is used here only as the matter of the word, and not as the chief part of
      the proposition. Hence its contingency or necessity has no reference to
      the necessity or contingency of the proposition, or to its being true or
      false. For it may be just as true that I said a man is an ass, as that I
      said Socrates runs, or God is: and the same applies to necessary and
      contingent. Hence it must be said that this antecedent is absolutely
      necessary. Nor does it follow, as some say, that the consequent is
      absolutely necessary, because the antecedent is the remote cause of the
      consequent, which is contingent by reason of the proximate cause. But this
      is to no purpose. For the conditional would be false were its antecedent
      the remote necessary cause, and the consequent a contingent effect; as,
      for example, if I said, &quot;if the sun moves, the grass will grow.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore we must reply otherwise; that when the antecedent contains
      anything belonging to an act of the soul, the consequent must be taken not
      as it is in itself, but as it is in the soul: for the existence of a thing
      in itself is different from the existence of a thing in the soul. For
      example, when I say, &quot;What the soul understands is immaterial,&quot;
      this is to be understood that it is immaterial as it is in the intellect,
      not as it is in itself. Likewise if I say, &quot;If God knew anything, it
      will be,&quot; the consequent must be understood as it is subject to the
      divine knowledge, i.e. as it is in its presentiality. And thus it is
      necessary, as also is the antecedent: &quot;For everything that is, while
      it is, must be necessarily be,&quot; as the Philosopher says in
      <em>Peri Herm</em>. i.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reply Obj. 3: Things reduced to act in time, as known by us successively
      in time, but by God (are known) in eternity, which is above time. Whence
      to us they cannot be certain, forasmuch as we know future contingent
      things as such; but (they are certain) to God alone, whose understanding
      is in eternity above time. Just as he who goes along the road, does not
      see those who come after him; whereas he who sees the whole road from a
      height, sees at once all travelling by the way. Hence what is known by us
      must be necessary, even as it is in itself; for what is future contingent
      in itself, cannot be known by us. Whereas what is known by God must be
      necessary according to the mode in which they are subject to the divine
      knowledge, as already stated, but not absolutely as considered in their
      own causes. Hence also this proposition, &quot;Everything known by God
      must necessarily be,&quot; is usually distinguished; for this may refer to
      the thing, or to the saying. If it refers to the thing, it is divided and
      false; for the sense is, &quot;Everything which God knows is
      necessary.&quot; If understood of the saying, it is composite and true;
      for the sense is, &quot;This proposition, &#x27;that which is known by God
      is&#x27; is necessary.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now some urge an objection and say that this distinction holds good with
      regard to forms that are separable from the subject; thus if I said,
      &quot;It is possible for a white thing to be black,&quot; it is false as
      applied to the saying, and true as applied to the thing: for a thing which
      is white, can become black; whereas this saying, &quot;a white thing is
      black&quot; can never be true. But in forms that are inseparable from the
      subject, this distinction does not hold, for instance, if I said, &quot;A
      black crow can be white&quot;; for in both senses it is false. Now to be
      known by God is inseparable from the thing; for what is known by God
      cannot be known. This objection, however, would hold if these words
      &quot;that which is known&quot; implied any disposition inherent to the
      subject; but since they import an act of the knower, something can be
      attributed to the thing known, in itself (even if it always be known),
      which is not attributed to it in so far as it stands under actual
      knowledge; thus material existence is attributed to a stone in itself,
      which is not attributed to it inasmuch as it is known.

      </p>
    </section>
    <p>ARTICLE II</p>
    <p>In the second article we ask:</p>
    <p>Is foreknowledge of merits the cause of or reason for predestination?</p>
    <p>
      [Parallel readings: S.T., I, 19, 5; 2 3, aa. 2, 4-5; I Sent., 40, 1, 1;
      41, 3; C.G., III,163; In Ephes., c. 1, lects. 1, 4 (P. 13:445b, 45 1 b);

    </p>
    <p>Difficulties</p>
    <p>It seems that it is, for</p>
    <p>
      1. In his gloss on the verse in Romans (9:15), “I will have mercy on whom
      I will have mercy,” Ambrose writes as follows: “I will give mercy to him
      who I know will return with his whole heart to Me after his error. This is
      to give mercy to him to whom it should be given, and not to give it to one
      to whom it should not. Consequently, He calls him who He knows will obey,
      not him who He knows will disobey.”’ Now, to obey and to return to God
      with all one’s heart are meritofious; the opposite actions are
      demeritorious. Foreknowledge of merit or of demerit is therefore the cause
      of God’s intention of being merciful to some and of excluding others from
      His mercy. This is equivalent to predestination and reprobation.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Predestination includes God’s will to save men. It cannot be said that
      it includes only His antecedent will, because, according to this will—as
      is said in the first Epistle to Timothy (2:4): “God wills all men to be
      saved”; hence, it would follow that all are predestined. It remains,
      therefore, that predestination includes only His consequent will. Now, “We
      are the cause,” as Damascene says, “of God’s consequent will,” according
      as we merit salvation or deserve damnation. Our merits foreknown by God
      are therefore the cause of predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Predestination means primarily God’s will with respect to man’s
      salvation. But men’s merits are the cause of their salvation. Moreover,
      knowledge causes and specifies the act of the will, since that which moves
      the will is a desirable thing which is known. Consequently, foreknowledge
      of merits is a cause of predestination, since two of the things which
      foreknowledge contains cause the two things contained in predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Reprobation and predestination signify the divine essence while
      connoting an effect. There is no diversity, however, in the divine
      essence. Consequently, the difference between predestination and
      reprobation comes entirely from their effects. Now, effects are considered
      as caused by us. It is due to us, as cause, therefore, that the
      predestined are segregated from the reprobate, as takes place through
      predestination. Hence, the same must be said as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Taken in itself, the sun is in the same relation to all bodies that can
      be illuminated, even though all bodies cannot share its light equally.
      Similarly, God is equally related to all, even though all do not
      participate in His divine goodness in an equal measure, as the saints and
      philosophers say so often. Now, since the sun is in the same relation to
      all bodies, it is not the cause of the differences that we find in these
      bodies, namely, that some of them are dark and others bright. This is due,
      rather, to differences in the physical constitution of the bodies which
      affect their reception of sunlight. Similarly, the reason for this
      difference, namely, that some reach salvation and others are damned, or
      that some are predestined while others are rejected, is to be found not in
      God but in us. Consequently, our original thesis stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Good communicates itself. It belongs to the highest good, therefore, to
      communicate itself in the highest possible degree, that is, as much as
      each and every thing is capable of receiving it. Consequently, if it does
      not communicate itself to something, this is because that thing is not
      capable of receiving it. Now, according to the quality of his merits, a
      person is capable or not capable of receiving that salvation which
      predestination ordains. Foreknowledge of merits, therefore, is the reason
      wily some are predestined and others are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Concerning the passage in Numbers (3:12), “1 took Levites...,” Origen
      writes: “Jacob, younger by birth, was judged to be the firstborn. Because
      what they intended to do was in their hearts, and this was clear to God
      before they were born or did any good or evil, It was said of them:‘Jacob
      have I loved, Esau have I hated.’” Now, this love, the saints commonly
      explain, pertains to Jacob’s predestination. Consequently, God’s
      foreknowledge of the intention Jacob was going to have in his heart was
      the reason for his predestination. Thus, the same must be said as was said
      previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Predestination cannot be unjust, since the ways of the Lord are always
      the ways of mercy and truth. Nor can there be any form of justice between
      God and men other than distributive justice. There is no place for
      commutative justice, since God, who needs none of our good things,
      receives nothing from us. Now, distributive justice rewards unequally only
      those that are unequal. But the only cause of inequality among men is
      difference in merit. Therefore, the reason why God predestines one man and
      not another is that He foreknows their different merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. As mentioned previously, predestination presupposes election. But a
      choice cannot be reasonable unless there is some reason why one person is
      to be preferred to another. Now, in the election we are speaking about,
      there can be no reason for the preference other than merits. Therefore,
      since God’s choice cannot be irrational, His election and, consequently,
      His predestination also must be caused by His foreknowledge of merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Commenting on that verse in the Prophecy of Malachi (1:2-3), “I have
      loved Jacob, but have hated Esau,” Augustine says that “the will of God,”
      by which He chose one and rejected the other “cannot be’ unjust, for it
      came from their hidden merits.” But the hidden merits can enter into an
      intention only in so far as they are foreknown. Consequently,
      predestination comes from foreknowledge of merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. As the use of grace is related to the final effect of predestination
      so the abuse of it is related to the effect of reprobation. Now, in the
      case of Judas, the abuse of grace was the reason for his reprobation,
      since he was made reprobate because he died without grace. Moreover, the
      fact that he did not have grace when he died was not due to God’s
      unwillingness to give it but to his unwillingness to accept it—as both
      Anselm and Dionysius point out. Consequently, the good use of grace by
      Peter or anyone else is the reason why he is elected or predestined.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. One person can merit the first grace for another. For the same reason,
      it seems that he could merit for that other person a continuation of grace
      up to the end. Now, if one gets final grace, he is predestined.
      Consequently, predestination can be caused by merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. According to the Philosopher: “One thing is said to be prior to
      another when the sequence of their being cannot be reversed.” But God’s
      foreknowledge is related to predestination in this way, because God knows
      beforehand what He predestines, while He foreknows the evil which He does
      not predestine. Foreknowledge, therefore, is antecedent to predestination.
      But what is prior in any order is the cause of what is posterior.
      Consequently, foreknowledge is the cause of predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. The word predestination is derived from sending or destining. But
      knowledge precedes sending or destining, because no one can send a person
      without knowing him first. Knowledge, therefore, is prior also to
      predestination; hence, it seems that it is the cause of predestination.
      Consequently, our thesis stands.
    </p>
    <p>To the Contrary</p>
    <p>
      1. The Gloss on the following verse in the Epistle to the Romans (9:12),
      “Not of works, but of him that calleth was it said,” reads: “He shows that
      the words ‘I have loved Jacob, etc.,’ were due neither to any previous nor
      to any future merits.” And the Gloss on the verse, “Is there injustice
      with God?” (9:4), says: “Let no one say that God chooses one man and
      rejects another because He foresaw future works.” Consequently, it does
      not seem that foreknowledge of merits is the cause of predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Grace is the effect of predestination but the principle of merit.
      Hence, foreknowledge of merits cannot possibly be the cause of
      predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. In the Epistle to Titus (3:5), the Apostle says: “Not by the works of
      justice which we have done but according to his mercy...” Predestination
      of one’s salvation, therefore, does not arise from foreknowledge of
      merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. If foreknowledge of merits were the cause of predestination, then no
      one would be predestined who did not merit. But some predestined never
      merit, as is evidently the case of children. Consequently, foreknowledge
      of merits is not the cause of predestination.
    </p>
    <p>REPLY</p>

      There is this difference between a cause and an effect—that whatever is
      the cause of the cause must be the cause of the effect, but the cause of
      the effect is not necessarily the cause of the cause. It is evident, for
      example, that the first cause produces its effect through a second cause,
      and so the second cause, in some way, causes the effect of the first
      cause, although it is not the cause of the first cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we must distinguish two aspects of predestination, the eternal
      predestination itself and its twofold temporal effect, grace and glory.
      Glory has human acts as its meritorious cause, but grace cannot have human
      acts as its meritorious cause; human acts can act only as a certain
      material disposition to grace, inasmuch as through these acts men are
      prepared for the acceptance of it. It does not follow from this, however,
      that our acts, whether they precede or follow grace, are the cause of
      predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, to discover the cause of predestination we must recall what we have
      said previously, namely, that predestination is a certain direction to an
      end, and this direction is brought about by reason, moved by the will.
      Consequently, a thing can be the cause of predestination if it can move
      the will. However, a thing can move the will in two ways, first, as
      something due, secondly, as something not due. Now, as something due, a
      thing can move the will in two ways, namely, either absolutely or on the
      supposition of something else. The ultimate end, which is the object of
      the will, moves absolutely; and it moves the will in such a fashion that
      the will cannot turn away from it. For example, as Augustine says, no man
      is capable of not willing to be happy. But that without which an end
      cannot be had is said to move as something due “on the supposition of
      something else.” If an end can be had, however, without a certain thing
      which contributes merely to the well-being of the end, then that thing
      does not move the will as something due. In this case, the will inclines
      to it freely; but when the will is already inclined to it freely, the will
      is thereby inclined to all the things without which it cannot be had, as
      to things that are due on the supposition of that which was first willed.
      For example, out of liberality a king makes a person a soldier; but,
      because one cannot be a soldier without a horse, on the supposition of the
      afore-mentioned liberality, giving the soldier a horse becomes due and
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the end-object of the divine will is God’s own goodness, which does
      not depend on anything else. God needs nothing to help Him possess it.
      Consequently, His will is inclined first to make something freely, not
      something due, inasmuch as it is His goodness that is manifested in His
      works. But, supposing that God wishes to make something, it follows as
      something due from the supposition of His liberality that He make those
      things also without which those that He has first willed cannot be had.
      For example, if He wills to make a man, He must give him an intellect. But
      if there is anything which is not necessary for that which God wills, then
      that thing comes from God, not as something due, but simply as a result of
      His generosity. Now, the perfection of grace and glory are goods of this
      kind, because nature can exist without them inasmuch as they surpass the
      limits of natural powers. Consequently, the fact that God wishes to give
      grace and glory is due simply to His generosity. The reason for His
      willing these things that arise simply from His generosity is the
      overflowing love of His will for His end-object, in which the perfection
      of His goodness is found. The cause of predestination, therefore, is
      nothing other than God’s goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to these principles, a solution can be found to the controversy
      that has been taking place between certain groups. Some have asserted that
      everything comes from God’s simple pleasure, while others say that
      everything which comes from God is due. Both opinions are false. The
      former ignores the necessary order that exists between the things God
      causes, and the latter asserts that everything arises from God because of
      a natural necessity. A middle course must therefore be chosen so that it
      may be laid down that those things which are first willed by God come from
      His simple pleasure, but those that are required for this first class of
      things come as something due, although on the basis of a supposition. This
      “debt” does not, however, make God obliged to things but only to His own
      will; for what is said to come from God as something due is due simply in
      order that His will be fulfilled.

    <p>Answers to Difficulties</p>
    <p>
      1. Divine providence ordains that grace bestowed be used as it should.
      Consequently, it is impossible for foreknowledge of this right use of
      grace to be the cause that moves God to give grace. The words of Ambrose,
      “I will give grace to him who I know will return to me with his whole
      heart,” cannot be understood as meaning that a perfect change of heart
      inclines God’s will to give grace but that His will ordains that the grace
      given be accepted by the person and that he be turned completely toward
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Predestination includes God’s consequent will, which is related in some
      way to that which we cause on our part, not by inclining the divine will
      to act, but by bringing about that effect for which His will has ordained
      grace or by bringing about that which, in a certain sense, disposes us for
      grace and merits glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. While it is true that knowledge moves the will, not every kind of
      knowledge does this but only knowledge of an end; and an end is an object
      moving the will. Consequently, it is because of His knowledge of His own
      goodness that God loves it; and, from this love, He wishes to pour out His
      goodness upon others. But it does not therefore follow that knowledge of
      merits is the cause of His will in so far as it is included in
      predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Although the different formal characters of God’s attributes are drawn
      from the differences in their effects, it does not follow from this that
      these effects are the cause of His attributes. For the different formal
      characteristics of His attributes are not derived from our qualities as
      though our qualities caused them; rather, our qualities are signs that the
      attributes themselves are causes. Consequently, it does not follow that
      that which comes from us is the reason why one man is reprobated and
      another predestined.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. We can consider God’s relation to things in two ways. We can consider
      it only with respect to the first disposition of things that took place
      according to His divine wisdom, which established different grades of
      things. If only this is considered, then God is not related to all things
      in the same way. We can, however, consider His relation to things also
      according to the way in which He provides for them as already disposed. If
      His relation to them is considered in this manner, then He is related to
      all things in the same way, because He gives equally to all, according to
      the proportion He has made. Now, all that has been said to proceed from
      God, according to His will taken simply, belongs to the first disposition
      of things, of which preparation for grace is a part.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It belongs to the divine goodness as infinite to give from its
      perfections whatever the nature of each thing requires and is capable of
      receiving. But this is not required for superabundant perfections such as
      grace and glory. Hence, the argument proves nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. God’s foreknowledge of what lay in the heart of Jacob was not the
      reason for His willing to give grace to him. Instead, the intention in
      Jacob’s heart was a good for which God ordained the grace to be given to
      him. It is for this reason that God is said to have loved him “because his
      heart’s intention was known by Him.” For God loved him in order that he
      might have such an intention in his heart or because He foresaw that his
      heart’s intention was a disposition for the acceptance of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It would be contrary to the nature of distributive justice if things
      that were due to persons and were to be distributed to them were given out
      unequally to those that had equal rights. But things given out of
      liberality do not come under any form of justice. I may freely choose to
      give them to one person and not to another. Now, grace belongs to this
      class of things. Consequently, it is not contrary to the nature of
      distributive justice if God intends to give grace to one person and not to
      another, and does not consider their unequal merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The election by which God chooses one man and reprobates another is
      reasonable. There is no reason why merit must be the reason for His
      choice, however, since the reason for this is the divine goodness. As
      Augustine says,” moreover, a justifying reason for reprobation [in the
      present] is the fact of original sin in man—for reprobation in the future,
      the fact that mere existence gives man no claim to grace. For I can
      reasonably deny something to a person if it is not due to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Peter Lombard says that Augustine retracted that statement in a
      similar passage. But, if it must be sustained, then it should be taken as
      referring to the effect of reprobation and of predestination, which has a
      meritorious or disposing cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. God’s foreknowledge of this abuse of grace was not the reason why
      Judas was reprobated, unless we are considering only the consequences of
      this abuse—though it is true that God denies grace to no one who is
      willing to accept it. Now, the very fact that we are willing to accept
      grace comes to us through God’s predestination. Hence, our willingness
      cannot be a cause of predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Although merit can be the cause of the effect of predestination, it
      cannot be the cause of predestination itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Although that with which the consequent cannot be interchanged is
      prior in some way, it does not always follow that it is prior as a cause
      is said to be prior; for, if this were true, then to be colored would be
      the cause of being a man. Consequently, it does not follow that
      foreknowledge is the cause of predestination.
