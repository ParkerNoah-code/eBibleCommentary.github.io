    <h2>The Rise of the Papacy</h2>
    <p>
      Much of what needs to be said in regard to the papacy has already been
      covered in the discussion dealing with the church, the priesthood, and
      Peter. But there remain some further points that should be clarified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word “pope,” by which the head of the Roman Church is known, and the
      word “papacy,” by which is meant the system of ecclesiastical government
      in which the pope is recognized as the supreme head, are not found in the
      Bible. The word “pope” comes from the Latin papa, meaning “father.” But
      Jesus forbade his followers to call any man “father” in a spiritual sense:
      “And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, even he
      who is in heaven” (Matthew 23:9). For centuries this term was applied to
      all priests, and even to the present day it is so used in the Eastern
      Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Italy the term “pope” came to be applied to all bishops as a title of
      honor, and then to the bishop of Rome exclusively as the universal bishop.
      It was first given to Gregory I by the wicked emperor Phocas, in the year
      604. This he did to spite the bishop of Constantinople, who had justly
      excommunicated him for having caused the assassination of his (Phocas’)
      predecessor, emperor Mauritius. Gregory, however, refused the title, but
      his second successor, Boniface III (607) assumed the title, and it has
      been the designation of the bishops of Rome ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, the title “pontiff’ (as also the term “pontificate,” meaning to
      speak in a pompous manner), which literally means “bridge builder” (pons ,
      bridge, and facio, make), comes not from the Bible but from pagan Rome,
      where the emperor, as the high priest of the heathen religion, and in that
      sense professing to be the bridge or connecting link between this life and
      the next, was called “Pontifex Maximus.” The title was therefore lifted
      from paganism and applied to the head of the Roman Catholic Church. As the
      high priest of the Old Testament was the mediator between God and men, so
      the pope also claims to be the mediator between God and men, with power
      over the souls in purgatory so that he can release them from further
      suffering and admit them to heaven, or prolong their suffering
      indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Christ alone is the mediator between God and men: “For there is one
      God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus” (1
      Timothy 2:5). And He alone is the true Head of the church. It was He who
      founded the church and redeemed it with His own blood. He promised to be
      with His church always, even unto the end of the world. He alone has the
      perfect attributes needed to fill that high office, for “in him dwelleth
      all the fulness of the Godhead bodily” (Colossians 2:9). “He put all
      things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all
      things to the church, which is his body” (Ephesians 1:22-23). “And he is
      the head of the body, the church” (Colossians 1:18). For the pope or any
      other man to claim to be the head of the church and the mediator between
      God and men is arrogant and sinful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The papal system has been in process of development over a long period of
      time. Romanists claim an unbroken line of succession from the alleged
      first pope, Peter, to the present pope, who is said to be the 262 nd
      member in that line. But the list is in many instances quite doubtful. The
      list has been revised several times, with a considerable number who
      formerly were listed as popes now listed as anti-popes. It simply is not
      true that they can name with certainty all the bishops of Rome from Peter
      to the present one. A glance at the notices of each of the early popes in
      the Catholic Encyclopedia will show that they really know little or
      nothing about the first ten popes. And of the next ten only one is a
      clearly defined figure in history. The fact of the matter is that the
      historical record is so incomplete that the existence of an unbroken
      succession from the apostles to the present can neither be proved nor
      disproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a period of six centuries after the time of Christ none of the
      regional churches attempted to exercise authority over any of the other
      regional churches. The early ecumenical councils were composed of
      delegates from the various churches who met as equals. There is not a
      scholar anywhere who pretends to show any decree, canon, or resolution by
      any of the ecumenical councils which attempts to give preeminence to any
      one church. The first six hundred years of the Christian era know nothing
      of any spiritual supremacy on the part of the bishops of Rome. The papacy
      really began in the year 590, with Gregory I, as Gregory the Great, who
      consolidated the power of the bishopric in Rome and started that church on
      a new course. We quote two contemporary church historians, one a
      Protestant and the other a Roman Catholic, concerning the place of Gregory
      in this development. Says Professor A. M. Renwick, of the Free Church
      College, Edinburgh, Scotland:
    </p>
    <p>
      “His brilliant rule set a standard for those who came after him and he is
      really the first ‘pope’ who can, with perfect accuracy, be given the
      title. Along with Leo I (440-461), Gregory VII (1073-1085), and Innocent
      III (1198-1216), he stands out as one of the chief architects of the papal
      system” ( The Story of the Church , p. 64).
    </p>
    <p>And the Roman Catholic, Philip Hughes, says that Gregory I...</p>
    <p>
      “...is generally regarded as the greatest of all his line. ... It was to
      him that Rome turned at every crisis where the Lombards [the invaders from
      the North] were concerned. He begged his people off and he bought them
      off. He ransomed the captives and organized the great relief services for
      widows and orphans. Linally, in 598, he secured a thirty years’ truce. It
      was St. Gregory who, in these years, was the real ruler of Rome and in a
      very real sense he is the founder of the papal monarchy” (A Popular
      History of the Catholic Church, p. 75, 1947. Used by permission of The
      Macmillan Company).

    <h2>The Claims of the Papacy</h2>
    <p>
      When the triple crown is placed on the head of a new pope at his
      “coronation” ceremony, the ritual prescribes the following declaration by
      the officiating cardinal:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Receive the tiara adorned with three crowns, and know that thou art the
      Lather of Princes and Kings, Ruler of the World, the Vicar of our Saviour
      Jesus Christ....” (.National Catholic Almanac).
    </p>
    <p>The New York Catechism says:</p>
    <p>
      “The pope takes the place of Jesus Christ on earth. ... By divine right
      the pope has supreme and full power in faith and morals over each and “
      pastor and his flock. He is the true Vicar of Christ, the head of the
      entire church, the father and teacher of all Christians. He is the
      infallible ruler, the founder of dogmas, the author of and the judge of
      councils; the universal ruler of truth, the arbiter of the world, the
      supreme judge of heaven and earth, the judge of all, being judged by no
      one, God himself on earth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And Pope Leo XIII, in his encyclical, The Reunion of Christendom (1855),
      declared that the pope holds “upon this earth the place of God Almighty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Roman Church holds that the pope, as the vicar of Christ on earth
      is the ruler of the world, supreme not only over the Roman Church itself
      but over all kings, presidents, and civil rulers, indeed over all peoples
      and nations. The fact is that on numerous occasions the popes have
      exercised that authority in countries where the Roman Church was strong.
      They have excommunicated and deposed kings and governors, and, as in the
      cases of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and Emperor Henry IV of Germany,
      they have attempted to arouse rebellions by releasing subjects from any
      allegiance to their rulers. They have been prevented from exercising such
      authority in the United States because they do not have control here and
      because our Constitution serves as a shield against such outside
      interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pope thus demands a submission from his people, and indeed from ah
      people insofar as he is able to make it effective, which is due only to
      God. Sometimes that submission takes a particularly servile form, with
      even the cardinals, the next highest ranking officials in the Roman
      Church, prostrating themselves before him and kissing his feet! The popes
      have gone so far in assuming the place of God that they even insist on
      being called by His names, e.g., “the Holy Father,” “His Holiness,” etc.
      Such titles applied to a mere man are, of course, blasphemous and
      unchristian. We cannot but wonder what goes through the mind of a pope
      when people thus reverence him, carrying him on their shoulders, kissing
      his hands and feet, hailing him as the “Holy Father,” and performing acts
      of worship before him. By such means this so-called vicar of Christ”
      accepts the position of ruler of the world which the Devil offered to
      Christ, but which Christ spumed with the command, “Get thee hence, Satan!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The triple crown the pope wears symbolizes his authority in heaven, on
      earth, and in the underworld—as king of heaven, king of earth, and king of
      hell—in that through his absolutions souls are admitted to heaven, on the
      earth he attempts to exercise political as well as spiritual power, and
      through his special jurisdiction over the souls in purgatory and his
      exercise of “the power of the keys” he can release whatever souls he
      pleases from further suffering and those whom he refuses to release are
      continued in their suffering, the decisions he makes on earth being
      ratified in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to denounce strongly enough the folly and guilt of such
      glorification of man. The papacy, however, is the direct consequence and
      end result of the exaltation of the priests as necessary mediators between
      God and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who can really believe that Christ has built His church upon a man?
      The Bible teaches clearly that Christ’s Vicar on earth is the Holy
      Spirit—“the Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in
      my name, he shall teach you all things” (John 14:26). The Holy Spirit,
      since He is the third person of the Trinity, has the attributes of wisdom
      and power which enable Him to perform effectively and perfectly the work
      of guiding and developing the church of Christ. Christ does not need such
      a deputy as Rome claims that she has in the pope, and history shows that
      all men who have attempted to function in that capacity have failed
      miserably. Over against the claims of Rome the Reformers set the Word of
      God. Against Rome’s “Thus saith the church,” they placed a “Thus with the
      Lord.” Luther and Calvin were willing to recognize only Christ as the Head
      of the Church and denounced the pope as the Antichrist. Indeed, the claims
      of the pope to universal and total authority over the souls of men and
      over the church and nations are such that either he is all that he claims
      to be—the vicar of Christ and the vice¬ regent of God—or he is the biggest
      imposter and fraud that the world has ever seen!

    <h2>Worldly Character of the Papacy</h2>
    <p>
      The fallacy of the claim that the pope is the vice-regent of Christ is
      apparent in the glaring contrast between him and Christ. The pope wears,
      as a fitting symbol of the authority claimed by him, a jewel-laden,
      extremely expensive crown, while Christ had no earthly crown at all—except
      a crown of thorns which He wore in our behalf. In solemn ceremonies the
      pope is carried in a portable chair on the shoulders of twelve men, while
      Christ walked wherever He needed to go. We cannot imagine Christ, who came
      not to be ministered unto but to minister, being carried in luxury on the
      shoulders of men. The pope is adored with genuflections (a bowing of the
      knee in reverence), he is preceded by the papal cross and by two large
      fans of peacock feathers, and his garments are very elaborate and costly,
      all of which is out of harmony with the person and manner of Christ. The
      pope lives in luxury with many servants in a huge palace in Vatican City,
      while Christ when on earth “had not where to lay His head.” Many of the
      popes, particularly during the Middle Ages, were grossly immoral, while
      Christ was perfect In holiness. Christ said that His kingdom was not of
      this world, and He refused to exercise temporal authority. But the pope is
      a temporal ruler, just like a little king, with his own country, his own
      system of courts, vassals, coinage, postal service, and a Swiss military
      guard (100 men in 16 th century uniforms) which serves as a papal
      bodyguard. The popes claim political power, and for many years ruled the
      Papal States, which stretched all the way across Italy and contained
      16,000 square miles and a population of approximately 3,000,000. Those
      states were confiscated by Italy, under the leadership of the patriot
      Garibaldi, in 1870, and since that time the popes have been limited to
      Vatican City, located within the city of Rome, which has an area of about
      one sixth of a square mile and a permanent population of about 1,000, with
      some 2,000 more employed there. In maintaining his claim to political
      power the pope sends ambassadors and ministers to foreign governments, and
      in turn receives ambassadors and ministers from those governments. As of
      October 12, 1960, 31 nations maintained ambassadors at the Vatican and
      received ambassadors from the Vatican, and 11 nations maintained ministers
      there. In each country to which a papal ambassador is sent Rome seeks to
      have her ambassador designated as the dean of the diplomatic corps, thus
      giving him rank above the other ambassadors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affairs of the Roman Church are controlled by a bureaucracy that is
      tightly controlled, completely authoritarian, and self-perpetuating, all
      of which is in striking contrast with the New Testament principles of
      church government in which the affairs of the church were in the hands of
      the people. The pope is elected by the cardinals, who then disband and
      have no further power to censure any of his actions. New cardinals are
      appointed by the pope, without necessary consultation with anyone; nor is
      there any limit on the number of new cardinals that he may appoint, the
      full number of the college of cardinals having remained at 70 for
      centuries until recently when pope John XXIII increased the number to
      85.<sup>1</sup> The bishops too are appointed by the pope, and may be
      promoted, moved, demoted, or dismissed as he pleases. The priests and nuns
      are chosen by the bishops, and are promoted, demoted, or transferred by
      them, without explanation if they so choose. And the people must be
      obedient to the priests, although in all of that elaborate system they
      have no official voice at all, nor is there any official channel through
      which they can express their ideas or preferences in church affairs. The
      papacy, therefore, is not a spiritual unity in Christ, but an external
      unity under the pope, a cloak which covers divisions and dissensions
      between the various church orders which on occasions have emerged with
      much rivalry and bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> The number was increased to 134 by pope Paul VI, in 1969, ten
      of whom are Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      We close this discussion of the papacy with a quotation from Dr. Harris
      which we believe states correctly the New Testament teaching concerning
      church government and inter-church affairs:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fact is that the early church had no head on earth. Christ was their
      head and they all were brothers. They did have an organization, however,
      and Presbyterians point to Acts 15 as a splendid example of how it
      operated. There was a doctrinal question at Antioch. What should the
      church of Antioch do to settle it? Should they write a letter to Peter
      asking his decision? This would be the Romanist position. But they did
      not. Should they write a letter to the ‘college of Apostles’? This is the
      episcopal position that the bishops by apostolic succession have the whole
      authority in the church. But Antioch did not do that. Should they call a
      congregational meeting of the church at Antioch and have the matter
      decided by the vote of the congregation? That would be the independent
      theory of church government. But they did not do this either. Rather they
      sent representatives to a synod meeting held at Jerusalem where the
      apostles and elders came together to consider the matter. They considered
      it carefully with prayer and Scripture study. Finally the apostles and
      elders decided on a policy and gave out decrees to which all the churches
      were expected to submit (Acts 16:4). There was no primacy of Peter or of
      anyone else. There was instead a democratic meeting of the ordained
      leaders of the churches judging matters according to God’s Word. This is
      the Scriptural answer to Roman Catholic pretentions on Peter” (The Bible
      Presbyterian Reporter , January, 1959).
