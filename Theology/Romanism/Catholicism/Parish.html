    <h2>The Roman Church Claims the Right to Supervise All Education</h2>
    <p>
      Webster’s New International Dictionary defines “parochial” as “(1) of or
      pertaining to a parish...; (2) confined or limited to a parish; as of
      parochial interest; hence limited in range or scope; narrow; local; as a
      parochial mind or point of view. ...”
    </p>
    <p>
      When we apply this term to a school we mean one created and governed by a
      church organization. Such a school may be created because the parent body
      does not consider the existing school system adequate (in most cases
      because it omits or gives unsatisfactory religious instruction) or because
      no other school is available. In the United States the motive for
      parochial schools is clearly the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the totalitarian claims made by the Roman Catholic Church, as
      professedly the only true church and the only organization on earth that
      has a right to speak for God, is the right to control all education,
      outside as well as inside its membership. Its ideal is that education
      should be the exclusive monopoly of the priesthood. Repeatedly it has de¬
      nounced public education, that is, education organized and controlled by a
      public authority such as a local, state, or national government. Pope Pius
      IX, in his Syllabus of Errors , in 1864, condemned the public school
      system in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The direction of public schools in which the youth of Christian states
      are brought up... neither can nor ought to be assumed by the civil
      authority alone, or in such a manner that no right shall be recognized on
      the part of any other authority to interfere in the dispositions of the
      schools, in the regulation of the studies, in the appointment of degrees,
      and in the selection and approval of masters. ... It is false that the
      best conditions of civil society demand that popular schools be open to
      the children of all classes, or that the generality of public institutions
      should be free from all ecclesiastical authority. Catholics cannot approve
      a system of education for youth apart from the Catholic faith, and
      disjointed from the authority of the church” (Propositions 45, 47, 48).
    </p>
    <p>
      In another statement Pope Pius IX declared: “Education outside of the
      Catholic Church is heresy.” But we may well ask, just what has education
      in the Roman Church done for the masses of Italy, France, Spain, and Latin
      America? And again we ask: If the direction of the public schools, which
      are paid for with tax money, should not be in the hands of the community
      which pays for it, where should it be? Certainly it should not be in the
      hands of a foreign pontiff of a different faith, nor should it be turned
      over to a totalitarian church which is under foreign control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope Pius XI, in his encyclical, On the Education of Youth (1929),
      declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the first place, education belongs pre-eminently to the Church for two
      supernatural reasons. ... As for the scope of the Church’s educative
      mission, it extends over all people without any limitations, according to
      Christ’s command: ‘Teach ye all nations.’ Nor is there a power which can
      oppose or prevent it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope John XXIII, on December 30, 1959, reiterated the papal claim in
      substantially the same words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rev. J. A. Burns, president of Holy Cross College, Washington, D. C., in
      his book, The Growth and Development of the Catholic School System in the
      United States , says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We deny, of course, as Catholics, the right of the civil government to
      educate, for education is a function of the spiritual society. ... It [the
      state] may found and endow schools and pay the teachers, but it cannot
      dictate or interfere with the education or discipline of the schools” (p.
      223).
    </p>
    <p>
      In these statements we have the claim of the Roman Church that it is the
      only rightful educator in the world. It denies the right of the state even
      to establish secular schools for its own order. According to this teaching
      the sole right and duty of the state in this field is to collect taxes for
      the establishment and maintenance of Roman Catholic schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not hesitate to claim openly, even in the Protestant and
      democratic United States, that education is exclusively a function of the
      Roman Catholic Church—as indeed it also claims that preaching and the
      administration of the sacraments are functions of the Roman Church only.
      This claim implies that education should be denied to all those outside
      the Roman Church. And indeed that is the policy that the Roman Church puts
      into effect in areas where she is in control—another means by which Rome
      seeks to maintain her control over the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the Roman Church really wants is a concordat between the Vatican and
      each nation, such as that under which Italy, Spain, Portugal, and various
      other nations have been or are governed, through which a large part or
      perhaps all of the educational process is turned over to the Roman Church
      while being paid for by the state. Her aim is to dominate public and
      private schools to the exclusion of all other churches and religions. The
      teaching of the Roman Catholic religion in the public schools becomes
      compulsory, even for Protestant children, as in present day Spain, if the
      Roman Church has her way. The first step in that process in a country such
      as ours is to undermine the public schools by making her parochial schools
      tax supported, while at the same time placing as many Roman Catholics as
      possible in the public schools as teachers. But such a condition destroys
      the very foundation of democratic and representative government.
      Concerning this problem MacGregor says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “A country such as America cannot expect to come to any reasonable terms
      with the Roman Catholic hierarchy on the subject of education. The Church
      is avowedly opposed not only to public schools but also to independent
      schools and universities that are not under the control of the Roman
      Catholic Church, to which alone, it is affirmed, belongs the right to
      teach anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In practice, however, in a country such as the United States, the Church
      is unable, for obvious reasons, to enforce this principle. So the
      hierarchy has to content itself with the more practical aim of securing
      Roman Catholic parochial schools at the public expense.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After saying that the Roman Church thus seeks “to make its own educational
      system a charge on the American public,” he adds:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Financially it would hardly be better news to the hierarchy if Congress
      were to pass a bill appropriating money from the Treasury for the payment
      of mass stipends to all Roman Catholic clergy throughout the country. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is by means of censorship and boycott, and above all, educational
      indoctrination at public expense, that it is hoped to transform America
      into a country that is predominantly Roman Catholic in spirit; that is to
      say, one in which it would be very imprudent to speak openly against
      anything uttered by a Roman Catholic bishop, and exceedingly dangerous to
      speak even privately in favor of anything uttered by anyone who was
      explicitly under the ban of the Church” (The Vatican Revolution , pp.
      148-150).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to remember that historically the American system of free,
      universal public education was exclusively a product of Protestantism.
      Practically all of the people in colonial America were Protestant. The
      Puritans of New England contributed most toward developing the ideal that
      all classes should have equal educational opportunities. Having come to
      America to secure religious freedom for themselves, it was only natural
      that they should turn to education as one means of promoting their faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first college, Harvard, was established in 1636, just 16 years after
      the landing at Plymouth Rock, and it was intended primarily as a school to
      train those preparing for the ministry. The first elementary schools were
      in the homes and churches, usually with the local pastor as the
      instructor. So keenly was the need felt for grammar schools that in 1647 a
      legislative act provided that every town having as many as fifty
      householders should appoint a teacher and provide for his wages, and that
      every community having as many as one hundred householders should provide
      a grammar school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next colleges of earliest origin, William and Mary (Episcopal) in
      1693, Yale (Puritan) in 1701, Princeton (Presbyterian) in 1746, as also
      Dartmouth, Brown, Rutgers, and the University of Pennsylvania, were
      established through church influences during the colonial period, before
      the Constitution was written and before those generally recognized as the
      champions of our American way of life were born. Those schools were not
      the product of government but of the church.

    <h2>Parochial Schools Compulsory for Roman Catholics</h2>
    <p>
      The First Plenary Council of Baltimore, in 1853, called upon all bishops
      to establish parish schools in every church in their dioceses. The Second
      Plenary Council of Baltimore, in 1866, repeated that call and took steps
      to make it effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canon Law 1374 denies freedom of choice to Roman Catholic parents in
      regard to schools, and says that they must send their children to
      parochial schools under pain of mortal sin unless excused from doing so by
      the bishop. Canon Law 1381 decrees concerning the school setup:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. “In all schools the religious training of the young is subject to the
      authority and inspection of the Catholic Church” [i.e., the priest or
      bishop].
    </p>
    <p>
      2. “It is the right and duty of the Bishops to take care that nothing is
      taught or done against the Faith or sound morals in any school in their
      territory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      3. “The Bishops have also the right to approve the teachers of religion
      and the textbooks and further to require that texts be dropped or teachers
      removed, when the good of religion or morality demands this action.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the curriculum, staff, and operation of the parochial school are
      under the complete domination of the bishop. Parents have no choice, no
      rights at all, as regards teachers, texts, or methods of instruction, as
      over against the bishop, if he chooses to exercise his authority. Nor has
      any school board or committee any choice in the management of the school
      except as that choice may be delegated to it by the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that the parochial school has been promoted primarily by the
      priests and bishops as a means of keeping the children of their church
      separate from Protestant children and from public school influences during
      their formative years, the better to indoctrinate and control them. If
      left to themselves most Roman Catholic parents would send their children
      to the public schools, and many do so in spite of the pressure from the
      priests. After more than one hundred years of effort by the hierarchy to
      impose the parochial school system on their people, less than half of
      their children attend those schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the United States there are some 10,760 parochial grade schools with an
      enrollment of approximately 4,700,000, and some 2,432 high schools with
      approximately 900,000 students.<sup>1</sup> The National Department of
      Health, Education, and Welfare has indicated that the total grade and high
      school enrollment in all schools is approximately 35,000,000. That means
      that the parochial schools enroll approximately one out of seven, or about
      15 percent. And that of course includes some who are not Roman Catholics.
      Also there are about 330,000 students enrolled in 278 Roman Catholic
      colleges and universities. The parochial school enrollment has risen from
      about 5 percent in 1900 to the present figure, with the primary increase
      having come since the close of the Second World War in 1945. All of these
      students, of course, are taught Roman Catholic polity (political,
      economic, and social) as well as Roman Catholic doctrine. Approximately 90
      percent of all parochial and private elementary and high schools in this
      country are under the control of the Roman Catholic Church. Less than half
      of those high schools are accredited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it be clearly understood that we do not object to church related
      schools as such, as they are conducted, for instance, in the Lutheran and
      some other churches, but only to that form of parochialism that is found
      in the Roman Catholic Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> In contrast with developments abroad, Roman Catholic
      parochial schools in the United States in recent years have declined.
      According to a report of the National Catholic Educational Association,
      enrollment in the elementary and secondary schools dropped from 5.6
      million in the 1964-65 school year to 4.6 million in 1969-70.

    <h2>Parochial School Indoctrination</h2>
    <p>
      In view of the fact that some 5,600,000 Roman Catholic children at the
      grade and high school level are being trained in the parochial schools,
      what is the hierarchy teaching these future Americans? It is well known
      that such schools do not confine their indoctrination to religion. History
      books are rewritten to present a “Catholic version.” Roman Catholic
      schools do not share a mutual pride and appreciation with the public
      schools in setting forth the problems and difficulties and progress of the
      early Colonists, such as the Pilgrims, Puritans, Quakers, etc.,
      practically all of whom were Protestants. Protestant national heroes, such
      as Washington, Jefferson, Lranklin, Roger Williams, William Penn, and
      others are minimized, and comparatively unimportant Roman Catholics are
      glorified and their deeds presented as accomplishments of Roman
      Catholicism. The struggles that our forefathers went through and the
      sacrifices they made to establish freedom of religion, freedom of speech
      and of the press, the right to vote, etc., are minimized or omitted. What
      we consider a victory and a great step forward, they consider a defeat and
      a step backward. We point with pride to the constitutional provision for
      the separation of church and state; they brand that a mistake and say that
      this and other nations should have remained under the authority of the
      pope. A few years ago the government of Mexico by constitutional provision
      closed all papal sectarian schools in that country, to the end that every
      boy and girl should be given a true statement of the history of Mexico as
      taught in the public schools. Certainly every boy and girl who is to
      become a good American citizen should be taught a fair and truthful
      account of American history.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the parochial schools Roman Catholic indoctrination is included in
      every subject. History, literature, geography, civics, and science are
      given a Roman Catholic slant. The whole education of the child is filled
      with propaganda. That, of course, is the very purpose of such schools, the
      very reason for going to all of the work and expense of maintaining a dual
      school system. Their purpose is not so much to educate, but to
      indoctrinate and train, not to teach Scripture truths and Americanism, but
      to make loyal Roman Catholics. The children are regimented, and are told
      what to wear, what to do, and what to think.<sup>2</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the teaching in the parochial schools is done by the nuns. They
      teach the children to revere and worship the Virgin Mary and to trust in
      images and rosaries whether they know anything about faith in Christ or
      not. All nuns are under solemn vows to promote their religion in every
      course they teach. They work year in and year out without receiving
      anything more than their board and keep, and without the personal freedom
      that every American has the right to enjoy. They are kept in abject
      poverty, while money flows freely to the priests, bishops, and especially
      to the Vatican in Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>2</sup> This paragraph... was quoted in a concurring opinion by
      justices Douglas, Black, and Marshall as the Supreme Court of the United
      States, in two cases, June 28, 1971, held by decisions of 8 to 0 and 8 to
      1 that State aid to parochial and private schools was unconstitutional.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the content of the curriculum at the high school and college
      level, in the textbook, Christian Principles and National Problems , by
      Ostheimer and Delaney, under the imprimatur of Cardinal Spellman, we read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The doctrine of the Church... is that the State must profess and teach
      not any religion, but the one true form of worship founded by Christ and
      continuing today in the Catholic Church alone” (p. 98).
    </p>
    <p>
      “The non-Catholic and the non-baptized should be permitted to carry on
      their own form of worship as long as there would be no danger of scandal
      or perversion of the faithful. In a country where the majority are
      Catholics, the practice of Protestantism or paganism by an inconspicuous
      minority would be neither a source of scandal nor perversion to the
      adherents of the true faith” (p. 99).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have the threat that freedom of worship will be denied to
      Protestants if the Roman Church gains the ascendancy. Only as long as the
      Protestant minority remains small and “inconspicuous” will it be allowed
      to exist peacefully, and even then it must not seek to carry on
      evangelistic work among Roman Catholics and others. But just how small and
      how inconspicuous it would have to be to receive this tolerance is not
      stated. Presumably that would rest with the individual Roman Catholic
      leaders. Judging by the active persecution that still is carried on
      against an inconspicuous minority of Protestants in Spain, it would have
      to be near the vanishing point. That the rising generation of Roman
      Catholics should be taught that when their church reaches an anticipated
      majority in the United States they are to start oppressing and persecuting
      other churches is monstrous and diabolical. And yet this is set forth
      under the imprimatur, and therefore with the approval of, the most
      prominent American Roman Catholic, Cardinal Spellman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar view is taught in another widely used text, Living Our Faith ,
      by Flynn, Loretto, and Simeon, also with Spellman’s imprimatur. It says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The question of union or separation of Church and State has perplexed men
      since the Protestant revolt. The ideal situation exists when there is
      perfect union and accord between Church and State, with each supreme in
      its own field. ... In a Catholic country, when a dispute arises and
      settlement is unattainable the rights of the Church should prevail, since
      it possesses the higher authority” (p. 247).
    </p>
    <p>
      This book also tells the students that “non-Catholic methods of worshiping
      must be branded counterfeit”—and the inference is that the state should
      assist the church in making the brand effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      A widely used college and seminary text, with the official nihil obstat
      (nothing objectionable) of Arthur J. Scanlan, S.T.D. (Censor Liborum ),
      and the official Imprimatur of Archbishop (now Cardinal) Francis J.
      Spellman, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suppose that the constitutional obstacles to proscription of
      non-Catholics have been legitimately removed and they themselves have
      become numerically insignificant: What then would be the proper course of
      action for a Catholic State? Apparently, the latter State could logically
      tolerate only such religious activities as were confined to the members of
      the dissenting group. It could not permit them to carry on general
      propaganda nor accord their organization certain privileges that had
      formerly been extended to all religious corporations, for example,
      exemption from taxation” (p. 320; from Catholic Principles of Politics, by
      John A. Ryan and Francis J. Boland. Copyright 1940 by the National
      Catholic Welfare Conference. Used by permission of the Macmillan Company).
    </p>
    <p>
      The general thrust of that book is that the Roman Catholic Church must
      establish itself as the state church in the United States, that it must be
      made to prevail and eventually to eliminate all other churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the rising generation of Roman Catholics is being indoctrinated with
      the belief that church-state separation is unwise and un-American in
      principle, that the Roman Church is the only true church, and that it is
      the right and privilege of that church to suppress others by force as it
      has opportunity. And we are even asked to subsidize such teaching with tax
      money! This same teaching is also being given more or less directly to
      three million other students in various public schools through this nation
      that are staffed in part with nuns and brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When these millions of students are being trained in that kind of mental
      climate, how can we doubt that if and when the opportunity comes they will
      attempt to put those ideas into practice? The bigoted and shocking
      teaching that goes on in schools using such textbooks as the above
      mentioned is a betrayal of American freedom and democracy. It is
      treasonable, and it certainly should not be allowed by any group or in any
      schools in this nation. If such teaching were being given in a set of
      schools established by the Communists there would be an immediate outcry
      against it. But when given in Roman Catholic schools it attracts little
      attention, and indeed some are even willing to assist in promoting it with
      tax money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman Catholics often pretend to Protestants that their schools for all
      practical purposes are the same as the public schools except that at
      certain periods religion is taught. But as we have shown by quotations
      from their own texts, the facts are quite the contrary. We particularly
      warn Protestant parents against sending their children to such schools.
      The training given can have no other effect than to undermine the faith of
      Protestant children. And for parents who send their children to such
      schools the time surely will come when they will regret their decision
      with bitter tears. Many Protestant parents who pay little attention to
      school affairs have suddenly been amazed to find their children praying to
      the Virgin, crossing themselves, and attending Roman Catechism classes.
      And when that stage is reached it may be too late to reclaim them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret of the success achieved by the dictators such as Hitler,
      Mussolini, and Stalin, in leading a majority of their countrymen to accept
      ideologies that were detrimental even to their own interests, was to
      concentrate on the training, or the so-called education, of youth. Each
      sought to control the schools and youth organizations, and both Hitler and
      Mussolini, although Roman Catholics themselves, had sharp disagreements
      with the Roman Church concerning that problem. Each of the dictators
      realized that if he could control the youth of the land, the nation soon
      would be under his control. The Roman Church had operated on that
      principle for centuries, and the dictators simply took that method over as
      a part of their own system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some Roman Catholic leaders say that a school in a community is more
      important than a church. And indeed that is the principle on which the
      hierarchy is now working in Japan, Korea, Formosa, in Lutheran Sweden and
      Finland, and in various other places where their people are few in
      numbers. In various places it is now putting the building of schools ahead
      of the building of churches. And that policy apparently pays off since it
      trains a group of followers who in time form the nucleus of a church. In
      established communities Roman churches usually do not bother to separate
      church and school finances but treat them as one operation. The parochial
      schools, with their intense indoctrination of the young are, in a word,
      the “secret weapon” by which the Roman Church hopes to control the
      nation’s future citizens and so to win the victory over Protestantism.

    <h2>Narrow View of the Parochial School</h2>
    <p>
      One feature of the Roman schools that calls for comment is the very narrow
      outlook presented. This applies particularly to schools at the high school
      and college level. While Protestantism encourages free investigation,
      Romanism restricts the investigative process and is concerned primarily
      with its own advancement. It suppresses truth as does any totalitarian
      power. In the ages before the Reformation free inquiry was prohibited and
      men were even put to death for possessing the Bible translated into their
      own tongue. The Index of Forbidden Books,<sup>3</sup> still in effect as
      rigidly as ever, proscribes all the controversial books, magazines, and
      other publications of Protestants and others who oppose Romanism, and so
      makes it impossible for Roman Catholics to know both sides of a question.
    </p>
    <p><sup>3</sup> See footnote [#1], [chapter 4].</p>
    <p>
      Graduates from parochial high schools who enroll in state colleges or
      universities are surprised to find, for instance, that their history books
      do not agree with the ones they have been studying. They read instead
      about the decadence and moral corruption of the papacy during the Middle
      Ages, the cruel tyranny of the Inquisition, and, on the other hand, the
      accomplishments of Protestant leaders and nations, and many other
      embarrassing facts. The Roman Church wants obedience, and to that end it
      withholds from its people that broader knowledge and outlook on the world
      that makes for a wellinformed and well-rounded personality. Many Roman
      Catholic laymen, as well as some priests, resent the narrow, un-American
      atmosphere of the parochial schools. But few have the courage to express
      their views openly or to do anything about it. Those who expect to stay in
      the Roman Church simply accept the situation and keep their mouths shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the entire Roman Catholic system of “education,” from the
      parochial schools to the colleges and seminaries, the teachers, who for
      the most part are nuns and priests, have studied practically nothing
      except what has borne the official Imprimatur (“Let it be published”) of
      the church. The Index of Forbidden Books limits and controls their
      libraries. The most important qualification for teachers and professors is
      not knowledge and teaching ability, but indoctrination and loyalty to the
      church. Roman Catholic students, therefore, in a real sense are forbidden
      to think. They let the priests think for them. But the fallacy of that
      system is that the priests too are forbidden to think. They too are
      limited by the Imprimatur and the Index. Freedom of thought and research
      have very little place in such schools. And the students in such schools
      are, for the most part, not educated but merely trained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various instances can be cited showing how this narrow attitude toward
      learning has worked out in the past. Copernicus, a Polish-born astronomer
      who died in 1543, wrote a book, On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies
      , in which he set forth the view that the sun was the center of the solar
      system and that the planets including the earth revolved around it. But
      the Roman theologians were bitterly opposed to that view. The idea that
      the earth was not fixed at the very center of all things was more than
      they could stand, and they were not open to demonstration. To make the
      earth a mere satellite, indeed only one among several satellites, seemed
      to diminish the importance of the pope, who allegedly was the ruler of the
      earth. Copernicus was excommunicated, and his book was put on the Index
      where it remained for centuries. But his scientific discoveries later
      proved to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Aquinas, most prominent of all Roman theologians, taught that the
      earth was fixed in its position, and his writings tied up that false
      doctrine with the doctrines of the Church of Rome. In 1633 Galileo,
      another brilliant astronomer who supported the views of Copernicus and who
      discovered the telescope, was brought to trial by the Jesuits before the
      Inquisition. His work was examined by a committee and was condemned as
      dangerous to the church. He was forced to recant. But it is said that as
      he rose after the recantation he reiterated his views concerning the
      earth, saying, “Nevertheless it does move.” The Inquisition sentenced him
      to the dungeon for three years. Later this was changed to house arrest,
      under which he spent the remainder of his life. The church put an end to
      his scientific investigations, but the learned man was right. The Roman
      Church persecuted Harvey who discovered the circulation of the blood, and
      it anathematized Pascal, the famous French mathematician and scientist,
      because he dared to question some of its doctrines.

    <h2>Public Schools Sometimes Taken Over by the Roman Church</h2>
    <p>
      In some communities in the United States where Roman Catholics are in a
      majority they have taken control of the public schools. This usually is
      accomplished by gaining a majority on the school board. In view of the
      fact that so few people vote in school elections, it frequently is easy
      for pressure groups to elect their candidates. The schools are then
      staffed with nuns, or in some cases with priests or brothers, the study of
      Roman Catholic doctrine is introduced and is practically made compulsory,
      and all the while the school remains on the public payroll. Pupils who
      object are subjected to social and economic reprisals, and sometimes are
      told that if they cannot adjust to the school they should go elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such schools are known as “captive schools.” A report in The Christian
      Century , July 15, 1959, said there were at least 281 such schools in 21
      states. The report also said that at least 2,055 nuns were teaching in
      these schools. Conditions of this kind exist in Ohio, Maine, Connecticut,
      Illinois, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Michigan, Texas, and Arkansas, with
      the worst conditions in Indiana, Kansas, and Kentucky. In some of these
      states nuns teach in their church garb, and the classrooms display
      religious pictures, crucifixes, and other symbols of the Roman Catholic
      Church which by no stretch of the imagination can be called legitimate
      teaching devices. Salary checks of the nuns, who have taken vows of
      poverty and who therefore cannot own property, and who have no family
      obligations, are commonly made payable to the religious orders to which
      they belong, even without being subject to withholding tax deductions. But
      the salaries of Protestants teaching in the same or similar schools and
      with family obligations are subject to all of the tax deductions. This
      same situation has also been found to exist in regard to chaplains in the
      armed forces. This practice means that in reality the nuns’ salaries and
      those of the chaplains are paid to the Roman Catholic Church, which in
      turn merely furnishes them with living expenses. For all practical
      purposes such schools are parochial schools supported by public taxation.
      This illustrates again the relentless drive of the hierarchy to get tax
      money for its private institutions. This practice of turning the nuns’ and
      chaplains’ salaries over to the order to which they belong, even without
      tax deductions, is permitted through a special ruling by H. F. O’Connell,
      Chief of Technical Reference Branch, U. S. Treasury Department, which
      seems to have been made for the special benefit of the Roman Catholic
      Church. His ruling reads:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Members of a religious order who have taken vows of poverty, are not
      required to report as income, for federal tax purposes, their earnings
      which, in accordance with their vows, they turn over to their orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Members of a religious order who have taken vows of poverty are bound
      absolutely to obey the commands of their superiors and have no discretion
      as to where they will perform their duties and in what capacity; and they
      are further bound to turn over their entire compensation (or the amount
      less living expenses), to the order. By reason of the stringency of these
      requirements and the lack of discretion on the part of the members, such
      members are considered agents of the order they represent. ... This is the
      general rule applicable where one person performs services and receives
      compensation as agent for another” (ruling issued December 19, 1956).
    </p>
    <p>
      We point out first of all, however, that the restrictions under which the
      nuns and priests work are merely Roman Catholic Church regulations for
      which the government has no responsibility whatever. The nuns and priests
      accept those restrictions willingly and are responsible for them. In the
      second place, how can nuns and priests who are so completely under the
      control of their church organizations that they have no discretion as to
      where or in what capacity they perform their duties be considered free
      agents fit to teach in our public schools? In the third place, while the
      government can legitimately contract with private companies for such
      things as construction projects, carrying the mail, etc., under our
      constitutional provision for the separation of church and state it has no
      right to hire the religious orders of a church to provide teachers for the
      public schools or chaplains for the armed forces. And in the fourth place,
      in view of the official doctrines of their church, how can these nuns and
      priests be expected to teach the true principles of American freedom and
      democracy? How can they be expected not to teach their religion?
    </p>
    <p>
      C. Stanley Lowell reported the following situation as existing in 1956:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In Indiana more than two million dollars in tax funds went to ‘public
      schools’ that were in effect parochial schools of the Roman Church. There
      are 152 garbed nuns teaching in the public schools of Kansas with their
      salaries going to their church” (Christianity Today , January 7, 1959).
    </p>
    <p>
      In some states long and expensive legislation has been instituted to clear
      up abuses of this kind. Much more is needed. Schools such as those just
      mentioned—public in name but parochial in purpose and operation—patently
      violate the religious rights of Protestant and other children who do not
      belong to the Roman Church. Such schools are an affront to our
      Constitutional principle of separation of church and state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glenn L. Archer, executive director of Protestants and Other Americans
      United for Separation of Church and State, cites the following as a
      typical example of church-state abuse:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In Bremond, Texas, the ‘public school’ is conducted in a parish-owned
      building with six nuns and two priests as teachers. A suit filed there
      recently charged that public funds were being illegally used in support of
      this sectarian institution. The Bremond school is only one of 22 such
      ‘public schools’ in Texas that are being supported by tax funds” (The
      Convert , November, 1959).
    </p>
    <p>
      In numerous instances school boards friendly to Roman Catholicism or under
      Roman Catholic domination have sold school buildings and grounds to the
      Roman Catholic Church for a mere fraction of their true values, sometimes
      for only $1.00, a mere token sale. At Rome, New York, an old school was
      “abandoned” by the city, sold for $25,000, and reopened as the
      Transfiguration parish school. Catholic sources admitted that the true
      value of the property as “estimated by experts” was not $25,000 but
      $300,000. In St. Louis, Missouri, publicly acquired property was resold to
      St. Louis University, a Jesuit institution of the Roman Catholic Church,
      at an alleged loss to the public in excess of $ 6 , 000 , 000 .
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when nuns in a public school are instructed by the school board not
      to teach their religion, it is vain to expect that they will not do so
      either directly or indirectly. They are under vows to teach their religion
      to all who come before them. Indeed that is the very purpose of their
      confession, and they will refrain from it only to the extent to which they
      are restrained. Protestants justly protest teaching which seeks to make
      Roman Catholics out of their children in the public school classrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      As just indicated, in several states nuns are even allowed to wear their
      religious garb while teaching in the public schools. In 1960 a ruling was
      handed down in Ohio permitting this practice. And the Roman Church pushes
      this practice just as far as it can without arousing too much opposition.
      Such symbolism inevitably has its effect on the impressionable young
      minds, identifying the teachers with the Roman Catholic Church and turning
      the pupils in that direction. Even if religion is not mentioned, even if
      the name “Roman Catholic” is never spoken, the church garb in itself
      carries the message: “This is Roman Catholicism; this is what the Roman
      Catholic Church teaches.” The pupils grow up looking up, perhaps
      unconsciously, to the nuns and priests as their mentors and guides. As a
      rule children tend to admire what they see in their teachers, and under
      normal conditions it is proper that they should do so. But it is most
      highly improper for the Roman Church to take advantage of this situation
      and to propagandize in schools that are paid for at public expense and
      which contain children from Protestant and other homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We oppose the employment of nuns in the public schools under any
      conditions, for the simple reason that they are not free agents. Their
      allegiance to their church is stronger than their allegiance to any school
      board. At the very least they should be required to exchange their church
      garb and insignia for dress that is without distinctive suggestion and
      which does not in itself propagandize in behalf of their religion. But
      even this is less than a halfway measure toward correcting the problem.

    <h2>Roman Catholic Opposition to Public Schools</h2>
    <p>
      The Roman Church not only promotes her own school system, but is strongly
      opposed to the American system of free public education. She would like
      nothing better than to see it destroyed. This is true first of all because
      the Roman Church claims for herself and as a matter of right the privilege
      of supervising all education, so that the youth of the land can be
      effectively directed toward that church. Typical of this attitude are the
      words of Paul L. Blakely, S.J., in an article, May an American Oppose the
      Public School , which bears the imprimatur of the late cardinal Hayes:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our first duty to the public school is not to pay taxes for its
      maintenance. We pay that tax under protest, not because we admit an
      obligation injustice. ... The first duty of every Catholic father to the
      public school is to keep his children out of it. ... For the man who sends
      his children to the public school when he could obtain for them the
      blessing of a Catholic education is not a practicing Catholic, even though
      he goes to mass every morning. ... ‘Every Catholic child in a Catholic
      school,’ is the command of the church.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late 19 th century the Roman Church began a vigorous campaign to
      drive Bible reading and all discussion of religion out of the public
      schools. The real objection, of course, was not to the teaching of
      religion as such, but to the fact that the Roman Catholic religion was not
      taught. And now that the Bible and religion have been driven out of the
      public schools the Roman Church denounces them as “godless,” “pagan,”
      “socialistic,” “immoral,” “un-American.”
    </p>
    <p>C. Stanley Lowell writes:</p>
    <p>
      “Roman Catholics undertook to drive religion out of the schools not
      because they were atheistic or secularistic people, but because they were
      not powerful enough to determine the kind of religion to be taught. They
      preferred no religious teaching at all if they could not have Roman
      Catholic dogma. The provincial council of the Roman Catholic Church in
      Baltimore, 1840, imposed on priests the responsibility of seeing to it
      that Catholic children attending public schools did not participate in any
      religious exercises there. They were also to use their influence to
      prevent any such practice in the public school. The ‘secular public
      school’ was in substantial part an achievement of the Roman Catholic
      Church” (Christianity Today, January 7, 1957).
    </p>
    <p>
      In some places, however, where Roman Catholics are able to dominate the
      public school moral and spiritual teaching with their own dogma, as in New
      York City, or where they have been able to secure public funds for their
      own schools, they have done an about-face and now call for a return of
      religion in education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another practice, we may even say a standard procedure, of the parochial
      schools is that of “dumping” delinquent, problem children on the public
      schools. Acknowledgment of such practice, even from a Roman Catholic
      source is found in an article in the Paulist magazine Information,
      November, 1959, by Louise Edna Goeden, a public school administrator in an
      un-named American city. She says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “As a teacher and administrator in a large public high school I am
      constantly dealing with pupils the parochial school expels or refuses to
      enroll or re-enroll. From experience, I know without looking that a large
      percentage of these entrants will be from parochial schools. From
      experience I also know that many will become our problem cases— because of
      poor scholarship or conduct or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I call in the parents, and the story is always the same. The students
      were ‘asked’ to leave the parochial school because they had poor grades or
      didn’t follow directions or were behavior problems. Or they were ‘advised’
      not to enroll in any Catholic school.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As a teacher and a Catholic, I take exception to the parochial schools
      dumping the dullards, the sluggards and the delinquents on the public
      school doorstep. When my non-Catholic colleagues say about problem
      students, ‘These are the very ones the Catholic schools should keep; they
      need religious training,’ I agree.”
    </p>

    <h2>The Two Systems Compared</h2>
    <p>
      Far from being “godless,” or “immoral,” or “un-American,” as the Roman
      Catholics charge, the public school, in which all students meet as equals
      regardless of race, color, or creed, is uniquely designed to be a bulwark
      against narrow sectarianism, bigotry, intolerance, and race prejudice. The
      record is clear that an undue proportion of the gangsters, racketeers,
      thieves, and juvenile delinquents who roam our big city streets come, not
      from the public schools, but from the parochial schools. The Roman
      hierarchy must be aware of the preponderance of malefactors among their
      own people, and evidently they are attempting to hide their guilt behind
      the “godless school” smoke screen. It is time that the American people
      wake up to the fact that the real godless schools are the parochial
      schools that are turning out more than their proportionate share of the
      moral misfits.
    </p>
    <p>C. Stanley Lowell, writing on this subject, has well said:</p>
    <p>
      “Our public school system has been the keystone of democracy. It is the
      one place where Protestant, Catholic and Jew meet on common ground and get
      to know and understand each other. Very early the Romanists began to
      establish their own sectarian schools, although millions of Roman Catholic
      youth continued to attend public schools. In an endeavor to correct this
      situation, Romanist leaders have launched a campaign to undermine and
      discredit the public school. Father Francis P. Le Buffe has declared:
      ‘Thanks to our godless American public school... we have a generation
      today which does not know God.’ The Rev. Robert I. Gannon, president of
      Fordham University, has charged the public school is responsible for
      juvenile delinquency and suggests that there would be none if Roman
      Catholic moral teaching were given to all. Unfortunately, it just happened
      that at the time Dr. Gannon was making this speech in New York City, three
      fifths of all the juvenile delinquents being arrested in that area were
      Roman Catholics (Roman Catholics make up only one fifth of the population
      of New York City). It just happens, too, that Roman Catholics supply more
      than twice their proportionate share of the prison population of this
      country” (pamphlet, A Summons to Protestants).
    </p>
    <p>And to the same general effect Dr. Walter M. Montano says:</p>
    <p>
      “Let me disabuse those Protestants who send their children to Catholic
      schools in the fond belief that they ‘receive a better education.’
      Actually, the education in Catholic schools is poor to a degree that would
      shock our educational authorities if they were ever permitted to find out
      about it. The deficiencies of our public schools, over which we are
      concerned, do not compare for a moment with the abysmal ignorance which
      passes as Catholic education.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Many American Catholic children are being taught by ignorant European
      peasants in this country solely through the connivance of Catholic
      politicians. Too often their teachers are nuns who know nothing of
      American democracy or American institutions, who cannot speak
      grammatically even in their own tongue. Add to this the suppression and
      distortion of facts which constitute history, literature, and such little
      of the arts and humanities as are ‘taught’ in the Catholic schools, and
      you have the quality of Roman Catholic education.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For instance, the word ‘Inquisition’ is hardly known to Catholic
      students. If mentioned at all, the Inquisition is represented as a
      political project in which Holy Mother Church’s office is merely to turn
      over troublesome political undesirables to the proper authorities. The
      same explanation is given of the burning of Joan of Arc, with the church’s
      responsibility played down to nullity and that of the political
      participants played up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This policy is also followed in dealing with current Colombian
      persecutions. Never is it revealed that the political authorities in all
      those cases held or hold their posts only by sufferance of the Roman
      Church and only as long as their decisions reflect her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      “While whitewashing Rome, Catholic education loses no opportunity to
      vilify Protestants and Protestantism in a way calculated to engender
      resentment and hatred, even in the trusting heart of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Turning from the social to the natural sciences, we find them faring as
      poorly. It is no accident that the United States fails to boast a single
      major Catholic scientist. The fact is that the Roman Church is afraid of
      science and would suppress it if she could as in the days of Galileo’s
      recantation. Her justified dread is based on the fact that science has so
      often proved her wrong. The need of private tutoring before they are able
      to meet matriculation requirements at standard colleges and universities
      is a common experience for Catholic students” (Christian Heritage, May,
      1959).
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the set purposes of the parochial school is to erect a wall between
      Roman Catholics and the other people of the community, not only the
      students but the parents as well, and so to isolate them to some extent
      from the liberalizing tendencies in American life. Children in a parochial
      school are taught that only the Roman church has the “truth,” that all
      others are in “error,” and that it is “a sin against faith and a rebuff to
      God” even to attend another church (see Living Our Faith, p. 114). They
      are also taught that any marriage ceremony involving a Roman Catholic is
      “null and void” unless performed by a priest, and that the marriage of a
      Roman Catholic before a minister or an official of the state is only “an
      attempt at marriage” (p. 290). Such teaching is bigotry of the worst kind.
      Add to this the fact that 90 percent of the teaching in the parochial
      school is done by brainwashed nuns and priests who throughout their lives
      are kept in a rigid mental strait jacket in which they are forbidden to
      read books or magazines not approved by the hierarchy, or to attend or
      listen by radio to religious services other than those of their own
      church, or even to carry on an ordinary conversation with people from
      other churches concerning religious matters, and that these teachers are
      not under a school board but under the absolute authority of one man, the
      bishop of the diocese, and the narrowness of the parochial school becomes
      so evident that it cannot be denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the Roman Catholic Church is so opposed to the public schools, the
      question arises: Should Roman Catholics—laymen, nuns, or priests—be
      allowed to teach in the public schools? Our answer is that they should not
      as long as they maintain their allegiance to the hierarchy. Protestants
      are not allowed to teach in the schools in Spain. In the other Roman
      Catholic countries it is very difficult, if not impossible, for
      Protestants to secure teaching positions. But the fact is that many
      Romanists are allowed to teach in this country. And not only that but in
      some places they are given a preference. In 1933 a law was passed in New
      York State making it an offense, punishable by a fine or imprisonment,
      even to inquire concerning the religious affiliation of applicants for
      teachers’ positions! Thus the citizens of that state were deprived of one
      of the safeguards of civil and religious liberty, that is, the right of
      free speech and inquiry and the way opened for teachers who are opposed to
      the public school system to be forced upon a community contrary to the
      wishes of the majority of the people of that community. Concerning this
      general subject Dr. Zacchello says:
    </p>

      “The Roman Church—popes, bishops, priests, and laymen—do not hesitate in
      opposing and denouncing our public schools. Then why should the followers
      of Romanism be allowed to teach in public schools? Would you employ in
      your business a man who would tell your customers that your merchandise is
      rotten and that they should buy from his relatives’ store? And would you
      want to finance that rival store?
    </p>
    <p>
      “No business man in his right mind would do this. Yet our government is
      not only employing teachers who are deliberately and publicly against our
      educational system, but is considering the financing of private Roman
      Catholic schools.

      “If the public schools of this country are not good enough for the

    <h2>State and Federal Aid for Parochial Schools</h2>
    <p>
      As the Roman Church has grown in this country the parochial schools also
      have grown. Often they have been staffed with poorly equipped nuns who
      served without pay, and often they have been conducted in inferior
      buildings with inferior equipment. In recent years, however, the Roman
      Church has made a considerable effort to improve its schools, particularly
      in the larger cities. In fact the aggressive actions of the hierarchy
      indicate that their ultimate goal is to take over the public school system
      here as they have done in the predominantly Roman Catholic countries. But
      before they can do that they must undermine it. This they attempt to do,
      first by securing fringe benefits. Usually they begin by asking for bus
      transportation. In some places this is now provided, sometimes through
      state or local law, oftentimes without benefit of law if there is no
      public protest. But free bus transportation does not satisfy them. Instead
      it only serves as a springboard for further demands. So consistently has
      this plan been followed that it has been appropriately termed “the school
      bus wedge.” The next step is to ask for free lunches, free text books,
      free equipment, etc. The plan then calls for state or federal aid in
      erecting school buildings and in paying teachers’ salaries, but never with
      state supervision, so that eventually the state pays for the schools and
      the Roman Church operates them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the school bus problem the magazine Church and State recently
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “One in three children in school today must be transported to and from the
      institution. The bill for public school transportation is $417 million
      annually. On the basis of the claimed attendance at parochial schools, and
      the national transportation average cost of $37 per pupil for those who
      need transportation, the subsidy to the [Roman] Church for transportation
      to its schools would run in excess of $61 million.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In various communities efforts to vote bonds for the erection of badly
      needed public school buildings have been defeated by an organized Roman
      Catholic vote, with the purpose of forcing equal appropriations for
      parochial schools. The hierarchy has made it clear to the U.S. Congress
      that it will oppose any federal aid to education bill unless aid to
      parochial schools is included. It is interesting to notice that in Puerto
      Rico, in the summer of 1960, the failure of the Roman Church to get
      legislation giving it the right to conduct classes in religion in the
      public school as well as certain other benefits was the occasion for the
      launching of a new Roman Catholic political party as a direct means to
      achieve those goals. But the new party fared rather badly in the 1960
      election.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign to shift the cost of Roman Catholic schools to the American
      taxpayer has been vigorously pushed, but up until now it has met with only
      minor success. Most Protestant denominations are strongly opposed to the
      use of public funds to aid parochial schools, and it has been particularly
      galling to the Roman hierarchy that it has not been able to put its hands
      into the public treasury in the United States as it is so accustomed to do
      in many other countries. To provide federal aid for parochial schools
      would mean that a nation which is four-fifths non-Catholic would build
      private religious schools for about one seventh of the children who attend
      those schools. But the never-ending campaign for tax money goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court of the United States has quite consistently upheld the
      principle of separation of church and state as set forth in the first
      amendment to the Constitution. Free bus transportation has been permitted,
      but only by a divided opinion, the judges voting five to four to permit
      it. In this connection we think that logic is on the side of Judge Ralph
      M. Holman, in a Circuit Court, in Oregon, who in a suit regarding the
      furnishing of textbooks to parochial schools, ruled against such aid and
      indicated that in his opinion the five Supreme Court justices who voted in
      favor of the constitutionality of parochial school bus appropriations were
      wrong, and that the four who constituted the minority were right. In that
      decision he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anything that assists a religious sect to conduct a separate school where
      all instruction is permeated with religious overtones is an aid to
      religion. The proof in this case is conclusive that the sole purpose in
      maintaining the private school is to promote religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It makes no difference whether books, teachers, equipment,
      transportation, or buildings are furnished, nor does it make any
      difference to whom they are furnished. In truth, all are an integral part
      of the whole which makes up the school and the educational process. You
      cannot logically distinguish one from the other. They constitute the
      elements of an educational process permeated with religious purpose”
      (Church and State, April, 1960).
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be clear to all that a Roman Catholic parochial school is an
      integral part of that church, as definitely so as is the service of
      worship. A parochial school is usually developed in connection with a
      church. In many cases the church and school monies are not even separated.
      Such a school is in no sense a public school, even though some children
      from other groups may be admitted to it. The buildings are not owned and
      controlled by a community of American people, not even by a community of
      American Roman Catholic people. The title of ownership in a public school
      is vested in the local community, in the elected officers of the school
      board or the city council. But the title of ownership in a parochial
      school is vested in the bishop as an individual, who is appointed by, who
      is under the direct control of, and who reports to the pope in Rome.<sup
        >4</sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>4</sup> This paragraph was quoted by justices Douglas, Black, and
      Marshall in a dissenting opinion as the Supreme Court of the United
      States, on June 28, 1971, by the narrow margin of 5 to 4, held
      constitutional the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963, which permits
      within certain limits the granting of federal funds to church-related
      colleges and universities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another contrast is that in the public school the selection of a faculty
      and the administration of the school usually rests with a school board
      which is subject to election and recall by the voters, but in the
      parochial school the selection of a faculty and the administration of the
      school is in the hands of the bishop alone, and usually is administered
      through the local priest. If a faculty member in the public school
      believes that he has been treated unjustly in being disciplined or
      dismissed, he can seek redress through the civil court and he is
      guaranteed a hearing. But if a faculty member in a parochial school is
      disciplined or dismissed he has no recourse whatsoever. The word of the
      bishop or priest is final, even without explanation if he so chooses. The
      taxpayers have a voice in the way their money is used in the public
      school, but the people who support a parochial school have no voice at all
      in such affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument is often made that Roman Catholic parents are the victims of
      double taxation since they pay the regular levy for public schools and
      also the cost of the parochial schools. But it is hardly accurate to call
      this double taxation. They pay the regular levy as does everyone else, and
      they have the privilege of sending their children to the public school.
      There is no discrimination against them. But if instead they choose to use
      the parochial school where the principal course is Roman Catholic polity
      and doctrine, that is their privilege, and they should be willing to pay
      for it. That is entirely a matter between them and their church. If they
      have any protest it should be made to their priest or bishop who orders
      them to build and maintain such a school. The other side of the picture,
      of course, is that if those of us who pay taxes to support the public
      schools are also required to support the Roman Catholic schools, that
      would constitute a double burden on us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, many people who have no children at all, or whose children
      are not ready for school or are past school age, are also required to pay
      the regular levy. And usually they do so gladly as a service to the
      community. If the Roman Catholic objection were valid, then only those
      families who have children in the public school should be required to pay
      the school tax, and they should pay in proportion to the number of
      children they have in school.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use a simple illustration: Suppose the state builds a road. It is paid
      for with state funds. It is open to the public, and anyone may use it. But
      if another group does not like the public road and wants to build their
      own private road parallel to the public road, they may do so. But they
      have no right to expect the rest of us to pay for it. It is their road.
      Let them pay for it or use the public road.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the United States we have “freedom of religion.” In many other nations
      the people do not enjoy this high privilege. But freedom of religion has
      always had a price tag attached to it: Pay the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us have public funds for public causes and private funds for private
      causes, whether it be for roads, schools, libraries, swimming pools, or
      anything else. And let Roman Catholics remember that in their country of
      Spain they do not allow Protestants to have private schools even though
      the latter would gladly pay all the costs.
    </p>
    <p>The Detroit News has commented concerning the school problem:</p>
    <p>
      “All the states decree... that all children shall be educated at public
      expense because an educated citizenry is essential to our form of
      government. ... No one is being taxed for the education of his own
      children; all are being taxed for the education of everyone’s children, to
      everyone’s ultimate benefit. They decree as well that what the community
      pays for on such a vast scale it must control. ... Like it or not, that is
      what our state constitutions provide. No child is a ‘second class
      citizen,’ for no child is barred from these schools.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardinal Spellman recently demanded that federal aid for education be
      extended to parochial as well as public schools, and argued that the
      government would be guilty of “coercion” and “discrimination” if it denied
      federal funds to Catholic schools. This was promptly and effectively
      answered by Glenn L. Archer, who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Actually the government would be guilty of coercion and discrimination if
      it compelled the 140 million non-Catholic people of the United States to
      pay for schools which are maintained primarily to promote the doctrines of
      one church. ... The Catholic people of the United States have been offered
      free access to the schools of all the people without religious
      discrimination. If they choose under the pressure of their bishops to
      decline this invitation, they should not ask the taxpayers to pay the bill
      for their own separation” (The Evening Star, Washington, D. C., January
      19, 1961).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Romanists achieve a breakthrough at the parochial school level, it
      can be confidently expected that that will be followed by demands for
      bigger and better Hill-Burton Hospital Construction Acts, G. I. Bills with
      generous tuition grants to sectarian schools, National Defense Education
      Acts, and, in the not too distant future, sectarian political parties and
      candidates at state and local levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under our American system of separation of church and state, all
      Protestant churches have financed their own projects by voluntary gifts
      from their adherents. The Roman Catholic Church should be willing to do
      the same. It is manifestly unfair for it to claim federal and state
      subsidies for its private projects. If such appropriations were granted,
      then Protestants, in proportion to their numbers, should receive similar
      appropriations, to be used in their church programs as they see fit. But
      Protestants do not want such help, and in most cases do not take it even
      if it is available. They are opposed on principle to government support
      for any denomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      On repeated occasions in recent years programs providing for federal aid
      to education have been blocked by Roman Catholic spokesmen because
      parochial schools were not included. Whether federal aid to education is
      in itself a wise or an unwise policy we do not here attempt to say,
      although we think that as a general rule educational problems can be
      handled more economically and more efficiently by local communities or at
      most with state aid. But in any event the fact of the matter is that
      throughout the nation more than half of all Roman Catholic children attend
      public schools. Roman Catholics are represented on school boards, often
      out of proportion to their numbers in the community. And the percentage of
      Roman Catholic teachers in public schools often is in excess of their
      proportion in the community. So they are benefiting quite materially from
      our public school system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument that the parochial school saves the community money is also
      largely false. In the first place, the community does not ask the Roman
      Church to aid in this matter. Secondly, the Roman Church develops such
      schools, not as an aid to the community, not to teach American principles
      of citizenship, but strictly to serve its own purpose. And thirdly, many
      people would rather pay the tax to provide an adequate and unprejudiced
      education for all of the young people than to experience the divisions and
      rivalries that almost invariably result from such schools. Usually they
      feel that the Roman Church is doing the community a disservice in
      restricting the children to the kind of training that they receive in the
      parochial schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something is to be learned by observing the school situation in Britain,
      which is quite different from that in the United States. The British
      government has agreed to provide up to 75 percent of the funds needed for
      the building and maintenance of Anglican and Roman Catholic schools, and
      up to 95 percent of certain other school expenses. But even so the
      hierarchy is not satisfied. It is demanding complete financial equality
      with the public schools. In France, under President De Gaulle, a Roman
      Catholic, the Roman hierarchy, early in 1960, precipitated a governmental
      crisis by demanding full school aid without governmental supervision, and
      with De Gaulle’s assistance received most of what it asked for. The ideal
      toward which the Roman Church strives is found in Spain where, under a
      concordat with the Vatican, the schools are financed by the government
      while the Roman Church supervises the curriculum, selects the teachers,
      and directs the administration of the schools. Protestant schools are
      prohibited. Why should anyone believe that the Roman Catholic Church in
      the United States would be satisfied with anything less?
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting light is thrown on this problem of state and federal aid to
      parochial schools in a recent issue of Church and State magazine. Under
      the title, Do They Need The Money?, we read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The spectacle of the hierarchy of the mighty Roman Catholic Church
      pleading poverty is one to give us pause. This church is, by its own
      admission, the largest and wealthiest of all Christian bodies. It is
      literally richer than Croesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Roman Church has assets so vast that it has never dared to make a
      public report of them. This is the organization which now comes pleading
      that it must have Federal grants or credit if it is to carry on. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “The credit rating of the Buffalo diocese provides financial information
      about the Roman Church that is rarely disclosed. The Church’s assets in
      this one diocese alone are placed at $236,000,000. Its average gross
      income is $24 1/2 million. Taking the Buffalo membership of 860,000 in
      ratio with the claimed total American membership of 40 million, a total
      wealth close to 11 billion is indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When one adds to this the income producing potential of the 40 million
      contributors of Roman Catholic faith, we are confronted with a financial
      power that can be discussed in the same breath with the United States
      government itself. This is the organization which claims to stand in
      desperate need of government aid. ... Why does the hierarchy insist on
      Federal aid to its denominational schools? We think we know the reason.
      And that reason is not financial” (May, 1961).
    </p>
    <p>
      A more recent and exhaustive study of the finances of American churches is
      The Churches: Their Riches, Revenues, and Immunities , by Martin A. Larson
      and C. Stanley Lowell (301 pages; 1969. Robert B. Luce, Inc., Washington,
      D.C.). The wealthiest church by far is the Roman Catholic, with assets,
      largely hidden, approximately as follows: Stocks, Bonds, Investment Real
      Estate, $13 billion; Business Property, $12 billion; Personal Property,
      $900 million; Religiously used real estate, $54 billion; total, about $80
      billion. Much of that is held by the various orders, which number 521.
      Annual Estimated Income is: Contributions, $5 billion; Business, $1
      billion 200 million; Dividends, Interest, $650 million; Wills, Community
      Chest Funds, Bingo, etc., $1 billion 500 million; total, over $8
      billion—largely immune from income tax. To that must be added a
      bewildering series of government projects funded in part through the
      churches and which in effect are subsidies, such as the Hill-Burton
      Hospital Act, Higher Education Facilities Act, Vocational Education Act,
      Economic Opportunities Act, Research Programs, Distribution of Foreign
      Aid, and many others—total, over $4 billion.
    </p>
    <p>
      What vast holdings and reserves those are, particularly when the spiritual
      and material needs of so many even of their own Roman Catholic people in
      many parts of the world are so great! Their expenses for parochial schools
      have scarcely touched that reservoir of wealth. Some Protestant churches
      also have wealth beyond their needs. But most evangelical churches
      maintain a fairly close balance between income and expenses, and many are
      seriously handicapped by lack of funds.

    <h2>Education in Romanist Dominated Countries</h2>
    <p>
      It is not by accident that the people in countries that have been
      dominated by Roman Catholicism for centuries have an abnormally high
      percentage of illiteracy. Some 50 percent of the Portuguese cannot read or
      write. Spain, which is the most Roman Catholic nation in Europe, is also
      the most backward and has the lowest standard of living of any nation in
      Europe. In Italy illiteracy is high, and Roman Catholic domination of
      education has been so oppressive that it has been almost impossible to
      establish even a primary school apart from the Roman Church. In Mexico,
      Central and South America, where the Roman Church has been dominant and
      practically without religious competition for four hundred years, the
      illiteracy rate until very recently was from 30 to 60 percent and in some
      places as high as 70 percent. Brazil, for instance, with 58 million people
      has more than 30 million who are illiterate. Only 42 percent of the people
      of Colombia, according to a government survey, can read and write, and
      most of those have not had schooling beyond the fourth grade. In Canada
      the Roman Catholic province of Quebec has lagged far behind the other
      provinces in education. Even primary education was not compulsory in
      Quebec until 1943. A program is now under way to remedy the lamentable
      conditions that were exposed by Life magazine in the issue of October 19,
      1942. Throughout these countries we see the practice, so typical of all
      Roman Catholic countries, of gathering large sums of money for the
      building of magnificent cathedrals to overawe the people and for the
      enrichment of the priesthood, while leaving the people in indescribable
      ignorance and poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the centuries the Roman Catholic Church has found that illiterate
      and superstitious people are much more obedient to her rule, and until she
      was forced by Protestant competition to make a change, her deliberate
      policy seems to have been designed to keep them in that condition. But
      thanks to the mission work that has been carried on in Latin America and
      to the generally enlightening influences that have come from the
      Protestant nations, the illiteracy rate in that area is now decreasing.
      Nevertheless the record of the Roman Church in Latin America remains one
      of miserable and undeniable failure so far as the general enlightenment of
      the people is concerned, and Rome must take full responsibility for that
      condition. Many of her leading men in the governing classes and many of
      her priests have been distinguished for learning and logical skill, for
      “knowledge is power.” But she has not entrusted that knowledge to the
      masses of her followers. Instead, she has reserved it for her office
      holders that they might use it to her advantage. It is important to keep
      in mind that the Roman Catholic Church the world over is one solid,
      monolithic organization, all closely knit and under the absolute power of
      the pope in Rome, and that the same pope who appoints all of the cardinals
      and bishops in the United States also appoints all of the cardinals and
      bishops in Latin America, and that the church, working through the
      hierarchy in Rome, has perfect freedom to send men and money and to
      promote or to refrain from promoting schools in any area under its
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Protestant countries the Roman Church has been driven, partly by shame
      and partly by a spirit of rivalry, to follow quite a different policy from
      that in Latin America. In the United States, which already possessed the
      most efficient system of universal education to be found anywhere in the
      world and where we might suppose that a parochial system was least needed,
      the Roman Church has been prompted to engage in extensive educational
      work. Much the same policy has been followed in Britain. In these
      countries her people cannot be kept in darkness, and she is forced to
      minister to them or lose them. In these countries her people are demanding
      high schools and colleges, and she is giving them what she does not give
      her people in Spain or Italy or Latin America.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the United States she has established hundreds of hospitals, colleges,
      and various special institutions such as Dismas House in St. Louis, and
      Boys Town in Nebraska (built to a considerable extent with money solicited
      indiscriminately from Protestants). But we do not find comparable
      institutions in the typical Roman Catholic countries. Hence we must to a
      considerable extent label these “showcase religion,” designed to meet
      Prot¬ estant competition.
    </p>
    <p>
      To discover what a system really is, what its true fruits are, we must
      look at countries where it is fully established and where it has been in
      operation for long periods of time. And when we apply that test to the
      Roman system we find the invariable products— ignorance, superstition,
      poverty, and immorality.

    <h2>The Christian School</h2>
    <p>
      Many Christian people are disturbed because the Bible cannot be read and
      Christianity cannot be taught in the public schools, and because in many
      instances the texts used present an anti-Christian viewpoint. This
      condition in the schools represents a radical departure from that which
      prevailed in the early days of our country and which in fact was common
      until comparatively recent times. The state, however, is a secular
      institution, and in a free society such as ours in which church and state
      are separate, the state cannot promote any particular religion in its tax
      supported and politically controlled schools. Hence it follows that
      whenever the government undertakes to provide education, whether at the
      local, state, or national level, it tends to secularize the schools. The
      result is that today most of the schools tend to ignore the subject of
      religion with many of them assuming a completely secular attitude, as if
      God did not exist, while others are actually irreligious, teaching an
      evolutionary philosophy in a man-centered world.

      One of the privileges enjoyed by the people of the United States is that
      of establishing and operating private or parochial schools if they so
      wish. This right has been affirmed by the United States Supreme Court.
      While we strongly disapprove of the parochial school as conducted by the
      Roman Catholic Church, there is another type of school designed to provide
      a Christian atmosphere and course of instruction of which we approve most
      heartily. This is generally known as the “Christian School.” It is
      supported and controlled not by a church or by a group of churches, but by
      an organization of Christian parents in the local community. It is usually
      interdenominational in nature, designed to serve the children of all of
      the evangelical churches in the community and such others as are given
      permission to attend. Since no church has any official connection with the
      project no compulsion is put upon any families in those churches to send
      their children to the Christian school if they prefer the public school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first schools in America were private, usually in the homes or in the
      churches. Often they were organized and taught by the local minister as a
      service to the community. The Bible was the most important book studied,
      sometimes almost the only book. As it came to be realized how valuable
      such training was, the local communities, and later the states, took over
      the work, broadened the course of study, and in time such education was
      made universal and compulsory.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that Christian training is the most important thing in a
      child’s life. Responsibility for such training rests first of all upon the
      parents in the home. Early in the Old Testament the command was given that
      there should be oral teaching of the Scriptures in the home by the
      parents: “And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon
      thy heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and
      shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest
      by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up”
      (Deuteronomy 6:6-7). The command is that the home shall be literally
      saturated with the Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But because many parents are so poorly equipped to give that training,
      perhaps never having had it themselves, it is a very great blessing if it
      can be given in the schools. The ideal situation would be a Christian
      state in which true Bible teaching could be given as a part of the regular
      school course. But that condition does not now prevail, and it cannot be
      realized in the foreseeable future.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we insist that there must be separation of church and state, that
      does not mean that we acknowledge any area of life in which Christianity
      should not play a dominant role. It only means that it is better that
      neither the government nor the schools should be dominated by any religion
      than that they should be dominated by a false religion, better that they
      not aid any religion than that they aid a false religion. Due to the fact
      that in the United States most communities are composed of Protestants,
      Roman Catholics, Jews, and other minority groups, in order not to offend
      any the public schools are forbidden by law to give any type of religious
      training.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not enough merely to educate children in the arts and sciences.
      They must also be trained in things relating to the spirit if they are to
      fulfill their true mission in life. To leave religion out of the
      curriculum is to omit the most important subject, and tends to give
      students the impression that religion is of little value or importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to meet this need various plans have been suggested. One is that
      in the public schools a certain number of Scripture verses be read each
      day without comment, followed perhaps by the Lord’s prayer or some other
      suitable prayer. But such teaching can only be most elementary. And a
      further difficulty arises as to which version of the Bible should be used,
      and to whom or in whose name the prayer should be offered. Another plan
      that has met with fairly wide support is that of “released time,” in which
      perhaps once each week the children are excused for a part of the school
      period in order to attend Christian training classes usually held in their
      own churches. The Supreme Court, in a case brought before it in 1952, gave
      the legal “go ahead” to released time religious classes, provided they are
      not held on school property. In accordance with that ruling approximately
      4,000,000 children of all faiths are released from the public schools each
      week to attend such classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter plan, however, still leaves much to be desired, particularly
      if other courses in the school are taught from a non-Christian or
      anti-Christian viewpoint. Much the best plan, we believe, is that of the
      Protestant Christian school. For that purpose an organization of Christian
      parents builds or leases its own buildings, hires its own teachers,
      teaches in general the same courses and seeks to meet the same academic
      standards as does the public school. Such schools may include only the
      grades, or the high school, or both. All courses are taught from the
      Christian viewpoint. And in addition they also have courses in Bible
      study, in which the Bible is presented as the inspired and authoritative
      Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the question naturally arises: Can the “private” school survive? The
      answer is: Yes, it can, if the people of a community are genuinely
      interested in its success. In numerous communities such schools are
      proving remarkably successful. The Christian Reformed Church, with
      headquarters in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has done much to promote this type
      of school. We need only point out that for long ages it was generally
      thought that the churches in the various countries could not survive if
      they were cut off from state funds. But in those nations in which they
      have been “dis-established” they have gained new vitality and perspective
      and have prospered much more than where they still are dependent on state
      aid. In like manner Christian schools can be productive of true
      scholarship and can develop with more freedom and originality if Christian
      people take their work seriously. R. J. Rushdoony, who has made a special
      study of this problem, points out that, “The school society, as a
      voluntary organization, operates on a radically more economical basis than
      the public school in building, operational, administrative, and
      maintenance costs. On this basis it can still produce superior results”
      (Intellectual Schizophrenia , p. 24; The Presbyterian and Reformed
      Publishing Co., Philadelphia, 1961).
    </p>
    <p>
      The hundreds of Protestant colleges with their splendid buildings and
      large endowment funds show what Protestant people can do when they set
      their minds to it. Such schools have rendered a most valuable service over
      the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are valid reasons for establishing Christian schools at the
      elementary and high school levels. First of all there is the teaching of
      Christian truth and the building of Christian character. That, of course,
      can be done much more effectively in schools in which the Bible is honored
      rather than in those in which it is ignored or even attacked and
      ridiculed. In the second place a dedicated Christian faculty leaves an
      indelible impression on the lives and characters of the students who
      attend such schools. And in the third place fellowship with other students
      whose background and purpose in life is Christian does much to inspire
      students to better ways of living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ministers and laymen usually find a place in such schools as principals,
      teachers, and members of the school boards. Many teachers prefer the
      atmosphere of the Christian school to that of the public school. And the
      evangelical churches of a community usually give moral and sometimes
      financial support, although as churches they have no control over the
      schools. But if we demand federal or state aid merely to compensate for
      our own lack of conviction, such schools probably will not manifest much
      Christian zeal. Let no man be compelled to pay for another man’s religion.
      That only arouses resentment, and it cannot accomplish any lasting good.
      Certainly the world will never take seriously our professed concern for
      Christian education if our Christian schools have to be maintained at
      public expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be emphasized that the Christian school is not designed to
      operate as a rival of the public school but rather to cooperate with it in
      a friendly way for the benefit of the entire community. It was never the
      wish of the Protestant churches that Bible reading and Christian training
      should be excluded from the public school. But the fact must be faced that
      that condition now exists, and that remedial measures are needed. We
      insist that the public school with its secular viewpoint must not claim
      the right to teach every child under all conditions, nor the exclusive
      right to teach any child—that education is primarily the responsibility of
      the parents, and that the parents may provide that education privately if
      they wish.
