    <h2>Rome’s Teaching concerning Purgatory</h2>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic Church has developed a doctrine in which it is held
      that all who die at peace with the church, but who are not perfect, must
      undergo penal and purifying suffering in an intermediate realm known as
      purgatory. Only those believers who have attained a state of Christian
      perfection go immediately to heaven. All unbaptized adults and those who
      after baptism have committed mortal sin go immediately to hell. The great
      mass of partially sanctified Christians dying in fellowship with the
      church, but who nevertheless are encumbered with some degree of sin, go to
      purgatory where, for a longer or shorter time, they suffer until all sin
      is purged away, after which they are translated to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Church holds that baptism removes all previous guilt, both
      original and actual, so that if a person were to die immediately after
      baptism he would go directly to heaven. All other believers, except the
      Christian martyrs but including even the highest clergy, must go to
      purgatory to pay the penalty for sins committed after baptism. The
      sacrifices made by the martyrs, particularly those that reflect honor upon
      the church, are considered adequate substitutes for the purgatorial
      sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of purgatory is not based on the Bible, but on a distinction
      which Rome makes by dividing sin into two kinds. This distinction is
      clearly set forth by Dr. Zacchello, who says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “According to Roman teaching a person can commit two kinds of sin against
      God: mortal and venial. By mortal sin is meant a grave offense against the
      law of God or of the church. It is called ‘mortal’ because it kills the
      soul by depriving it entirely of sanctifying grace. Venial sin is a small
      and pardonable offense against God and the laws of the church. Then, this
      confusing and unscriptural doctrine continues: Two ki nds of punishment
      are due to mortal sin, eternal (in hell forever), and temporal (in
      purgatory). Eternal punishment is cancelled by the sacraments of baptism
      and penance or by an act of perfect contrition with promise of confession.
      Temporal punishment is not cancelled by these sacraments, but by works of
      penance, by almsgiving, by paying the priest to say mass, by indulgences,
      etc., which reduce the temporal punishment for mortal sins that would have
      to be suffered in purgatory. Thus even if all mortal sins of a Roman
      Catholic are forgiven in confession by a priest, and he does not perform
      enough of these ‘good works,’ he will go to purgatory and remain there in
      torture until his soul is completely purified” (Secrets of Romanism, p.
      101).
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of purgatory rests on the assumption that while God forgives
      sin, His justice nevertheless demands that the sinner must suffer the full
      punishment due to him for his sin before he will be allowed to enter
      heaven. But such a distinction is illogical even according to human
      reasoning. For it manifestly would be unjust to forgive a criminal the
      guilt of his crime and still send him to prison to suffer for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic people are taught that the souls of their relatives and
      friends in purgatory suffer great torment in the flames, that they are
      unable to help themselves, that not even God can help them until His
      justice has been satisfied, and that only their friends on earth can
      shorten or alleviate that suffering. Purgatory is supposed to be under the
      special jurisdiction of the pope, and it is his prerogative as the
      representative of Christ on earth to grant indulgences (i.e., relief from
      suffering) as he sees fit. This power, it is claimed, can be exercised
      directly by the pope to alleviate, shorten, or terminate the sufferings,
      and within limits it is also exercised by the priests as representatives
      of the pope. It is, of course, impossible but that power of this kind
      could be abused even in the hands of the best of men. Vested in the hands
      of ordinary men, as generally must be the case, or in the hands of
      mercenary and wicked men as too often has happened, the abuses are bound
      to be appalling. The evils that have flowed from this doctrine, and which
      are its inevitable consequences, make it abundantly cannot that it cannot
      be of divine origin.

    <h2>The Terrifying Aspect of Purgatory</h2>
    <p>
      Since none but actual saints escape the pains of purgatory, this doctrine
      gives to the death and funeral of the Roman Catholic a dreadful and
      repellent aspect. Under the shadow of such a doctrine, death is not, as in
      evangelical Protestantism, the coming of Christ for His loved one, but the
      ushering of the shrinking soul into a place of unspeakable torture. It is
      no wonder that millions of people bom in the Roman Catholic Church,
      knowing practically nothing about the Bible but believing implicitly in
      the doctrines of their church, should live and die in fear of death, in
      fear of spending an unknown number of years in the pain and anguish of
      that place called purgatory. How tragic that these people live in fear and
      servitude to the priests, who they are taught to believe hold in their
      hands the power of life and death, when all the time Christ has paid for
      their redemption in full. Even their own Roman Catholic Bible says:
      “Wherefore because children have blood and flesh in common, so he in like
      manner has shared in these; that through death he might destroy him who
      had the empire of death, that is, the devil; and might deliver them, who
      throughout their life were kept in servitude by the fear of death”
      (Hebrews 2:14-15, Confraternity Version). These words, “Kept in servitude
      by the fear of death,” describe the spiritual state of even devout Roman
      Catholics. All their lives they are kept in bondage through fear of this
      imaginary purgatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sufferings in purgatory are said to vary greatly in intensity and
      duration, being proportioned to the guilt and impurity or impenitence of
      the sufferer. They are described as being in some cases comparatively
      light and mild, lasting perhaps only a few hours, while in others little
      if anything short of the torments of hell itself and lasting for thousands
      of years. They differ from the pains of hell at least to this extent, that
      there is eventually an end to the sufferings in purgatory, but not to
      those in hell. They are in any event to end with the last judgment. Hence
      purgatory eventually is to be emptied of all its victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the intensity of the suffering, Bellarmine, a noted Roman
      Catholic theologian, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The pains of purgatory are very severe, surpassing anything endured in
      this life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Manual of the Purgatorial Society, with the imprimatur of Cardinal
      Hayes, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “According to the Holy Fathers of the Church, the fire of purgatory does
      not differ from the fire of hell, except in point of duration. ‘It is the
      same fire,’ says St. Thomas Aquinas, ‘that torments the reprobate in hell,
      and the just in purgatory. The least pain in purgatory,’ he says,
      ‘surpasses the greatest suffering in this life.’ Nothing but the eternal
      duration makes the fire of hell more terrible than that of purgatory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And in another book with the imprimatur of archbishop Spellman (now
      cardinal), Bellarmine is quoted as saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is absolutely no doubt that the pains of purgatory in some cases
      endure for entire centuries” (John M. Haffert, Saturday in Purgatory).
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that the Church of Rome has rather wisely refrained from making
      any official pronouncement concerning the nature and intensity of
      purgatorial suffering. Books and discourses intended for Protestant
      readers or hearers speak of it only in the mildest terms. But the Roman
      Church does not thereby escape responsibility, for it has always allowed
      free circulation, with its expressed or implied sanction, of books
      containing the most frightening descriptions, ranging all the way from
      comparatively mild disciplinary measures to a burning lake of billowing
      flames in which the souls of the impenitent are submerged. Among their own
      people and in the hands of the priests the doctrine of purgatory has been
      an instrument of terrifying power. We are reminded of the remark of
      Charles Hodge in this connection: “The feet of the tiger with its claws
      withdrawn are as soft as velvet; but when those claws are extended, they
      are fearful instruments of laceration and death.”
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, as Dr. Augustus H. Strong has appropriately said:</p>
    <p>
      “Suffering has in itself no reforming power. Unless accompanied by special
      renewing influences of the Holy Spirit, it only hardens and embitters the
      soul. We have no Scriptural evidence that such influences of the Spirit
      are exerted after death, upon the still impenitent; but abundant evidence
      on the contrary, that the moral condition in which death finds men is
      their condition forever. ... To the impenitent and rebellious sinner the
      motive must come, not from within, but from without. Such motives God
      presents by His Spirit in this life; and when this life ends and God’s
      Spirit is withdrawn, no motive to repentance will be presented. The soul’s
      dislike for God (we may even say, the sinner’s hatred for God) will issue
      only in complaint and resistance” (Systematic Theology , p. 1041).
    </p>
    <p>
      We ask: How can spirits suffer the pains of material fire in purgatory
      before they have resurrection bodies? In answer to this question the Roman
      theologians have invented a theory that in purgatory the soul takes on a
      different kind of body—the nature of which they do not define—in which the
      suffering can be felt. But that is like the doctrine of purgatory itself,
      a purely fictitious assumption without any Scripture proof whatever, and
      in fact contrary to Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman Catholicism is often described as a religion of fear. The doctrine
      of purgatory is where much of that fear centers—fear of the priest, fear
      of the confessional, of the consequences of missing mass, of the
      discipline of penance, of death of purgatory, and of the righteous
      judgment of an angry God. L. H. Lehmann tells us concerning his boyhood in
      Ireland:
    </p>
    <p>
      “A sense of constant fear overshadowed everything. Ingrained fear is, in
      fact, the predominant note running through the life of all children born
      and reared in Catholic Ireland. Few ever get rid of it completely in after
      life, even in America. That fear concerns everything in this life on
      earth, and still more terrible is the fear of the terrors in the life
      beyond the grave” (The Soul of a Priest, p. 34).

    <h2>The Money Motive in the Doctrine of Purgatory</h2>
    <p>
      It is safe to say that no other doctrine of the Church of Rome, unless it
      be that of auricular confession, has done so much to pervert the Gospel or
      to enslave the people to the priesthood as has the doctrine of purgatory.
      A mere reference to the days of Tetzel, Luther, and the Protestant
      Reformation, not to mention present day conditions in the Roman Catholic
      countries in Southern Europe and Latin America where that church has had
      undisputed ecclesiastical control for centuries, is sufficient to
      illustrate this point. Every year millions of dollars are paid to obtain
      relief from this imagined suffering. No exact figures are available. In
      contrast with the custom in Protestant churches, in which itemized
      financial statements of income and expenses are issued each year, Roman
      Catholic finances are kept secret, no kind of budget or balance sheet ever
      being published which would show where their money comes from, how much it
      amounts to, how much is sent to Rome, how or where the remainder is spent.
      In this as in other things, the people must trust their church implicitly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of purgatory has sometimes been referred to as “the gold mine
      of the priesthood” since it is the source of such lucrative income. The
      Roman Church might well say, “By this craft we have our wealth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In general it is held that the period of suffering in purgatory can be
      shortened by gifts of money, prayers by the priest, and masses, which
      gifts, prayers, and masses can be provided by the person before death or
      by relatives and friends after death. The more satisfaction one makes
      while living, the less remains to be atoned for in purgatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of death the priest is summoned to the bed of the dying
      person. He administers extreme unction, and solemnly pronounces
      absolution. Yet after death occurs, money is extracted from the mourning
      relatives and friends to pay for masses to be said in order to shorten the
      period of torment in purgatory. The result, particularly among ignorant
      and uneducated people, has been that the Roman Church sells salvation for
      money, not outwardly and directly, but nevertheless in reality. All
      understand that the service of the church in securing the salvation of a
      soul in purgatory is to be rewarded with appropriate gifts or services. It
      has well been said that the Roman Church is a huge money-gathering
      institution, and that everything in Rome has a price tag on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is due in no small measure to this doctrine of purgatory that the Roman
      Catholic Church has been able to amass large sums of money and to build
      magnificent cathedrals, monasteries, and convents, even in regions where
      the people are poor. This has been particularly true in the Latin American
      countries. It is a common experience in Mexico, for instance, to find in
      almost every town an impressive Roman Catholic church surrounded by the
      miserable huts of the natives. The practical outworking of the system has
      been seen in several countries, e.g., France, England, Italy, Austria,
      Mexico and others when a disproportionately large amount of property fell
      into the hands of the Roman Catholic Church, sometimes as much as a fourth
      or a third of all the property of the nation, and had to be confiscated
      and redistributed by the government in order to redress the economic
      situation. There is literally no limit to the amount of property that the
      Roman Church seeks for itself if it is not restrained. Those who
      contribute money for masses, particularly those who at the urging of the
      priests leave substantial portions of their estates to the Roman Church so
      that future masses can be said for them, are helping to keep in being a
      lucrative and detestable system which did not become a regular practice in
      the church until centuries after the time of Christ and which is a
      disgrace to Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point another question arises. If the pope, or the priest acting
      for him, really has the power to shorten or modify or terminate the
      suffering of souls in purgatory, why does he not, if he is a good man,
      render that service freely and willingly as a Christian service to
      humanity? In the hospitals the doctors and nurses try in every possible
      way to relieve the pain and misery of those who come to them. Why does the
      pope, or the priest, keep those poor souls suffering horrible pain in the
      fire if at any time he can pay all their debt out of his rich treasury of
      the merits of the saints? Why? Does Romanism have an answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      If any one of us actually had the power to release souls from purgatory
      and refused to exercise that power except in return for a payment of
      money, he would be considered cruel and unchristian—which indeed he would
      be. By all Christian standards that is a service that the church should
      render freely and willingly to its people. No decent man would permit even
      a dog to suffer in the fire until its owner paid him five dollars to take
      it out. The insistence on a money transaction before a soul can be
      released, and sometimes money transactions over long periods of time,
      shows clearly the sinister purpose for which the doctrine of purgatory is
      invented. The simple fact is that if purgatory were emptied and all those
      suffering souls admitted to heaven, there would be little incentive left
      for the people to pay money to the priests. The doctrine of purgatory is a
      horribly cruel doctrine in that the priests, all of whom in the United
      States at least, are educated, intelligent men, know how flimsy or how
      utterly lacking is all actual evidence for such a place. Under the
      pretense of delivering souls from that suffering, large sums of money are
      wrung from the bereaved at a time when hearts are sore and when they are
      least able to think logically about such matters. Says Stephen L. Testa:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Purgatory has been called ‘a gigantic fraud,’ and ‘a colossal racket’;
      for it deprives the poor of their last pennies and extorts large funds
      from the rich in exchange for nothing. During the Middle Ages the rich
      rivaled each other in leaving their estates to the Church, and the poor
      gave out of their poverty till the Church became the richest landowner in
      every country. In several countries the Church owned one half of the land
      and one third of all the invested funds. It built great cathedrals and
      bishops’ palaces and left the poor to live in huts and shanties. You can
      see even today in Europe and in Mexico great massive cathedrals surrounded
      by the hovels of the poor who grovel in misery, ignorance, and
      wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But many of those Catholic nations during the last century had their wars
      of independence, beginning with the French Revolution, and the Church was
      deprived of its temporal power and the landed properties were seized by
      the State and partitioned among the poor farmers. In Italy this happened
      in 1870. But Mussolini restored the temporal power of the pope (in name
      only) in 1929. However, the church is not the rich land owner that it once
      was. The spirit of liberty and democracy is fatal to the autocracy and
      totalitarianism of the Roman Church” (booklet, The Truth About Catholics,
      Protestants, and Jews , p. 14).
    </p>
    <p>And Dr. Robert Ketcham asks:</p>
    <p>
      “How do you know, Mr. Priest, when to stop praying and taking money from
      your parishioners for a given case? How do you know when John Murphy is
      out of purgatory? His getting out is dependent upon the saying of masses
      paid for by his bereaved ones. If you stop one or two masses too soon,
      what then? If you keep on saying masses for the fellow after he is out,
      that is bad. It is bad either way you come at it. I ask seriously, Sir,
      Mr. Roman Catholic Priest, How do you know when to stop saying masses for
      a given individual? Do you have some ki nd of a connection with the unseen
      world?” (booklet, Let Rome Speak for Herself, p. 20).
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that Roman Catholic priests admit that they have no way of
      knowing when a soul is released from purgatory. One former layman from
      that church writing on this subject says that it was the priests’ abuse of
      this doctrine that finally turned him against Roman Catholicism. He tells
      of an incident that occurred 45 years after the death of a man in his
      congregation when the then officiating priest again asked the widow for
      money that he might say mass for her husband. A succession of priests in
      turn had taken money from that widow, always on the pretense of getting
      her husband out of purgatory. But they had never gotten him out. And
      there, 45 years later, they were still extracting money on that fraudulent
      claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      We charge in the strongest terms that the practice of saying mass for
      souls in purgatory is a gigantic hoax and fraud, a taking of money under
      false pretenses, because it purports to get people out of purgatory when
      actually no such place exists. We would not trust a judge who manipulated
      the law to make himself rich, nor would we trust a policeman who asked for
      a bribe. Why, then, should we trust a priest who presents an
      interpretation concerning the afterlife which is not only not in the Bible
      but which is contrary to the clear teaching of the Bible? Such practice is
      fraudulent and is designed primarily for only one purpose, that of keeping
      the people under the power of the priests and controlling their lives and
      property as far as possible.

    <h2>Scripture Teaching</h2>
    <p>
      That the doctrine of purgatory is unscriptural can be shown easily. The
      Bible says nothing about any such place, and in fact the most devastating
      arguments against purgatory come from those inspired pages. Christ made
      not even so much as a passing allusion to purgatory. Instead He said: “He
      that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life,
      and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life”
      (John 5:24). Hence eternal life is already possessed by the soul that
      believes on Christ, and there can be no possible condemnation of that
      soul. When Jesus said to the penitent thief on the cross, “Today shalt
      thou be with me in Paradise” (Luke 23:43), the clear inference was that at
      his death he would go immediately to heaven. Christ’s words, “It is
      finished” (John 19:30), spoken at the end of His suffering on the Cross,
      mean that the work of redemption which He came to perform has
      accomplished, finished, not partially, but completely. Furthermore, there
      is no transfer from one realm to another after death. Those who go to the
      place of outer darkness cannot cross from that sphere to the other:
      “Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass
      from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from
      thence to us” (Luke 16:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apostle John teaches the same: ‘“The blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth
      us from all sin. ... If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous
      to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1
      John 1:7,9). Hence our sins, all of them, are forgiven through the
      sacrifice of Christ, and none are left to be purged away by human merit.
      And again: “And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the
      dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they
      may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them” (Revelation
      14:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul’s teaching on this subject is quite full. He anticipated no
      purgatory, but said that to depart was to “be with Christ,” and that it
      would be “very far better” (Philippians 1:23). While we are “at home in
      the body,” we are “absent from the Lord”; but to be “absent from the body”
      is to be “at home with the Lord” (2 Corinthians 5:8). To the Philippians
      he wrote: “For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain” (1:21). In answer
      to the question, “What must I do to be saved?” he gives the
      straightforward and unqualified answer: “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and
      thou shalt be saved” (Acts 16:31)—no reference there to confession to a
      priest, penance, purgatory, or any other thing such as a religion of works
      attaches. Those who put their trust in Christ’s atoning death do not come
      into judgment: “There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in
      Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, the alleged founder of Romanism, declared: “Christ also suffered
      for sins once , the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us
      to God” (1 Peter 3:18). Hence we cannot be made to suffer for that sin a
      second time. And the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews says that God
      not only forgives, but pledges Himself never to bring our sins to His
      remembrance: “And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more”
      (10:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast there is between these words of Scripture concerning the
      state of the righteous immediately after death, and that teaching which
      would have us believe that the sufferings of purgatory must be endured
      indefinitely, perhaps even for years! The Roman Church knows, of course,
      that this doctrine of purgatory, which is of such great importance to it,
      is not in the Bible. And that undoubtedly is one of the reasons that
      through the ages it has kept the Bible from the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purgatory is, therefore, a travesty on the justice of God. God’s justice
      has been fully satisfied once and for all by the sacrifice of Christ, and
      God cannot exact double punishment, once from Christ, and again from those
      for whom He died. Hence the redeemed soul goes not to any midway station
      between earth and heaven, but directly to heaven; and the sacrifice on
      Calvary was sufficient to “purge” all our sins without the need of any
      "purgatory."
    </p>
    <p>
      A Roman Catholic cannot approach his deathbed and the certain prospect of
      the interminable fires of purgatory with anything other than fear and
      dread. For as he is true to the doctrines of his church he can see only
      great fires beyond. It is difficult to conceive of a belief so groundless
      and yet so frightening as that of the doctrine of purgatory. But what a
      marvelous, glorious thing it is at death to go straight to heaven! And
      what good news it is for Roman Catholics when they leam that there is no
      such place as purgatory, no suffering for the redeemed soul beyond the
      grave!
    </p>
    <p>
      Where, then, does Rome find her authority for the doctrine of purgatory?
      Four Scripture verses are cited, but not one of them has any real bearing
      on the subject. They are (Confraternity Version): “He will baptize you
      with the Holy Spirit and with fire” (the words of John the Baptist
      concerning Christ) (Matthew 3:11); “If his work bums, he will lose his
      reward, but himself will be saved, yet so as through fire” (1 Corinthians
      3:15); “And some, who are judged, reprove; and others, save, snatching
      them from the fire” (Jude 1:22-23); and “Christ... [who] was brought to
      life in the spirit, in which also he went and preached to those spirits
      that were in prison. These in times past had been disobedient when the
      patience of God waited in the days of Noe while the ark was building. In
      that ark a few, that is, eight souls were saved through water” (1 Peter
      3:18-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      None of these verses mentions purgatory, nor gives any real ground for
      believing that such a place exists. 1 Peter 3:18-20 at first seems more
      plausible. But on closer examination these verses simply tell us that the
      Spirit through which Christ “was brought to life” (in the resurrection),
      which we believe refers to the Holy Spirit, was the same Spirit in which
      He preached to the people in Noah’s day. The preaching referred to by
      Peter was long since past. It occurred while the ark was in process of
      construction, and the tragic thing about it is that only eight souls
      responded to that preaching. Those eight, and only those, were saved
      through water. Those who refused the testimony of the Spirit of Christ as
      He spoke through Noah were “those spirits that were in prison” (the
      American Standard Version translates more accurately: “the spirits in
      prison”), that is, in the prison house of sin, or in hell, at the time
      Peter wrote. And they still are imprisoned. These verses are, in brief, a
      warning against disobedience to God and rejection of the Gospel, but they
      have no bearing on the doctrine of purgatory. Thus the four passages cited
      by Roman Catholics surely are a very light cord on which to hang so heavy
      a weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rome bases her doctrine of purgatory primarily on a passage in
      Maccabees, which is a Jewish book written after the close of the Old
      Testament. It is, of course, an apocryphal writing, and is not
      acknowledged by Protestants as having any authority. In order to show how
      flimsy this evidence is we quote this passage in full:
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the day following Judas (Maccabeus) came with his company, to take
      away the bodies of them that had been slain, and to bury them with their
      kinsmen, in the sepulchres of their fathers. And they found under the
      coats of the slain some of the donaries of the idols of Jamnia, which the
      law forbiddeth to the Jews: so that all plainly saw, that for this cause
      they were slain. Then they all blessed the just judgment of the Lord, who
      had discovered the things that were hidden. And so betaking themselves to
      prayers, they besought him, that the sin which had been committed might be
      forgiven. But the most valiant Judas exhorted the people to keep
      themselves from sin, forasmuch as they saw before their eyes what had
      happened, because of the sins of those that were slain. And making a great
      gathering, he sent twelve thousand drachmas of silver to Jerusalem for a
      sacrifice to be offered for the sins of the dead, thinking well and
      religiously concerning the resurrection. For if he had not hoped that they
      that were slain should rise again, it would have seemed superfluous and
      vain to pray for the dead. And because he considered that they who had
      fallen asleep with godliness, had great grace laid up for them. It is
      therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead that they may
      be loosed from sins” (12:39-45, Douay Version).
    </p>
    <p>
      But these verses really do not teach the doctrine at all. Nowhere in this
      passage is there any mention of fire in which souls are tormented. All
      that is mentioned is prayers for the dead, from which the Roman Catholic
      theologians infer, first, that such prayers are proper, and secondly, that
      such prayers can be effective for the salvation of the dead. Furthermore,
      from the Roman Catholic viewpoint, these verses prove too much, for they
      teach the possible salvation of soldiers who had died in mortal sin, that
      of idolatry. And that contradicts Roman Catholic doctrine, which is that
      those dying in mortal sin go straight to hell and are permanently lost.
      They do not go to purgatory where they can be aided by the prayers of
      people still on earth. Surely one who had never heard of purgatory would
      not learn about it from this passage. The word purgatory is not found
      here. This, again, is a precarious passage on which to build such an
      important doctrine.

    <h2>History of the Doctrine</h2>
    <p>
      The germ of what afterward grew into the doctrine of purgatory is to be
      found in the idea of a purification by fire after death among ancients
      long before the time of Christ, particularly among the people of India and
      Persia. It was a familiar idea to the Egyptian and later to the Greek and
      Roman mind. Plato accepted the idea and gave expression to it in his
      philosophy. He taught that perfect happiness after death was not possible
      until one had made satisfaction for his sins, and that if his sins were
      too great his suffering would have no end. Following the conquests of
      Alexander the Great, Greek influences spread through all the countries of
      western Asia, including Palestine. We have seen that it found expression
      in 2 Maccabees. The Rabbis began to teach that by means of sin offerings
      children could alleviate the sufferings of deceased parents. Later Jewish
      speculation divided the underworld into two abodes—paradise, a place of
      happiness, and Gehenna, a place of torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need only read church history to discover how this doctrine developed
      by slow processes into its present form. In the early Christian era,
      following the Apostolic age, the writings of Marcion and the Shepherd of
      Hermes (second century) set forth the first statement of a doctrine of
      purgatory, alleging that Christ after His death on the cross went to the
      underworld and preached to the spirits in prison (1 Peter 3:19) and led
      them in triumph to heaven. Prayers for the dead appear in the early
      Christian liturgies and imply the doctrine since they suggest that the
      state of the dead is not yet fixed. Origen, the most learned of the early
      church fathers (died A.D. 254), taught, first, that a purification by fire
      was to take place after the resurrection, and second, a universal
      restoration, a purifying by fire at the end of the world through which all
      men and angels were to be restored to favor with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the writings of Augustine (died A.D. 430) the doctrine of purgatory was
      first given definite form, although he himself expressed doubt about some
      phases of it. It was, however, not until the sixth century that it
      received formal shape at the hands of Gregory the Great, who held the
      papal office from A.D. 590 to 604. Thereafter eschatology entered upon
      what we may term its mythological phase, during the period of history
      known as the Dark Ages. The invisible world was divided into heaven and
      purgatory, with the imagination attempting to portray as vividly as
      possible the topography and experiences of each region. The doctrine was
      proclaimed an article of faith in 1439 by the Council of Florence, and was
      later confirmed by the Council of Trent in 1548. But does any intelligent
      person believe that if such a place as purgatory is described in the Bible
      it would have taken the church fathers 600 years to discover it and
      another 1,000 years to confirm it? At any rate, the Protestant Reformation
      swept away those creations of terror and fancy, and reverted to the
      Scriptural antithesis of heaven and hell. The Eastern Orthodox Church,
      incidentally, does not teach the doctrine of purgatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following paragraph by Dr. Charles Hodge shows the influence that this
      doctrine had in the lives and thinking of all classes of people during the
      Middle Ages:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was Gregory the Great who consolidated the vague and conflicting views
      circulating through the church, and brought the doctrine into shape and
      into such connection with the discipline of the church, as to render it
      the effective engine of government and income, which it has ever since
      remained. From this time onward through all the Middle Ages, purgatory
      became one of the prominent and consistently reiterated topics of public
      discussion. It took firm hold of the popular mind. The clergy from the
      highest to the lowest, and the different orders of monks vied with each
      other in their zeal for its inculcation, and in the marvels which they
      related of spiritual apparitions, in support of the doctrine. They
      contended fiercely for the honor of superior power of redeeming souls from
      purgatorial pains. The Franciscans claimed that the head of their order
      descended annually into purgatory, and delivered all the brotherhood who
      were detained there. The Carmelites asserted that the Virgin Mary had
      promised that no one who died with the Carmelite scapulary upon their
      shoulders, should ever be lost. The chisel and pencil of the artist were
      employed in depicting the horrors of purgatory, as means of impressing the
      public mind. No class escaped the contagious belief; the learned as well
      as the ignorant; the high and the low; the soldier and the recluse; the
      skeptic and the believer were alike enslaved. From this slavery the Bible,
      not the progress of science, has delivered Protestants. ... All experience
      proves that infidelity is no protection against superstition. If men will
      not believe the rational and true, they will believe the absurd and false”
      ( Systematic Theology, III, p. 770).
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Harris says:</p>
    <p>
      “It is well to remember that the doctrine of purgatory which rests like a
      heavy burden upon the heart of every Roman Catholic was not taught by any
      of the early church fathers and had a very slow growth until the fifth
      century. Its beginnings in prayers for the dead and a difference in status
      between the martyred dead and the ordinary Christian departed may be found
      as early as A.D. 200 in Tertullian. Mention of the penal fires comes much
      later, and the masses for the poor souls in purgatory still later. The
      doctrine of purgatory is another one of those foreign growths that has
      fastened itself like a malignant tumor upon the theology of the Roman
      Catholic Church” (. Fundamental Protestant Doctrines, V, p. 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      And Alexander Hislop, in his exhaustive study of the origin of Roman
      Catholic doctrines, finds that the doctrine of purgatory was adopted from
      paganism—from Babylonian, Greek, and Roman mythology:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In every system except that of the Bible the doctrine of a purgatory
      after death, and prayers for the dead, has always been found to occupy a
      place. Go wherever we may, in ancient or modern times, we shall find that
      Paganism leaves hope after death for sinners, who, at the time of their
      departure, were consciously unfit for the abodes of the blest. For this
      purpose a middle state has been feigned, in which, by means of purgatorial
      pains guilt unremoved in time may in a future world be purged away, and
      the soul be made meet for final beatitude. In Greece the doctrine of
      purgatory was inculcated in the very chief of the philosophers (Plato).
      ... In pagan Rome, purgatory was equally held up before the minds of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In Egypt, substantially the same doctrine of purgatory was inculcated.
      But when once this doctrine of purgatory was admitted into the popular
      mind, then the door was opened for all manner of priestly extortions.
      Prayers for the dead ever go hand in hand with purgatory; but no prayers
      can be completely efficacious without the interposition of the priests;
      and no priestly functions can be rendered unless there be special pay for
      them. Therefore, in every land we find the pagan priesthood ‘devouring
      widows’ houses,’ and making merchandise of the tender feelings of
      sorrowing relatives, sensitively alive to the immortal happiness of the
      beloved dead” ( The Two Babylons, p. 168).

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      As we have indicated, there is surprisingly little revealed in Scripture
      concerning the intermediate state. This has led some to resort to
      conjecture and imagination in order to fill out the picture that
      revelation has given only in the barest outline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic theologian Newman cites the doctrine of purgatory as
      one of the clearest instances of “development” from a slight Scriptural
      germ. But in reality it is an instance of the development from a germ of
      that which was never in it to begin with—as if from a mustard seed one
      could derive an oak tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      In defense of this doctrine Roman Catholics lay considerable stress upon
      the fact that the custom of praying for the dead prevailed early and long
      in the church. Such prayers, it is said, take for granted that the dead
      need our prayers, and that they are not immediately in heaven. But the
      fact is that prayer for the dead is merely another superstitious practice
      which is entirely without Scriptural support. That was one of the many
      corruptions introduced into the church from heathenism. It will not do to
      argue from one corruption to support another.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing that has given the doctrine of purgatory a certain amount of
      plausibility is the fact that we all are sinners and none attain perfect
      holiness in this life, while heaven is a place of perfect holiness where
      nothing evil can enter. The question naturally arises, How is the soul
      cleansed from the last remnants of sin before it enters heaven? Since this
      deals with something that is outside the realm of our experience it might
      seem reasonable to believe that there would be a place of further
      purification. In this case the Bible is our only trustworthy source of
      information. But a careful examination of all the passages relating to
      this subject show that there are only two abodes for the dead—a heaven for
      the saved, and a hell for the lost. And in response to the question as to
      how the Christian is made ready for heaven, the Bible teaches that perfect
      righteousness is not to be had by any process at all, but only through
      faith in Christ (Galatians 2:16). We are not justified by the works of the
      law. As expressed in the Westminster standards: “The souls of believers
      are at their death made perfect in holiness.” And if it be doubted that
      holiness can be attained in a single moment, let it be remembered that
      recovery from disease is ordinarily a process but that when Christ said,
      “I will; be thou made clean,” even the leper was cleansed in an instant
      (Matthew 8:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Belief that one can maintain contact with the dead, and that he can
      influence them for good or bad, has been a common element in the pagan
      religions. When the Israelites came into the land of Canaan, Moses
      strictly charged them that they were not to follow the customs of the land
      in making gifts to or sacrificing for the dead, nor were they to allow any
      marks to be made in their flesh to appease or facilitate contact with the
      spirits of the dead. In Deuteronomy 26:13-14 we read: “And thou shalt say
      before Jehovah thy God, I have put away the hallowed things [objects of
      heathen veneration and worship] out of my house. ... I have not eaten
      thereof in my mourning, neither have I put away thereof, being unclean nor
      given thereof for the dead.” The Roman practice of gifts for the dead and
      prayers to and for the dead (to Mary and the saints and for deceased
      relatives and friends) is not far removed, if indeed it is removed at all,
      from such customs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Norman Porter, of Belfast, Northern Ireland, tells of a conversation
      that occurred during a visit to a Roman Catholic monastery in connection
      with a course of instruction offered on Roman Catholic beliefs. “I asked
      the priest, ‘Sir, when you die, where do you hope to go?’ He replied, ‘I
      hope that when I die I shall go at least to the lowest place in purgatory.
      That was his hope. I said, ‘Tell me, when the pope dies, where will he
      go?’ He said, ‘He will be just as I am. He hopes that he will go to
      purgatory.’ I said, ‘The so-called Vicar of Christ, the man who has
      claimed for himself the right to represent Christ on earth, is going to
      purgatory?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ I then said, ‘Sir, when do you get out of
      purgatory? When will you be in heaven?’ He answered, ‘I don’t know.’ So
      not even the Roman priests know when a soul escapes from this mysterious
      place. What a message for a perishing world!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the doctrine of purgatory represents God as a respecter of
      persons, which the Bible says He is not. Because of money a rich man can
      leave more for prayers and masses and so pass through purgatory and into
      heaven more speedily than many a poor man who is more deserving and who
      has more to commend him in the sight of God. The Bible teaches that God’s
      judgment is based on character alone, not on outward circumstances of
      wealth, position, or special standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine turns to commercial gain the sorrow of relatives and friends
      for their departed loved ones and prolongs indefinitely the hold of the
      priest over the guilty fears and hopes of people which otherwise would end
      at death. It is not difficult to imagine the anguish in the heart of a
      devout Roman Catholic who accepts the teachings of his church and believes
      that his father or mother, son or daughter, is suffering in the flames of
      purgatory. Millions of people are steeped in that superstitious system,
      and those who sincerely believe it will do almost anything to provide
      relief. It is not strange that the Roman Church accumulates wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a striking contrast there is between a Protestant and a Roman
      Catholic funeral! For the Protestant, death is his promotion to glory and
      his coronation. He has gone to heaven to be with Christ. He has preceded
      us to the Father’s house. We gather not primarily to mourn a loss, but to
      celebrate a victory. The Scriptures are read, and the words of Christ
      comfort our hearts: “Let not your hearts be troubled: believe in God,
      believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not
      so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. And if I
      go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto
      myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” And the words of Paul,
      such as these: “For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain... having the
      desire to depart, and be with Christ; for it is very far better”;
      “...willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at with the
      Lord”; etc. Christian hymns about heaven are sung, such as “Safe in the
      arms of Jesus”; “O think of the home over there”; “When we all get to
      heaven”; “And I shall see Him face to face, and tell the story, ‘Saved by
      grace’”; “Beyond the sunset”—hymns which speak of heaven as our home. Then
      words of comfort and consolation are spoken to the bereaved family, words
      of inspiration and warning to the congregation, urging them to accept
      Christ as Savior and to walk in His way as He is the way that leads to
      heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how different is the Roman Catholic funeral! We quote the words of
      Stephen L. Testa as he describes a funeral that he attended recently:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was a high requiem mass, with three priests officiating, all in black
      robes chanting a dirge of penitential psalms in Latin, in lugubrious tones
      which heighten the wailing and crying of the bereaved family especially if
      they come from Latin countries. The friends of the family read the prayer
      on the prayer card given to them at the door by the undertaker, praying to
      Jesus to have mercy on the soul of the deceased and release it soon from
      the ‘devouring flames’ (of purgatory) where it is supposed to be
      imprisoned. At one point during the mass the priest will sprinkle the
      casket with holy water and pronounce the ‘absolution of the dead,’ and
      then he will fumigate it with sweet smelling burning incense, walking
      around the casket or catafalque, mumbling Latin prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No hymns about heaven are sung. It is a fact that Catholic prayer books
      have no songs about heaven.<sup>1</sup> And no sermon or words of
      consolation are spoken by the priest to the bereaved family, for the whole
      service is intended to appease God, that He may have mercy on the soul of
      the deceased and deliver him soon from the flames of purgatory. If any
      words are spoken in English it is to induce the friends of the bereaved
      family to pay for more requiem masses to be said in the future at $5.00
      per, for the refreshment and repose of that soul in purgatory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong public sentiment that is found everywhere against obtaining
      money under false pretenses should apply to the Roman Catholic priests who
      extort money from deceived relatives for prayers and masses which they
      pretend will better the condition of the dead. And the church that
      maintains this species of dishonesty should be held in disrepute and
      contempt by all honest people regardless of denominational differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our conclusion, therefore, after an extensive survey of the doctrine of
      purgatory is that it is not in the Bible, that it is a human invention and
      contrary to what the Bible teaches. Redeemed souls are cleansed, not by
      the fires of purgatory, but by the blood of Christ and in this present
      life; for the Bible says, “The blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all
      sin” (1 John 1:7)—thereby eliminating once and for all any need for such a
      horrible place as purgatory. We do not say that any person who believes in
      purgatory cannot be a Christian. Experience shows that Christians as well
      as unbelievers sometimes are very inconsistent, that they may accept
      without thinking it through a doctrine or theory that is contrary to what
      the Bible teaches and to what their hearts know to be true. But how
      thankful we should be that we are not under the false teaching of a
      misguided church or priesthood that threatens us with the torments of
      purgatory, that instead we have the assurance that at death we go
      immediately to heaven and enter into its joys.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> The new Roman Catholic hymnal of 1965 includes some
      Protestant hymns which speak of heaven.
