    <h2>The Roman Catholic Position</h2>
    <p>
      The controversial passage in regard to Peter’s place in the Church is
      Matthew 16:13-19, which reads as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now Jesus, having come into the district of Caesarea Philippi, began to
      ask his disciples, saying, ‘Who do men say the Son of Man is?’ But they
      said, ‘Some say, John the Baptist; and others, Elias; and others,
      Jeremias, or one of the prophets.’ He said to them, ‘But who do you say
      that I am?’ Simon Peter answered and said, ‘Thou art the Christ, the Son
      of the living God.’ Then Jesus answered and said, ‘Blessed art thou, Simon
      Bar-Jona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed this to thee, but my
      Father in heaven. And I say to thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
      will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
      And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou
      shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever thou shalt
      loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Confraternity Version).
    </p>
    <p>
      To this passage the Confraternity Version adds the following
      interpretation:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The rock was Peter. ... The gates of hell: hostile, evil powers. Their
      aggressive force will struggle in vain against the Church. She shall never
      be overcome; she is indefectible. And since she has the office of teacher
      (cf. 28, 16-20), and since she would be overcome if error prevailed, she
      is infallible.
    </p>
    <p>
      “ Keys: a symbol of authority. Peter has the power to admit into the
      Church and to exclude therefrom. Nor is he merely the porter; he has
      complete power within the Church. ‘To bind and to loose’ seems to have
      been used by the Jews in the sense of to forbid or to permit; but the
      present context requires a more comprehensive meaning. In heaven God
      ratifies the decisions which Peter makes on earth in the name of Christ”
      (pp. 36-37).
    </p>
    <p>
      And the late Cardinal Gibbons, a former archbishop of Baltimore and one of
      the most representative American Roman Catholics, in his widely read book,
      Faith of our Fathers , set forth the position of his church in these
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Catholic Church teaches that our Lord conferred on St. Peter the
      first place of honor and jurisdiction in the government of His whole
      church, and that the same spiritual supremacy has always resided in the
      popes, or bishops of Rome, as being the successors of St. Peter.
      Consequently, to be true followers of Christ all Christians, both among
      the clergy and laity, must be in communion with the See of Rome, where
      Peter rules in the person of his successor” (p. 95).
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole structure of the Roman Church is built on the assumption that in
      Matthew 16:13-19 Christ appointed Peter the first pope and so established
      the papacy. Disprove the primacy of Peter, and the foundation of the
      papacy is destroyed. Destroy the papacy, and the whole Roman hierarchy
      topples with it. Their system of priesthood depends absolutely upon their
      claim that Peter was the first pope at Rome, and that they are his
      successors. We propose to show that (1) Matthew 16:13-19 does not teach
      that Christ appointed Peter a pope; (2) that there is no proof that Peter
      ever was in Rome; and (3) that the New Testament records, particularly
      Peter’s own writings, show that he never claimed authority over the other
      apostles or over the church, and that that authority was never accorded to
      him.

<div id="Rock" dropdownName="The Rock" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>The “Rock”</h2>
    <p>
      “And I say to thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
      church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” (Matthew
      16:18, Confraternity Version).
    </p>
    <p>
      Romanists quote this verse with relish, and add their own interpretation
      to establish their claim for papal authority. But in the Greek the word
      Peter is Petros, a person, masculine, while the word “rock,” petra, is
      feminine and refers not to a person but to the declaration of Christ’s
      deity that Peter had just uttered—“Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
      living God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Using Peter’s name and making, as it were, a play upon words, Jesus said
      to Peter, “You are Petros, and upon this petra I will build my church.”
      The truth that Peter had just confessed was the foundation upon which
      Christ would build His church. He meant that Peter had seen the basic,
      essential truth concerning His person, the essential truth upon which the
      church would be founded, and that nothing would be able to overthrow that
      truth, not even all the forces of evil that might be arrayed against it.
      Peter was the first among the disciples to see our Lord as the Christ of
      God. Christ commended him for that spiritual insight, and said that His
      church would be founded upon that fact. And that, of course, was a far
      different thing from founding the church on Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Christ intended to say that the Church would be founded on Peter, it
      would have been ridiculous for Him to have shifted to the feminine form of
      the word in the middle of the statement, saying, if we may translate
      literally and somewhat whimsically, “And I say unto thee, that thou art
      Mr. Rock, and upon this, the Miss Rock, I will build my church.” Clearly
      it was upon the truth that Peter had expressed, the deity of Christ, and
      not upon weak, vacillating Peter, that the church would be founded. The
      Greek “petros” is commonly used of a small, movable stone, a mere pebble,
      as it were. But “petra” means an immovable foundation, in this instance,
      the basic truth that Peter had just confessed, the deity of Christ. And in
      fact, that is the point of conflict in the churches today between
      evangelicals on the one hand, and modernists or liberals on the
      other—whether the church is founded on a truly divine Christ as revealed
      in a fully trustworthy Bible, or whether it is essentially a social
      service and moral welfare organization which recognizes Christ as an
      example, an outstandingly great and good man, but denies or ignores His
      deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bible tells us plainly, not that the church is built upon Peter, but
      that it is “built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ
      Jesus himself being the chief comer stone” (Ephesians 2:20). And again,
      “For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is
      Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 3:11). Without that foundation the true
      Christian church could not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Matthew 16:18 had been intended to teach that the church is founded on
      Peter, it would have read something like this: “Thou art Peter, and upon
      you I will build my church”; or, “Thou art Peter, and upon you the rock I
      will build my church.” But that is not what Christ said. He made two
      complete, distinct statements. He said, “Thou art Peter,” and, “Upon this
      rock (change of gender, indicating change of subject) I will build my
      church.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The gates of hell were not to prevail against the church. But the gates of
      hell did prevail against Peter shortly afterward, as recorded in this same
      chapter, when he attempted to deny that Christ would be crucified, and
      almost immediately afterward, in the presence of the other disciples,
      received the stinging rebuke, “Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art a
      stumbling block unto me, for thou mindest not the things of God but the
      things of men” (v. 23)—surely strong words to use against one who had just
      been appointed pope!
    </p>
    <p>
      Later we read that Peter slept in Gethsemane, during Christ’s agony. His
      rash act in cutting off the servant’s ear drew Christ’s rebuke. He boasted
      that he was ready to die for his Master, but shortly afterward shamefully
      denied with oaths and curses that he even knew Him. And even after
      Pentecost Peter still was subject to such serious error that his hypocrisy
      had to be rebuked by Paul, who says: “But when Cephas came to Antioch [at
      which time he was in full possession of his papal powers, according to
      Romanist doctrine], I resisted him to the face, because he stood
      condemned” (Galatians 2:11). And yet Romanists allege that their pope, as
      Peter’s successor, is infallible in matters of faith and morals!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gospel written by Mark, who is described in early Christian literature
      as Peter’s close companion and understudy, does not even record the remark
      about the “rock” in reporting Peter’s confession at Caesarea Philippi
      (Mark 8:27-30). No, Christ did not build His church upon a weak, sinful
      man. Rather the essential deity of Christ, which was so forcefully set
      forth in Peter’s confession, was the foundation stone, the starting point,
      on which the church would be built.
    </p>
    <p>
      That no superior standing was conferred upon Peter is clear from the later
      disputes among the disciples concerning who should be greatest among them.
      Had such rank already been given, Christ would simply have referred to His
      grant of power to Peter. Instead we read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them,
      What were ye reasoning on the way? But they held their Peace: for they had
      disputed one with another on the way, who was the greatest. And he sat
      down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be
      first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all” (Mark 9:33-35).
    </p>
    <p>And again:</p>
    <p>
      “And there came near unto him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying
      unto him. Teacher, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we
      shall ask of thee. And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do
      for you? And they said unto him. Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy
      right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy glory. And when the ten heard
      it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John. And
      Jesus called them unto him, and saith unto them. Ye know that they who are
      accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great
      ones exercise authority over them. But it is not so among you: but
      whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister; and
      whosoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all” (Mark
      10:34-44).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to notice that some of the church fathers, Augustine and
      Jerome among them, gave the Protestant explanation of this verse,
      understanding the “rock” to mean not Peter but Christ. Others, of course,
      gave the papal interpretation. But this shows that there was no “unanimous
      consent of the fathers,” as the Roman Church claims, on this subject.
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Harris says concerning the reference to the “rock”:</p>
    <p>
      “Mark’s Gospel is connected with Peter by all early Christian tradition
      and it does not even include this word of Jesus to Peter. Likewise in the
      Epistles of Peter there is no such claim. In 1 Peter 2:6-8 Christ is
      called a rock and a chief cornerstone. But Peter here claims nothing for
      himself. Indeed he is explicit in calling all believers living stones
      built up a spiritual house with Christ as the head of the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Christ is repeatedly called a Rock. The background for this is that
      around thirty-four times in the Old Testament God is called a Rock or the
      Rock of Israel. It was a designation of God. In the Messianic passages,
      Isaiah 8:14; 28:16; and Psalm 118:22, Christ is called a Rock or Stone
      upon which we should believe. These passages are quoted in the New
      Testament and for that reason Christ is called a Rock several times. It
      designates Him as divine. For that reason, every Jew, knowing the Old
      Testament, would refuse the designation to Peter or to anyone except
      insofar as we are children of Christ. He is the Rock. We are living stones
      built upon Him. Ephesians 2:20 says this plainly. We are built upon the
      foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
      chief cornerstone. Paul says of the Rock from which the Israelites drank
      that it typified Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4). In the New Testament there
      are twelve foundations and on them are the names of the twelve
      apostles—none of them are made pre-eminent” (The Bible Presbyterian
      Reporter , January, 1959.)
    </p>
    <p>And Dr. Henry M. Woods says:</p>
    <p>
      “If Christ had meant that Peter was to be the foundation, the natural form
      of statement would have been, ‘Thou art Peter, and on thee I will build my
      church’; but He does not say this, because Peter was not to be the rock on
      which the church was built. Note also that in the expression ‘on this
      rock,’ our Lord purposely uses a different Greek word, Petra , from that
      used for Peter, Petros. He did this to show that, not Peter, but the great
      truth which had just been revealed to him, viz., that our Lord was ‘the
      Christ, the Son of the living God,’ was to be the church’s foundation.
      Built on the Christ, the everlasting Saviour, the gates of hell would
      never prevail against the Church. But built on the well-meaning but sinful
      Peter, the gates of hell would surely prevail; for a little later our Lord
      had to severely rebuke Peter, calling him ‘Satan’” ( Our Priceless
      Heritage, p. 40).

<div id="Keys" dropdownName="The Keys" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>The “Keys”</h2>
    <p>
      “And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou
      shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever thou shalt
      loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Matthew 16:19, Confraternity
      Version).
    </p>
    <p>
      Admittedly this is a difficult verse to interpret, and numerous
      explanations have been given. It is important to notice, however, that the
      authority to bind and to loose was not given exclusively to Peter. In the
      eighteenth chapter of Matthew the same power is given to all of the
      disciples. There we read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “At that hour the disciples came to Jesus. ... Amen. I say to you,
      whatever you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven; and whatever you
      loose on earth shall be loosed also in heaven” (vv. 1,18, Confraternity
      Version).
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently Matthew 16:19 does not prove any superiority on Peter’s part.
      Even the scribes and Pharisees had this same power, for Jesus said to
      them: “But woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
      shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye enter not in yourselves,
      neither suffer them that are entering in to enter” (Matthew 23:13). And on
      another occasion He said: “The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat:
      all things therefore whatsoever they bid you, these do and observe: but do
      not ye after their works; for they say, and do not. Yea, they bind heavy
      burdens and grievous to be born, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they
      themselves will not move them with their finger” (Matthew 23:2-4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the expression clearly means that the scribes and Pharisees, in that
      the Word of God was in their hands, thereby had the power, in declaring
      that Word to the people, to open the kingdom of heaven to them, and in
      withholding that Word they shut the kingdom of heaven against people. That
      was Moses’ function in giving the law. It was, there fore, a declaratory
      power, the authority to announce the terms on which God would grant
      salvation, not an absolute power to admit or to exclude from the kingdom
      of heaven. Only God can do that, and He never delegates that authority to
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in Luke 11:52 Jesus says: “Woe unto you lawyers! for ye took away the
      key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were
      entering in ye hindered.” Here, the key of the knowledge of the way of
      salvation, by which entrance into the kingdom of heaven is obtained, was
      in the hands of the Pharisees in that they had the law of Moses in their
      possession, and were therefore the custodians of the Word of God. In that
      sense they possessed the key to the kingdom. They took away that key in
      that they failed to proclaim the Word of God to the people. They were not
      entering into the kingdom of heaven themselves, and they were hindering
      those who wanted to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, we notice that in the words spoken to Peter, it was “things,”
      not “persons,” that were to be bound or loosed—“whatsoever,” not
      “whomsoever”—things such as the ceremonial laws and customs of the Old
      Testament dispensation were to be done away with, and new rituals and
      practices of the Gospel age were to be established.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the “keys” symbolize the authority to open, in this instance, to open
      the kingdom of heaven to men through the proclamation of the Gospel. What
      the disciples were commissioned to do, given the privilege of doing, was
      the opposite of that which the scribes and Pharisees were doing; that is,
      they were to facilitate the entrance of the people into the kingdom of
      heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, of course, no physical seat which had been used by Moses and
      which now was being used by the scribes and Pharisees. But the scribes and
      Pharisees, who were in possession of the law of Moses, were giving
      precepts which in themselves were authoritative and good and which
      therefore were to be obeyed; but since they did not live up to those
      precepts the people were not to follow their example.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that the keys were symbolical of authority, which here is
      specified as the power of binding and loosing; and it is also clear that
      the consequences of what the disciples did in this regard would go far
      beyond earth and would have their permanent results in heaven. They were
      in a real sense building for eternity. In referring to the keys of the
      kingdom Jesus was continuing the figure in which He had been comparing the
      kingdom of heaven to a house which He was about to build. It would be
      built upon a solid rock (Matthew 7:24). Entrance into that house was
      through the door of faith. This door was to be opened, first to the Jews,
      and then to the Gentiles. And Peter, who had been the first of the
      disciples to comprehend the person of Christ in His true deity and to
      confess that deity before the other disciples, was commissioned to be the
      first to open that door. In this sense the keys were first given to him.
      To him was given the distinction and high honor among the apostles of
      being the first to open the door of faith to the Jewish world, which he
      did on the day of Pentecost when through his sermon some three thousand
      Jews were converted (Acts 2:14-42), and a short time later the distinction
      and high honor of opening the door of faith to the Gentile world, which he
      did in the house of Cornelius (Acts 10:1-48). And while the keys were in
      this respect first given to Peter, they were soon afterward also given to
      the other disciples as they too proclaimed the Gospel both to Jews and
      Gentiles. But while Peter was given the distinction and honor of being the
      first to open the kingdom to the Jews, and then to the Gentiles, he did
      not claim nor assume any other authority, and was in all other respects on
      precisely the same footing as were the other apostles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possession of the keys, therefore, did not mean that Peter had sovereignly
      within his own person the authority to determine who should be admitted to
      heaven and who should be excluded, as the Roman Church now attempts to
      confer that authority on the pope and priests. Ultimate authority is in
      the hands of Christ alone—it is He “that openeth and none shall shut, and
      that shutteth and none openeth” (Revelation 3:7). But it did mean that
      Peter, and later the other apostles, being in possession of the Gospel
      message, truly did open the door and present the opportunity to enter in
      as they proclaimed the message before the people. This same privilege of
      opening the door or of closing the door of salvation to others is given to
      every Christian, for the command that Christ gave His church was to go and
      make disciples of all the nations. Thus “the power of the keys” is a
      declarative power only.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can almost be said that the Roman Catholics build their church upon
      these two verses which speak of the “rock” and the “keys.” They say that
      the power given to Peter was absolute and that it was transferred by him
      to his successors, although they have to admit that there is not one verse
      in Scripture which teaches such a transfer. Under this “power of the keys”
      the Roman Church claims that “In heaven God ratifies the decisions which
      Peter makes on earth” (footnote, Confraternity Version, p. 37).
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is interesting to see how Peter himself understood this grant of
      power. In his exercise of the power of the keys he says: “And it shall be,
      that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved” (Acts
      2:21). And at the house of the Roman centurion Cornelius he again gave a
      universal Gospel invitation: “To him [Christ] bear all the prophets
      witness, that through his name every one that believeth on him shall
      receive remission of sins” (Acts 10:43). So, in the preaching of Peter, as
      elsewhere in the New Testament, salvation is set forth as based on faith
      in Christ, and nowhere is obedience to Peter, or to the pope, or to any
      other man even hinted at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome terribly abuses this “power of the keys” to insure obedience to her
      commands on the part of her church members and to instill in them a sense
      of fear and of constant dependence on the church for their salvation. This
      sense of fear and dependence, with constant references to “Mother Church,”
      goes far to explain the power that the Roman Church has over her members,
      even cowing them to the extent that they are afraid to read or to listen
      to anything contrary to what their church teaches. And since that teaching
      is drilled into them from childhood, the truly formidable power that the
      Roman Church exercises over the laity can be easily understood.
    </p>

<div id="Authority" dropdownName="Papal Authority" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Papal Authority not Claimed by Peter</h2>
    <p>
      The Roman Church claims that Peter was the first bishop or pope in Rome
      and that the later popes are his successors. But the best proof of a man’s
      position and authority is his own testimony. Does Peter claim to be a
      pope, or to have primacy over the other apostles? Fortunately, he wrote
      two epistles or letters which are found in the New Testament. There he
      gives his position and certain instructions as to how others in the same
      position are to perform their duties. We read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. ... The elders therefore among you I
      exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ,
      who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: Tend the flock
      of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint,
      but willingly, according to the will of God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but
      of a ready mind; neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you,
      but making yourselves ensamples to the flock” (1 Peter 1:1, 5:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Peter refers to himself as an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder (the
      word in the Greek is presbuteros), which of course has nothing to do with
      a sacrificing priesthood. He does not claim the highest place in the
      church as some would expect him to do or as some would claim for him. He
      assumes no ecclesiastical superiority, but with profound humility puts
      himself on a level with those whom he exhorts. He makes it clear that the
      church must be democratic, not authoritarian. He forbids the leaders to
      lord it over the people, to work for money or to take money unjustly. He
      says that they are to serve the people willingly, even eagerly, and that
      by their general lives they are to make themselves examples for the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fact is that the Church of Rome acts directly contrary to these
      instructions. Can anyone imagine the proud popes of later times adopting
      such a role of humility? It was several centuries later, when the church
      had lost much of its original simplicity and spiritual power, and had been
      submerged in a flood of worldliness, that the autocratic authority of the
      popes began to appear. After the fourth century, when the Roman empire had
      fallen, the bishops of Rome stepped into Caesar’s shoes, took his pagan
      title of Pontifex Maximus, the supreme high priest of the pagan Roman
      religion, sat down on Caesar’s throne, and wrapped themselves in Caesar’s
      gaudy trappings. And that role they have continued ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the title Pontifex, the Standard International Encyclopedia
      says this was “the title given by the ancient Romans to members of one of
      the two celebrated religious colleges. The chief of the order was called
      Pontifex Maximus. The pontiffs had general control of the official
      religion, and their head was the highest religious authority in the state.
      ... Following Julius Caesar the emperor was the Pontifex Maximus. In the
      time of Theodosius [emperor, died A.D. 395] the title became equivalent to
      Pope, now one of the titles of the head of the Roman Catholic Church.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter refused to accept homage from men—as when Cornelius the Roman
      centurion fell down at his feet and would have worshipped him, Peter
      protested quickly and said, “Stand up; I myself also am a man” (Acts
      10:25-26). Yet the popes accept the blasphemous title of “Holy Father” as
      theirs as a matter of right. And how the cardinals, bishops, and priests
      do like to set themselves apart from the congregations and to lord it over
      the people!
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely if Peter had been a pope, “the supreme head of the church,” he
      would have declared that fact in his general epistles, for that was the
      place of all others to have asserted his authority. The popes have never
      been slow to make such claims for themselves, or to extend their authority
      as far as possible. But instead Peter refers to himself only as an apostle
      (of which there were eleven others), and as an elder or presbyter, that
      is, simply as a minister of Christ.

    <h2>Paul’s Attitude toward Peter</h2>
    <p>
      It is very interesting to notice Paul’s attitude toward Peter. Paul was
      called to be an apostle at a later time, after church had been launched.
      Yet Peter had nothing to do with that choice, as he surely would have had,
      if he had been pope. Instead God called and ordained Paul without
      consulting Peter, as He has called and ordained many thousands of
      ministers and evangelists since then without reference to the popes of
      Rome. Paul was easily the greatest of the apostles, with a deeper insight
      into the way of salvation and a larger revealed knowledge concerning the
      mysteries of life and death. He wrote much more of the New Testament than
      did Peter. His thirteen epistles contain 2,023 verses, while Peter’s two
      epistles contain only 166 verses. And if we ascribe the Epistle to the
      Hebrews to Paul, as does the Roman Catholic Church (Confraternity Version,
      p. 397), he wrote an even larger proportion. Peter’s epistles do not stand
      first among the epistles, but after those of Paul; and in fact his second
      epistle was one of the last to be accepted by the church. Paul worked more
      recorded miracles than did Peter, and be seems to have established more
      churches than did Peter. Apart from the church at Rome, which we believe
      was established by laymen, Paul established more prominent and more
      permanent churches than did Peter. And, so far as the New Testament record
      goes, Paul’s influence in the church at Rome was much greater than was
      that of Peter. Paul mentions Peter more than once, but nowhere does he
      defer to Peter’s authority, or acknowledge him as pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, quite the contrary is the case. Paul had founded the church at
      Corinth, but when some there rebelled against his authority, even to the
      extent of favoring Peter, he does not give even an inch on his own
      authority. Instead he vigorously defends his authority, declaring, “Am I
      not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord?” (1 Corinthians 9:1), and
      again, “For in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles” (2
      Corinthians 12:11), or, as translated in the Confraternity Version, “In no
      way have I fallen short of the most eminent apostles.” He declares that he
      has been “intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter
      with the gospel of the circumcision” (Galatians 2:7). He therefore put
      himself on a level with all the other apostles. Certainly those ideas were
      incompatible with any idea of a pope in Paul’s day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beyond all that, on one occasion Paul publicly rebuked peter. When
      Peter at Antioch sided with the “false brethren” (v. 4) in their Jewish
      legalism and “drew back and separated himself’ from the Gentiles and was
      even the cause of Barnabas being misled, Paul administered a severe
      rebuke. We read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he
      stood condemned. For before that certain came from James, he ate with the
      Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing
      them that were of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews dissembled
      likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their
      dissimulation. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to
      the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas before them all, If thou,
      being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how
      compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?” (Galatians 2:11-14).
    </p>
    <p>
      He then impressed upon Peter some good, sound, evangelical theology,
      declaring that:
    </p>
    <p>
      “...a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in
      Jesus Christ... because by the works of the law shall no flesh be
      justified” (v. 16).
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, Paul gave the “Holy Father” a “dressing down” before them
      all, accusing him of not walking uprightly in the truth of the Gospel.
      Surely that was no way to talk to a pope! Imagine anyone today, even a
      cardinal, taking it upon himself to rebuke and instruct a real pope with
      such language! Just who was Paul that he should rebuke the Vicar of Christ
      for unchristian conduct? If Peter was the chief it was Paul’s duty and the
      duty of the other apostles to recognize him as such and to teach only what
      he approved. Obviously Paul did not regard Peter as infallible in faith
      and morals, or recognize any supremacy on his part.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Attitude of the Other Apostles toward Peter</h2>
    <p>
      The other apostles as well as Paul seem totally unaware of any appointment
      that made Peter the head of the church. Nowhere do they acknowledge his
      authority. And nowhere does he attempt to exercise authority over them.
      The only instance in which another man was chosen to succeed an apostle is
      recorded in Acts 1:15-26, and there the choice was made not by Peter but
      by popular choice on the part the brethren who numbered about one hundred
      and twenty, and by the casting of lots.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion Peter, together with John, was sent by the apostles to
      preach the Gospel in Samaria (Acts 8:14). Imagine the pope today being
      sent by the cardinals or bishops on any such mission. It is well known
      that today the popes seldom if ever preach. They do issue statements, and
      they address select audiences which come to them. But they do not go out
      and preach the Gospel as did Peter and the other apostles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important church council in Jerusalem (Acts 15) reveals quite clearly
      how the unity of the church was expressed in apostolic days. Differences
      had arisen when certain men from Judaea came down to Antioch, in Syria,
      where Paul and Barnabas were working and insisted that certain parts of
      the Jewish ritual must be observed. Had the present Roman Catholic theory
      of the papacy been followed, there would have been no need at all for a
      council. The church in Antioch would have written a letter to Peter, the
      bishop of Rome, and he would have sent them an encyclical or bull settling
      the matter. And of all the churches the one at Antioch was the last that
      should have appealed to Jerusalem. For according to Roman Catholic legend
      Peter was bishop in Antioch for seven years before transferring his see to
      Rome! But the appeal was made, not to Peter, but to a church council in
      Jerusalem. At that council not Peter but James presided and announced the
      decision with the words, “Wherefore my judgment is...” (v. 19). And his
      judgment was accepted by the apostles and presbyters. Peter was present,
      but only after there had been “much questioning” (v. 7) did he even so
      much as express an opinion. He did not attempt to make any infallible
      pronouncements although the subject under discussion was a vital matter of
      faith. In any event it is clear that the unity of the early church was
      maintained not by the voice of Peter but by the decision of the ecumenical
      council which was presided over by James, the leader of the Jerusalem
      church. Furthermore, after that council Peter is never again mentioned in
      the book of Acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an old human failing for people to want to exercise authority over
      their fellow men. We are told that the disciples disputed among themselves
      which was to be accounted the greatest. Jesus rebuked them with the words:
      “If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all”
      (Mark 9:35). On another occasion the mother of James and John came to
      Jesus with the request that her two sons should have the chief places in
      the kingdom. But He called the disciples to Him and said, “Ye know that
      the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones
      exercise authority over them. Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever
      would become great among you shall be your minister; and whosoever would
      be first among you shall be your servant: even as the Son of man came not
      to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for
      many” (Matthew 20:25-28). And even on the night in which Christ was
      delivered up to die they contended among themselves “which of them was
      accounted to be greatest” (Luke 22:24). In each instance Jesus taught them
      that they were not to seek to exercise lordship, but rather to excel in
      service. But in no instance did He settle the dispute by reminding them
      that Peter was the Prince of the Apostles. In fact they could not have
      argued that question at all if Peter had already been given the place of
      preeminence, as the Roman Church holds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ alone is the Head of the church. “Other foundation can no man lay
      than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 3:11). The
      church is “built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ
      Jesus himself being the chief corner stone” (Ephesians 2:20). Paul says
      that God “gave him [Christ] to be head over all things to the church,
      which is his body” (Ephesians 1:22-23). Besides Him there can be no
      earthly foundation or head of the church. Only a monstrosity can have two
      heads for one body.

    <h2>Was Peter Ever in Rome?</h2>
    <p>
      According to Roman Catholic tradition Peter was the first bishop of Rome,
      his pontificate lasted twenty-five years, from A.D. 42 to 67, and he was
      martyred in Rome in A.D. 67. The Douay and Confraternity versions say that
      he was in Rome before the Jerusalem council of Acts 15, and that he
      returned to Jerusalem for that council, after which he went to Antioch,
      and then returned to Rome. In the Confraternity Version we read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “After the resurrection the primacy was conferred upon him and immediately
      after the ascension he began to exercise it. After preaching in Jerusalem
      and Palestine he went to Rome, probably after his liberation from prison.
      Some years later he was in Jerusalem for the first church council, and
      shortly afterward at Antioch. In the year 67 he was martyred is Rome”
      (Introduction to the First Epistle of St. Peter).
    </p>
    <p>
      The remarkable thing, however, about Peter’s alleged bishopric in Rome, is
      that the New Testament has not one word to say about it. The word Rome
      occurs only nine times in the Bible, and never is Peter mentioned in
      connection with it. There is no allusion to Rome in either of his
      epistles. Paul’s journey to that city is recorded in great detail (Acts 27
      and 28). There is in fact no New Testament evidence, nor any historical
      proof of any kind, that Peter ever was in Rome. All rests on legend. The
      first twelve chapters of the book of Acts tell of Peter’s ministry and
      travels in Palestine and Syria. Surely if he had gone to the capital of
      the empire, that would have been mentioned. We may well ask, if Peter was
      superior to Paul, why does he receive so little attention after Paul comes
      on the scene? Not much is known about his later life, except that he
      traveled extensively, and that on at least some of his missionary journeys
      he was accompanied by his wife—for Paul says, “Have we no right to lead
      about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the
      brethren of the Lord, and Cephas” (1 Corinthians 9:5). (The Confraternity
      Version here reads “sister” instead of “wife”; but the Greek word is gune,
      wife, not adelphe, sister.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We know nothing at all about the origins of Christianity in Rome. This is
      acknowledged even by some Roman Catholic historians. It was already a
      flourishing church when Paul wrote his letter to the Romans in A.D. 58.
      Quite possibly it had been founded by some of those who were present in
      Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and heard Peter’s great sermon when some
      3,000 were converted, for Luke says that in that audience were “sojourners
      from Rome, both Jews and proselytes” (Acts 2:10). In any event there is
      nothing but unfounded tradition to support the claim that Peter founded
      the church in Rome and that he was its bishop for 25 years. The fact is
      that the apostles did not settle in one place as did the diocesan bishops
      of much later date, so that it is quite incorrect to speak of Rome as the
      “See of Peter,” or to speak of the popes occupying “the chair” of St.
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legend was early busy with the life of Peter. The one which tells of his
      twenty-five years’ episcopate in Rome has its roots in the apocryphal
      stories originating with a heretical group, the Ebionites, who rejected
      much of the supernatural content of the New Testament, and the account is
      discredited both by its origin and by its internal inconsistencies. The
      first reference that might be given any credence at all is found in the
      writings of Eusebius, and that reference is doubted even by some Roman
      Catholic writers. Eusebius wrote in Greek about the year 310, and his work
      was translated by Jerome. A 17 th century historian, William Cave
      (1637-1713), chaplain to King Charles II of England, in his most important
      work, The Lives of the Apostles, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It cannot be denied that in St. Jerome’s translation it is expressly said
      that he (Peter) continued twenty-five years as bishop in that city: but
      then it is as evident that this was his own addition, who probably set
      things down as the report went in his time, no such thing being found in
      the Greek copy of Eusebius.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Exhaustive research by archaeologists has been made down through the
      centuries to find some inscription in the Catacombs and other ruins of
      ancient places in Rome that would indicate that Peter at least visited
      Rome. But the only things found which gave any promise at all were some
      bones of uncertain origin. L. H. Lehmann, who was educated for the
      priesthood at the University for the Propagation of the Faith, Rome, tells
      us of a lecture by a noted Roman archaeologist, Professor Marucchi, given
      before his class, in which he said that no shred of evidence of Peter’s
      having been in the Eternal City had ever been unearthed, and of another
      archaeologist, Di Rossi, who declared that for forty years his greatest
      ambition had been to unearth in Rome some inscription which would verify
      the papal claim that the Apostle Peter was actually in Rome, but that he
      was forced to admit that he had given up hope of success in his search. He
      had the promise of handsome rewards by the church if he succeeded. What he
      had dug up verified what the New Testament says about the formation of the
      Christian church in Rome, but remained absolutely silent regarding the
      claims of the bishops of Rome to be the successors of the apostle Peter
      (cf., The Soul of a Priest, p. 10).
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after all, suppose Peter’s bones should be found and identified
      beyond question, what would that prove? The important thing is, does the
      Church of Rome teach the same Gospel that Peter taught? Succession to
      Peter should be claimed, not by those who say they have discovered his
      bones, but by those who teach the Gospel that he taught—the evangelical
      message of salvation by grace through faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, if mere residence conferred superiority, then Antioch would
      outrank Rome; for the same tradition which asserts that Peter resided in
      Rome asserts that he first resided in Antioch, a small city in Syria. It
      is well known that during the time of the apostles and for generations
      later the Eastern cities and the Eastern church had the greatest
      influence, and that the Roman church was comparatively insignificant. The
      first councils were held in Eastern cities and were composed almost
      altogether of Eastern bishops. Four of the patriarchates were
      Eastern—Jerusalem, Antioch, Constantinople, and Alexandria. Rome did not
      gain the ascendancy until centuries later, after the breakup of the Roman
      empire. If any church had a special right to be called the Mistress of all
      the churches, it surely was the church in Jerusalem, where our Lord lived
      and taught, where He was crucified, where Christianity was first preached
      by Peter and the other apostles, where Peter’s great Pentecostal sermon
      was delivered, and from which went forth to Antioch and Rome and to all
      the world the glad tidings of salvation. Long before the Reformation
      Rome’s claim to be the only true church was rejected by the eastern
      churches, which were the most ancient and in the early days much the most
      influential churches in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interesting and very important if not decisive line of evidence in
      this regard is the fact that Paul was preeminently the apostle to the
      Gentiles while Peter was preeminently the apostle to the Jews, this
      division of labor having been by divine appointment. In Galatians 2:7-8
      Paul says that he “had been intrusted with the gospel of the
      uncircumcision, even as Peter with the gospel of the circumcision (for he
      that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought
      for me also unto the Gentiles).” Thus Paul’s work was primarily among the
      Gentiles, while Peter’s was primarily among the Jews. Peter ministered to
      the Jews who were in exile in Asia Minor, “to the elect who are sojourners
      of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia” (1
      Peter 1:1), and in his journeys he went as far east as Babylon, from which
      city his first epistle (and probably his second) was addressed to the
      Jewish Christians in Asia Minor: “She that is in Babylon, elect together
      with you, saluteth you” (1 Peter 5:13). As most of Paul’s letters were
      addressed to churches he had evangelized, so Peter wrote to the Jewish
      brethren that he had evangelized, who were scattered through those
      provinces. While there is no Scriptural evidence at all that Peter went
      west to Rome, here is a plain statement of Scripture that he did go east
      to Babylon. Why cannot the Roman Church take Peter’s word to that effect?
    </p>
    <p>
      But his testimony, of course, must be circumvented by those who are so
      anxious to place him in Rome, and they take a curious way to do it. The
      Confraternity edition has an introductory note to 1 Peter which reads:
      “The place of composition is given as ‘Babylon’... a cryptic designation
      of the city of Rome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is no good reason for saying that “Babylon” means “Rome.” The
      reason alleged by the Church of Rome for understanding Babylon to mean
      Rome is that in the book of Revelation Rome is called by that name
      (Revelation 17:5, 18:2). But there is a great difference between an
      apocalyptic book such as the book of Revelation, which for the most part
      is written in figurative and symbolic language, and an epistle such as
      this which is written in a straightforward, matter-of-fact style.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to Peter’s assignment to work among the Jews, it is known that
      there were many Jews in Babylon in New Testament times. Many had not
      returned to Palestine after the Exile. Many others, such as those in Asia
      Minor and Egypt, had been driven out or had left Palestine for various
      reasons. Josephus says that some “gave Hyrcanus, the high priest, a
      habitation at Babylon, where there were Jews in great numbers” (
      Antiquities , Book XV, Ch. II, 2). Peter’s assigned ministry to the Jews
      took him to those places where the Jews were in the greatest numbers, even
      to Babylon.

    <h2>Paul’s Epistle to the Romans</h2>
    <p>
      The strongest reason of all for believing that Peter never was in Rome is
      found in Paul’s epistle to the Romans. According to Roman Church
      tradition, Peter reigned as pope in Rome for 25 years, from A.D. 42 to 67.
      It is generally agreed that Paul’s letter to the Christians in Rome was
      written in the year A.D. 58, at the very height of Peter’s alleged
      episcopacy there. He did not address his letter to Peter, as he should
      have done if Peter was in Rome and the head of all the churches, but to
      the saints in the church in Rome. How strange for a missionary to write to
      a church and not mention the pastor! That would be an inexcusable affront.
      What would we think of a minister today who would dare to write to a
      congregation in a distant city and without mentioning their pastor tell
      them that he was anxious to go there that he might have some fruit among
      them even as he has had in his own community (1:13), that he was anxious
      to instruct and strengthen them, and that he was anxious to preach the
      Gospel there where it had not been preached before? How would their pastor
      feel if he knew that such greetings had been sent to 27 of his most
      prominent members who were mentioned by name in the epistle (Ch. 16)?
      Would he stand for such ministerial ethics? And if he were the most
      prominent minister in the land, as allegedly was the bishop of Rome, such
      an affront would be all the more inexcusable. This point alone ought to
      open the eyes of the most obdurate person blinded by the traditions of the
      Roman Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Peter had been working in the church in Rome for some 16 years, why did
      Paul write to the people of the church in these words: “For I long to see
      you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the and ye may be
      established” (1:11)? Was not that a gratuitous insult to Peter? Was it not
      a most presumptuous thing for Paul to go over the head of the pope? And if
      Peter was there and had been there for 16 years, why was it necessary for
      Paul to go at all, especially since in his letter he says that he does not
      build on another’s foundation: “making it my aim so to preach the gospel,
      not where Christ was already named, that I might not build upon another
      man’s foundation” (15:20)? This indicates clearly that Peter was not then
      in Rome, and that he had not been there, that in fact Paul was writing
      this letter because no apostle had yet been in Rome to clarify the Gospel
      to them and to establish them in the faith. At the conclusion of this
      letter Paul sends greetings to the 27 people mentioned above, including
      some women, also to several groups. But he does not mention Peter in any
      capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again, had Peter been in Rome prior to or at the time when Paul
      arrived there as a prisoner in A.D. 61, Paul could not have failed to have
      mentioned him, for in the epistles written from there during his
      imprisonment—Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon—he gives a
      complete list of his fellow workers in Rome, and Peter’s name is not among
      them. He spent two whole years there as a prisoner, and received all who
      came to visit him (Acts 28:30). Nor does he mention Peter in his second
      epistle to Timothy, which was written from Rome during his second
      imprisonment, in A.D. 67, the year that Peter is alleged to have suffered
      martyrdom in Rome, and shortly before his own death (2 Timothy 4:6-8). He
      says that all his friends have forsaken him, and that only Luke is with
      him (4:10-11). Where was Peter? If Peter was in Rome when Paul was there
      as a prisoner, he surely lacked Christian courtesy since he never called
      to offer aid. Surely he must have been the first absentee bishop on a big
      scale!
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this makes it quite certain that Peter never was in Rome at all.
      Not one of the early church fathers gives any support to the belief that
      Peter was a bishop in Rome until Jerome in the fifth century. Du Pin, a
      Roman Catholic historian, acknowledges that “the primacy of Peter is not
      recorded by the early Christian writers, Justin Martyr (139), Irenaeus
      (178), Clement of Alexandria (190), or others of the most ancient
      fathers.” The Roman Church thus builds her papal system, not on New
      Testament teaching, nor upon the facts of history, but only on unfounded
      traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chronological table for Peter’s work, so far as we can work it out,
      seems to be roughly as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Bible students agree that Paul’s conversion occurred in the year A.D.
      37. After that he went to Arabia (Galatians 1:17), and after three years
      went up to Jerusalem where he remained with Peter for 15 days (Galatians
      1:18). That brings us to the year A.D. 40. Fourteen years later he again
      went to Jerusalem (Galatians 2:1), where he attended the Jerusalem council
      described in Acts 15, in which Peter also participated (v. 6). This
      conference dealt primarily with the problems which arose in connection
      with the presentation of the Gospel in Jewish and Gentile communities.
      Paul and Barnabas presented their case, and were authorized by the council
      to continue their ministry to the Gentiles (Acts 15:22-29); and this quite
      clearly was the occasion on which Paul was assigned to work primarily
      among the Gentiles while Peter was assigned to work primarily among the
      Jews (Galatians 2:7-8), since this same Jerusalem council is spoken of in
      the immediate context (Galatians 2:1-10). So this brings us to the year
      A.D. 54, and Peter still is in Syria, 12 years after the time that the
      Roman tradition says that he began his reign in Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime after the Jerusalem council Peter also came to Antioch, on which
      occasion it was necessary for Paul to reprimand him because of his
      conformity to Judaistic rituals (Galatians 2:11-21). And the same Roman
      tradition which says that Peter reigned in Rome also says that he governed
      the church in Antioch for seven years before going to Rome. Hence we reach
      the year A.D. 61, with Peter still in Syria! Indeed, how could Peter have
      gone to Rome, which was the very center of the Gentile world? Would he
      defy the decision reached by all the apostles and brethren from the
      various churches who met in the famous first Christian council in
      Jerusalem? Clearly the Scriptural evidence is that Peter accepted that
      decision, and that his work was primarily among the Jews of the
      dispersion, first in Asia Minor, and later as far east as Babylon—that in
      fact his work took him in the opposite direction from that which Roman
      tradition assigns to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      And even if Peter had been the first bishop of Rome, that would not mean
      that the bishops who followed him would have had any of the special powers
      that he had. The apostles had the power to work miracles and to write
      inspired Scripture. Even if Peter had been granted special powers above
      those of the other apostles, there is nothing in Scripture to indicate
      that those powers could have been transmitted to his successors. In his
      second epistle he makes a reference to his approaching death (1:14), and
      surely that would have been the appropriate place to have said who his
      successor should be and what the method of choosing future bishops should
      be. But he gives no indication that he even thought of such things. Peter
      as an apostle had qualifications and gifts which the popes do not have and
      dare not claim. The fact of the matter is that with the passing of the
      apostles their place as guides to the church was taken not by an
      infallible pope but by an inspired and infallible Scripture which had been
      developed by that time, which we call the New Testament, through which God
      would speak to the church from that time until the end of the age.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may be certain that if the humble, spiritually-minded Peter were to
      come back to earth he would not acknowledge as his successor the proud
      pontiff who wears the elaborate, triple-decked, gold bejeweled crown, who
      wears such fabulously expensive clothing, who is carried on the shoulders
      of the people who stands before the high altar of worship, who is
      surrounded by a Swiss military guard, and who receives such servile
      obedience from the people that he is in effect, if not in reality,
      worshipped by them. The dedicated Christian minister who serves his people
      faithfully and humbly, and not the pope, is the true successor of Peter.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Let it be understood that we do not seek to minimize or downgrade but only
      to expose the preposterous claims that the Roman Church makes for its
      popes and hierarchy. Peter was a prince of God, but he was not the Prince
      of the Apostles. He, together with the other apostles, Mary, and the early
      Christians, turned from the religion in which they were bom, Judaism, and
      became simply Christians, followers of Christ. Not one of them was a Roman
      Catholic. Roman Catholicism did not develop until centuries later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of the primacy of Peter is just one more of the many errors
      that the Church of Rome has added to the Christian religion. With the
      exposure of that fallacy the foundation of the Roman Church is swept away.
      The whole papal system stands or falls depending on whether or not Peter
      was a pope in Rome, and neither the New Testament nor reliable historical
      records give any reason to believe that he ever held that position or that
      he ever was in Rome.
