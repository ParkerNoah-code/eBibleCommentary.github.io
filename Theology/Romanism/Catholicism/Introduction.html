    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
    <p>
      In our twentieth century America few among us seem to realize what a
      priceless heritage we possess in the freedom of religion, freedom of
      speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly that is an integral
      part of our everyday life. Nor are many aware of the bitter and prolonged
      struggles our forefathers went through at the time of the Reformation and
      later to secure these freedoms. Instead it is quite the common thing to
      take these for granted and to assume that they are the natural rights of
      all men. But truly those of us who call ourselves Protestants are the
      inheritors of a great tradition. And in a country such as the United
      States our Roman Catholic friends also share these freedoms, little
      realizing what it means to live under a clerical dictatorship such as
      their church imposes wherever it has the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman Catholics often attempt to represent Protestantism as something
      comparatively new, as having originated with Martin Luther and John Calvin
      in the 16 th century. We do indeed owe a great debt to those leaders and
      to the Reformation movement that swept over Europe at that time. But the
      basic principles and the common system of doctrine taught by those
      Reformers and by the evangelical churches ever since go back to the New
      Testament and to the first century Christian church. Protestantism as it
      emerged in the 16 th century was not the beginning of something new, but a
      return to Bible Christianity and to the simplicity of the Apostolic church
      from which the Roman Church had long since departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The positive and formal principle of this system is that the Bible is the
      Word of God and therefore the authoritative rule of faith and practice.
      Its negative principle is that any element of doctrine or practice in the
      church which cannot be traced back to the New Testament is no essential
      part of Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>The basic features of Protestant belief therefore are:</p>
    <p>The supremacy of the Bible in all matters of faith and practice.</p>
    <p>
      Justification by faith, not by works, although works have their necessary
      and logical place as the fruits and proof of true faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right of the individual to go directly to God in prayer apart from the
      mediation of any priest or other human intermediary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individual freedom of conscience and worship, within the authority of the
      Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than a thousand years before the Reformation the popes had
      controlled Europe and had said that there was only one way to worship God.
      That period is appropriately known as the “Dark Ages.” In the church and,
      to a considerable extent, in the state, too, the priests held the power.
      They suppressed the laity until practically all their rights were taken
      away. They constantly pried into private affairs, interfering even between
      husband and wife and between parents and children by means of the
      confessional. All marriage was in their hands. They interfered in the
      administration of public affairs, in the proceedings of the courts, and in
      the disposition of estates. The revenues of the state built new churches
      and paid the salaries of the priests in much the same manner as in present
      day Spain. Anyone who dared resist ran the risk of losing his job, his
      property, and even his life. Life under such tyranny was intolerable. From
      that condition the Reformation brought deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first and most important results of the Reformation was that
      the Bible was given to the people in their own languages. Previously the
      Bible had been kept from them, on the pretext that only the church
      speaking through the priest could interpret it correctly. Luther
      translated the Bible into his native German, and edition followed edition
      in rapid succession. Similar translations were made in England, France,
      Holland, and other countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protestants of our day who have not been called upon to suffer or to make
      any sacrifices to secure this rich heritage are inclined to hold these
      blessings lightly. But the advances that Romanism is making today in this
      nation and in other parts of the world should cause even the most careless
      to stop and think. It seems that as Protestants we have forgotten how to
      protest against those same religious and political abuses that were common
      before the Reformation. We need to acquaint ourselves with and to teach
      the principles of our faith if we are not to be overwhelmed by a religious
      despotism that, if it gains the upper hand, will be as cruel and
      oppressive as ever it was in Germany, Italy, France, or Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our American freedoms are being threatened today by two totalitarian
      systems, Communism and Roman Catholicism. And of the two in our country
      Romanism is growing faster than is Communism and is the more dangerous
      since it covers its real nature with a cloak of religion. This nation has
      been well alerted to the dangers of Communism, and it is generally opposed
      by the radio, the press, and the churches. But Romanism has the support of
      these to a considerable extent, and even the Protestant churches in many
      places take a conciliatory and cooperative attitude toward it. Most people
      have only a very hazy notion as to what is involved in the Roman system.
      And yet the one consuming purpose of the Vatican is to convert the entire
      world, not to Christianity, but to Roman Catholicism. Its influence is
      being applied vigorously at every level of our local, state, and federal
      government. It is particularly significant that in this country the
      hierarchy has taken as its slogan, not, “Make America Christian,” but,
      “Make America Catholic.” And in that slogan are the strong overtones of a
      full scale attack upon our Protestant heritage and those precious rights
      of freedom of religion, freedom of conscience, and freedom of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot adequately understand this problem unless we realize that the
      kind of Roman Catholicism that we see in the United States is, for the
      most part, not real Roman Catholicism at all, that is, not Roman
      Catholicism as it exists where it is the dominant force in the life of a
      nation, but a modified and compromised form that has adjusted itself to
      life with a Protestant majority. Here it is comparatively reticent about
      asserting its claims to be the only true church, the only church that has
      a right to conduct public religious services, its right to suppress all
      other forms of religion, its superiority to all national and state
      governments, its control over all marriage, its right to direct all
      education, and the obligation of the state to support its churches and
      schools with tax money. That this is no visionary list of charges, but a
      cold and realistic appraisal, is shown by the fact that in Spain, which is
      governed under the terms of a concordat with the Vatican, and which is
      often praised by Roman Catholic spokesmen as the ideal Catholic state, the
      Roman Church is now exercising most of these so-called “rights” or
      privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to see clearly what Roman Catholicism really is, we must see it
      as it was during the Middle Ages, or as it has continued to be in certain
      countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Southern Ireland, and
      Latin America, where it has had political as well as ecclesiastical
      control. In those countries where it has been dominant for centuries with
      little or no opposition from Protestantism, we see the true fruits of the
      system in the lives of the people, with all of their poverty, ignorance,
      superstition, and low moral standards. In each of those countries a
      dominant pattern is discernible. Spain is a particularly good example, for
      it is the most Roman Catholic country in Europe, yet it has the lowest
      standard of living of any nation in Europe. The Latin American nations
      have been predominantly Roman Catholic for four centuries, and today the
      illiteracy rate ranges from 30 to 70 percent. The veteran radio political
      analyst, Howard K. Smith, recently reported that “The average per capita
      income in the United States is eight times that of any country in South
      America” (March 3, 1960). The average per capita income in South America
      is $280, one ninth that in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even in those countries we do not see the ultimate fruits of the
      system. For over a period of years they have been influenced to some
      extent by Protestantism and they have been receiving assistance from the
      Protestant nations, particularly from the United States and England, so
      that their present condition, economic, social, political, and religious,
      is not nearly as bad as it would have been had they been left to
      themselves. Substantial aid has been given since the close of the First
      World War. American foreign aid, economic and military, granted to other
      nations since the Second World War through 1977, amounted to $200 billion
      (Statistical Abstract of the U.S., 1978). And probably $50 billion more
      has been granted since that time, making a total of approximately $250
      billion. The Roman Catholic nations of Europe and Latin America have
      profited greatly through this assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      American Catholicism, so different on the surface from that found in
      Spain, Italy, and Latin America, is, nevertheless, all a part of the same
      church, all run from Rome and by the same man who is the absolute ruler
      over all of the branches and who has the authority to change policy in any
      of those branches as he deems it safe or expedient. If he chose to give
      his subjects in Spain or Colombia relatively more freedom and better
      schools, such as are enjoyed by those in the United States, he could
      readily do so by directing his priests and financial resources to that
      end. Undoubtedly Romanism in the United States would be much the same as
      that found in other countries were it not for the influence of evangelical
      Christianity as set forth by the Protestant churches.

  <section>
    <h2>Roman Catholicism a Poor Defense Against Communism</h2>
    <p>
      We have no hesitation in saying that most of the Roman Catholic nations,
      had they been left to themselves, long ago would have fallen victims of
      Communism. In all probability both Italy and France would have turned
      Communist at the close of the Second World War had it not been for
      American aid and all of the political influence that our government could
      lawfully exert toward those nations, and even then the result was in doubt
      for some considerable time. The Vatican had supported Mussolini’s Fascist
      and military policies, including the conquest of Ethiopia (which conquest
      had been condemned by the League of Nations and by practically all of the
      civilized world), his open and extensive support of Franco in Spain with
      troops and arms, and his invasion of Albania and Greece. After Italy
      entered the war on the side of Nazi Germany the Roman Church supported the
      Italian war effort, which meant, of course, that our work of carrying the
      war to a successful conclusion was made just that much harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the war Pope Pius XII gave his blessing to large numbers of Italian
      and German troops who appeared before him in uniform. With the defeat of
      Germany and Italy those policies caused strong popular resentment. It is
      probable that, in the turmoil that followed the ignominious fall of
      Mussolini, the Roman Catholic Church would have been overthrown in much
      the same way that the Orthodox Catholic Church in Russia was overthrown
      when the Czarist regime fell at the end of the First World War, had not
      American military forces then in Italy preserved order. In Russia a dead,
      formalistic church had lost the respect of the people and had become
      identified with the despotic rule of the Czar since he was the head of
      both the state and the church. When the people rose up in anger and threw
      out the political government, they threw out the church with it and turned
      to the other extreme, atheism. That has often been the case where the
      people have known only one church. When that became corrupt they had no
      alternative but to turn against religion altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the critical Italian election held after the war, in April, 1948, the
      Communists made a strong effort to gain control of the government, but a
      coalition of other parties managed to gain the majority. Today the biggest
      Communist party outside of Russia and Red China is found in Roman Catholic
      Italy, seat of the papacy, precisely where, if Roman Catholicism is the
      effective defense against Communism that it claims to be, we should find
      the least Communism. Approximately one third of the voters in Italy today
      are Communist, as are approximately one fourth of those in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman Catholicism opposes Communism, of course, as one totalitarian system
      opposes another. And for propaganda purposes she even attempts to present
      herself as the chief opponent of, and the chief bulwark against,
      Communism. But the fact is that during the past fifteen years Communism
      has made its greatest gains in Roman Catholic nations, both in Europe and
      in Latin America, while the Protestant nations, the United States,
      Britain, Canada, Holland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, have been its most
      effective opponents. It is in reality only a short step from a
      totalitarian church to a totalitarian state, since the people have been
      trained to accept authority as it is imposed upon them rather than to
      think for themselves and to manage their own affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his very informative book, American Freedom and Catholic Power , Paul
      Blanshard, American sociologist and journalist who has written extensively
      on church-state relations, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In several great crises in Europe the Vatican has, through passive and
      active collaboration with fascism, thrown the balance of power against
      democracy. ... It has aligned itself with the most reactionary forces in
      Europe and Latin America. Surely it is not by accident that the two most
      fascist nations in the world today—Spain and Portugal—are Catholic nations
      whose dictators have been blessed by the pope and are conspicuously loyal
      to him! The Vatican’s affinity with fascism is neither accidental nor
      incidental. Catholicism conditions its people to accept censorship,
      thought control, and ultimately dictatorship” (Rev. ed., 1958, p. 291;
      Beacon Press, Boston).
    </p>
    <p>And Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, a former Roman Catholic, says:</p>
    <p>
      “Catholicism is the fascist form of Christianity of which Calvinism
      represents its democratic wing. The Catholic hierarchy rests fully and
      securely on the leadership principle with the infallible pope in supreme
      command for a lifetime. ... Like the Fascist party, its priesthood becomes
      a medium for an undemocratic minority rule by a hierarchy. ... Catholic
      nations follow fascist doctrines more willingly than Protestant nations,
      which are the main strongholds of democracy. Democracy lays its stress on
      personal conscience; fascism on authority and obedience” (Crusade for
      Pan-Europe, p. 173).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the United States should become Roman Catholic, the result undoubtedly
      would be the rapid conquest of this country and the rest of the world by
      Russian Communism. In view of the weak defense that the Roman Catholic
      countries are able to put up intellectually, morally, or militarily, we
      are safe in saying that one of the surest ways to turn this nation
      Communist would be to turn it first to Roman Catholicism. We have acted as
      a strong restraint in keeping Roman Catholic nations from going Communist.
      But who would restrain this nation? There would be no other to serve that
      purpose, and our descent would be sure and swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that much of the popular support that the puppet governments
      behind the Iron Curtain have received has been given because they have
      forbidden the Roman Catholic Church to take any part in political affairs
      or to control the schools. In several countries, both in Europe and in
      Latin America, the only choice the people have is either Romanism or
      Communism. Protestantism, as an alternative choice, is practically
      non-existent. Those people have been taught hatred for Protestantism from
      childhood, and few of them would try it. Many vote Communist, not because
      they believe in the program, but because it is the only effective
      instrument they have to oppose Roman Catholicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, to see what the effect of Protestantism is upon a
      people we turn to the United States, where with complete separation of
      church and state the Reformation has made its greatest advance, and to
      Britain and the other nations where Protestantism has long been the
      dominant religion. These we find are unquestionably the most enlightened
      and advanced nations of the world; and in the main it is from these
      nations, where the people are accustomed to think and act for themselves
      and to govern themselves in both church and state, that the opposition to
      Communism has come.

    <h2>Romanism an Age-Long Development</h2>
    <p>
      One of the first things that we want to point out in this study is that
      the Roman Catholic Church has not always been what it is today. Rather, it
      has reached its present state as the result of along, slow process of
      development as through the centuries one new doctrine, or ritual, or
      custom after another has been added. Even a superficial reading of the
      following list will make clear that most of the distinctive features of
      the system were unknown to Apostolic Christianity, and that one can hardly
      recognize in present day Romanism the original Christian doctrines. Not
      all dates can be given with exactness since some doctrines and rituals
      were debated or practiced over a period of time before their formal
      acceptance.

      day, fish day, meat days, incense, holy oil, holy palms, Christopher
      medals, charms, novenas, and still others.
    </p>
    <p>
      There you have it—the melancholy evidence of Rome’s steadily increasing
      departure from the simplicity of the Gospel, a departure so radical and
      far-reaching at the present time that it has produced a drastically
      anti-evangelical church. It is clear beyond possibility of doubt that the
      Roman Catholic religion as now practiced is the outgrowth of centuries of
      error. Human inventions have been substituted for Bible truth and
      practice. Intolerance and arrogance have replaced the love and kindness
      and tolerance that were the distinguishing qualities of the first century
      Christians, so that now in Roman Catholic countries Protestants and others
      who are sincere believers in Christ but who do not acknowledge the
      authority of the pope are subject to all kinds of restrictions and in some
      cases even forbidden to practice their religion. The distinctive attitude
      of the present day Roman Church was fixed largely by the Council of Trent
      (1545-1563), with its more than 100 anathemas or curses pronounced against
      all who then or in the future would dare to differ with its decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think what all of this means! Each of the above doctrines or practices can
      be pin-pointed to the exact or approximate date at which it became a part
      of the system. And no single one of them became a part of the system until
      centuries after the time of Christ! Most of these doctrines and practices
      are binding on all Roman Catholics, for they have been proclaimed by a
      supposedly infallible pope or church council. To deny any doctrine or
      practice so proclaimed involves one in mortal sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      What will be next? Indications are that it will be another proclamation
      concerning Mary. Two new doctrines are under discussion: Mary as
      Mediatrix, and Mary as Co-redemptrix. Important Roman Catholic authorities
      have already indicated that these will be the next doctrines officially
      proclaimed. Mary is being presented in current Roman teaching as a
      Mediator along with Christ. She is said to be the “Mediatrix of all
      graces,” and the people are being told that the way to approach Christ is
      through His mother. “To Christ through Mary,” is the slogan. Her images
      outnumber those of Christ, and more prayer is offered to her than to
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also being said that Mary’s sufferings, particularly those at the
      cross, were redemptive in the same sense that Christ’s sufferings were
      redemptive. It would seem that these two doctrines, if adopted, would in
      effect place Mary as a fourth member of the Godhead, along with the
      Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And presumably these doctrines, if adopted,
      will be officially announced by the pope, for he was proclaimed infallible
      in this regard in 1870 and therefore no longer needs the authority of an
      ecumenical council.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still the Roman Church boasts that she never changes or teaches new
      doctrines! <em>Semper idem</em> —“Always the same”—is her motto! The fact
      that not one of the doctrines in the above list has any support in the
      Bible disproves conclusively the claim of the priests that their religion
      is the same as that taught by Christ and that the popes have been the
      faithful custodians of that truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that many of the above listed rites and ceremonies were taken
      directly from paganism or from Old Testament Judaism. Some scholars say
      that as much as 75 percent of the Roman ritual is of pagan origin. John
      Henry Newman, later cardinal, in his book,
      <em>The Development of the Christian Religion</em>, admits that “Temples,
      incense, oil lamps, votive offerings, holy water, holy days and seasons of
      devotion, processions, blessings of fields, sacerdotal vestments, the
      tonsure (of priests, monks, and nuns), images, etc., are all of pagan
      origin” (p. 359).
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Roman Church has been so free to hurl the name “heretic” at all
      who differ with her, the above list shows that the real heretics are the
      Roman Catholics themselves, and that the true orthodox are the evangelical
      Christians. Says the Scripture:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But in vain do they worship me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts
      of men. ... Making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have
      delivered: and many such like things ye do” (Mark 7:7,13).
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according to this
      word, surely there is no morning for them” (Isaiah 8:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely the Apostle Paul knew the human tendency to add to the Word of God
      when he gave this warning to the early church:
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you,
      not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves shall men arise,
      speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them” (Acts
      20:29-30). And even more strongly: “But though we, or an angel from
      heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we
      preached unto you, let him be anathema” (Galatians 1:8).

    <h2>Protestantism and First Century Christianity</h2>
    <p>
      Ever since New Testament times there have been people who accepted the
      basic principles now set forth in Protestantism. That is, they took the
      Bible as their authoritative standard of belief and practice. They were
      not called Protestants. Neither were they called Roman Catholics. They
      were simply called Christians. During the first three centuries they
      continued to base their faith solely on the Bible. They often faced
      persecution, sometimes from the Jews, sometimes from the pagans of the
      Roman empire. But early in the fourth century the emperor Constantine, who
      was the ruler in the West, began to favor Christianity, and then in the
      year 324, after he had become ruler of all of the empire, made
      Christianity the official religion. The result was that thousands of
      people who still were pagans pressed into the church in order to gain the
      special advantages and favors that went with such membership. They came in
      far greater numbers than could be instructed or assimilated. Having been
      used to the more elaborate pagan rituals, they were not satisfied with the
      simple Christian worship but began to introduce their heathen beliefs and
      practices. Gradually, through the neglect of the Bible and the ignorance
      of the people, more and more heathen ideas were introduced until the
      church became more heathen than Christian. Many of the heathen temples
      were taken over by the church and re-dedicated as Christian churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus in time there was found in the church a sacrificing and gorgeously
      appareled priesthood, an elaborate ritual, images, holy water, incense,
      monks and nuns, the doctrine of purgatory, and in general a belief that
      salvation was to be achieved by works rather than by grace. The church in
      Rome, and in general the churches throughout the empire, ceased to be the
      apostolic Christian church, and became for the most part a religious
      monstrosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained, however, some groups, small in numbers, usually in
      isolated places, and later primarily in the mountains of northern Italy,
      who maintained the Christian faith in reasonable purity. There were also
      individuals throughout the church in all ages, usually more or less
      independent of the church at large, who continued to hold quite correct
      ideas concerning the Christian faith. But the half paganized condition
      continued through the Middle Ages and on into the 16 th century when the
      religious revival in the West, known as the Reformation, shook the church
      to its foundations. At that time some scholars bean to study Bible
      manuscripts that had been brought to light by the forced flight of eastern
      monks from their monasteries as the Mohammedan invasions extended into
      Europe, and these scholars saw how far the church had departed from its
      original Scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      First there came the Renaissance, which was primarily a revival of
      learning, followed shortly by the Reformation. Some of the scholars in the
      church were called “Reformers.” They called the people back to the Bible,
      and there they saw how wrong and contrary to Scripture was the use of
      images, holy water, priests saying mass, and church services in Latin
      which the people could not understand. The Reformers strongly attacked the
      ignorance and superstition that had become such a large part of the church
      program, and gave the people a service in their own language with
      preaching based on the Word of God. Protestantism, therefore, was not a
      new religion, but a return to the faith of the early church. It was
      Christianity cleaned up, with all the rubbish that had collected during
      the Middle Ages thrown out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reformation, under Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, and Knox, was literally a
      “back-to-the-Bible” movement, a return to apostolic Christianity.
      Evangelical Christianity has established itself as the historic faith of
      the first century, which came down through the ante-Nicene Fathers and
      Augustine, which was largely obscured during the Middle Ages, but which
      burst forth again in all its glory in the Reformation, and which has
      continued to grow and increase down to our own time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very name “Protestant,” first applied to those Reformers who protested
      against the decrees issued by the Diet of Spires, implies in its broader
      sense that the churches led by the Reformers “protested” against the false
      doctrines and practices that were contrary to the teachings of the New
      Testament. They demanded a return to the purity and simplicity of New
      Testament Christianity. Protestantism did not begin with Luther and
      Calvin. It began with the Gospel, with the life and death and resurrection
      of Christ. It teaches what the New Testament teaches, nothing more and
      nothing less. It was not founded on the writings of Luther, or Calvin, or
      any of the later writers, although those writings proved helpful in the
      work of the church. Evangelical Protestantism cannot change greatly, for
      it is founded on an unchanging Book, completed in the first century and
      declared in the creeds of all evangelical churches to be the Word of God.
      The names of Protestant churches are not very old, and the denominations
      differ in regard to some doctrines; but the churches are in quite close
      agreement concerning the essentials of the faith, each attempting to hold
      in its purity the teachings of Christ and the apostles. The disagreement
      and conflict which Rome attempts to picture as existing between Protestant
      denominations is for the most part exaggeration, and is due largely to
      Rome’s failure to understand what Protestantism really is.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, then, do we know whether or not any particular system sets forth true
      Christianity? By comparing it with a recognized standard, especially with
      the Bible which is the ultimate authority. Judged by that standard,
      evangelical Protestantism is the same system of truth that was set forth
      in the New Testament and practiced by the first century Christians. All
      accretions, such as purgatory, the authority of tradition, the priesthood,
      the papacy, the worship of the Virgin Mary and the saints, the veneration
      of relics, auricular confession (“auricular”—pertaining to the
      ear—auricular confession, therefore, means confession in the ear of a
      priest), penance, etc., are totally without Scriptural basis and should be
      branded as false.

  <section>
    <h2>Contrast Between Protestant and Roman Catholic Countries</h2>
    <p>
      It is a fact beyond challenge that the Protestant countries of Europe and
      the Americas have been comparatively strong, progressive, enlightened, and
      free, while the Roman Catholic countries have remained relatively
      stationary or have stagnated and have had to be aided economically and
      politically by the Protestant nations. The Middle Ages were dark because
      Romanism was dominant and unchallenged. The light that we enjoy, which was
      first manifested in Europe and then in America, we owe to the Protestant
      Reformation. How appropriate the inscription on the Reformation monument
      in Geneva —Post tenebris lux, “After the darkness, light”!
    </p>
    <p>
      The lesson of history is that Romanism means the loss of religious liberty
      and the arrest of national progress. If after living in the United States
      one who was not aware of the contrast between Protestant and Roman
      Catholic cultures were to visit some Roman Catholic countries in Europe or
      Latin America, not merely to see places that have been fixed up to attract
      tourists but to live for some time among the common people, it would make
      him sick at heart to see the ignorance, poverty, superstition, illiteracy,
      suppression of religious freedom, and legalized prostitution which
      particularly in Latin America is found in practically every town of any
      size, a fairly consistent pattern in all of those areas—characteristics of
      heathenism, characteristics of Romanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Latin America, where the Roman Church has been dominant for four
      centuries with practically no competition from Protestantism, it has had
      ample opportunity to bring forth the true fruits of the system. And there,
      as a church, it has failed miserably. About 90 percent of the people have
      been baptized in the Roman Catholic Church, but probably not more than 10,
      or at most 15, percent are practicing Roman Catholics. The present writer
      is in receipt of a letter from a missionary in Bolivia who writes: “The
      Roman Catholic Church in Bolivia is not a Christian church at all but an
      unholy device for keeping the people in ignorance and poverty.” He added
      that Romanism the world over is one unified system, all under the control
      of the pope in Rome, and that it probably would be as bad in the United
      States if it were not for the restraining influence of the evangelical
      churches. Strong words those, but he was writing of a situation concerning
      which we know but little in this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Governments in Roman Catholic countries have been extremely unsteady.
      Repeatedly the people shoot up their governments or overthrow them.
      Practically all of those countries have been ruled by dictators at various
      times, and sometimes for long periods of time. Since the Second World War
      France has had repeated governmental crises, until a more stable situation
      was reached making General de Gaulle president and giving him dictatorial
      powers. Italy has had 32 governmental crises in 25 years, usually, as in
      France, characterized by resignation of the government, followed by a
      period of uncertainty and paralysis until a new election was held or a new
      alignment of parties was worked out. Spain, which is often pointed to as
      the model Catholic state, is governed under a concordat with the Vatican,
      has only one political party, the clerical-fascist party of General
      Franco, and has been under the dictatorship of Franco since 1938.
      Portugal, too, is a clerical-fascist state, under dictator Antonio
      Salazar. In that country the fall of the monarchy in 1910 was followed by
      a period of economic and political chaos, with 40 governmental changes in
      18 years, until Salazar became minister of finance in 1928 and prime
      minister with dictatorial powers in 1932, which position he has held ever
      since.<sup>1</sup> In the Latin American nations the overthrow of national
      governments, followed by periods of dictatorship, has occurred repeatedly
      during the past 15 years—those in Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Venezuela,
      Peru, Cuba, Chile, and Nicaragua having been the most recent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> Salazar’s dictatorship ended in 1968, and Franco’s ended in
      1975.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be passed off as mere chance that governments in Protestant
      countries, such as the United States, Britain, Canada, Holland, and the
      Scandinavian countries, have been so stable over long periods of time
      while those in the Roman Catholic countries have been so unstable. The
      result follows in part at least because of the contrasting doctrines of
      the relation that should exist between church and state. Protestantism
      holds that the church and the state are each of divine origin, that each
      is supreme in its own sphere and independent of the other. Romanism holds
      that power comes to the state through the church, that the church and
      state should be united with the church holding the superior position, that
      the pope as God’s representative on earth is above all temporal rulers,
      above all kings, presidents, and governors, that it is the duty of the
      state to maintain a political atmosphere favorable to the Roman Catholic
      Church, supporting it with public money while placing restrictions on all
      other churches, and that the state should do the bidding of the church in
      punishing heretics. Such doctrines undermine governments by weakening the
      confidence of the people in them, while the Protestant doctrines
      strengthen and support them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout history the Roman Church has sought to gain power from the
      state, but has never willingly relinquished power to the state. It has
      always resented paying taxes to the state, even on purely commercial
      properties that are owned and operated by it, and it has resented any laws
      requiring its priests to pay income taxes. The continual meddling of the
      Roman Church in politics, even to the extent of sponsoring Roman Catholic
      political parties where it is strong enough to do so (usually known as the
      “Christian Democratic” party, or a similar name, as in Italy, France,
      Germany, Holland, Belgium, etc.), has caused much resentment. That, no
      doubt, is also its plan for the United States if and when it becomes
      strong enough. Usually a political party is not instituted unless it can
      control at least one fourth of the total vote. How can any unprejudiced
      person face these facts and still not see the contrast between the two
      systems?
    </p>
    <p>
      We behold a strange phenomenon in the world today. While people in the
      predominantly Roman Catholic countries are struggling to throw off the
      yoke of the Roman Church, Protestant countries are welcoming it with open
      arms and allowing it to dictate policies of state, education, medicine,
      social life, entertainment, press, and radio. And in no Protestant country
      is this tendency more clearly seen than in the United States. For 32
      years, 1928-1960, one of our great political parties had an unbroken line
      of national party chairmen who were members of that church, and in 1960 it
      succeeded in electing a Roman Catholic president of the United States.
      Although the Constitution makes it illegal to favor one church above
      another, repeatedly in recent years bills have been passed by Congress and
      signed by nominally Protestant presidents granting very substantial favors
      to the Roman Catholic Church. More than $24,000,000 in public money has
      been given to the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines since the close
      of the Second World War, allegedly for war damages, while hardly one tenth
      that amount has been given to Protestant, Jewish, and other church groups
      in that country. In June, 1956, Congress passed, and President Eisenhower
      signed, a bill giving the Vatican nearly one million dollars ($964,199)
      for the refurnishing of the pope’s summer home at Castel Gandolfo, just
      outside the city of Rome, Italy—allegedly as war damages inflicted by
      American air raids, although the State Department has held that this
      country has no legal obligation for such damages. In election years, when
      no one wants to vote against the Roman Catholic Church, Congress is
      particularly vulnerable to such pressures. But nothing was appropriated to
      restore Protestant churches in Italy or in the other war-ravaged
      countries! Those had no lobby in Washington to represent their cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      About 80 percent of the money provided by the government under the
      Hill-Burton bill for the building and operation of sectarian hospitals in
      the United States ($112,000,000 during the first ten years of its
      operation) went to Roman Catholic institutions as that church eagerly took
      such money, while most Protestant churches, desirous of maintaining the
      principle of separation of church and state, were reluctant to accept it.
      In various places, particularly in the bigger cities governed by Roman
      Catholic officials, public properties, such as schools, hospitals,
      building sites, etc., have been turned over to the Roman Catholic Church
      at give-away prices. Similar things happen in England, where, for
      instance, parochial schools receive 95 percent of their total costs from
      the public treasury—but even so, the hierarchy is not satisfied and is
      demanding complete financial equality with the public schools, which, of
      course, is fair warning of what the Roman Church would like to achieve in
      this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hold that Roman Catholicism is able to maintain over large numbers of
      people, not only in Europe and Latin America but also in the United
      States, is due in part to its appeal to unregenerate human nature. The
      Roman concept of sin is quite different from that of Protestantism. Rome
      does not demand reform in her people. As long as they acknowledge the
      church and meet the external requirements they are allowed to do about as
      they please. In our country witness the many corrupt politicians and
      gangsters in our cities in recent years who have been members of that
      church and who have remained in good standing while continuing their evil
      course over long periods of time. A case in point is that of Tom
      Pendergast, in Kansas City, who with a large number of his accomplices
      finally was sent to the penitentiary. When he died the Roman Catholic
      priest who conducted his funeral praised him as a friend and commended his
      loyalty to his church, because, it was said, he had not missed mass in 30
      years. It can be assumed that Roman Catholicism will remain popular as
      long as the majority of men remain unregenerate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the real cause of Roman Catholic growth and success is not to be found
      so much in its aggressive policy in infiltrating governments, schools,
      press, radio, etc., nor in its lax moral code. It is to be found rather in
      the indifference of Protestants and their lack of devotion to their own
      evangelical message. Modernistic and liberal theology has so enervated
      many of the churches that they have little zeal left to propagate their
      faith. Let Protestantism return to its evangelical message and to the type
      of missionary zeal that governed the early Christians, and let Protestants
      challenge Rome to full and open debate regarding the distinctive doctrines
      that separate the two systems, and it will be seen that the one thing Rome
      does not want is public discussion. Rome prefers to assert her alleged
      “rights” and to have them accepted without too much question. But
      Protestantism has the truth, and can win this battle any time that it is
      willing to force the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this regard J. Marcellus Kik, former associate editor of Christianity
      Today , has written:
    </p>
    <p>
      “That there is still a remnant of paganism and papalism in the world is
      chiefly the fault of the church. The Word of God is just as powerful in
      our generation as it was during the early history of the church. The power
      of the Gospel is just as strong in this century as in the days of the
      Reformation. These enemies could be completely vanquished if the
      Christians of this day and age were as vigorous, as bold, as earnest, as
      prayerful, and as faithful as Christians were in the first several
      centuries and in the time of the Reformation” ( Revelation Twenty , p.
      74).
    </p>
    <p>
      Protestants do not desire controversy merely for the sake of controversy,
      and often shrink from engaging in it. But in this time of rising tensions
      certain issues must be faced. Rome continues to press her propaganda
      drive. Where she is in the majority she takes special privileges for
      herself and places restrictions on, or prohibits, other churches. Where
      she is in the minority she asks for special favors, favors which by no
      stretch of the imagination are ever given to Protestants in Roman Catholic
      countries, and seeks quietly to infiltrate the government, schools, press,
      radio, hospitals, etc. When Protestants are in the majority they tend to
      ignore those things. But when some major issue arises, such as the
      nomination of an American ambassador to the Vatican, or the nomination of
      a Roman Catholic for President of the United States, Protestant opposition
      does become vocal. A few years ago when President Truman sent the name of
      General Mark Clark to the Senate for confirmation as American ambassador
      to the Vatican, there was vigorous protest and a full scale debate was
      fast arising when General Clark requested that his name be withdrawn. All
      that the hierarchy could do was to run for cover and cry “bigot” and
      “persecutor” at anyone who opposed such a tie-up with the Vatican. They
      definitely did not want a public debate. But the result of such events is
      to bring out into the open the issues which normally are more or less kept
      under cover, and to afford opportunity for discussion of the issues on
      their merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind of society that Roman Catholicism has produced in other countries
      where it has been dominant should serve as a fair warning as to what we
      can expect if it becomes dominant here. What clearer warning do we need?
      Let us take a good look at conditions in those countries and then ask
      ourselves if a Roman Catholic America is the kind of heritage we desire
      for ourselves and the kind we want to pass on to later generations.
      Through the indifference of Protestants and the aggressiveness of
      Romanists we are in danger of losing the very things that have made this
      nation great.

      Scripture quotations throughout this book for the most part are from the
      American Standard Version of 1901 rather than the King James Version since
      the former is generally conceded to be more accurate. Quotations from the
      Roman Catholic Confraternity Version are designated as such.
