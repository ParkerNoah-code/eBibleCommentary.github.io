            In our twentieth century America few among us seem to realize what a priceless heritage
we possess in the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and
freedom of assembly that is an integral part of our everyday life. Nor are many aware of
the bitter and prolonged struggles our forefathers went through at the time of the
Reformation and later to secure these freedoms. Instead it is quite the common thing to
take these for granted and to assume that they are the natural rights of all men. But truly
those of us who call ourselves Protestants are the inheritors of a great tradition. And in a
country such as the United States our Roman Catholic friends also share these freedoms,
little realizing what it means to live under a clerical dictatorship such as their church
imposes wherever it has the power.
        </p>
        <p>
Roman Catholics often attempt to represent Protestantism as something comparatively
new, as having originated with Martin Luther and John Calvin in the 16
th
century. We do
indeed owe a great debt to those leaders and to the Reformation movement that swept
over Europe at that time. But the basic principles and the common system of doctrine
taught by those Reformers and by the evangelical churches ever since go back to the New
Testament and to the first century Christian church. Protestantism as it emerged in the
16
th
century was not the beginning of something new, but a return to Bible Christianity
and to the simplicity of the Apostolic church from which the Roman Church had long
since departed.

        </p>
        <p>
            The positive and formal principle of this system is that the Bible is the Word of God and
therefore the authoritative rule of faith and practice. Its negative principle is that any
element of doctrine or practice in the church which cannot be traced back to the New
Testament is no essential part of Christianity.
</p>
<p>
The basic features of Protestant belief therefore are:
</p>
<p>
The supremacy of the Bible in all matters of faith and practice.
</p>
<p>
Justification by faith, not by works, although works have their necessary and logical
place as the fruits and proof of true faith.
</p>
<p>
The right of the individual to go directly to God in prayer apart from the mediation of any
priest or other human intermediary.
</p>
<p>
Individual freedom of conscience and worship, within the authority of the Bible.
</p>
<p>
For more than a thousand years before the Reformation the popes had controlled Europe
and had said that there was only one way to worship God. That period is appropriately
known as the “Dark Ages.” In the church and, to a considerable extent, in the state, too,
the priests held the power. They suppressed the laity until practically all their rights were
taken away. They constantly pried into private affairs, interfering even between husband
and wife and between parents and children by means of the confessional. All marriage
was in their hands. They interfered in the administration of public affairs, in the
proceedings of the courts, and in the disposition of estates. The revenues of the state built
new churches and paid the salaries of the priests in much the same manner as in present
day Spain. Anyone who dared resist ran the risk of losing his job, his property, and even
his life. Life under such tyranny was intolerable. From that condition the Reformation
brought deliverance.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the first and most important results of the Reformation was that the Bible was
given to the people in their own languages. Previously the Bible had been kept from
them, on the pretext that only the church speaking through the priest could interpret it
correctly. Luther translated the Bible into his native German, and edition followed edition
in rapid succession. Similar translations were made in England, France, Holland, and
other countries.
</p>
<p>
Protestants of our day who have not been called upon to suffer or to make any sacrifices
to secure this rich heritage are inclined to hold these blessings lightly. But the advances
that Romanism is making today in this nation and in other parts of the world should cause
even the most careless to stop and think. It seems that as Protestants we have forgotten
how to protest against those same religious and political abuses that were common before
the Reformation. We need to acquaint ourselves with and to teach the principles of our
faith if we are not to be overwhelmed by a religious despotism that, if it gains the upper
hand, will be as cruel and oppressive as ever it was in Germany, Italy, France, or Spain.
</p>
<p>
Our American freedoms are being threatened today by two totalitarian systems,
Communism and Roman Catholicism. And of the two in our country Romanism is
growing faster than is Communism and is the more dangerous since it covers its real
nature with a cloak of religion. This nation has been well alerted to the dangers of
Communism, and it is generally opposed by the radio, the press, and the churches. But
Romanism has the support of these to a considerable extent, and even the Protestant
churches in many places take a conciliatory and cooperative attitude toward it. Most
people have only a very hazy notion as to what is involved in the Roman system. And yet
the one consuming purpose of the Vatican is to convert the entire world, not to
Christianity, but to Roman Catholicism. Its influence is being applied vigorously at every
level of our local, state, and federal government. It is particularly significant that in this
country the hierarchy has taken as its slogan, not, “Make America Christian,” but, “Make
America Catholic.” And in that slogan are the strong overtones of a full scale attack upon
our Protestant heritage and those precious rights of freedom of religion, freedom of
conscience, and freedom of speech.
        </p>
        <p>
            We cannot adequately understand this problem unless we realize that the kind of Roman
Catholicism that we see in the United States is, for the most part, not real Roman
Catholicism at all, that is, not Roman Catholicism as it exists where it is the dominant
force in the life of a nation, but a modified and compromised form that has adjusted itself
to life with a Protestant majority. Here it is comparatively reticent about asserting its
claims to be the only true church, the only church that has a right to conduct public
religious services, its right to suppress all other forms of religion, its superiority to all
national and state governments, its control over all marriage, its right to direct all
education, and the obligation of the state to support its churches and schools with tax
money. That this is no visionary list of charges, but a cold and realistic appraisal, is
shown by the fact that in Spain, which is governed under the terms of a concordat with
the Vatican, and which is often praised by Roman Catholic spokesmen as the ideal
Catholic state, the Roman Church is now exercising most of these so-called “rights” or
privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to see clearly what Roman Catholicism really is, we must see it as it was during
the Middle Ages, or as it has continued to be in certain countries such as Spain, Portugal,
Italy, France, Southern Ireland, and Latin America, where it has had political as well as
ecclesiastical control. In those countries where it has been dominant for centuries with
little or no opposition from Protestantism, we see the true fruits of the system in the lives
of the people, with all of their poverty, ignorance, superstition, and low moral standards.
In each of those countries a dominant pattern is discernible. Spain is a particularly good
example, for it is the most Roman Catholic country in Europe, yet it has the lowest
standard of living of any nation in Europe. The Latin American nations have been
predominantly Roman Catholic for four centuries, and today the illiteracy rate ranges
from 30 to 70 percent. The veteran radio political analyst, Howard K. Smith, recently
reported that “The average per capita income in the United States is eight times that of
any country in South America” (March 3, 1960). The average per capita income in South
America is $280, one ninth that in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            But even in those countries we do not see the ultimate fruits of the system. For over a
period of years they have been influenced to some extent by Protestantism and they have
been receiving assistance from the Protestant nations, particularly from the United States
and England, so that their present condition, economic, social, political, and religious, is
not nearly as bad as it would have been had they been left to themselves. Substantial aid
has been given since the close of the First World War. American foreign aid, economic
and military, granted to other nations since the Second World War through 1977,
amounted to $200 billion (Statistical Abstract of the U.S., 1978). And probably $50
billion more has been granted since that time, making a total of approximately $250
billion. The Roman Catholic nations of Europe and Latin America have profited greatly
through this assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
            American Catholicism, so different on the surface from that found in Spain, Italy, and
Latin America, is, nevertheless, all a part of the same church, all run from Rome and by
the same man who is the absolute ruler over all of the branches and who has the authority
to change policy in any of those branches as he deems it safe or expedient. If he chose to
give his subjects in Spain or Colombia relatively more freedom and better schools, such
as are enjoyed by those in the United States, he could readily do so by directing his
priests and financial resources to that end. Undoubtedly Romanism in the United States
would be much the same as that found in other countries were it not for the influence of
evangelical Christianity as set forth by the Protestant churches.
