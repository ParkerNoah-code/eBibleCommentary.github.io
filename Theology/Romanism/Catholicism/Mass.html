      “The Holy Eucharist: And while they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and
      blessed and brake, and gave it to his disciples, and said, ‘Take and eat;
      this is my body.’ And taking a cup, he gave thanks and gave it to them,
      saying, ‘All of you drink this; for this is my blood of the new covenant,
      which is being shed for many unto the forgiveness of sins’” (Confraternity
      Version, Matthew 26:26-28).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Institution of the Eucharist: For I myself have received from the Lord
      (what I also delivered to you), that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which
      he was betrayed, took bread, and giving thanks, broke, and said, ‘This is
      my body which shall be given up for you; do this in remembrance of me.’ In
      like manner also the cup, after he had supped, saying, ‘This cup is the
      new covenant in my blood: do this as often as you drink it, in remembrance
      of me. For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the cup, you
      proclaim the death of the Lord, until he comes’” (Confraternity Version, 1
      Corinthians 11:23-26).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New York Catechism we read: “Jesus Christ gave us the sacrifice of
      the Mass to leave to His Church a visible sacrifice which continues His
      sacrifice on the cross until the end of time. The Mass is the same
      sacrifice as the sacrifice of the cross [italics ours]. Holy Communion is
      the receiving of the body and blood of Jesus Christ under the appearance
      of bread and wine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Creed of Pope Pius IV, which is one of the official creeds of the
      Roman Church, says: “I profess that in the Mass is offered to God a true,
      proper, and propitiatory sacrifice [that is, a sacrifice which satisfies
      the justice of God and so offsets the penalty for sin] for the living and
      the dead; and that in the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist there is
      truly, really, and substantially, the body and blood, together with the
      soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that there is a
      conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the body, and of the
      whole substance of the wine into the blood, which the Catholic Church
      calls Transubstantiation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council of Trent declared: “The sacrifice [in the Mass] is identical
      with the sacrifice of the Cross, inasmuch as Jesus Christ is a priest and
      victim both. The only difference lies in the manner of offering, which is
      bloody upon the cross and bloodless on our altars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A Roman Catholic, John A. O’Brien, whose books are widely read, says: “The
      Mass with its colorful vestments and vivid ceremonies is a dramatic
      re-enactment in an unbloody manner of the sacrifice of Christ on Calvary”
      ( The Faith of Millions, p. 382).

    <h2>The Nature of the Mass</h2>
    <p>
      The words of Matthew 26:26-28 and 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, particularly the
      words, “This is my body,” and “This is my blood,” may seem to be quite
      simple and easy to understand. But the fact is that they probably are the
      most controverted words in the history of theological doctrine, and
      probably have caused more division within the church than any others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is surprising how many Protestants do not understand the significance
      of the Roman Catholic mass. Some think of it as merely a church ritual and
      dismiss it as just another form of the Lord’s Supper or holy communion.
      But that is far from being the case. For Protestants and Roman Catholics
      alike, the Lord’s Supper or holy communion is a sacrament. For Protestants
      it is a means of spiritual blessing and a memorial service, recalling to
      mind the glorious person of Christ and the great service that He rendered
      for us on Calvary. But for Roman Catholics it is something quite
      different. For them it is also a sacrifice , performed by a priest. And
      its sacrificial element is by far the most important. In fact the
      sacrifice of the mass is the central point in their worship, while even
      the preaching of the Gospel is assigned a subordinate role and is not even
      held to be an essential of the priestly office.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Roman Church this further distinction should be noted between the
      two parts of the mass—the mass proper, and holy communion. In the mass the
      so-called sacrifice is offered only by the priest and only he partakes of
      both the bread and the wine. In holy communion the people partake of the
      bread but not of the wine and have no other active part in the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Roman teaching, in the sacrifice of the mass the bread and
      wine are changed by the power of the priest at the time of consecration
      into the actual body and blood of Christ. The bread, in the form of thin,
      round wafers, hundreds of which may be consecrated simultaneously, is
      contained in a golden dish. The wine is in a golden cup. The supposed body
      and blood of Christ are then raised before the altar by the hands of the
      priest and offered up to God for the sins both of the living and the dead.
      During this part of the ceremony the people are little more than
      spectators to a religious drama. Practically everything is done by the
      priest, or by the priest and his helpers. The audience does not sing, nor
      are there any spontaneous prayers either on the part of the priest or the
      people. The liturgy is so rigid that it can be carried out mechanically,
      almost without thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the observance of holy communion the priest partakes of a large wafer,
      then he drinks the wine in behalf of the congregation. The lay members go
      to the front of the church and kneel before a railing, with closed eyes,
      and open mouths into which the priest places a small wafer. Roman Catholic
      theology holds that the complete body and blood of Christ are in both the
      bread and the wine. At this point one is tempted to ask, If the priest can
      partake of the wine for the congregation, why may he not also partake of
      the bread for the congregation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly it was required that anyone partaking of the mass must have
      abstained from any form of food or drink, even water, since midnight—hence
      the need for early mass. That, however, caused many to become indifferent.
      Now one has to abstain from solid food for only one hour before receiving
      communion, and he does not have to abstain from water at all. Yet the New
      Testament tells us that Christ instituted the Lord’s Supper immediately
      after He and the disciples had eaten the Passover feast. If Christ had no
      objection to the bread being mixed with other food, why should the Roman
      Church object?
    </p>
    <p>
      The elaborate ritual of the mass is really an extended pageant, designed
      to re-enact the experiences of Christ from the supper in the upper room,
      through the agony in the garden, the betrayal, trial, crucifixion, death,
      burial, resurrection, and ascension. It is a drama crowding the detailed
      events of many days into the space of one hour or less. For its proper
      performance the priest in seminary goes through long periods of training
      and needs a marvelous memory. Witness the following: he makes the sign of
      the cross sixteen times, turns toward the congregation six times, lifts
      his eyes to heaven eleven times, kisses the altar eight times, folds his
      hands four times, strikes his breast ten times, bows his head twenty-one
      times, genuflects eight times, bows his shoulders seven times, blesses the
      altar with the sign of the cross thirty times, lays his hands flat on the
      altar twenty-nine times, prays secretly eleven times, prays aloud thirteen
      times, takes the bread and wine and turns it into the body and blood of
      Christ, covers and uncovers the chalice ten times, goes to and fro twenty
      times, and in addition performs numerous other acts.<sup>1</sup> His
      bowings and genuflections are imitations of Christ in His agony and
      suffering. The various articles of clothing worn by the priest at
      different stages of the drama represent those worn by Christ—the seamless
      robe, the purple coat, the veil with which His face was covered in the
      house of Caiaphas, a girdle representing the cords with which He was bound
      in the garden, the cords which bound Him to the cross, etc. If the priest
      forgets even one element of the drama he commits a great sin and
      technically may invalidate the mass. Add to the above the highly colored
      robes of the clergy, the candles, bells, incense, music, special church
      architecture of the chancel often in gleaming white, and the fact that the
      mass is said or sung in an unknown tongue, Latin, which is not understood
      by the people, and you see something of the complexity of the program.
      Surely there was much truth in Voltaire’s remark concerning the mass as
      practiced in the cathedrals of France in his day, that it was “the grand
      opera of the poor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a miserable form of play-acting is all of that! What a poor
      substitute for the Gospel do the people depend on for eternal life! In
      contrast how simple was the scene in the upper room as Christ instituted
      the Lord’s Supper! In 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, in just four verses, Paul
      outlines the whole simple service: The Lord Jesus in the night in which He
      was betrayed took bread; He gave thanks; He broke the bread; and He gave
      it to them as a memorial of His body which was to be broken for them. Just
      four simple actions concerning the bread. Then two actions are recorded
      concerning the wine: He took the cup, and He gave it to them as symbolical
      of His blood which was to be shed for them. All that we are asked to
      remember is that He died to save sinners and that we are so to commemorate
      His death until He returns. But this simple event the Church of Rome has
      magnified into the glaring, elaborate, showy pageantry and drama of the
      mass!
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> The liturgy of the mass was considerably simplified in 1965,
      and can now be said in the colloquial language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The celebration of the mass is the chief duty of the Roman priesthood. Yet
      the New Testament gives no instruction as to how to offer mass, and in
      fact there is not so much as one line on the subject in Scripture. Christ
      sent the apostles to teach and to baptize, not to say mass. His final
      instructions to the church were: “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of
      all the nations, baptizing them... teaching them...” (Matthew 28:19).
      Search the Gospels, the book of Acts, and the Epistles, and you find many
      admonitions to prayer, praise, preaching the Gospel, but not one word
      about the mass. Paul gave many instructions and exhortations concerning
      the government and duties of the churches, but he says nothing about the
      sacrifice of the mass. For centuries the sacrificing priesthood of the Old
      Testament era had been typical of the one true Priest who was to come. But
      after He had come and had accomplished His work there was no further need
      to continue the empty forms. So the priesthood, having served its purpose,
      was abolished, and Christ made no provision for His apostles and ministers
      to continue any kind of sacrifice. The writer of the Epistle to the
      Hebrews has much to say about the endless repetition and futility of the
      ancient sacrifices. He shows that their only value was to symbolize and
      point forward to the one true sacrifice that was to be made by Christ. “We
      have been sanctified,” he said, “through the offering of the body of Jesus
      Christ once for all. And every priest indeed standeth day by day
      ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifice which can never
      take away sins; but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sin for
      ever, sat down on the right hand of God; henceforth expecting till his
      enemies be made the footstool of his feet. For by one offering he hath
      perfected for ever them that are sanctified” (10:10-14). The New
      Testament, therefore, announces the termination of all sacrifices,
      declaring that Christ alone is our true sacrifice, and that He offered
      Himself “once for all,” thus forever ending all other sacrifices.
    </p>
    <p>
      It staggers the imagination to realize that a merely human pantomime so
      absurd and so contradictory to Holy Scripture could be accepted and
      slavishly attended day after day and week after week by thinking men and
      women. Since the New Testament gives no instructions at all about the
      continuation of the Old Testament sacrifices, it was necessary for the
      Roman priesthood to invent a new kind of sacrifice. This they did by
      making a frivolous distinction between the “bloody” sacrifice of Christ on
      the cross, and the “unbloody” sacrifice which they pretend to offer in the
      mass. A priest, of course, must have a sacrifice, for that is the
      distinguishing mark of his profession. A priest without a sacrifice is
      simply no priest at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the true observance of the Lord’s Supper the symbolism is found in the
      bread and wine. But in the Roman ceremony no place is left for that
      symbolism, for the bread and wine become the actual flesh and blood of
      Christ so that He is literally present. The newly developed symbolism in
      the Roman ceremony centers in the priest at the altar—his consecration of
      the host, his vestments, and his various movements which constitute “the
      drama of the mass.” Rome destroys the symbolism of the elements, which
      recalls the sacrifice on Calvary, and substitutes the symbolism of the one
      who administers the sacrament.
    </p>
    <p>Concerning the altar at which the priest ministers. Dr. Harris says:</p>
    <p>
      “It was probably the invention of the priesthood which brought in the
      altar. The early churches had no altar. The Jewish altar, done away in
      Christ, was a massive structure of brass on which a constantly burning
      fire consumed the Jewish offerings. It was a type, of course, of the cross
      on which Christ ‘once for all’ (Hebrews 9:26) offered Himself. An altar
      without fire is a contradiction in terms, just as an ‘unbloody sacrifice
      of the mass’ is a contradiction of the clear teaching of Scripture that
      ‘without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness’ (Hebrews 9:22),
      and, ‘we are justified by his blood’ (Romans 5:9, Confraternity ed.). The
      altar, as now used, is a Roman Catholic invention” (.Fundamental
      Protestant Doctrines, II, p. 5).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Protestant views concerning the elements in the Lord’s Supper can be
      stated very simply. They differ somewhat in regard to the symbolic
      significance of the bread and wine, but in regard to the event
      memorialized they agree that in the one sacrifice on Calvary Christ
      offered Himself once for all for the sins of His people. The following
      summary of Protestant views is given in the Christian Heritage Series,
      Book No. 1, pages 52 and 53:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Lutheran Church rejects the doctrine of transubstantiation and
      teaches that the elements are figurative. They insist, however, upon the
      real presence of Christ at the Supper; that is, He is present as the soul
      is in the body or magnetism is in the magnet. Theologians call this
      consubstantiation.” [Luther expressed this by saying that Christ is “in,
      with, and under” the elements.]
    </p>
    <p>
      “Reformed [and Presbyterian] congregations understand the words of Christ
      metaphorically. ‘This is (that is, signifies) my body.’ Along with this
      metaphorical understanding of the elements, however, is the idea that
      Christ is present virtually, or as Dr. Hodge puts it: ‘the virtues and
      effects of the sacrifice of the body of the Redeemer on the cross are made
      present and are actually conveyed in the sacrament to the worthy receiver
      by the power of the Holy Ghost, who uses the sacrament as His instrument
      according to His sovereign will.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “All other Protestant churches hold that the bread and wine are mere
      symbols of the body and blood of Christ, nothing more. The observance is a
      memorial only of His death for our sins, to be commemorated until He comes
      again.”

    <h2>The Mass the Same Sacrifice as on Calvary?</h2>
    <p>
      In a Roman Catholic Catechism of Christian Doctrine the question is asked:
      “Is the Holy Mass one and the same sacrifice with that of the Cross?”
      (Question 278). And the answer is given:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Holy Mass is one and the same sacrifice with that of the Cross,
      inasmuch as Christ, who offered Himself, a bleeding victim, on the Cross
      to His Heavenly Father, continues to offer Himself in an unbloody manner
      on the altar, through the ministry of His priests.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church of Rome holds that the mass is a continuation of the sacrifice
      that Christ made on Calvary, that it is in reality a re-crucifixion of our
      Lord over and over again, in an unbloody manner. It also holds that this
      sacrifice is just as efficacious to take away sin as was the sacrifice on
      Calvary. Christ supposedly is offered in sacrifice every time the mass is
      celebrated, that is, daily, in thousands of Roman Catholic churches
      throughout the world. The mass, therefore, is not a memorial, but a ritual
      in which the bread and wine are transformed into the literal flesh and
      blood of Christ, which is then offered as a true sacrifice. The only
      difference is the manner in which the two are made. Rome thus claims to
      continue an act which the Scriptures say was completed nearly two thousand
      years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sacrifice of the mass the Roman priest becomes an “Alter Christus
      ,” that is, “Another Christ,” in that he sacrifices the real Christ upon
      the altar and presents Him for the salvation of the faithful and for the
      deliverance of souls in purgatory. The Roman Church teaches that Christ,
      in the form of the “host” (the consecrated wafer), is in reality upon the
      altar, and that the priests have Him in their power, that they hold Him in
      their hands, and carry Him from place to place.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must, of course, take strong exception to such pretended sacrifice. We
      cannot regard it as anything other than a deception, a mockery, and an
      abomination before God. The so-called sacrifice in the mass certainly is
      not identical with that on Calvary, regardless of what the priests may
      say. There is in the mass no real Christ, no suffering, and no bleeding.
      And a bloodless sacrifice is ineffectual. The writer of the book of
      Hebrews says that “apart from shedding of blood there is no remission” of
      sin (9:22); and John says, “The blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from
      all sin” (1 John 1:7). Since admittedly there is no blood in the mass, it
      simply cannot be a sacrifice for sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament the ordinance of the Lord’s Supper is always
      presented as a sacrament, never as a sacrifice. Furthermore according to
      the Levitical law a sin offering was never to be eaten and all eating of
      blood, even animal blood, and much more the eating of human blood, was
      strictly forbidden. The fact that in the Lord’s Supper the elements are
      eaten is proof in itself that it was never intended to be a sacrifice.

    <h2>Transubstantiation</h2>
    <p>
      The word “transubstantiation” means a change of substance. The Church of
      Rome teaches that the whole substance of the bread and wine is changed
      into the literal physical body and blood of Christ. A Catechism of
      Christian Doctrine asks the question: “What is the Holy Mass?” and the
      answer is given:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Holy Mass is the sacrifice of the body and blood of Jesus Christ,
      really present on the altar under the appearance of bread and wine, and
      offered to God for the living and the dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of transubstantiation and the power of the priests is clearly
      stated by Liguori in the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “With regard to the power of the priests over the real body of Christ, it
      is of faith that when they pronounce the words of consecration, the
      incarnate God has obliged Himself to obey and come into their hands under
      the sacramental appearance of bread and wine. We are struck with wonder
      when we find that in obedience to the words of His priests— Hoc est corpus
      meum (This is my body)—God Himself descends on the altar, that He comes
      whenever they call Him, and as often as they call Him, and places Himself
      in their hands, even though they should be His enemies. And after having
      come He remains, entirely at their disposal and they move Him as they
      please from one place to another. They may, if they wish, shut Him up in
      the tabernacle, or expose Him on the altar, or carry Him outside the
      church; they may, if they choose, eat his flesh, and give Him for the food
      of others. Besides, the power of the priest surpasses that of the Blessed
      Virgin because she cannot absolve a Catholic from even the smallest sin”
      (The Dignity and Duties of the Priest).
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest supposedly is endowed with power by the bishop at the time of
      his ordination to change the bread and wine into the literal living body
      and blood of Christ, which is then known as the “host,” and to bring Him
      down upon the altar. And that body is said to be complete in all its
      parts, down to the last eyelash and toenail! How it can exist in thousands
      of places and in its full proportions, even in a small piece of bread, is
      not explained, but is taken on faith as a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed for a minute that modern Roman Catholics do not
      literally believe this jumble of medieval superstition. They have been
      taught it from infancy, and they do believe it. It is the very finest
      doctrine of their church. It is one of the chief doctrines, if indeed it
      is not the chief doctrine, upon which their church rests. The priests
      preach it literally and emphatically several times a year, and Roman
      Catholic laymen do not dare express any doubt about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the adoration of the consecrated “host,” the uplifted hands of he
      priest pretend to offer to God the very body and blood of Christ as a
      sacrifice for the living and the dead. Then, in the observance of the
      eucharist he pretends to eat Him alive, in the presence of the people,
      also to give Him to the people under the appearance of bread, to be eaten
      by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine of the mass, of course, is based on the assumption that the
      words of Christ, “This is my body,” and “This is my blood” (Matthew
      6:26-28), must be taken literally. The accounts of the institution of the
      Lord’s Supper, both in the Gospels and in Paul’s letter to the
      Corinthians, make it perfectly clear that He spoke in figurative terms.
      Jesus aid, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood” (Luke 22:20). And
      Paul quotes Jesus as saying: “This is the new covenant in my blood. ... or
      as oft as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s
      death till he come” (1 Corinthians 11:25-26). In these words He used a
      double figure of speech. The cup is put for the wine, and the wine is
      called the new covenant. The cup was not literally the new covenant,
      although it is declared to be so as definitely as the bread is declared to
      be His body. They did not literally drink the cup, nor did they literally
      drink the new covenant. How ridiculous to say that they did! Nor was the
      bread literally His body, or the wine His blood. After giving the wine to
      the disciples Jesus said, “I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit
      of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come” (Luke 22:18). So the
      wine, even as He gave it to them, and after He had given it to hem,
      remained “the fruit of the vine”! Paul too says that the bread remains
      bread: “Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread and drink the pup of the
      Lord in an unworthy manner. ... But let each man prove himself, and so let
      him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup” (1 Corinthians 1:27-28). No
      change had taken place in the elements. This was after the prayer of
      consecration, when the Church of Rome supposes the change took place, and
      Jesus and Paul both declare that the elements still are bread and wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another and more important proof that the bread and wine are not changed
      into the literal and actual flesh and blood of Christ is this: the literal
      interpretation makes the sacrament a form of cannibalism. For that is
      precisely what cannibalism is—the eating of human flesh. Rome attempts to
      deny this, but not with much logic. Clearly there is a contradiction in
      the Romanist explanation somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, how can Christ’s words, “This is my body,” and, “This is my
      blood,” be taken in a literal sense? At the time those words were spoken,
      the bread and wine were on the table before Him, and in His body He was
      sitting at the table a living man. The crucifixion had not taken place.
      They ate the Lord’s Supper before the crucifixion took place. Furthermore,
      we do not, and cannot memorialize someone who is present, as the Romanists
      say Christ is present in the mass. But in the future, in His absence,
      these things would symbolize His broken body and shed blood. They would
      then call to mind His sacrifice, and would then be taken in remembrance”
      of Him (1 Corinthians 11:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus’ words, “This do in remembrance of me,” show that the Lord’s Supper
      was not some kind of magical operation, but primarily a memorial,
      instituted to call Christians throughout the ages to remember the wondrous
      cross of the crucified Lord and all its marvelous benefits and lessons for
      us. A memorial does not present the reality, in this case His true body
      and blood, but something quite different, which serves only as a reminder
      of the real thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We often show a friend a photograph and say, “This is my wife”; “This is
      my son”; “This is my daughter.” Such language is readily understood in
      ordinary conversation. Nobody takes such words literally. The Bible is
      written in the language of the common people. Hence it is perfectly
      obvious to any observant reader that the Lord’s Supper was intended
      primarily as a simple memorial feast, in no sense a literal reincarnation
      of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that the real meaning of Christ’s words can be seen when they
      are compared with similar figurative language which He used in John
      4:13-14. There, speaking to the woman at Jacob’s well, He said: “Every one
      that drinketh this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the
      water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall
      give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal
      life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      On other occasions He used similar language. He said, “I am the door”
      (John 10:7), but of course He did not mean that He was a literal wooden
      door with lock and hinges. He said, “I am the vine” (John 15:5), but no
      one understood Him to mean that He was a grapevine. When He said, “I am
      the good shepherd” (John 10:14), He did not mean that He was actually a
      shepherd. When He said, “Ye must be born again,” (John 3:7), He referred
      not to a physical birth but to a spiritual birth. When He said, “Destroy
      this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (John 2:19), he meant
      His body, not the structure of wood and stone. When He said, “He that
      eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life” (John 6:54), He
      was speaking of a spiritual relationship between Himself and His people in
      terms of the Old Testament type, that is, eating the Passover lamb and
      drinking the Passover wine; but His Jewish hearers, being literalists, as
      are the Roman Catholics, misunderstood His words. He said, “Ye are the
      salt of the earth” (Matthew 5:13), and “Ye are the light of the world”
      (Matthew 5:14). He spoke of “the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees”
      (Matthew 16:6). James said, “The tongue is a fire” (3:6); and again, “Ye
      are a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away”
      (4:14). Moses spoke of “the bread of affliction” (Deuteronomy 16:3), and
      Isaiah spoke of “the bread of adversity and the water of affliction”
      (30:20). None of these statements is true if taken literally. The
      disciples had no trouble understanding Jesus’ figures of speech.
      Similarly, the expressions, “This is my body,” and “This is my blood,” are
      clear enough for all except those who will not see, or those who merely
      follow medieval theologians. It is unreasonable in the extreme to take
      these two expressions literally while taking the others figuratively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual eating of human flesh and blood is repulsive, abhorrent to all
      right minded people, and it was especially so to the Jews. Such practice
      is contrary to Scripture and to common sense. “And whatsoever man there
      be... that eateth any manner of blood, I will set my face against that
      soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people,” was
      the word of God through Moses (Leviticus 17:10); “Ye shall not eat the
      blood” (Deuteronomy 12:16); etc. In Jewish law a stem penalty was enacted
      against eating blood. In Peter’s vision (Acts 10) when he was told to
      arise, kill and eat, he promptly protested that he had never eaten
      anything unclean. A little later the Jerusalem Council, legislating for
      the Christian dispensation, ratified a provision against the eating of
      blood: “...that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from
      blood” (Acts 15:29). It is impossible to believe that when the apostles
      thus set forth the law of God they were themselves partakers, not merely
      of animal blood, but of human blood—as they would have been if in the
      Lord’s Supper they regularly ate the literal flesh and blood of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Church acknowledges that in the mass there is no visible change
      in the bread and wine, that they continue to have the same properties: the
      same taste, color, smell, weight, and dimensions. It should be sufficient
      to refute this doctrine to point out that it involves an impossibility. It
      is impossible that the attributes or sensible properties of bread and wine
      should remain if the substance has been changed. It is self-evident that
      if the attributes of flesh and blood are not there, the actual flesh and
      blood are not there. When Jesus changed the water into wine at Cana of
      Galilee, there was no question but that it was wine. It had the properties
      of wine. But since the bread and wine in the eucharist do not have the
      attributes of flesh and blood, it is absurd to say that any such change
      has taken place. That which contradicts our reason must be pronounced
      irrational. Yet the adherents of Rome, under threat of eternal
      condemnation, are forced to believe what their church tells them, even
      though it contradicts their senses. The effect cannot be other than
      detrimental when men are forced to accept as true that which they know to
      be false. Says Henry M. Woods:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If men think at all, they know that what the papal church requires them
      to believe in the eucharist, under penalty of an eternal curse, is a
      monstrous untruth. They know they are eating bread, not human flesh: and
      they know that no human priest can offer a real atoning sacrifice for sin”
      (Our Priceless Heritage , p. 107).
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Roman priest consecrates the wafer it is then called the “host,”
      and they worship it as God. But if the doctrine of transubstantiation is
      false, then the “host” is no more the body of Christ than is any other
      piece of bread. And if the soul and divinity of Christ are not present,
      then the worship of it is sheer idolatry, of the same kind as that of
      pagan tribes who worship fetishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious and interesting item in connection with the doctrine of the
      Church of Rome is that the efficiency of a priest’s action in performing
      any sacrament depends upon his “intention,” and that if he does not have
      the right intention in doing what he professes to do the sacrament is
      invalid. The Council of Trent declared: “If anyone shall say that
      intention, at least of doing what the church does, is not required in
      ministers while performing and administering the sacraments, let him be
      anathema” (Sess. VII, Can. 11). The Creed of Pope Pius IV says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If there is a defect in any of these: namely, the due matter, the form
      with intention, or the sacerdotal order of the celibrant, it nullifies the
      sacrament.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And cardinal Bellarmine, who is considered one of the foremost
      authorities, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No one can be certain, with the certainty of faith, that he has received
      a true sacrament, since no sacrament is performed without the intention of
      the ministers, and no one can see the intention of another” (Works, Vol.
      I, p. 488).
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence in the administration of the mass, baptism, or any of the other
      sacraments, if the right intention is lacking on the part of the priest,
      either through lack of attention to what he is doing, ill feeling toward
      the person before him, spite at his superiors, physical or mental
      distresses which distract him, etc., the sacrament is null and void. If at
      the time the priest is administering the mass, the bread and wine undergo
      no change, then when he elevates the “host” and the people bow down and
      worship it they are worshipping a mere creature, acknowledged by the
      Church of Rome to be such. And that, of course, is sheer idolatry. How
      often that occurs we have no way of knowing. If one cannot be certain that
      he is partaking of a true sacrament, he cannot be sure that he is not
      worshipping mere bread and wine. In view of the fact that so many priests
      eventually leave the priesthood— some say as many as one fourth or one
      third—it surely is reasonable to assume that many of those, for
      considerable periods of time before they leave and while they are in a
      state of doubt and uncertainty, are often lacking in sincere intention in
      performing the sacraments. It would indeed be interesting to know what
      proportion of the members of the Roman Church, according to Rome’s own
      doctrine, have received invalid baptisms, ordinations, marriages,
      absolutions, etc. Undoubtedly it is considerable. It would also be
      interesting, if it were possible, to know who those individuals are. No
      doubt there would be many surprises as some of her most distinguished and
      ardent supporters were revealed as not legitimately ordained priests, nor
      even members of the Roman Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Joseph Zacchello, a former priest and editor of The Convert , points
      out that this doctrine of the intention of the priest undermines the
      doctrinal basis of the Roman Church. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “This teaching implies that no Roman Catholic, be he priest or laymen, can
      ever be sure that he has been properly baptized, confirmed, absolved in
      confession, married, received holy communion or extreme unction. ...
      Suppose a child is baptized by a priest who lacks the proper intention.
      The baptism is then of no avail, and the child grows up a pagan. If he
      should enter a seminary and be ordained a priest, his ordination will be
      invalid. All the thousands of masses he says, all the sacraments he
      performs, will likewise be invalid. If he becomes a bishop, the priests he
      ordains and the other bishops he consecrates will have no such power. If
      by chance he should become pope, the Roman Catholic Church would then have
      as ‘Vicar of Christ’ and ‘infallible’ head a man who was not even a
      Christian to start with!” (Secrets of Romanism, p. 110).

  <section>
    <h2>The Cup Withheld from the Laity</h2>
    <p>
      Another serious error of the Church of Rome is that in the eucharist, or
      holy communion, she withholds the wine from the laity. She thus deprives
      believers of half of the benefits of the sacrament. That decision was made
      without any command from the New Testament, there being no suggestion of
      any such distinction between clergy and laity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the Confraternity Version Christ’s command that all believers
      partake of the cup is clear and unequivocal: “All of you drink this”
      (Matthew 26:27). And Mark says: “And they all drank of it” (14:23). Christ
      said, “This is the new covenant in my blood” (1 Corinthians 11:25). Since
      all believers are in that covenant, and since all Christians should
      remember Christ’s atoning death which was made for them, all should
      partake of the cup which is one of the seals of that covenant and one of
      the reminders of that death.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paul’s directions for the observance of the Lord’s Supper it is clear
      that the laity partook of both the bread and the wine. Writing to the
      church at Corinth he even found it necessary to admonish the people
      against gluttony and drunkenness. We read: “When ye come together in the
      church. ... When therefore ye assemble yourselves together. ...”; then
      follows the admonition: “...one is hungry, and another is drunken. What,
      have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?... Wherefore whosoever shall
      eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be
      guilty of the body and blood of the Lord” (1 Corinthians 11:18-27). How
      could anyone be guilty of drinking the cup of the Lord in an unworthy
      manner if the cup were not given to him? This is clearly one more instance
      in which the Church of Rome has taken it upon herself to alter the
      commands of the Gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early church the people partook of both the bread and the wine, and
      that practice was continued through the first eleven centuries. Then the
      practice of permitting the priest to drink the wine for both himself and
      the congregation bean to creep in. In 1415 the Council of Constance
      officially denied the cup to the people. That decision was confirmed by
      the Council of Trent (1545-1563), and that practice has been continued to
      the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reasons given by the priests for withholding the cup from the laity
      are: (1) that someone might spill a drop (since the wine allegedly has
      been transformed into the literal blood of Christ, that indeed would be a
      great tragedy)—the disciples too might have spilled some, but Jesus did
      not withhold it from them for any such flimsy reason; and (2) that the
      body of Christ, the flesh and the blood, is contained complete in either
      the bread or the wine—but there is no suggestion of that in Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      O’Brien acknowledges that “It was the common custom for the first twelve
      centuries to give communion under both kinds,” and that “The Present law
      of giving communion to the laity only under the form of bread dates from
      the Council of Constance in 1415” ( The Faith of Millions, p. 223).

<div id="Finality" dropdownName="Sacrificial Finality" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>The Finality of Christ’s Sacrifice</h2>
    <p>
      That Christ’s sacrifice on Calvary was complete in that one offering, and
      that it was never to be repeated, is set forth in Hebrews, chapters 7, 9,
      and 10. There we read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices,
      first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he
      did once for all, when he offered up himself’ (7:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      “...through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place,
      having obtained eternal redemption” (9:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Apart from shedding of blood there is no remission. ... Nor yet that he
      should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy
      place year by year with blood not his own; else must he often have
      suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the
      ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
      ... Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall
      appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him unto
      salvation” (9:22-29).
    </p>
    <p>
      “By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of
      Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest indeed standeth day by day
      ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can
      never take away sins: but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins
      for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; henceforth expecting till his
      enemies be made the footstool of his feet. For by one offering he hath
      perfected for ever them that are sanctified” (10:10-14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that throughout these verses occurs the statement “once for all,”
      which has in it the idea of completeness, or finality, and which precludes
      repetition. Christ’s work on the cross was perfect and decisive. It
      constituted one historic event which need never be repeated and which in
      fact cannot be repeated. The language is perfectly clear: “He offered one
      sacrifice for sins for ever” (10:12). Paul says that “Christ being raised
      from the dead dieth no more” (Romans 6:9); and the writer of the Epistle
      to the Hebrews says that “By one offering he hath perfected for ever them
      that are sanctified” (10:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ’s priesthood is contrasted with that of the Old Testament priests,
      and we are told that the ancient priesthood has ceased and that the
      priesthood of Christ has taken its place. We are told that Christ has sat
      down as token that His work is finished. Depend upon it, He never descends
      from that exalted place to be a further sacrifice upon Rome’s altars or on
      any other; for of such sacrifice there is no need. The verses just quoted
      completely contradict all that Rome has to say about the mass. Thank God
      that we can look back to what our Lord did on Calvary and know that He
      completed the sacrifice for sins once for all, and that our salvation is
      not dependent on the whim or arbitrary decree of any priest or church. Any
      pretense at a continuous offering for sin is worse than vain, for it is a
      denial of the efficacy of the atoning sacrifice of Christ on Calvary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there is a continual offering for sin, as when the sacrament of the
      mass is offered daily, it means that sins are really never taken away, and
      that those who are called priests pretend to continue the unfinished work
      of Christ. When on Memorial Day we lay a wreath on the tomb of a soldier
      we may speak of the sacrifice that he made to save his country. But his
      sacrifice cannot be renewed. He died once and his sacrifice was complete.
      So it is with the sacrifice of Christ. He died once, as the Scriptures so
      emphatically and repeatedly state; and since He was deity incarnate, He
      was a person of infinite value and dignity and His work therefore was
      fully efficacious and complete for the accomplishing of what He intended,
      namely, the redemption of those for whom He died. When Paul said, “For as
      often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s
      death till he come” (1 Corinthians 11:26), he did not say that we repeat
      the Lord’s death, or supplement it, or make it finally effective, but that
      we proclaim it, that is, memorialize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman Catholics who take their church membership seriously and who in most
      cases have had it drilled into them from infancy that in the mass a daily
      sacrifice is offered for them, find it hard to leave the Roman Church
      precisely because in the Protestant church they find no mass, and they
      fear that without the mass they will lose their salvation. A devout Roman
      Catholic regards this matter of salvation through the mass far more
      seriously than most Protestants realize. And the hierarchy has been quick
      to realize that its main hold on the minds and hearts of the people
      through the centuries has been the mass, which is a visible re-enactment,
      by the use of symbols, of the suffering and death of Christ. Only when one
      begins to read the Bible thoughtfully and prayerfully does he discover
      that the only sacrifice necessary for his salvation was made for him by
      Christ on Calvary, and that the mass cannot possibly be a continuing
      sacrifice. Once he sees this point it becomes easy for him to accept the
      other doctrines of the Protestant faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obligation that rests on a Roman Catholic to attend mass is a far
      different thing from the freedom that Protestants enjoy in the matter of
      church attendance. The Baltimore Catechism says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a mortal sin not to hear Mass on a Sunday or a holyday of
      obligation, unless we are excused for a serious reason. They also commit
      sin mortal who, having others under their charge, hinder them from hearing
      Mass without a sufficient reason” (Answer, 390).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic, according to this authoritative standard, is obliged
      to attend mass every Sunday, and in the United States there are six
      special holydays. The mass is the most important ceremony of the Roman
      Church, the central and supreme act of worship. Everything else hinges on
      this. It becomes, therefore, the rule of discipline for all Roman
      Catholics, a mighty instrument in the hands of the clergy for the
      supervision of the laity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judged by outward appearances, Roman Catholics are quite faithful in
      attending Sunday mass, although on the acknowledgment of some there is
      nothing in the performance of a pleasing nature. But the Romanist,
      believing in the efficacy of good works, looks upon church attendance as a
      means of gaining merit for himself in the other world and as an offset to
      the evil charged against him. Attendance at mass gives him a sense of
      having fulfilled his duty. He has met the requirement. Regardless of how
      wicked a person he may be, if he continues to acknowledge the authority of
      the church by regular attendance at mass and by going to confession as
      required at least once a year, he remains a member “in good
      standing”—witness, for instance, the large number of gangsters and crooked
      politicians in the big cities who have maintained their standing in this
      church while continuing uninterruptedly their evil practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the sagacity characteristic of her long career, the Roman Church
      takes advantage of that weakness in human nature which seeks some visible
      and outward object of worship. In the consecrated “host” she presents to
      her people a god whom they can see and feel. And it is generally accepted
      that Romanists, having been to mass, especially on Sunday, can do about as
      they please the remainder of the day. Rome is more concerned about the
      observance of a ceremony and the mark of allegiance which it implies than
      she is about holy living or about keeping a day holy to the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another feature of the mass is that it is conducted in Latin,'<sup>2</sup>
      a language not spoken by the people in the Medieval church nor understood
      by people today unless they use a translation. Latin has been a dead
      language for centuries. Paul said: “Howbeit in the church, I had rather
      speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also,
      than ten thousand words in a tongue” (1 Corinthians 14:19). In response to
      the criticism that at mass the worshipper is not a participant, not able
      to understand what is said, but merely an observer, the Roman Church in
      some places conducts the services in the vernacular, or makes translations
      available so that the people can participate intelligently, at least to
      the extent of knowing what is said. But such is not the general practice.
      In fact the Council of Trent directed one of its anathemas against those
      who say “that the mass ought to be celebrated in the vulgar tongue only.”
      But the prayers of the Jews in Old Testament times were always offered in
      the Hebrew vernacular; and we read that the members of the early church,
      when they met for worship, “lifted up their voices to God with one accord”
      (Acts 4:24). Yet, as C. Stanley Lowell has appropriately observed: “It is
      not essential [in the mass] that they understand. Ideas are not integral
      to the mass, may even defeat its purpose. The objective here is to produce
      through the medium of the miracle allegedly performed by the priest an
      emotional ecstasy in which thoughts or ideas become superfluous” (Article,
      Protestant and Papal Infallibility).
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>2</sup>

      In the “New Mass,” introduced in 1965, Latin is no longer compulsory.

    <h2>The Mass and Money</h2>
    <p>
      One very prominent feature of the mass as conducted in the Roman Church is
      the financial support which it brings in. It is by all odds the largest
      income producing ceremony in the church. An elaborate system has been
      worked out. In the United States low mass, for the benefit of a soul in
      purgatory, read by the priest in a low tone of voice and without music,
      costs a minimum of one dollar. The high mass, on Sundays and holydays,
      sung by the priest in a loud voice, with music and choir, costs a minimum
      of ten dollars. The usual price for high mass is twenty-five to
      thirty-five dollars. The high requiem mass (at funerals), and the high
      nuptual mass (at weddings), may cost much more, even hundreds of dollars,
      depending on the number and rank of the priests taking part, the display
      of flowers, the music, candles, etc. Prices vary in the different dioceses
      and according to the ability of the parishioners to pay. No masses are
      said without money. The Irish have a saying: High money, high mass; low
      money, low mass; no money, no mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the various kinds of masses, there are (1) votive masses,
      made for various purposes, such as relief of one suffering in purgatory,
      recovery from sickness, success in a business venture, a safe journey,
      protection against storms, floods, droughts, etc; (2) requiem or funeral
      masses, in behalf of the dead; (3) nuptual masses, at marriages; and (4)
      pontifical masses, conducted by a bishop or other dignitary. Each of these
      is available in high or low mass, and at various prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Purgatory Day, November 2 of each year, three masses are said, for the
      souls in purgatory and one for the “intentions” of the pope—which
      “intentions,” we may assume, are directed for the good of the offerer.
      Every member of the church is urged to attend on that day. The priest of a
      church of 500 members may reasonably expect to take in from $500 to $5,000
      on that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most popular mass is that to alleviate or terminate the suffering of
      souls in purgatory. The more masses said for an agonizing soul the better.
      Sometimes ads are placed in church papers in which multiple or repeated
      masses are offered for a price. Purgatorial societies and mass leagues
      offer blanket masses recited for beneficiaries en masse , in which anyone
      who sends, say, $10, can secure for a departed soul a certain number of
      high masses celebrated daily for a month, or longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present writer, who lives in Missouri, has for the past two
      Christmases received solicitations by mail from a priest and church in
      Maryland for a thousand masses, euphemistically called “spiritual
      bouquets,” for the apparently reasonable price of $10. The need for such
      large numbers of masses, continued over long periods of time, surely casts
      doubt on the claim that the mass is of such high value in matters of
      salvation. One consequence of this system is that the poor are left to bum
      in purgatory longer, while the rich can have more and higher grade masses
      said and so escape more quickly. People with property are sometimes urged
      to leave thousands of dollars to provide for prayers and masses to be said
      perpetually for their souls. According to the teaching of the Church of
      Rome the great majority of those dying within the pale of the church go to
      purgatory where they remain in a state of suffering with no known
      termination date before the day of judgment. Those outside the Roman
      Church are, for the most part, said to be hopelessly lost and therefore
      beyond help.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the worst features about the mass system is that the priest can
      never give assurance that the soul for which he has said mass is out of
      purgatory. He admittedly has no criterion by which that can be known.
      Hence the offerings may be continued for years—as long as the deluded
      Romanist is willing to continue paying. Says Stephen L. Testa:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would not pay the priest to say that the soul for which he prayed is
      already out of purgatory and gone to heaven and needs no further masses.
      It would cut off a rich source of income. Like many unscrupulous
      physicians who would rather prolong the illness of a wealthy patient, so
      he could continue to need his treatments, a priest would never tell a
      bereaved mother that her daughter is ‘with Jesus’ in heaven and needs no
      more requiem masses. A Protestant minister would give that comforting
      assurance from the Word of God, but never a Catholic priest!” ( The Truth
      About Catholics, Protestants, and Jews , p. 13).
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Zacchello says:</p>
    <p>
      “The only ‘sacrifice’ in the Roman Catholic mass is that of the money of
      the poor given to the priest to pay for the mysterious ceremonies he
      performs, in the belief that he will relieve the suffering of their
      beloved ones in the fires of purgatory” ( Secrets of Romanism , p. 82).
    </p>
    <p>And L. J. King points out that...</p>
    <p>
      “Death doesn’t end all with the Roman Church. A member cannot avoid his
      church dues by dying. His estate or friends have to pay on and on. Even
      the tax collector lets up on a dead man, but the Roman Church never. It
      retains its grip on its dupes long after their bodies are reduced to
      ashes. The priestly threat that the soul is suffering in the ‘devouring
      flames’ of purgatory and will remain there for a long, long time, will
      bring the last dollar from the sorrowing mother, whose only son or
      daughter is detained in that fiery prison.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who contribute money for masses fail to appreciate the fact that the
      gifts of God cannot be bought with any amount of money. That was precisely
      the sin of Simon the sorcerer, who attempted to buy the power of God with
      money. But he received Peter’s stem rebuke: “Thy money perish with thee,
      because thou hast sought to obtain the gift of God with money” (Acts
      8:20). The term “simony” has entered the dictionary, meaning “to make a
      profit out of sacred things,” “the sin of buying or selling ecclesiastical
      benefices,” etc.

    <h2>Historical Development</h2>
    <p>
      In view of the prominent place given the mass in the present day Roman
      Church, it is of particular interest to find that it was unknown in the
      early church, that it was first proposed by a Benedictine monk, Radbertus,
      in the ninth century, and that it did not become an official part of
      Romanist doctrine until so pronounced by the Lateran Council of 1215 under
      the direction of Pope Innocent III. It was reaffirmed by the Council of
      Trent in 1545. Transubstantiation is not mentioned in the Apostles’ Creed,
      or in the Nicene or Athanasian creeds. Its first creedal mention is by
      Pope Pius IV, in the year 1564.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only since the year 1415, by decree of the Council of Constance, has the
      Roman Church refused to give the cup to the laity. On various occasions in
      the earlier history of the church, popes have condemned as a sacrilege the
      serving of bread only in the holy communion. The decree that the bread
      only should be given to the laity was enacted on June 15, 1415, at a time
      when the Roman Church was without a head. For this same council had
      deposed Pope John XXIII on May 29, 1415, for crimes against the church and
      the state; and his successor, Martin V, was not elected until November 11,
      1417.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decree denying the cup to the laity contradicted Roman Canon Law of
      the preceding centuries. Pope Leo I, called the Great (440 461), said in
      his condemnation of the Manichaeans: “They receive Christ’s body with
      unworthy mouth, and entirely refuse to take the blood of our redemption;
      therefore we give notice to you, holy brethren, that men of this kind,
      whose sacrilegious deceit has been detected, are to be expelled with
      priestly authority from the fellowship of the saints.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope Gelasius I (492-496), in a letter addressed to some bishops, said:
      “We have ascertained that certain persons having received a portion of the
      sacred body alone abstain from partaking of the chalice of the sacred
      blood. Let such persons... either receive the sacrament in its entirety,
      or be repelled from the entire sacrament, because a division of one and
      the same mystery cannot take place without great sacrilege.” The decree of
      the Council of Clermont, presided over by Pope Urban II, in 1095, and Pope
      Paschal II in 1118, also condemned the practice of giving the bread only
      in the sacrament. How can the Church of Rome claim to be catholic,
      apostolic, and unchanging when a council without a pope has deliberately
      overthrown the teaching of four popes concerning the matter of holy
      communion?
    </p>
    <p>
      We can only conclude that the mass is a medieval superstition, designed to
      throw a veil of mystery over the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper and to
      impress ignorant people. From a simple memorial feast it became a
      miraculous re-enactment of the sacrifice on Calvary, through which Christ
      was constantly dying for His people. A similar effect was designed in the
      use of the Latin language in the liturgy—for which it certainly cannot be
      said that it was intended to make the Lord’s Supper more intelligible to
      the people, for practically none of them could understand Latin. The
      purpose of each of those innovations was to exalt the hierarchy, to clothe
      it with an air of mystery, and, particularly as regards the mass, to make
      the priest appear to have supernatural powers.

    <h2>Seven Sacraments</h2>
    <p>
      What is a sacrament? To this question the Shorter Catechism of the
      Westminster Standards answers:
    </p>
    <p>
      “A sacrament is a holy ordinance instituted by Christ; wherein by sensible
      signs, Christ and the benefits of the new covenant are represented,
      sealed, and applied to believers” (Answer, 92).
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the New Testament, and according to the teaching of the
      Protestant churches, two sacraments, and only two, were instituted by
      Christ. These are baptism and the Lord’s Supper. In the upper room during
      the last night with His disciples Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper when
      He said: “This do in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19). Baptism was
      practiced from the time of John the Baptist, and after His resurrection
      Christ specifically instituted it as a sacrament when He said: “Go ye
      therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the
      name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. ...” (Matthew
      28:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      To these two sacraments Rome has added five more, so that she now lists
      them as: (1) baptism, (2) confirmation, (3) eucharist (mass), (4) penance,
      (5) extreme unction, (6) marriage, and (7) orders (ordination of priests
      and consecration of nuns).
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome holds that in the ordinary course of life, five of these—baptism,
      confirmation, mass, penance, and extreme unction—are indispensable to
      salvation, while marriage and orders are optional. But no church leaders
      nor any church council has the right to appoint sacraments. The church is
      Christ’s church, and only He, as its Head, has that right. Furthermore,
      Rome has altered the form of the eucharist, making it a sacrifice as well
      as a sacrament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome can give no proof for the additional five sacraments, except that
      tradition holds them to be such. The number seven was arrived at only
      after centuries of drifting about. The early church fathers sometimes used
      the word in a broad sense, and spoke of the sacrament of prayer, the
      sacrament of the Scriptures, the sacrament of the Christian religion, the
      sacrament of weeping, etc., applying the term to various things that were
      regarded as in some way sacred or as designed to bring one closer to God,
      although it is evident from their writings that, strictly speaking, they
      recognized only two real sacraments. Peter Lombard (1100-1164), who
      published the famous book of “Sentences” from the writings of Augustine
      and other church leaders, which was regarded as a standard book on
      theology until the time of the Reformation, was the first to define the
      number as seven. It is important to notice that no author for more than a
      thousand years after Christ taught that there were seven sacraments. It
      was not until the Council of Florence, in the year 1439 that the seven
      sacraments were formally decreed. Later the Council of Trent declared: “If
      any one saith that the sacraments of the New Law were not instituted by
      Jesus Christ, our Lord; or that are more, or less, than seven, to wit,
      baptism, confirmation, the eucharist, penance, extreme unction, orders,
      and matrimony; or even anyone of these seven is not truly and properly a
      sacrament, let him be anathema.”
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the purpose of the Church of Rome in appointing seven sacraments?
      Probably in order that it might have complete control over the lives of
      its people from the cradle to the grave. This sacramental system is
      designed to give the priest control at the most important events of human
      life. From baptism as soon as possible after birth to the shadow of
      approaching death the laity is kept dependent on and under the control of
      the priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the five sacraments added by the Church of Rome are spurious should
      be clear beyond doubt. Confirmation, penance, and extreme unction are not
      even mentioned in Scripture, and are therefore completely without
      authority. We shall discuss the seven in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Baptism. Rome has perverted the meaning of baptism so that instead of
      accepting it as a symbolical ordinance and an outward sign through which
      Christ and the benefits of the new covenant are represented and conveyed
      to the believer and received by faith, it is represented as working in a
      magical way to produce baptismal regeneration and securing automatically
      the forgiveness of all past sins, and as absolutely necessary to
      salvation. Rome teaches that it is not possible even for newly bom infants
      to be saved so as to enjoy the delights of heaven unless they are
      baptized. To that end they have even invented a means of prenatal baptism.
      In the words of the Trent Catechism: “Infants, unless regenerated unto God
      through the grace of baptism, whether their parents be Christian or
      infidel, are bom to eternal misery and perdition.” But what a horrible
      doctrine that was! And what a contrast with the generally accepted
      Protestant doctrine that all those dying in infancy, whether baptized or
      unbaptized, are saved!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Romish doctrine was so horrible and so unacceptable to the laity that
      it was found necessary to invent a third realm, the Limbus Infantum , to
      which unbaptized infants are sent, in which they are excluded from heaven
      but in which they suffer no positive pain. The ecumenical councils of
      Lyons and Florence and the canons of the Council of Trent declare
      positively that unbaptized infants are confined to this realm. The primary
      purpose of the Church of Rome in excluding unbaptized infants from heaven
      is to force parents to commit their children to her as soon as possible.
      The long range design is to bring all people into subjection to her, to
      put her stamp of ownership on every person possible. And the pressure put
      on Roman Catholic parents to see to it that their children are baptized
      early is almost unbelievable—a commitment which once she receives she
      never relinquishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Confirmation. In the so-called sacrament of confirmation the bishop
      lays his hands on the head of a person who previously has been baptized,
      for the purpose of conveying to him the Holy Spirit. But no apostle or
      minister in the apostolic church performed that rite, and no man on earth
      has the Holy Spirit at his command. Roman theologians are uncertain as to
      the time when this so-called sacrament was instituted. The ritual leads
      those confirmed to think they have received the Holy Spirit, whereas all
      they have received is the word and ritual of fallible priests.
      Confirmation is also practiced in the Protestant Episcopal Church, but
      they regard it only as a church ordinance, not as an institution
      established by Christ.
    </p>
    <p>3. Eucharist (the mass), discussed throughout this chapter.</p>
    <p>
      4. Penance. What is penance? An authorized catechism says: “Penance is a
      sacrament in which the sins committed after baptism are forgiven by means
      of the absolution of the priest. ... The priest gives a penance after
      confession that we may satisfy God for the temporal punishment due to our
      sins. We must accept the penance which the priest gives to us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Word of God teaches that the sinner must truly repent from the heart
      for his sin. Otherwise there can be no forgiveness. But the Church of Rome
      to a considerable degree substitutes penance for Gospel repentance.
      Penance consists of outward acts, such as repeating certain prayers many
      times, e.g., the Hail Mary or the rosary, self-inflicted punishments,
      fastings, pilgrimages, etc. Penance represents a false hope, for it
      relates only to outward acts. True repentance involves genuine sorrow for
      sin, it is directed toward God, and the person voluntarily shows by his
      outward acts and conduct that he has forsaken his sin. Rome cannot point
      to any event in the Bible in which penance was instituted.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Extreme Unction. Extreme unction is described as “the anointing by the
      priest of those in danger of death by sickness with holy oil, accompanied
      with a special prayer. ... It is called Extreme because administered to
      sick persons when thought to be near the close of life.” In this ritual
      the priest anoints the eyes, ears, nose, hands, and feet of the dying
      person with “holy oil,” as he pronounces an accompanying Latin prayer
      formula which offsets the sin committed by those members of the body.<sup
        >3</sup
      >
      But no matter how good the priest or his prayer, he still cannot assure
      the dying person of heaven. The best he can do is to get him into
      purgatory, there to suffer the pains of fire. From that point his loved
      ones are supposed to purchase numberless masses to secure his early
      release. But how different that is from the Protestant assurance that all
      true believers at death pass into the immediate presence of and into the
      joys of heaven! Christ said: “Verily, verily I say unto you. He that
      heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life , and
      cometh not into judgment , but hath passed out of death into life” (John
      5:24). Christ gives liberty; the priest imposes bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sacrament in its present form was not introduced into the church
      until the twelfth century. And again the Roman theologians are uncertain
      as to the time of its institution. It is entirely lacking in Scriptural
      warrant. There is no case in Scripture of any apostle anointing a man with
      oil. The case recorded in James 5:14-15 cannot be claimed, for the purpose
      there was to restore the sick one to health. But extreme unction is
      intended only for those who are expected to die, not for those who are
      expected to recover, and it is intended as a preparation for the next
      life.
    </p>
    <p><sup>3</sup> Since 1965 this ritual has been simplified.</p>
    <p>
      6. Orders. The ordination of church officials was appointed by Christ, but
      not the specific orders adopted by the Church of Rome—priests, bishops,
      archbishops, cardinals, and popes. Furthermore, no sacramental sign was
      appointed to accompany the appointment of church officials.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Matrimony. Matrimony, too, is a divine ordinance, but it was given no
      outwardly prescribed sign. It was in fact instituted thousands of years
      earlier, even before the fall, and therefore is not an institution of the
      new covenant. The Church of Rome admits her uncertainty about the time of
      its appointment as a sacrament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome’s error in making marriage a sacrament came about because of a
      mistranslation in the Vulgate, Jerome’s Latin translation of the Bible,
      which the Council of Trent made the official inspired version for the
      Roman Church. The passage in question is Ephesians 5:31-32, which
      correctly translated reads: “For this cause shall a man leave his father
      and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and the two shall become one
      flesh. This mystery is great. ...” But the Vulgate translated: “This is a
      great sacrament. ...” Happily that error has been corrected in the new
      Confraternity Version, so that it reads: “This is a great mystery. ...”
      But even so, Rome continues to teach that marriage is a sacrament. But
      cardinal Cajetan, Luther’s opponent at Augsburg, made the frank admission:
      “You have not from this place, O prudent reader—from Paul—that marriage
      was a sacrament; for he does not say that it was a great sacrament, but a
      great mystery.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, for six or seven centuries after the establishment of the
      Christian church, the laity made no acknowledgment of any claim that the
      clergy alone could perform marriages, and they exercised the right of
      divorce on Scriptural grounds. It was through the influence of strong
      popes, such as Hildebrand, who, wishing to bring the laity under the more
      complete control of the clergy, at last secured for the church complete
      control over marriage. Such was the situation during the Middle Ages. As a
      “sacrament” the new type marriage could be performed only by a priest and
      was indissoluble. The low state of morals in countries where the Roman
      Church has been able to enforce its rule shows the result of that false
      doctrine. A fee, of course, has always been charged for the marriage
      ceremony. And where the fee has been excessive, as in some Latin American
      countries, the result has been an abnormally large proportion of common
      law marriages, in some areas as high as 70 percent. Had the Roman clergy
      been truly Christian it would have modified its claims and practices when
      the practical results of those claims and practices became evident, and
      would have sought first of all to safeguard the honor of the church and
      the family. But instead it has held doggedly to its privileged position,
      refusing to give up anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the multiplying of sacraments, the words which God spoke to
      Moses regarding the laws of the Old Testament are particularly
      appropriate: “Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither
      shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah
      your God which I command you” (Deuteronomy 4:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church of Rome embodies further serious error in its doctrine of the
      sacraments in that it teaches that they confer divine grace automatically
      and mechanically, by their outward action, as fire bums by its heat or as
      medicine cures by its chemical properties. But the Word of God teaches
      just the opposite. The blessing is not inherent in the sacrament as such,
      nor in him who administers it, but is bestowed directly by the Holy
      Spirit, and it is received by the one who exercises true faith—“Without
      faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing to him; for he that cometh to
      God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek
      after him” (Hebrews 11:6). A sacrament is an outward visible sign of an
      inward invisible grace, through which the blessings of grace are conferred
      when appropriated by faith. As the Holy Spirit does not dwell in the pages
      of the Bible, yet warms the heart and enlightens the mind as we read, so
      grace does not reside intrinsically in the sacrament, but comes to the
      believer who receives it by faith.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In this chapter it has been our purpose to show that there is no
      transubstantiation in the mass and therefore no physical presence of
      Christ in the bread and wine, that there is no true sacrifice in the mass,
      and that the eucharist is instead primarily a means of spiritual blessing
      and a commemorative feast through which we are reminded of our Lord and
      what He has done for our salvation. We assert unqualifiedly that the mass
      as practiced in the Roman Catholic Church is a fraud and a deception—for
      the simple reason that it is the selling of non-existent values. The sale
      of masses to gullible people for various purposes has transformed the
      ministers of the Roman Church into sacrificing priests, and has been an
      effective means by which under false pretenses huge sums of money have
      been extracted from the people.

      In all the pagan religions of the world it would be hard to find an
      invention more false and ridiculous than that of the mass. To assert that
      an egg is an elephant, or that black is white, would be no more absurd or
      childish than to assert that the bread and wine, which retain the
      properties of bread and wine, are actually and totally the body and blood,
      the deity and humanity, of Christ.

      The Roman doctrine of the sacraments constitutes the most elaborate system
      of magic and ritual that any civilized religion ever invented, and from
      first to last it is designed to enhance the power and prestige of the
      clergy. In its fundamental ideas it is as alien to the whole spirit of
      Christianity and as out of harmony with modern times as the Medieval
      science of astrology is out of harmony with astronomy, or alchemy with
      chemistry. Yet these are the beliefs to which the Roman Catholic people
      give allegiance, and to which they hope some day to convert the United
      States and the world. For these beliefs they are willing to overlook all
      the horrors of the Middle Ages and all the corruption of the popes and the
      papacy of that period—insofar as they know anything at all about the
      history of that period.

      The fact that the elaborate ritual of the mass is totally unknown to
      Scripture, and that it is highly dishonoring to Christ in that it makes
      His work on the cross largely ineffective until it is supplemented by the
      work of the priest, does not impress the average Roman Catholic layman
      seriously, for the simple reason that he has practically no knowledge at
      all of what the Bible teaches concerning these things.

    <p>
      We ask in all seriousness: What is there in the Roman service of the mass
      that compares with the beauty and simplicity of the Lord’s Supper as
      observed in Protestant churches? In the latter you have no pompous
      hierarchy separated from the laity and communing with themselves,
      partaking of the bread and wine while standing at the altar on a higher
      level and with their backs to the congregation, while the laity, like
      children, kneel before the clergy with closed eyes and open mouths and
      receive only the wafer which is dropped into their mouths. In the
      Protestant churches the minister comes from the pulpit and sits at the
      communion table on the same level with the people. Minister and people are
      a company of Christian brethren partaking together of the Lord’s Supper as
      a simple memorial feast, each one eating of the bread and each one
      drinking of the cup as the rite was originally instituted. In the light of
      New Testament revelation surely the latter is right, and it alone.
