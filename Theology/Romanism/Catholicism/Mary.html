    <h2>Mary’s Place in Scripture</h2>
    <p>
      The New Testament has surprisingly little to say about Mary. Her last
      recorded words were spoken at the marriage in Cana, at the very beginning
      of Jesus’ ministry: “Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it”—then silence.
      But the Church of Rome breaks that silence, and from sources entirely
      outside of Scripture builds up a most elaborate system of Mary works and
      Mary devotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following Mary’s appearance at the marriage in Cana, we meet her only once
      more during Jesus’ public ministry, when she and His brothers came where
      He was speaking to the multitudes, seeking Him, only to draw the rebuke:
      “Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? Whosoever shall do the will of
      my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother”
      (Matthew 12:46-50). She was present at the cross, where she was committed
      to the care of the disciple John for the remainder of her natural life
      (John 19:25-27). Finally, in Acts 1:14, she is mentioned as having been
      with the disciples and the other women and the Ford’s brethren engaged
      steadfastly in prayer immediately after the ascension, but she has no
      prominent place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apostles never prayed to Mary, nor, so far as the record goes, did
      they show her any special honor. Peter, Paul, John, and James do not
      mention her name even once in the epistles which they wrote to the
      churches. John took care of her until she died, but he does not mention
      her in any of his three epistles or in the book of Revelation. We recall
      that Prime Minister Churchill used to make it a special point of honor to
      mention the Queen in his eloquent public addresses. Imagine the prime
      Minister of England never mentioning the Queen in any of his addresses to
      Parliament or in any of his state papers!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the church was instituted at Pentecost there was only one name given
      among men whereby we must be saved, that of Jesus (Acts 4:12). Wherever
      the eyes of the church are directed to the abundance of grace, there is no
      mention of Mary. Surely this silence is a rebuke to those who would build
      a system of salvation around her. God has given us all the record we need
      concerning Mary, and that record does not indicate that worship or
      veneration in any form is to be given to her. How complete, then, is the
      falsehood of Romanism that gives primary worship and devotion to her!

    <h2>“Mother of God”</h2>
    <p>
      The doctrine of “Mary, the Mother of God,” as we know it today is the
      result of centuries of growth, often stimulated by pronouncements of
      church prelates. And yet the full-fledged system of Mariolatry is a
      comparatively recent development in Roman Catholic dogma. In fact the last
      one hundred years have quite appropriately been called the “Century of
      Mariolatry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As late as the fourth century there are no indications of any special
      veneration of Mary. Such veneration at that time could begin only if one
      were recognized as a saint, and only the martyrs were counted as saints.
      But since there was no evidence that Mary had suffered a martyr’s death,
      she was excluded from sainthood. Later the ascetics came to be
      acknowledged as among the saints. That proved to be the opening age for
      the sainthood of Mary, for surely she of all people, it was alleged, must
      have lived an ascetic life! The church acknowledged that Christ was bom of
      the virgin Mary. Apocryphal tradition built on those possibilities, and
      slowly the system emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase “Mother of God” originated in the Council of Ephesus, in the
      year 431. It occurs in the Creed of Chalcedon, which was adopted by the
      council which met in that city in 451, and in regard to the person of
      Christ it declared that He was “bom of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God
      according to the manhood”—which latter term means: according to the flesh
      of human nature. The purpose of the expression as used by the Council of
      Ephesus was not to glorify Mary, but to emphasize the deity of Christ over
      against those who denied His equality with the Father and the Holy Spirit.
      A heretical sect, the Nestorians, separated the two natures in Christ to
      such an extent that they held Him to be two persons, or rather a dual
      person formed by the union between the divine Logos and the human person
      Jesus of Nazareth. They were accused of teaching that the Logos only
      inhabited the man Jesus, from which it was inferred that they held that
      the person bom of Mary was only a man. It was therefore only to emphasize
      the fact that the “person” born to Mary was truly divine that she was
      called “the Mother of God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence the term today has come to have a far different meaning from that
      intended by the early church. It no longer has reference to the orthodox
      doctrine concerning the person of Christ, but instead is used to exalt
      Mary to a supernatural status as Queen of Heaven, Queen of the Angels,
      etc., so that, because of her assumed position of prominence in heaven,
      she is able to approach her Son effectively and to secure for her
      followers whatever favors they ask through her. When we say that a woman
      is the mother of a person we mean that she gave birth to that person. But
      Mary certainly did not give birth to God, nor to Jesus Christ as the
      eternal Son of God. She was not the mother of our Lord’s divinity, but
      only of His humanity. Instead, Christ, the second person of the Trinity,
      has existed from all eternity, and was Mary’s Creator. Hence the term as
      used in the present day Roman Church must be rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the life and worship of the Roman Church there has been a long course
      of development, setting forth Mary’s perpetual virginity, her exemption
      from original sin and from any sin of commission, and now her bodily
      assumption to heaven. In the Roman Church Mary is to her worshippers what
      Christ is to us. She is the object of all religious affections, and the
      source whence all the blessings of salvation are sought and expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bible calls Mary the “Mother of Jesus,” but gives her no other title.
      All that the Roman Church has to substantiate her worship of Mary is a
      sheaf of traditions entirely outside the Bible telling of her appearances
      to certain monks, nuns, and others venerated as saints. At first glance
      the term “Mother of God” may seem comparatively harmless. But the actual
      consequence is that through its use Roman Catholics come to look upon Mary
      as stronger, more mature, and more powerful than Christ. To them she
      becomes the source of His being and overshadows Him. So they go to her,
      not to Him. “He came to us through Mary,” says Rome, “and we must go to
      Him through her.” Who would go to “the Child,” even to “the holy Child,”
      for salvation when His mother seems easier of access and more responsive?
      Romanism magnifies the person that the Holy Spirit wants minimized, and
      minimizes the person that the Holy Spirit wants magnified.
    </p>
    <p>Says S. E. Anderson:</p>
    <p>
      “Roman priests call Mary the ‘mother of God,’ a name impossible,
      illogical, and unscriptural. It is impossible, for God can have no mother;
      He is eternal and without beginning while Mary was born and died within a
      few short years. It is illogical, for God does not require a mother for
      His existence. Jesus said, ‘Before Abraham was born, I am’ (John 8:58). It
      is unscriptural, for the Bible gives Mary no such contradictory name. Mary
      was the honored mother of the human body of Jesus—no more—as every
      Catholic must admit if he wishes to be reasonable and Scriptural. The
      divine nature of Christ existed from eternity past, long before Mary was
      born. Jesus never called her ‘mother’; He called her ‘woman’” (Booklet, Is
      Rome the True Church? p. 20).
    </p>
    <p>And Marcus Meyer says:</p>
    <p>
      “God has no mother. God has always existed. God Himself is the Creator of
      all things. Since a mother must exist before her child, if you speak of a
      ‘mother of God’ you are thereby putting someone before God. And you are
      therefore making that person God. ... Mary would weep to hear anyone so
      pervert the truth as to call her the mother of her Creator. True, Jesus
      was God; but He was also man. And it was only as man that He could have a
      mother. Can you imagine Mary introducing Jesus to others with the words:
      ‘This is God, my Son?"' (Pamphlet, No Mother).
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, if the Roman terminology is correct and Mary is to be Called
      God’s mother, then Joseph was God’s stepfather; James, Joseph, Simon, and
      Judas were God’s brothers; Elizabeth was God’s aunt; John the Baptist was
      God’s cousin; Heli was God’s grandfather, and Adam was God’s 59 th great
      grandfather. Such references to God’s relatives sound more like a page out
      of Mormonism than Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The correct statement of the person of Christ in this regard is: As His
      human nature had no father, so His divine nature had no mother.

    <h2>Historical Development</h2>
    <p>
      It is not difficult to trace the origin of the worship of the Virgin Mary.
      The early church knew nothing about the cult of Mary as it is practiced
      today—and we here use the word “cult” in the dictionary sense of “the
      veneration or worship of a person or thing; extravagant homage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The first mention of the legend about Mary is found in the so-called
      Proto-Evangelism of James, near the end of the second century, and
      presents a fantastic story about her birth. It also states that she
      remained a virgin throughout her entire life. Justin Martyr, who died in
      165 compares Mary and Eve, the two prominent women in the Bible. Irenaeus,
      who died in 202, says that the disobedience of the “virgin Eve” was atoned
      for by the obedience of the “virgin Mary.” Tertullian, who was one of the
      greatest authorities in the ancient church, and who died in 222, raised
      his voice against the legend concerning Mary’s birth. He also held that
      after the birth of Jesus, Mary and Joseph lived in a normal marriage
      relationship. The first known picture of Mary is found in the Priscilla
      catacomb in Rome and dates from the second century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Christian church functioned for at least 150 years without
      idolizing the name of Mary. The legends about her begin to appear after
      that, although for several centuries the church was far from making a cult
      of it. But after Constantine’s decree making Christianity the preferred
      religion, the Greek-Roman pagan religions with their male gods and female
      goddesses exerted an increasingly stronger influence upon the church.
      Thousands of the people who then entered the church brought with them the
      superstitions and devotions which they had long given to Isis, Ishtar,
      Diana, Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, and other goddesses, which were then
      conveniently transferred to Mary. Statues were dedicated to her, as there
      had been statues dedicated to Isis, Diana, and others, and before them the
      people kneeled and prayed as they had been accustomed to do before the
      statues of the heathen goddesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the people who came into the church had no clear distinction in
      their minds between the Christian practices and those that had been
      practiced in their heathen religions. Statues of pagan gods and heroes
      found a place in the church, and were gradually replaced by statues of
      saints. The people were allowed to bring into the church those things from
      their old religions that could be reconciled with the type of Christianity
      then developing, hence many who bowed down before the images of Mary were
      in reality worshipping their old gods under a new name. History shows that
      in several countries Roman Catholicism has absorbed local deities as
      saints, and has absorbed local goddesses into the image of the Madonna.
      One of the more recent examples is that of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a
      goddess worshipped by the Indians in Mexico, which resulted in a curious
      mixture of Romanism and paganism, with sometimes one, sometimes the other
      predominating—some pictures of the Virgin Mary now appearing show her
      without the Child in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have seen, the expression “Mother of God,” as set forth in the
      decree of the Council of Ephesus gave an impetus to Mary worship, although
      the practice did not become general until two or three centuries later.
      From the fifth century on, the Mary cult becomes more common. Mary appears
      more frequently in paintings, churches were named after her, and prayers
      were offered to her as an intercessor. The famous preacher Chrysostom, who
      died in 407, resisted the movement wholeheartedly, but his opposition had
      little effect in stemming the movement. The Roman Catholics took as their
      text the words of the angel to Mary, found in Luke 1:28: “And he came in
      unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with
      thee.” It is to be noted, however, that shortly after the angel spoke to
      Mary, Elizabeth, speaking by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, did not say,
      “Blessed art thou above women,” but, “Blessed art thou among women” (Luke
      1:42). Starting with the false premise that Mary was above all other
      women, there developed the practice of worshipping her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Invocation of the saints had a similar origin. In the year 610 Pope
      Boniface IV first suggested the celebration of an All Saints festival and
      ordered that the Pantheon, a pagan temple in Rome that had been dedicated
      to all the gods, should be converted into a Christian church and the
      relics of the saints placed therein. He then dedicated the church to the
      Blessed Virgin and all the martyrs. Thus the worship of Mary and the
      saints replaced that of the heathen gods and goddesses, and it was merely
      a case of one error being substituted for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spiritual climate of the Middle Ages was favorable to the development
      of Mary worship. Numerous superstitions crept into the church and centered
      themselves in the worship of the Virgin and the saints. The purely pagan
      character of these practices, with dates and manner of observance, can be
      traced by any competent historian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art of the Middle Ages represented Mary with the child Jesus, Mary as
      “mater dolorosa” at the cross, etc. The rosary became popular; poems and
      hymns were written in honor of the “god-mother.” Stories of miracles
      performed by her started in response to prayers addressed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also during that period arose the custom of looking to “patron saints,”
      who in fact were merely Christianized forms of old pagan gods. In
      polytheism everything had its own god—the sea, war, hunting, merchants,
      agriculture, etc. After the same fashion there developed the Roman
      Catholic gallery of “patron saints” for seamen, soldiers, travelers,
      hunters, and in modern times, for fliers, divers, cyclists, artillerymen,
      etc. This kinship with the pagan cults explains why Mary worship developed
      so rapidly after Constantine made Christianity the official religion.

    <h2>Contrast between Roman and Protestant Teaching</h2>
    <p>
      We are indebted to Dr. Joseph Zacchello, editor of The Convert , Clairton,
      Pennsylvania for the following statement concerning Mary’s place in the
      Christian church, followed by extracts in one column from Liguori’s book,
      The Glories of Mary, and in a parallel column extracts setting forth what
      the Bible teaches:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The most beautiful story ever told is the story of the birth of our Lord
      Jesus Christ. And a part of that beautiful story is the account of Mary,
      the mother of our Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mary was a pure virtuous woman. Nothing is clearer in all the Word of God
      than this truth. Read the accounts of Matthew and Luke and you see her as
      she is—pure in mind, humble, under the hand of God, thankful for the
      blessing of God, having faith to believe the message of God, being wise to
      understand the purpose of God in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mary was highly favored beyond all other women. It was her unique honor
      that she should be the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed was Mary
      among women. Through her, God gave His most priceless gift to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, though Mary be worthy of all honor as a woman favored of God beyond
      all others, and though she be indeed a splendid, beautiful, godly
      character, and though she be the mother of our Lord, Mary can neither
      intercede for us with God, nor can she save us, and certainly we must not
      worship her. There is nothing clearer in the Word of God than this truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us notice this truth as it is diligently compared with the teaching of
      the Roman Catholic Church and the Word of God. The following quotations
      are taken from the book, The Glories of Mary, which was written by Bishop
      Alphonse de Liguori, one of the greatest devotional writers of the Roman
      Catholic Church, and the Word of God taken from the Douay Version which is
      approved by James Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore. The Editor’s
      notice says, ‘Everything that our saint has written is, as it were, a
      summary of Catholic tradition on the subject that it treats; it is not an
      individual author; it is, so to speak, the church herself that speaks to
      us by the voice of her prophets, her apostles, her pontiffs, her saints,
      her fathers, her doctors of all nations and ages. No other book appears to
      be more worthy of recommendation in this respect than The Glories of
      Mary.'" (1931 edition; Redemptorist Fathers, Brooklyn). Note the following
      deadly parallel:
    </p>
    <h2>Mary Is Given the Place Belonging to Christ</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Roman Catholic Church:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      “And she is truly a mediatress of peace between sinners and God. Sinners
      receive pardon by... Mary alone” (pp. 82-83). “Mary is our life. ... Mary
      in obtaining this grace for sinners by her intercession, thus restores
      them to life” (p. 80). “He fails and is LOST who has not recourse to Mary”
      (p. 94).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The Word of God:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      For there is one God, and ONE Mediator of God and men, the man Christ
      Jesus” (1 Tim. 2:5). “Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and
      the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me” (John 14:6). “Christ...
      is our life” (Col. 3:4).
    </p>
    <h2>Mary Is Glorified More than Christ</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Roman Catholic Church:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Holy Church commands a worship peculiar to Mary” (p. 130). “Many
      things... are asked from God, and are not granted; they are asked from
      Mary, and are obtained,” for “She... is even Queen of Hell, and Sovereign
      Mistress of the Devils” (pp. 127, 141, 143).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The Word of God:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the Name of Jesus Christ... For there is no other name under Heaven
      given to men, whereby we must be saved” (Acts 3:6, 4:12). His Name is
      “above every name... not only in this world, but also in that which is to
      come” (Eph. 1:21).
    </p>
    <h2>Mary Is the Gate to Heaven Instead of Christ</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Roman Catholic Church:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mary is called... the gate of heaven because no one can enter that
      blessed kingdom without passing through her” (p. 160).
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Way of Salvation is open to none otherwise than through Mary,” and
      since “Our salvation is in the hands of Mary... He who is protected by
      Mary will be saved, he who is not will be lost” (pp. 169-170).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The Word of God:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved,” says
      Christ (John 10:1,7,9).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jesus saith to him, I am the way... no man cometh to the Father but by
      me” (John 14:6). “Neither is there Salvation in any other” (Acts 4:12).
    </p>
    <h2>Mary Is Given the Power of Christ</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Roman Catholic Church:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      “All power is given to thee in Heaven and on earth,” so that “at the
      command of Mary all obey—even God... and thus... God has placed the whole
      Church... under the domination of Mary” (pp. 180-181). Mary “is also the
      Advocate of the whole human race... for she can do what she wills with
      God” (p. 193).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The Word of God:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      “All power is given to me in Heaven and in earth,” so that “in the Name of
      JESUS every knee should bow,” “that in all things He may hold the primacy”
      (Matt. 28:18, Phil. 2:9-11, Col. 1:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, JESUS Christ the
      Just: and he is the propitiation for our sins” (1 John 2:1-2).
    </p>
    <h2>Mary Is the Peace-Maker Instead of Jesus Christ Our Peace</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Roman Catholic Church:</em>
    </p>
    <p>Mary is the Peace-maker between sinners and God” (p. 197).</p>
    <p>
      “We often more quickly obtain what we ask by calling on the name of Mary,
      than by invoking that of Jesus.” “She... is our Salvation, our Life, our
      Hope, our Counsel, our Refuge, our Help” (pp. 254, 257).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The Word of God:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      But now in Christ Jesus, you, who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by
      the blood of Christ. For He is our peace” (Eph. 2:13-14).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hitherto you have not asked anything in my name. Ask, and you shall
      receive,” for “Whatsoever we shall ask according to His will. He heareth
      us” (John 16:23-24).
    </p>
    <h2>Mary Is Given the Glory that Belongs to Christ Alone</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Roman Catholic Church:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      “The whole Trinity, O Mary, gave thee a name... above every other name,
      that at Thy name, every knee should bow, of things in heaven, on earth,
      and under the earth” (p. 260).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The Word of God:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      God also hath highly exalted Him, and hath given Him a Name which is above
      all names, that in the Name of JESUS every knee should bow, of those that
      are in Heaven, on earth, and under the earth” (Phil. 2:9-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Liguori, more than any other one person, has been responsible for
      promoting Mariolatry in the Roman Church, dethroning Christ and enthroning
      Mary in the hearts of the people. Yet instead of excommunicating him for
      his heresies, the Roman Church has canonized him as a saint and has
      published his book in many editions, more recently under the imprimatur of
      Cardinal Patrick Joseph Hays, of New York.

      In a widely used prayer book, the Raccolta , which has been especially
      indulgenced by several popes and which therefore is accepted by Romanists
      as authoritative, we read such as the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hail, Queen, Mother of Mercy, our Life. Sweetness, and Hope, all Hail! To
      thee we cry, banished sons of Eve; to thee we sigh, groaning and weeping
      in this vale of tears.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We fly beneath thy shelter, O holy Mother of God, despise not our
      petitions in our necessity, and deliver us always from all perils, O
      glorious and Blessed Virgin.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heart of Mary, Mother of God... Worthy of all the veneration of angels
      and men. ... In thee let the Holy Church find safe shelter; protect it,
      and be its asylum, its tower, its strength.”
    </p>
    <p>“Sweet heart of Mary, be my salvation.”</p>
    <p>
      “Leave me not. My Mother, in my own hands, or I am lost; let me but cling
      to thee. Save me, my Hope; save me from hell.”
    </p>
    <p>Also in the Raccolta prayers are addressed to Joseph:</p>
    <p>“Benign Joseph, our guide, protect us and the Holy Church.”</p>
    <p>
      “Guardian of Virgins, and Holy Father Joseph, to whose faithful keeping
      Christ Jesus, innocence itself, and Mary, Virgin of Virgins, were
      committed, I pray and beseech thee by those two dear pledges, Jesus and
      Mary, that being preserved from all uncleanness, I may with spotless mind,
      pure heart, and chaste body, ever most chastely serve Jesus and Mary.
      Amen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The rosary, which is by far the most popular Roman Catholic ritual prayer,
      contains fifty “Hail Mary’s.” The Hail Mary (or Ave Maria ) is follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst
      women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of
      God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.”

    <h2>Mary as an Object of Worship</h2>
    <p>
      The devotions to Mary are undoubtedly the most spontaneous of any in the
      Roman Catholic worship. Attendance at Sunday mass is obligatory, under
      penalty of mortal sin if one is absent without a good reason, and much of
      the regular service is formalistic and routine. But the people by the
      thousands voluntarily attend novenas for the “Sorrowful Mother.” Almost
      every religious order dedicates itself to the Virgin Mary. National
      shrines, such as those at Lourdes in France, Fatima in Portugal, and Our
      Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico, are dedicated to her and attract millions.
      The shrine of St. Anne de Beaupre, in Quebec, the most popular shrine in
      Canada, is dedicated to Saint Anne, who according to apocryphal literature
      was the mother of Mary. Thousands of churches, schools, hospitals,
      convents, and shrines are dedicated to her glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult for Protestants to realize the deep love and reverence
      that devout Roman Catholics have for the Virgin Mary. One must be immersed
      in and saturated with the Roman Catholic mind in order to feel its
      heartbeat. Says Margaret Shepherd, an ex nun:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No words can define to my readers the feeling of reverential love I had
      for the Virgin Mary. As the humble suppliant kneels before her statue he
      thinks of her as the tender, compassionate mother of Jesus, the friend and
      mediatrix of sinners. The thought of praying to Christ for any special
      grace without seeking the intercession of Mary never occurred to me” {My
      Life in the Convent , p. 31).
    </p>
    <p>
      The titles given Mary are in themselves a revelation of Roman Catholic
      sentiment toward her. She is called: Mother of God, Queen of the Apostles,
      Queen of Heaven, Queen of the Angels, the Door of Paradise, the Gate of
      Heaven, Our Life, Mother of Grace, Mother of Mercy, and many others which
      ascribe to her supernatural powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of those titles are false. Let us consider just two of them. When she
      is called “Queen of the Apostles,” is that an apostolic doctrine? Where is
      it found? Certainly it is not in Scripture. When did the apostles elect
      Mary their queen? Or when was she appointed by God to be their queen? And
      the title “Queen of Heaven” is equally false, or even worse. Heaven has no
      “queen.” The only references in Scripture to prayers to the “queen of
      heaven” are found in Jeremiah 7:18, 44:17-19,25, where it is severely
      condemned as a heathen custom practiced by some apostate Jews. This
      so-called “queen of heaven” was a Canaanitish goddess of fertility,
      Astarte (plural, Ashtaroth) (Judges 2:13). How shameful to impose a
      heathen title on Mary, and then to venerate her as another deity!
    </p>
    <p>
      How can anyone of the perhaps one hundred million practicing Roman
      Catholics throughout the world who desire Mary’s attention imagine that
      she can give him that attention during his prayers to her, his wearing her
      scapulars for special protection, his marching in parades in her honor,
      etc., while at the same time she is giving attention to all others who are
      praying to her, attending to her duties in heaven, conducting souls to
      heaven, rescuing souls from purgatory, etc.? The average Roman Catholic
      acts on the assumption that Mary has the powers of deity. There is nothing
      in the Bible to indicate that any departed human being, however good, has
      any further contact with affairs on this earth, or that he can hear so
      much as one prayer from earth. How, then, can a human being such as Mary
      hear the prayers of millions of Roman Catholics, in many different
      countries, praying in many different languages, all at the same time? Let
      any priest or layman try to converse with only three people at the same
      time and see how impossible that is for a human being. They impose on Mary
      works which no human being can do. How impossible, how absurd, to impose
      on her the works which only God can do! Since Mary is not omnipresent nor
      omniscient, such prayers and worship are nothing less than idolatry—that
      is, the giving of divine honors to a creature. Nowhere in the Bible is
      there the slightest suggestion that prayer should be offered to Mary. If
      God had intended that we should pray to her, surely He would have said so.
      Worship is accorded to the infant Jesus, but never to His mother. When
      Jesus was born in Bethlehem, wise men came from the East, and when they
      came into the house, they saw the young child with Mary His mother. What
      did they do? Did they fall down and worship Mary? Or Joseph? No! We read:
      “They fell down and worshipped him” (Matthew 2:11). And to whom did they
      give their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh? To Mary? Or to Joseph?
      No! They presented their gifts to Jesus. They recognized Him, not Mary or
      Joseph, as worthy of adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, in Old Testament times the Jews prayed to God, but never to
      Abraham, or Jacob, or David, or to any of the prophets. There is never the
      slightest suggestion that prayers should be offered to anyone other than
      God. Nor did the apostles ever ask the early Christians to worship, or
      venerate, or pray to Mary or to any other human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objections against prayers to Mary apply equally against prayers to
      the saints. For they too are only creatures, infinitely less than God,
      able to be at only one place at a time and to do only one thing at a time.
      How, then, can they listen to and answer the thousands upon thousands of
      petitions made simultaneously in many different lands and in many
      different languages? Many such petitions are expressed, not orally, but
      only mentally, silently. How can Mary and the saints, without being like
      God, be present everywhere and know the secrets of all hearts?
    </p>
    <p>
      That living saints should pray to departed saints seems on the face of it
      to be the very height of the ridiculous. But the fact is that most Roman
      Catholics pray to Mary and the saints more than they pray to God. Yet they
      cannot explain how departed saints can hear and answer prayers. The
      endless prayers to the Virgin and to the countless saints cannot bring one
      closer to God. And particularly when we see all the gaudy trappings that
      are resorted to in Rome’s distorted version of a glamour queen the whole
      procedure becomes, to Protestants, truly abhorrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Church commits grievous sin in promoting the worship of Mary. It
      dishonors God, first, by its use of images, and secondly, by giving to a
      creature the worship that belongs only to the Creator. We have here merely
      another example of Rome’s persistent tendency to add to the divinely
      prescribed way of salvation. Romanism sets forth faith and works,
      Scripture and tradition, Christ and Mary, as the means of salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Chiniquy, a former priest from Montreal, Canada, who became a
      Presbyterian minister, tells of the following conversation between himself
      and his bishop when doubts began to assail him regarding the place given
      to Mary:
    </p>
    <p>“My lord, who has saved you and me upon the cross?”</p>
    <p>He answered, “Jesus Christ.”</p>
    <p>
      “Who paid your debt and mine by shedding His blood; was it Mary or Jesus?”
    </p>
    <p>He said, “Jesus Christ.”</p>
    <p>
      “Now, my lord, when Jesus and Mary were on earth, who loved the sinner
      more; was it Mary or Jesus?”
    </p>
    <p>Again he answered that it was Jesus.</p>
    <p>“Did any sinner come to Mary on earth to be saved?”</p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>“Do you remember that any sinner has gone to Jesus to be saved?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, many.”</p>
    <p>“Have they been rebuked?”</p>
    <p>“Never.”</p>
    <p>
      Do you remember that Jesus ever said to sinners, “Come to Mary and she
      will save you?”
    </p>
    <p>“No,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Do you remember that Jesus has said to poor sinners, “Come to me?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, He has said it.”</p>
    <p>“Has He ever retracted those words?”</p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>“And who was, then, the more powerful to save sinners?” I asked.</p>
    <p>“O, it was Jesus!”</p>
    <p>
      “Now, my lord, since Jesus and Mary are in heaven, can you show me in the
      Scriptures that Jesus has lost anything of His desire and power to save
      sinners, or that He has delegated this power to Mary?”
    </p>
    <p>And the bishop answered, “No.”</p>
    <p>
      “Then, my lord,” I asked, “why do we not go to Him, and to Him alone? Why
      do we invite poor sinners to come to Mary, when, by your own confession
      she is nothing compared with Jesus, in power, in mercy, in love, and in
      compassion for the sinner?”
    </p>
    <p>
      To that the bishop could give no answer (Fifty Years in the Church of
      Rome, p. 262).
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to this day the province of Quebec is almost solidly Roman Catholic.
      Throughout the province one can scarcely hear the Gospel in any church, or
      on any local radio broadcast, or obtain anything but Roman Catholic
      literature. Quebec is full of idols. The late pope Pius XII declared that
      the province of Quebec was the world’s most Catholic country. But
      everywhere Mary, and not Christ, is represented as the only hope of the
      four million French-Canadians. And, let it be noticed further, the
      province of Quebec has the most illiteracy, the poorest schools, and the
      lowest standard of living of any province in Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very difficult to convince Roman Catholic people that Christ has won
      for them the right to go directly to God in prayer. They read the Bible
      but very little. Instead they fall back on what their priests have taught
      them, that to obtain mercy and forgiveness they must cajole some saint,
      some close and favored friend of God, to intercede for them. And the most
      powerful intercessor of all, of course, is Mary, since she is the mother
      of Christ. But the absurd thing about saint worship is that neither Mary
      nor any of the others ever promised, when they were living, that they
      would pray for their devotees after reaching heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to New Testament usage, all true Christians are saints. Paul’s
      letters to the Ephesians was addressed, “to the saints that are at
      Ephesus” (1:1); his letter to the Philippians, “to all the saints that are
      at Philippi” (1:1). See also Romans 1:7, 16:15; 1 Corinthians 1:2; 2
      Corinthians 1:1. It has well been said, If you want a “saint” to pray for
      you, find a true Christian and make the request of him. His prayer will be
      more effective than any request that can be made through departed saints.
      We have no need for the intercession of Mary, or departed saints, or
      angels, for we ourselves have direct access to God through Christ.
      Furthermore, not only do we have no single instance in the Bible of a
      living saint worshipping a departed saint, but all attempts on the part of
      the living to make any kind of contact with the dead are severely
      condemned (Deuteronomy 18:9-12, Exodus 22:18, Leviticus 20:6, Isaiah
      8:19-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scriptures directly repudiate all saint worship. We have specific
      examples of Peter, and Paul, and even of an angel rejecting such worship.
      When Peter went to the house of Cornelius in response to the vision that
      he had while at prayer on the housetop, we read that “Cornelius met him,
      and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. But Peter raised him up,
      saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man” (Acts 10:25-26). Although Peter
      was one of the twelve, and had been personally associated with Jesus, he
      knew that he had no right to such worship for he was only a man. At
      Lystra, after Paul had healed a lame man, the multitude attempted to
      worship him and Barnabas. We read: “But when the apostles, Barnabas and
      Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the
      multitude, crying out and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also
      are men of like passions with you and bring you good tidings, that ye
      should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the heaven
      and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is” (Acts 14:14-15). And
      the apostle John writes concerning his experience on the island of Patmos:
      “And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the
      angel that showed me these things. And he saith unto me, See thou do it
      not: I am a fellowservant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets,
      and with them that keep the words of this book: worship God” (Revelation
      22:8-9). But how different is the attitude of popes, bishops, and priests
      who expect people to kneel before them and to kiss their hands or rings!
      The pope allows or expects that under some conditions they shall even kiss
      his feet! But what nonsense that is, both on the part of the pope and on
      the part of those who submit themselves to such a servile practice!

    <h2>Mary Usurps the Place of Christ</h2>
    <p>
      A striking phenomenon in Roman Catholicism is the effective way in which
      they have caused Mary to usurp the place of Christ as the primary mediator
      between God and men. Christ is usually represented as a helpless babe in a
      manger or in His mother’s arms, or as a dead Christ upon a cross. The babe
      in a manger or in His mother’s arms gives little promise of being able to
      help anyone. And the dead Christ upon a cross, with a horribly ugly and
      tortured face, is the very incarnation of misery and helplessness, wholly
      irrelevant to the needs and problems of the people. Such a Christ might
      inspire feelings of pity and compassion but not of confidence and hope. He
      is a defeated, not a victorious, Christ. The Roman Church cannot get its
      people to love a dead Christ, no matter how many masses are said before
      Him or how many images are dedicated to Him. There can be no real love for
      Christ unless the worshipper sees Him as his living Savior, who died for
      him, but who arose, and who now lives gloriously and triumphantly —as
      indeed He is presented in Protestantism. In the Roman Church the people
      prefer a living Mary to a dead Christ. And the result is that the center
      of worship has shifted from Christ to Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite all protestations to the contrary, the fact is that the worship,
      intercessions, and devotions that are given to Mary obscure the glory of
      Christ and cause the church to set forth a system of salvation in which
      human merit plays a decisive part. While asserting the deity of Christ,
      Rome nevertheless makes Him subservient to the Virgin, and dispenses
      salvation at a price through the agency of the priest. This most blessed
      of women, the mother of Jesus, is thus made His chief rival and competitor
      for the loyalty and devotion of the human heart. In Romanism Mary becomes
      the executive director of deity, the one through whom the prayers of the
      people are made effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary has nothing whatever to do with our salvation. All who think she does
      are simply deceived. And yet in Romanism probably ten times as much prayer
      is directed to her as to Christ. The most popular prayer ritual of Roman
      Catholics, the rosary, has ten prayers to Mary for each one directed to
      God. The prayer book contains more prayers which are to be offered to Mary
      and the saints than to Christ. Mary is unquestionably the chief object of
      prayer.

<div id="Sympathy" dropdownName="Marian Sympathy" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Mary Represented as More Sympathetic than Jesus</h2>
    <p>
      The spiritual climate of the Middle Ages was favorable for the development
      of the Mary-cult. Particularly in that age Christ was represented as a Man
      of stem wrath, a strict judge, avenging evil with an inexorable justice,
      while Mary was clothed with the virtues of lovingkindness and mercy. Where
      Christ would demand justice, Mary would extend mercy. The simple believer,
      who had been told that God was an angry judge always ready to send the
      sinner to hell, wanted to flee to the protection of the tender-hearted and
      loving Mary. Even monks who lived ascetic lives and shunned or even hated
      women as instruments of their temptation and downfall sought the
      protection of Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      In The Glories of Mary, Liguori pictures Christ as a stern, cruel Judge,
      while Mary is pictured as a kind and lovable intercessor. Among other
      things Liguori says: “If God is angry with a sinner, and Mary takes him
      under her protection, she withholds the avenging arm of her Son, and saves
      him” (p. 124); “O Immaculate Virgin, prevent thy beloved Son, who is
      irritated by our sins, from abandoning us to the power of the devil” (p.
      248); and again: “We often obtain more promptly what we ask by calling on
      the name of Mary, than by invoking that of Jesus” (p. 248).
    </p>
    <p>
      In another instance Liguori teaches that Mary is the Savior of sinners,
      and that outside her there is no salvation. He describes an imaginary
      scene in which a man burdened with sin sees two ladders hanging from
      heaven, with Christ at the head of one and Mary at the other. He attempts
      to climb the ladder at which Christ is the head, but when he sees the
      angry face he falls back defeated. As he turns away despondent, a voice
      says to him, “Try the other ladder.” He does so, and to his amazement he
      ascends easily and is met at the top by the blessed virgin Mary, who then
      brings him into heaven and presents him to Christ! The teaching is, “What
      son would refuse the request of his mother?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The same reasoning is found among Roman Catholics today. Christ still is
      looked upon as a stem judge. But Mary, being a mother, is looked upon as
      having a mother’s heart and therefore as more capable of understanding the
      problems of her children. She can go to her Son with her requests and
      petitions, and He can never refuse to grant any favor that she asks. She
      is represented as everywhere present. Romanists are taught to appeal to
      her with confidence to allay the fierce judgment of Christ, and to turn
      His serious frown into a friendly smile—all of this in spite of the fact
      that no prayer by Mary for a sinner can be found anywhere in the New
      Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a travesty it is on Scripture truth to teach that Christ demands
      justice, but that Mary will extend mercy! How dishonoring it is to Christ
      to teach that He is lacking in pity and compassion for His people, that He
      must be persuaded to that end by His mother! When He was on earth it was
      never necessary for anyone to persuade Him to be compassionate. Rather,
      when He saw the blind and the lame, the afflicted and hungry, He was
      “moved with compassion” for them and lifted them out of their distress. He
      had immediate mercy on the wicked but penitent thief on the cross, and
      there was no need for intercession by Mary although she was there present.
      His love for us is as great as when He was on earth; His heart is as
      tender; and we need no other intermediary, neither His mother after the
      flesh, nor any saint or angel, to entreat Him on our behalf.
    </p>

<div id="Mediator" dropdownName="One Mediator" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>One Mediator</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible teaches that there is but one mediator between God and men. It
      says: “For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men himself
      man, Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5). When this verse is understood the
      whole system of the Roman Church falls to the ground, for it invalidates
      the papacy, the priesthood, and all Mary worship. Other verses which teach
      the same truth are:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father,
      but by me” (John 14:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      “And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name
      under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved” (Acts
      4:12).
    </p>
    <p>“He is the mediator of a new covenant” (Hebrews 9:15).</p>
    <p>
      “If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
      righteous” (1 John 2: 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Christ Jesus... who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh
      intercession for us.” Christ, not Mary, the Scripture says, is at the
      right hand of God making intercession for us (Romans 8:34).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near
      unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them”
      (Hebrews 7:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Christ, because He is both God and man, is the only Saviour, the only
      Mediator, the only way to God. Not one word is said about Mary, or a pope,
      or the priests, or the saints, as mediators. Yet Romanism teaches that
      there are many mediators, and the great majority of Roman Catholics, if
      asked, would say that our primary approach to God is through the Virgin
      Mary, and that only as she begs for us can we enter the presence of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests detract from the glory of Christ when they teach that Mary is
      a mediator. Humanly speaking, that must grieve her who would want all
      honor to go to Christ. The priests have no right to place her in such an
      unscriptural position. Mary is presented in Scripture as a handmaiden of
      the Lord who fulfilled her office in the church according to promise, just
      as did John the Baptist and others, but whose work has long since ceased.
      The great antithesis is not between Eve and Mary, as Rome sets it forth,
      but between Adam and Christ (Romans 5:12-21; 1 Corinthians
      15:21-22,45,47). Roman tradition has so altered the picture of Mary that
      the Mary found in the New Testament and the Mary found in the Roman
      Catholic Church are two different and conflicting persons. Any fairminded
      Roman Catholic knows that his church gives first place to Mary and that
      Christ is kept in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason that Mary, the saints, or angels cannot act as our priest or
      mediator is because they have no sacrifice, nothing to offer in behalf of
      our sins. Only a priest with a true sacrifice can serve as mediator
      between God and men. Christ alone has a true sacrifice, and He alone can
      act as our priest. In this connection Calvin says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I deem it indisputable that the papal priesthood is spurious; for it has
      been formed in the workshop of men. God nowhere commands a sacrifice to be
      offered now to Him for the expiation of sins; nowhere does He command that
      priests be appointed for such a purpose. While then the pope ordains his
      priests for the purpose of sacrificing, the Apostle [Paul] denies that
      they are to be accounted lawful priests.”

  <section>
    <h2>Adoration or Idolatry?</h2>
    <p>
      The Roman Church officially denies worshipping Mary. Officially she says
      that Mary is only a creature, highly exalted, but still a creature, in no
      way equal to God. Yet she tells us that Mary hears the prayers of millions
      and that she constantly gives attention to her followers throughout the
      world. It may well be that, as Rome says, she does not intend idolatry.
      But the intention and the practical working out of the system are two
      different things. We must insist that it is worship, and that therefore it
      is idolatry as practiced by millions of people who kneel before Mary’s
      statues and pray and sing to her. Most of these people know nothing at all
      of the technical distinctions made by their theologians between adoration
      and worship. It certainly is idolatrous to give her the attributes of
      omnipresence and omniscience and to give her titles and which belong to
      God, as when, by the late pope Pius XII, she was officially designated the
      “Queen of Heaven,” and “Queen of the World,” and when prayers are made to
      her for salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the prayers addressed to Mary and the saints are idolatrous is clear
      from the fact that (1) they are precisely the same kind, and are expressed
      in the same terms, as those addressed to God; (2) they are presented in
      the ordinary course of worshipping God; (3) they are offered kneeling; and
      (4) they form the bulk of the prayers offered. We have mentioned the most
      famous prayer addressed to Mary, the Ave Maria, or Hail Mary. As commonly
      used, this prayer follows the Lord’s prayer, and is offered in precisely
      the same way. Assuming that there are one hundred million “practicing”
      Roman Catholics throughout the world, and that half of them say the rosary
      at least once each day—the rosary contains 50 “Hail Mary’s” and takes
      quite some time to repeat—Mary would have to have the attributes of deity
      to hear and answer such a mass of prayer. Surely Roman Catholics
      themselves can see the impossibility of all those prayers being heard and
      answered by one who by the admission of their own church is not God, but
      only human. The whole thing is a deceit and an illusion. Even if it were
      true that the spirits of the departed have access to this world, that
      could not be known except by divine revelation. And no such revelation
      exists. The growth of Mariolatry is indeed a sad chapter in the history of
      the church. Like the brazen serpent of Moses, which at the time of
      Hezekiah had become an object of idolatrous worship and had to be
      destroyed, so in the Roman Church Mary has come to be looked upon as the
      instrumental cause of salvation, and as such is given divine honors. The
      Roman Church ascribes to her large numbers of miracles, fully supernatural
      and similar in all respects to those performed by Christ. Numerous
      appearances are claimed for her. On some occasions statues of Mary are
      said to have blinked or wept. Relics in abundance have been exhibited in
      European cathedrals. Samples of her clothing, hair, teeth, and milk have
      been exhibited in numerous places.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worship of Mary is, of course, a great injustice to Mary herself, for
      it makes her the occasion for breaking the commandments of God. Nothing is
      more clearly revealed in Scripture than that divine worship is to be paid
      to God alone: “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt
      thou serve” (Matthew 4:10). Nothing is more severely rebuked than idolatry
      of every kind and form. If Mary could see all the Roman Catholics bowing
      down before her images in the thousands of churches and millions of homes,
      how great would be her grief! To pray to Mary is at the least a waste of
      time. And worse than that, it is idolatry, a direct product of the use of
      unscriptural doctrines and practices.

  <section>
    <h2>Latria, Dulia, Hyperdulia</h2>
    <p>
      The Church of Rome, without any warrant whatever from Scripture,
      technically divides worship into three kinds: (1) Latria, the supreme
      worship, given to God alone; (2) Dulia, a secondary kind of veneration
      given to saints and angels; and (3) Hyperdulia, a higher kind of
      veneration given to the Virgin Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory, however, is useless in practice, for the average worshipper is
      not able to make the distinctions, nor does he even know that such
      distinctions exist. The subtleties of definition only confuse the issue,
      for who can balance his feelings so nicely as to give God, the Virgin, and
      the saints their due proportion? This is particularly true in Roman
      Catholic countries such as Italy, Spain, and Latin America where so many
      of the people are illiterate and given to all kinds of superstitions. We
      must insist that any religious worship, whether inward or outward,
      consisting of prayer, or praise, and expressed by outward homage such as
      bowing, kneeling, or prostration, is properly termed worship and belongs
      to God alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slogan, “Through Mary to Christ,” does not change the fact that for
      many worshippers the devotion naturally stops with Mary. They pray to
      Mary, not to Christ. Their prayers are directed to her personally. Roman
      Catholics are taught that all grace necessarily flows through Mary. She is
      regarded as a kind of fourth person of the Blessed Trinity. To speak of
      Mary as “holy,” as “the Mother of God,” and as “co-redeemer with Christ,”
      cannot but give the impression that she is more than human. Pope Benedict
      XV (1914-1922) gave expression to the thought that Mary suffered with her
      suffering and dying Son, and that with Him she has redeemed the human
      race. This pronouncement was also sanctioned by Pope Pius XI in 1923.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distinction that Rome makes between latria, dulia, and hyperdulia does
      enable her to maintain officially that she does not teach the “worship” of
      Mary. However, the lengths to which her apologists have gone in trying to
      distinguish between such devotions and actual worship is evidence that she
      feels uncomfortable about the lofty names given to Mary and about the
      actual results, and that she does not dare take responsibility for what
      goes on in her churches. And, subtleties aside, some Roman theologians
      acknowledge that they do worship Mary.

<div id="Jesus" dropdownName="Jesus' Attitude" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Jesus’ Attitude toward Mary</h2>
    <p>
      It is particularly instructive to notice the attitude that the Lord Jesus
      Himself took toward Mary. The first recorded instance occurred when, at
      the age of 12, the boy Jesus, after attending the Passover in Jerusalem
      with His parents, remained in the temple. We read, in the Confraternity
      Version, that when His parents found Him, “His mother said to him, ‘Son,
      what thou done so to us? Behold, in sorrow thy father and I have been
      seeking thee.’ And he said to them, ‘How is it that you sought me? Did you
      not know that I must be about my Father’s business?’ And they did not
      understand the word that he spake to them” (Luke 2:48-49).
    </p>
    <p>
      Says The New Bible Commentary (Protestant) in explanation of this event:
      “The answer of Jesus is an expression of surprise. There was something
      about Him which He was surprised His parents did not know. ... He had
      always been occupied with His Father’s affairs and had no interests of His
      own to engage Him. This was what His parents might have known” (p. 844).
    </p>
    <p>
      On two later occasions, after Jesus had reached His maturity, Mary
      attempted to show her parental authority, but each time was held in check.
      The first occurred at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, when the wine ran
      out. We read, again in the Confraternity Version:
    </p>
    <p>
      “And on the third day a marriage took place at Cana of Galilee, and the
      mother of Jesus was there [Notice, it does not say, “Mother of God”]. Now
      Jesus too was invited to the marriage, and also his disciples. And the
      wine having run short, the mother of Jesus said to him, ‘They have no
      wine: And Jesus said to her, What wouldst thou have me do, woman? My hour
      has not yet come.’ His mother said to the attendants, ‘Do whatever he
      tells you’” (John 2:1-5).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this instance, the first of its kind after the beginning of His public
      ministry, Jesus gave Mary to understand that no one, not even His mother,
      must dictate to Him concerning the time and manner of opening His public
      ministry, that thenceforth she was not to exercise any authority over Him,
      and that His working of miracles and the redemption of souls was, strictly
      speaking, none of her business. He was pointing out to His mother that
      from then on He had no dependence on her, but that she must depend upon
      Him. Mary’s words to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you,” indicate
      that she understood and accepted this new role. In any event, Mary is not
      to be worshipped, nor does she have authority with her Son in behalf of
      others. Had Jesus submitted to His mother’s suggestion and leading, there
      might have been some grounds for “Mary worship,” and for the claim of the
      Roman Church that “Mary is the hope of all.” But here at the very
      beginning of His public ministry the ground is cut from under any such
      claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion, apparently after weeks of absence, Mary came seeking
      Jesus at the place where He was preaching to the multitude, but could not
      get to Him because of the crowd. Apparently she sent word to Him by
      messenger, making known her desire that He would come to her, or perhaps
      making the direct request that He come to her without regard to how that
      might interrupt His work. But He ignored or refused her request. We read
      (Confraternity Version):
    </p>
    <p>
      “While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brethren
      were standing outside, seeking to speak to him. And someone said to him,
      ‘Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are standing outside, seeking thee.’
      But he answered and said to him that told him, ‘Who is my mother and who
      are my brethren?’ And stretching forth his hand toward his disciples, he
      said, ‘Behold my mother and my brethren! For whoever does the will of my
      Father in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother’” (Matthew
      12:46-50).
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of granting Mary’s request, He replied in such a way that it was
      in effect a public rebuke. Undoubtedly she felt it keenly. Perhaps Mary
      was even ashamed of the fact that her Son was attracting so much attention
      and wanted to withdraw Him from the crowd, for in Mark’s account of this
      event we read, “And the multitude cometh together again, so that they
      could not so much as eat bread. And when his friends heard it, they went
      out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself’ (3:20-21). As
      we read the New Testament we get the impression that neither Mary nor the
      brothers of Jesus understood His activities while He was on earth (“For
      even his brethren did not believe on him,” John 7:5), and that while Mary
      believed on Him earlier, His brothers may not have joined the company of
      believers until after His resurrection, perhaps not until after His
      ascension.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a boy growing up in the home of Joseph and Mary, Jesus was obedient to
      them. But after His public ministry began, after He had presented Himself
      as the Son of God and as the Savior of the world, Mary had to sink into
      the background. It is to Jesus alone that the world must turn for
      salvation. Undoubtedly He gave this rebuke purposely, that the world might
      know that Mary was His mother as man, but not as God.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mary had had the influence and authority over Him that is claimed the
      Church of Rome, He would not have answered her as He did, but would have
      honored her request promptly. Here again we have Scriptural evidence that
      Mary has nothing to do with the ministry of the Son of God as regards the
      matter of salvation. By this statement He respectfully classes her and His
      brethren along with other converts. To Him they were all the same—“Who is
      my mother and who are my brethren? ... Whoever does the will of my Father
      in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother!” As the Son of God and
      the Redeemer of men, His relation to Mary was identically the same as with
      any others who would hear His Word, and do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on still another occasion a woman in the crowd raised her voice in
      praise of Mary (Confraternity Version): “Now it came to pass as he was
      saying these things, that a certain woman from the crowd lifted up her
      voice and said to him, ‘Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the
      breasts that nursed thee.’ But he said, ‘Rather, blessed are they who hear
      the word of God and keep it’” (Luke 11:27-28).
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the most subtle attack of all, appealing as it does to the
      sentiments and the emotions. It is a device that even today traps unstable
      souls into worshipping a woman, that is, Mariolatry. But here again Jesus
      gave a plain and decisive answer which should settle forever the question
      regarding the superiority of Mary or the promotion of any Mary cult. He
      utterly rejected the idea that Mary occupies a position of holiness above
      that of other women, or that she was to be crowned the “Queen of Heaven”
      and become the object of worship. After the ascension of Christ she is
      seen with the apostles and several other women in Jerusalem (Acts 1:14),
      but no special honor or position is recorded as having been given to her.
      She was not, in herself, more than any other virtuous woman, except that
      she was especially chosen to be the mother of Jesus, and to be the kind
      and loving parent which she was to the most wonderful Child that ever grew
      up in a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      We notice further that throughout our Lord’s public life He was ever
      careful to call Mary “woman,” never “mother.” Even when He was dying on
      the cross He addressed her thus. The Greek, Hebrew, and Latin each had a
      word for “mother,” as well as for “woman.” But the Scripture says “woman,”
      not “mother.” And of course He never used the term “Lady,” which is so
      much used in the Roman Catholic Church. Let us follow the Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Jesus always spoke respectfully to His mother, He nevertheless made
      it clear that neither she nor anyone else had any part in the work of
      salvation. No mere human could assist in that work, and the Scriptures are
      careful to point out that no assistance or dictation in any form was
      permitted. When Jesus stepped out of His home life at Nazareth and began
      His public ministry, a new relationship was established. From that time
      on, His supernatural parentage was emphasized. For He was the only
      begotten Son of the Father in heaven. He rebuked the mistaken tendency
      which seeks to exalt the human relationship at the expense of the divine,
      the physical at the expense of the spiritual.

    <h2>The Protestant Attitude toward Mary</h2>
    <p>
      As evangelical Protestants we honor Mary, the mother of our Lord, with the
      honor the Scriptures give her as “blessed among women.” No other member of
      the human race has received such high honor as was conferred upon Mary in
      that she was chosen to be the mother of the Savior of the world. She was
      truly a woman of virtue, and of extraordinary faith. She fulfilled
      admirably the office assigned to her. She was the chosen vessel to bring
      the Bread of Life to a sin-cursed world. But she was only the vessel, not
      the Bread of Life. We cannot eat the vessel; rather it is the Bread of
      Life that we need. It is not Mary the Jewish maiden, but Jesus the Son of
      God whom we need as Savior.
    </p>
    <p>
      We honor Mary, and all generations shall call her “blessed,” because she
      believed the word of God and accepted the message of the angel Gabriel.
      But we do not deify her, nor worship her, nor pray to her, and we are
      bound to protest strongly when Christ is dethroned and Mary is elevated to
      that place which belongs to Him alone. We worship with her the Son of God,
      but we do not worship her , nor worship through her, as if she were a
      mediator. It is important that all understand the difference between the
      matter of honoring Mary, and the grossly unscriptural practice of
      worshipping her. We are constantly reminded of the words of Jesus:
      “Whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my
      brother, and sister, and mother” (Matthew 12:50).
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman priests say that they honor Mary and accuse Protestants of failing
      to do so. There is the danger, of course, that in revolting against the
      recognized evil of Mariolatry, we may neglect to give Mary the
      distinguished and honored place which the Scripture itself accords her.
      And we should be on guard against that. But the priests do her a grave
      injustice in that they impose too much responsibility upon her. Peter, the
      alleged first pope, did not do that. He did not even mention her in any of
      his sermons or in his two letters. As is characteristic of Protestants, he
      said much about Christ as the only Savior from sin, but he did not present
      Mary as a mediator. To present her in that capacity is to rob God of part
      of His glory and to palm off a counterfeit salvation upon the people.
      There is no record in Scripture of anyone ever believing on Mary for
      salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The false estimate of Mary’s position on the part of the Roman Church is
      based in large measure on a mistaken interpretation of the words of Jesus
      spoken on the cross, when He said to John, “Behold, thy mother.” Romanists
      say that these words were addressed to all men, present and future, and
      that He was committing all men to Mary as her sons. The truth, however, is
      that the New Testament is unmistakably clear on this point, and that the
      Lord committed His mother to John’s care for the remainder of her natural
      life, and that He laid upon John as an individual the responsibility to
      serve as a son to her. It reads:
    </p>
    <p>
      “When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he
      loved, he saith to his mother, Woman, behold, thy son! Then saith he to
      the disciple, Behold, thy mother! and from that hour the disciple took her
      unto his own home” (John 19:26-27).
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural meaning of those words is that they were addressed to Mary and
      to John as individuals, that from that time forward Mary should look upon
      John, the beloved disciple, as her son, as the one who in her life would
      take the place of Jesus, and that John should assume the duties of a son
      and care for Mary with filial affection, that he should comfort her in her
      loneliness, as a true son would. And that Mary and John so understood
      those words is clear from the immediately following verse, which reads:
      “And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home” (v. 27).
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then is the Mary we honor—not a weeping statue of stone, not a
      half-goddess, nor a “Queen of Heaven,” but the humble servant of God, who
      found favor with Him and became the mother of Jesus.

  <section>
    <h2>Were There Other Children in the Family of Joseph and Mary?</h2>
    <p>
      The Scriptures tell us that Jesus was virgin bom. But what of the family
      of Joseph and Mary after the birth of Jesus? Did Joseph and Mary have
      other children? Or was Jesus the only Child? The answers to these
      questions pointedly divide Roman Catholics and Protestants.
    </p>
    <p>In Matthew 13:54-56 we read:</p>
    <p>
      “And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue,
      insomuch that they were astonished, and said, “Whence hath this man this
      wisdom, and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not
      his mother called Mary? And his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon,
      and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark also names the brothers of Jesus and mentions his sisters (6:3). The
      natural meaning of these verses is that there were other children in the
      family of Joseph and Mary. There were four sons; and there were at least
      two daughters, for the term is in the plural. Presumably there were three
      or more daughters, for the term used is “all.” When there are only two we
      say “both,” not “all.” And the reference in John 1:5, “For even his
      brethren did not believe on him,” also finds its most natural meaning in
      other sons of Joseph and Mary. It was self-evident that the people at
      large did not believe on Him, but here John says that even His own
      brothers, the members of His own family, did not believe on Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prophecy about Christ in Psalm 69, “I am become a stranger unto my
      brethren, And an alien unto my mother’s children” (vs. 8), also finds its
      natural fulfillment in the attitude of Christ’s brothers toward Him. That
      this is a Messianic psalm, prophetic of the coming and work of Christ, is
      clear from a number of New Testament references in which it is applied to
      Him. Compare verses 4, 8, 21, and 25 with John 15:25, 2:17; Romans 15:3;
      Matthew 27:34; and Acts 1:20, in which other elements of the Psalm are
      fulfilled. Luke’s statement concerning Mary, “And she brought forth her
      firstborn son” (2:7), implies that there were other sons born after Jesus.
      Acts 1:14 refers to “Mary the mother of Jesus,” and “his brethren,” who
      are mentioned in addition to the disciples.
    </p>
    <p>
      These would in fact have been half-brothers and half-sisters of Jesus
      since they were sons and daughters of Joseph and Mary, while He was the
      Son of Mary only. James, the halfbrother of the Lord, became the head of
      the church in Jerusalem and presided at the Jerusalem Council (Acts
      15:13,19). And two of the books of the New Testament, James and Jude, were
      written by the sons of Joseph and Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic Church attempts to explain these away as cousins, and
      therefore not children of Joseph and Mary at all. But the Greek has
      another word which means cousin, anepsios , as in Colossians 4:10: “Mark,
      the cousin of Barnabas.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reference indicating the same is Matthew 1:24,25: “And Joseph
      arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and
      took unto him his wife; and knew her not till she brought forth a son: and
      he called his name Jesus.” All that the Scripture says is that Joseph knew
      her not until after the birth of Jesus. The inference is that after the
      birth of Jesus Mary became wholly and completely the wife of Joseph, that
      they then lived as normal husband and wife, and, taken in connection with
      the other references that we have, that other children were then bom into
      their family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scriptures affirm that Mary was a virgin until after Jesus was bom.
      Nothing beyond that is needed to safeguard the Deity of Christ and
      Virginity of Mary. What more is needed to prove that Jesus was virgin-bom?
      What more do we need to prove that Joseph was not the father of Jesus? In
      going beyond that and teaching the “perpetual virginity” of Mary, the
      Roman Catholics go beyond Scripture and set up manmade doctrine which has
      no authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests make repeated references to “the Virgin Mary.” They
      acknowledge that Joseph and Mary were husband and wife and attempt to
      portray them as the ideal human family, but deny that they lived in a
      normal marriage relationship. But such an unnatural relationship absurd on
      the face of it, and nowhere in Scripture is approval ever given for such
      an abnormal relationship. Such an arrangement would have been contrary to
      nature and simply a frustration for both parties. The priests must either
      give up the idea of Mary’s perpetual virginity, or give up the idea that
      Joseph and Mary represent the ideal human family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back of Rome’s insistence on the perpetual virginity of Mary, of course,
      is the desire to justify the celibate state of the priests and nuns. Rome
      teaches that the single state is holier than the married state, that there
      is something inherently unclean and defiling about marriage. Says one
      Roman Catholic writer concerning the Virgin Mary: “It cannot with decency
      be imagined that the most holy vessel which was once consecrated to be a
      receptacle of the Deity should be afterwards desecrated and profaned by
      human usage.” According to this teaching a woman’s body is “desecrated and
      profaned” when she becomes a mother in the normal course of family life! A
      nun is holier than the mother of lovely children! And since Rome thinks of
      marriage as unholy and unclean, and since she has set herself to maintain
      the holiness, even the sinless perfection, of Mary, she finds herself
      obliged to teach that Mary always remained a virgin.

  <section>
    <h2>The Immaculate Conception</h2>
    <p>
      The doctrine of the “Immaculate Conception” teaches that Mary herself was
      bom without sin, that from the very first moment of her existence she was
      free from the taint of original sin. It holds that while all the rest of
      mankind are bom into an inheritance of original sin, Mary alone, by a
      special miracle of God, was excepted. The original decree setting forth
      this doctrine was issued by Pope Pius IX, on December 8, 1854, and reads
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We declare, pronounce and define that the Most Blessed Virgin Mary at the
      first instant of her conception was preserved immaculate from all stain of
      original sin, by the singular grace and privilege of the Omnipotent God,
      in virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of mankind, and that
      this doctrine was revealed by God, and therefore must be believed firmly
      and constantly by all the faithful” (from the papal bull Inejfabilus Deus,
      quoted in The Tablet , December 12, 1953).
    </p>
    <p>
      Many Protestants misunderstand this doctrine and assume that it relates to
      the virgin birth of Christ. It relates, however, to Mary’s own birth, and
      has nothing to do with the virgin birth of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side with the doctrine that Mary was born without sin, there
      developed the doctrine that she did not commit sin at any time during her
      life. Then, as one link reached out for another, they gave her the
      attribute of impeccability, which means that she could not sin, that her
      nature was such that it was impossible for her to sin! All of this was a
      natural outgrowth of their worship of Mary, a further step in her
      deification. Their Mariolatry demanded it! They sensed that if they were
      to give her the worship that is due our Lord, she must be sinless.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this doctrine, like the other distinctive doctrines of the Roman
      system, completely lacks any Scriptural support, and in fact is directly
      opposed to the Scripture doctrine of original sin. The Bible teaches that
      all men, with the single exception of Christ, who was deity incarnate and
      pre-existent, are sinners. Mary herself acknowledged her need of a Savior,
      for she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my
      Saviour” (Luke 1:46-47).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note particularly Mary’s words, “my Savior.” No one other than a sinner
      needs a Savior, for no punishment or evil in any form can be inflicted
      upon a sinless person. Roman Catholics will have to take Mary’s word or
      accuse “Our Lady” of lying. For in those words she confessed that she was
      a sinner in need of a Savior. That should settle once and for all whether
      or not a Christian should pray to her. Mary was an admirable character, to
      be sure. But she was not sinless, and she was only human. It was,
      therefore, necessary for her to be born again of the Spirit and to
      participate in the redemption provided by her Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scriptures say clearly: “All have sinned, and fall short of the glory
      of God” (that includes Mary—Romans 3:23); “Therefore, as through one man
      sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed
      unto all men, for that all sinned” (Romans 5:12); “For as in Adam all die”
      (1 Corinthians 15:22); “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
      ourselves, and the truth is not in us. ... If we say that we have not
      sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us” (1 John 1:8,10);
      “There is none righteous, no, not one” (Romans 3:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Scripture tells us that after the birth of Jesus, Mary brought the two
      offerings as prescribed in the law—one, a bumt-offering (symbolizing
      complete surrender of the will to God), and the other a sin-offering (a
      sacrifice acknowledging sin) (Luke 2:22-24, Leviticus 12:6-8). The last
      time Mary is mentioned in the New Testament she is praying on the same
      plane as other needy Christians, not being prayed to by them (Acts
      1:13-14).
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of the immaculate conception has had a long and varied
      history. It was unknown to the apostolic church, and it was not even a
      matter of discussion until several centuries after the death of Mary. It
      did not become an official doctrine until the year 1854, more than 18
      centuries after Christ was born of the virgin Mary, and so is one of the
      later doctrines of the Roman Church. The Council of Ephesus, 431, used the
      expression, “Mother of God,” but its purpose was to emphasize the deity of
      Christ, not to set forth a doctrine concerning Mary. But popular opinion
      reasoned that since the birth of Christ occurred without any taint of sin,
      Mary herself must have been without sin, even without original sin, which
      is the lot of all other human beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustine, who died in A.D. 430, and who was admittedly the greatest
      theologian of the ancient church, contradicts the idea of immaculate
      conception, for he expressly declares that Mary’s flesh was “flesh of sin”
      (De Peccatorum Mentis , II, c. 24); and again that “Mary, springing from
      Adam, died because of sin; and the flesh of our Lord, derived from Mary,
      died to take away sin.” He expressly attributed original sin to Mary in
      his Sermon on Psalm 2. The doctrine was opposed by Chrysostom, Eusebius,
      Ambrose, Anselm, most of the great medieval schoolmen, including Thomas
      Aquinas, Bonaventure, Cardinal Cajetan (Luther’s opponent at Augsburg),
      and also by two of the greatest of the popes, Gregory the Great and
      Innocent III.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Aquinas says that while Christ did not contract original sin in any
      way whatsoever, nevertheless “the blessed Virgin did contract original
      sin, but was cleansed therefrom before her birth” (Summa Theol. Ill, ad 2;
      Quest. 27, Art. 1-5); and again that, “It is to be held, therefore, that
      she was conceived in original sin, but was cleansed from it in a special
      manner” (Compendium Theol., p. 224). Geddes MacGregor, in his book, The
      Vatican Revolution, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “So strong was St. Thomas’ [Aquinas] opposition to the doctrine that it
      became almost a point of honor throughout the Dominican order to oppose
      the notion as theologically untenable. The Franciscans, however, following
      Duns Scotus, were more inclined to foster the notion, and the Jesuits,
      later on, made it one of their special concerns to do so. If Pope Pius IX
      was right, let alone infallible, it seems regrettable that the learned
      theologians of Christendom should have been left for eighteen hundred
      years with such a marked lack of guidance on the subject that they not
      only erred on it but erred almost in proportion to their stature as the
      leaders of the Church’s intellectual life, the luminaries in the firmament
      of her mind” (p. 9; Beacon Press, Boston; Macmillan & Co., Ltd., London
      and Toronto).
    </p>
    <p>
      The dispute between the Dominicans and the Franciscans became so bitter
      that Pope Sixtus IV eventually took a hand and prohibited further
      discussion, without deciding the question in favor of either side. The
      Council of Trent, though called primarily to deal with the problems
      arising because of the Protestant Reformation, was asked by Pope Pius IV
      to make a pronouncement, but left the matter untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the idea that Mary was sinless continued to gain ground.
      Members of the Jesuit order soon began to propagate the doctrine anew, and
      it was largely through their work that it was decreed by pope Pius IX,
      “the infallible successor of Peter,” in 1854, and was officially ratified
      by the docile Vatican Council of 1870 (which council also ratified the
      decree concerning the infallibility of the pope in matters of faith and
      morals).
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the theologians of the Middle Ages opposed the doctrine because
      they were unable to harmonize it with the universality of original sin.
      Most of them held that if Mary were not a partaker of the sin and apostasy
      of the race, she could not be the point of contact between Deity and
      humanity as was required for the human nature of Christ. Hence in this
      case, even tradition, the usual refuge of the Roman Church in matters of
      doctrine, contradicts this papal dogma.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Mary is now placed on a plane of absolute equality with her adorable
      Son, Jesus Christ, so far as sinlessness is concerned. Like the other
      doctrines of Romanism, this one is said to be based on “the unanimous
      consent of the fathers.” Though the dispute in reality continued for
      centuries and was at times bitter, it is accepted by all Roman Catholics
      today, for the official pronouncement by the pope leaves them no other
      choice. For along with the decree there was issued this condemnation of
      any who dare to disbelieve it:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Therefore, if some shall presume to think in their hearts otherwise than
      we have defined (which God forbid), they shall know and thoroughly
      understand that they are by their own judgment condemned, have made
      shipwreck concerning the faith, and fallen away from the unity of the
      Church; and, moreover, that they, by this very act, subject themselves to
      the penalties ordained by law, if, by word, or writing, or by other
      external means, they dare to signify what they think in their heart.”
    </p>
    <p>
      What a flagrant example of false doctrine and ecclesiastical tyranny! It
      is the very thing that Peter condemned when he forbade “lording it over
      your charges” (Confraternity Version, 1 Peter 5:3). The Council of Trent
      pronounced its anathemas primarily against Protestants who dared to differ
      with its decrees. But the anathemas pronounced by the later councils have
      been directed primarily against their own people, in order to force them
      into line.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should any Roman Catholic embrace that doctrine when the greatest
      teachers in his own church rejected it? Indeed, why should anyone believe
      it if the Bible does not teach it?
    </p>

<div id="Assumption" dropdownName="Assumption of Mary" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>The Assumption of Mary</h2>
    <p>
      The latest addition to the long list of Roman Catholic beliefs
      (“inventions” might be a more accurate term) came on November 1, 1950,
      with the ex cathedra pronouncement by Pope Pius XII from St. Peter’s chair
      that Mary’s body was raised from the grave shortly after she died, that
      her body and soul were reunited, and that she was taken up and enthroned
      as Queen of Heaven. And to this pronouncement there was added the usual
      warning that “anyone who may henceforth doubt or deny this doctrine is
      utterly fallen away from the divine and Catholic faith.” That means that
      it is a mortal sin for any Roman Catholic to refuse to believe this
      doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>According to tradition, Mary’s assumption was on this wise:</p>
    <p>
      “On the third day after Mary’s death, when the apostles gathered around
      her tomb, they found it empty. The sacred body had been carried up to the
      celestial paradise. Jesus Himself came to conduct her hither; the whole
      court of heaven came to welcome with songs of triumph the Mother of the
      divine Lord. What a chorus of exultation! Hark how they cry, ‘Lift up your
      gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, O eternal gates, and the Queen
      of Glory shall enter in.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the type of account that might be expected from a medieval monk
      who was not satisfied with the information given in the Bible concerning
      Mary, and who undertook to describe the events as he imagined they might
      have happened. Here we are told that Mary was not only received into
      heaven, but that she was raised to a preeminence far above that which it
      is possible for any of the saints to attain. Because of her alleged
      cooperation in the passion of her Son, she is assigned a dignity beyond
      even the highest of the archangels. She was crowned Queen of Heaven by the
      eternal Father, and received a throne at her Son’s right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Mary’s body was miraculously preserved from corruption, and her
      resurrection and ascension are made to parallel Christ’s resurrection and
      ascension. And she, like Him, is said to be enthroned in heaven where she
      makes intercession for the millions of people throughout the world who
      seek her assistance. This was a natural consequence of the 1854
      pronouncement of the immaculate conception of Mary—a supernatural entrance
      into life calls for a supernatural exit from life. A mysterious halo of
      holiness falls over her entire being. Whereas the glorification of the
      saints will take place at the end of the world, her glorification has
      already taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The late pope Pius XII was called the “Marian pope” for his work in
      promulgating this doctrine of the assumption of Mary and in declaring her
      Queen of Heaven. By his decree a twelve-month period was set aside for
      this purpose, involving Marian congresses, special services, and
      pilgrimages to Rome (which, of course, brought huge revenues to the
      Vatican, primarily from American pilgrims or tourists), with the avowed
      purpose of turning the eyes of the world more intensively toward
      Mary—which inevitably meant a proportionate turning away from Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a Protestant the most amazing thing about the doctrine of the
      assumption of Mary is that it has no Scripture proof whatever. Not one
      shred of evidence can Roman Catholics find in the Bible about Mary’s
      death, burial, location of her grave, or when or how she ascended to
      liven. And yet this troubles the Roman Church not in the least. Pope Pius
      XII made the pronouncement with the utmost confidence, relying on an
      alleged original “deposit of faith” given to the apostles by Jesus
      Christ—but which, we note, did not come clearly to light until some
      nineteen centuries later. The early church fathers, who were closest to
      those events, knew nothing at all about such an ascension. One marvels
      that such unscriptural, unhistorical, and senseless teachings could be
      embraced by any people and treated as if they were unchallengeable
      Scripture truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that the Roman Church pretends to have from an early date supporting
      this doctrine is an apocalyptic legend, contained in a book. In Gloriam
      Martyrum , written by Gregory of Tours, southern France, in the sixth
      century. On the face of it, it is a mere fairy tale. This book narrates
      how as Mary lay dying with the apostles gathered around her bed, Jesus
      appeared with His angels, committed her soul to the care of Gabriel, and
      her body was taken away in a cloud. As Edward J. Tanis appropriately
      remarks, “There is no more evidence for the truth of this than for the
      ghost stories told by our grandfathers” (What Rome Teaches , p. 26). But
      this curious medieval folklore has now been made an official doctrine of
      the Roman Church, and any member who refuses to accept it is declared by
      papal decree to be “utterly fallen away from the divine and Catholic
      faith.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have a typical example of how Roman Catholic doctrines develop.
      Millions of people are required to believe in the bodily assumption of
      Mary without the church furnishing any Scriptural or historical proof, and
      they do so even without a protest. Not even in the schools of learning is
      there any voice raised to demand proof for such a doctrine. Whether
      Scriptural or unscriptural, historical or unhistorical, scientific or
      unscientific, reasonable or unreasonable, every member of the church is
      under obligation to accept it and believe it. This shows the baneful
      effect of the kindred doctrines that the pope is infallible in his ex
      cathedra statements, and that the average church member is not to try to
      reason out his faith but to accept implicitly whatever the church teaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of the assumption of Mary is merely one of the so-called
      “logical conclusions” that the Roman theologians have drawn to support
      their system. Since Mary was sinless it is illogical, we are told, to
      assume that her body remained in the grave. But the answer is: If Mary was
      sinless, why did she have to die at all? Death is the penalty for sin. And
      where there is no sin there can be no penalty. God would be unjust if He
      punished the innocent. Either Mary was sinless and did not die, or she did
      have sin, she died, and her body remains in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome has so built up the Mary role that it has become an indispensable
      part of the present day church, so much so that if Mary were placed back
      in the position given her in Scripture, it would change the whole
      character of that church. Some have even suggested that the Roman Catholic
      Church should be called the “Marian Church,” because in its life and
      practice it gives first place to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the ex cathedra pronouncements concerning the immaculate
      conception and the bodily assumption of Mary, there remains one major link
      to complete the process to which the Roman Church is committed in regard
      to Mary—that of her co-redeemership with Christ. This doctrine has been
      under discussion for several years. Some prominent churchmen have
      indicated that the next official pronouncement will declare that Mary,
      though technically not divine, is nevertheless associated with the Father,
      Son, and Holy Spirit in matters of salvation, and that she is the
      “Mediatrix of all Graces,” or “Co-redemptrix with Christ.” At the present
      rate we eventually shall have in heaven no longer a Trinity but a Quartet!
      Thus in every age Rome moves forward deliberately in the formulation of
      her doctrines.

<div id="Purpose" dropdownName="Real Purpose" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Rome’s Real Purpose in the Exaltation of Mary</h2>
    <p>
      In the development of this section extensive use has been made of an
      article, The Secret Purpose of Mariolatry , by Dee Smith, published in
      Christian Heritage , December, 1958. In the Roman Church so much of myth
      and legend has been added to Mary’s person that the real Mary has been
      largely forgotten. Although there are but few references to her in the
      Bible, she is there presented as a sublimely courageous character. In no
      other event is her true character brought out so clearly as in her vigil
      at Calvary. When most mothers would have been in a state of collapse, Mary
      persisted through a long and agonizing ordeal which only the most valiant
      spirit could have endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast there is between this noble, heroic woman and the gaudily
      dressed doll that we see in the Roman Catholic Church! Instead of the
      candid and forthright gaze of one conscious of the dignity and
      self-respect of her womanhood, the “Blessed Virgin” shrinks in servility
      with lowered head and lowered eyes, as if ashamed of it. One searches the
      empty face for a single trace of such character as must have graced the
      one chosen to nurture the Christ. The astute observer soon realizes that
      this insipid caricature decked out in superfluous finery has no
      relationship at all to the Mary of Scripture, and is nothing more than a
      sheer fabrication, a fiction promoted with ulterior purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, then, is the purpose of the hierarchy in promoting this particular
      type of mannequin? In what way does she serve their interests?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is obvious that the Blessed Virgin represents a model for Roman
      Catholic women, or to put it more accurately, a strait jacket in which the
      clergy would like to fasten them. She represents the type of woman most
      conducive to sustained clerical control over the minds of the Roman
      masses. Her outstanding qualities are humility, obedience, pliability—
      abject submission to authority. It is this ideal that the Roman Church
      wishes to instill— indeed must instill—in Roman Catholic womanhood if it
      is to retain its hold on the people and maintain the services rendered in
      its many institutional enterprises such as schools and hospitals, which
      for the most part are run with unpaid labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important service rendered by this caricature of the Blessed Mary
      is that of maintaining the control of the Roman clergy over Roman Catholic
      women. For the promotion of the church program it is absolutely essential
      that they remain spineless, mindless, “meek and mild,” as Mary is
      pictured, willing to accept dumbly a half-life in which their role is
      merely to bear and to drudge. In Roman Catholic countries this control
      remains as complete today as ever it was at any age in the past, and in
      countries such as our own any deviation from this norm is due to the good
      fortune of those women in being born in a Protestant country in which
      truly Christian influences make for the general uplift of womankind. The
      hierarchy exacts a service from the women of the church that it cannot
      obtain from the men, yet ironically its contempt for womankind is coupled
      with a full awareness that its whole power system rests upon the Catholic
      woman, and that if she ever raises her bowed head, the worldwide political
      machine will lose its efficiency and collapse irreparably.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Roman Catholic countries, where women can be kept in total ignorance,
      the priests, who are educated and intelligent men, have never hesitated to
      play upon their emotions, to instill fear into their souls, and to
      encourage superstition as that suited their purpose. In enlightened
      countries common knowledge prevents much of that deception, and Roman
      Catholic women to a large extent share with their Protestant sisters the
      blessings of a common culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well known that the Roman Catholic clergy in all countries urge
      their people to produce large families. This serves a double purpose.
      First, it keeps both mothers and fathers so fully occupied, the women in
      caring for the children, and the fathers in making a living, that they
      have little chance to look around and make undesirable comparisons between
      the ethics of their creed and that of the Protestant countries. And,
      secondly, this large family program serves to plug the hole in the dyke
      left by the defection of a large number who leave their church.
    </p>

      As an alternative to her child-bearing services for the glory of Rome, the
      Catholic woman is offered the privilege of becoming a holy drudge within
      the church, namely, a nun in a convent. Here again the Blessed Virgin
      plays a key role, that of recruiting officer. Add to this the masterly
      publicity job that has been done on the Roman Catholic girl from infancy
      to make the nun an object of holy glamour, almost a replica of the Blessed
      Virgin, and it is somewhat surprising to learn that in recent years the
      Roman Church is finding it increasingly difficult to persuade American
      girls to enter convents. It has become so difficult in fact that the Roman
      Church has been obliged to import sisters from Europe to meet the need for
      teachers and nurses.

    <p>In concluding the article previously mentioned, Dee Smith says:</p>
    <p>
      “Presiding over the two functions of Roman Catholic womanhood, the
      child-bearing program and the unpaid labor pool, stands the puppet figure
      of the Blessed Virgin, at once the instigator and the patroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Compared with her services in insuring the cushioned privilege and power
      of the hierarchy by subjugating the Roman Catholic women, the enormous
      wealth brought to Rome’s exchequer by the financial exploitations of
      Mariolatry is merely incidental. Yet it is worth a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “From the sale of ‘holy’ pictures, leaflets, scapulars, candles burned
      before her altars, fees for masses, and so on, the staggering intake at
      commercialized shrines such as St. Anne de Beaupre, Our Lady of Guadalupe,
      and others, a steady stream of gold flows into hierarchical coffers. One
      might almost paraphrase the Roman title, ‘Mother of God,’ to ‘Minter of
      Gold.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “But all this is as nothing beside the Blessed Virgin’s vital and
      indispensable function in maintaining the status quo. Without the
      inspiration of the Blessed Virgin the Roman Catholic woman could not be
      kept at her business of child-bearing and drudging. Without the subjection
      of the Catholic woman, without her submissive acceptance of the yoke of
      Mary caricatured by the Roman Church, the all-powerful, self-indulgent
      ambitious men who constitute the Roman hierarchy would not be able to use
      their power as a weapon against human liberties and human rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without doubt, the devotion to the Blessed Virgin constantly impressed
      upon the Roman population by its clergy is inspired not by piety, but by
      expediency. For the clergy, devotion to Mary is not merely a matter of
      dollars and cents, but of survival. Their sinecure depends on it. That is
      the secret purpose of Mariolatry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      What, then, is the remedy for this situation, this entire problem of
      Mariology and Mariolatry? It is, indeed, very simple. Let the Roman
      Catholic people read the Bible, particularly the New Testament. There they
      will find the living, compassionate, redeeming Christ, with very little
      said about Mary. It is not without reason that the Roman priesthood has
      striven so hard to keep the Bible from the people, and that even now the
      people are strictly forbidden to read any Bible except one that contains
      the approved set of explanatory notes.
