    <h2>The Christian View of Marriage</h2>
    <p>
      The teaching of Scripture concerning marriage can be set forth in the four
      following propositions:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Marriage is a holy and sacred relationship between one man and one
      woman, designed to continue as long as they both live.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Marriage is the normal state for the average adult both from the social
      and the hygienic standpoint.
    </p>
    <p>3. Children are a gift from God.</p>
    <p>
      4. The family (not the individual) is the fundamental unit of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Christian view of marriage sex is set forth as one of the powers
      divinely implanted in human nature. It is, therefore, not to be looked
      upon as something evil, something to be suppressed and put down like a
      plague. The Bible tells us: “God created man in his own image, in the
      image of God created he him; male and female created he them” (Genesis
      1:27). In that same passage we also read: “And God saw everything that he
      had made, and, behold, it was very good” (vs. 31).
    </p>
    <p>
      God, then, is the author of sex. He created mankind with that particular
      power, and when He had done so He pronounced it good. He also made clear
      that the purpose of sex was (1) that the human race might be perpetuated
      and that it might increase upon the earth, and (2) that it might provide a
      special kind of companionship among human beings. Viewed in this light,
      marriage is a gift that not even the angels know, and sex is a high and
      wholesome gift from God to the highest of His earthly creatures. Sex,
      therefore, can become evil only when it is perverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Says one writer: “The attraction which men and women and boys anal girls
      feel for each other is a normal, natural thing. It is part of the nature
      that God has put within us, but it must be governed by the ideals and
      rules that He has given us. The fullness of human relationship is to be
      shared by only one man with one woman and vice versa. It is intended that
      this human partnership shall be on a lifetime basis. It is a union which
      is physical and spiritual, and it is the ultimate in human relationships”
      (B. Hoyt Evans, The Presbyterian Journal , August 5, 1959).
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Christian man and woman marriage properly begins in the church.
      Most Christians realize the importance of religion for marriage, and they
      want to have the ceremony solemnized and blessed by the church. The vows
      taken are religious. The spiritual aspect of marriage and the blessing of
      God upon the new union are the very heart of the matter. For Christians it
      just does not seem right or sufficient to be married before a civil
      official even though such marriage is legal. A mere civil ceremony seems
      cold and lacking in that spiritual aspect which can do so much to enrich
      and ennoble the new union and make it permanent. For non-Christians,
      however, the civil ceremony is both legal and proper.

    <h2>The Roman Doctrine that Marriage is a Sacrament</h2>
    <p>
      Because the supposedly infallible Vulgate mistranslated Ephesians 5:32 to
      read, “This is a great sacrament,” the Roman Church for ages has taught
      that marriage is a sacrament. But the correct translation is: “This is a
      great mystery.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In his broader teaching in Ephesians chapter 5, Paul is speaking of the
      union that exists between Christ and the church, and he points to marriage
      as a symbol of that union. He teaches that as Christ loved the church, and
      gave himself up for it (v. 25), so should husbands love their wives as
      their own bodies (v. 28). He says: “For this cause shall a man leave his
      father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall
      be one flesh”; and then he adds: “This is a great mystery: but I speak
      concerning Christ and the church” (vv. 31-32, King James Version). The
      American Standard Version reads: “This mystery is great,” which is
      substantially the same. Today even Roman Catholic writers acknowledge that
      the old translation was in error. The new Confraternity Version translates
      it correctly: “This is a great mystery”—which is the same as the King
      James Version. But the Church of Rome continues to hold zealously the
      doctrine that was formulated on the erroneous Vulgate translation, namely,
      that marriage is a sacrament. Marriage is now firmly established as one of
      the seven sacraments of the Church of Rome, and evidently cannot be
      relinquished.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vital consequence of the erroneous translation has been that the Roman
      Church has attempted to control everything pertaining to marriage. Since
      marriage was held to be a sacrament, that placed it entirely under the
      control of the church; for only the church can administer a sacrament.
      Civil marriage was declared to be unlawful. And since at the time of the
      Council of Trent the Roman Church did not acknowledge the validity of
      Protestant marriage, the Council simply declared that any marriage not
      performed by a priest was null and void. The 73 article of the Syllabus of
      Errors issued by Pope Pius IX, which even today forms a part of the
      ordination vow of every Roman Catholic priest, says: “Marriage among
      Christians cannot be constituted by any mere civil contract; the marriage
      contract among Christians must always be a sacrament; and the contract is
      null, if the sacrament does not exist.” In another statement Pius IX
      declared that marriage without the Roman sacrament was “low and abominable
      concubinage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Catholic Almanac for 1954 says: "... a Catholic who goes through a
      marriage ceremony before a minister or justice of the peace contracts no
      marriage.” And America’s most distinguished Roman theologian, Monsignor
      Francis J. Connell, for many years Dean of the School of Sacred Theology
      at Catholic University, in Washington, D. C., sets forth the rule that
      Roman Catholics who are married before a Protestant minister must be
      punished even to the graveyard. In answer to the question, “Is it correct
      to tell Catholics that they will be denied Christian burial in the event
      that they attempt marriage before a non-Catholic minister?” he replied:
      “Such a statement can be made correctly, as long as the clause is added,
      ‘unless before death they give signs of repentance’ (Canon 1240, Section
      1). The reason is that by such a sinful act a Catholic becomes a public
      and manifest sinner, and to such a one Christian burial is denied (Canon
      1240, Section 1, Note 6)” (American Ecclesiastical Review , October, 1959,
      p. 266). And The Sign, a Roman Catholic magazine, issue of May, 1958,
      expresses typical Roman Catholic bigotry on this subject when it refers to
      marriage not performed by a priest as merely “attempted” marriage, and
      rates a marriage ceremony performed by a Protestant minister as inferior
      even to that of a civil official. It says: “The attempted marriage of two
      Catholics, or of even one Catholic, before a civil official is invalid. On
      that score, however, excommunication is not incurred, as would be the case
      were the marriage attempted before a non-Catholic religious minister.” A
      practical Commentary on the Code of Canon Law (1925), by S. Woywod, page
      563, carrying the imprimatur of Cardinal Hayes, sets forth this same view,
      as does another book, Catholic Principles of Politics, by Ryan and Boland,
      a widely used text in Roman Catholic colleges and universities. Hence it
      is clear that the Roman Church claims exclusive jurisdiction over the
      marriage contract and the marital state of Christians, and that all civil
      laws that contradict Canon Law are held to be null and void.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> Marriage requirements were liberalized somewhat in 1966 and
      again in 1970. See footnote [#2].
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fact is that Rome’s own teaching is null and void, for Paul does
      not say that marriage is a sacrament, nor is that statement found anywhere
      in the Bible. Marriage was not instituted by Christ, which is a
      requirement for a true sacrament, but instead was instituted in the Garden
      of Eden thousands of years before the time of Christ. Hence Rome’s attempt
      to bring all marriage under her exclusive jurisdiction stands revealed as
      merely another of the methods which she uses in her attempt to nullify an
      important area of civil control and to bring all human relationships under
      her own control. Her clearly revealed purpose is to rule the entire life
      of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that Roman Catholicism holds that marriage is a sacrament does
      not mean that it holds marriage in greater reverence than does
      Protestantism. Protestantism holds that marriage was divinely instituted
      in the Garden of Eden, and so was established by God’s blessing. For a
      Christian, therefore, it is a sacred ordinance that should be performed by
      a minister and blessed by the church.

    <h2>Roman Denial of the Validity of Protestant and Civil Marriage</h2>
    <p>
      During the Middle Ages, when the Roman Church had a monopoly over all
      religious affairs, her control over marriage was effective and ruthless.
      Civil law was conformed to Canon Law, and no form of marriage other than
      that performed by a priest was recognized as valid or legal. Even after
      the Reformation the Roman Church for centuries continued to deny the
      validity of all marriage performed by Protestant ministers or by officials
      of the state. She asserted that all couples not married by a priest were
      living in adultery and that their children were illegitimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few Protestants seem to know that even today the Roman Church still claims
      authority over the marriage of all Christians everywhere, over Protestants
      as well as Roman Catholics, and that it is only since the Ne Temere
      decree, issued by Pope Pius X, April 19, 1908, that the marriage of
      Protestants, performed by Protestant ministers, has been regarded as valid
      by the Roman Church. And even today in several countries where there is a
      concordat between the Vatican and the civil government, as in Spain and
      Colombia, Protestant marriages still are illegal. Civil marriages are
      legal for Protestants, but they have to be approved by judges who usually
      are Roman Catholics and they often are hindered by all kinds of
      impediments. If one party has been baptized into the Roman Church even in
      fancy (as most people in those countries have been), even though he has
      long since left that church, Rome still opposes the marriage and seeks to
      bring it within her own jurisdiction. That, of course, is Roman practice
      everywhere, never to give up to another church one who has been baptized
      in the Roman Church. In the concordat countries the marriage of two Roman
      Catholics, or of a Roman Catholic and a Protestant, or of a Roman Catholic
      and an unbeliever, before a Protestant minister or official of the state
      is strictly forbidden by the Roman Church and is illegal in the state.
      That is a consistent pattern in countries where Rome has the power to
      enforce her will, and that is what we can expect in the United States if
      this ever becomes a Roman Catholic nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ne Temere decree of 1908, while granting that the marriage of
      Protestants by Protestant ministers after that date would be considered
      valid, was not retroactive and did not validate such marriages performed
      before that date. On the other hand it defined more specifically the rule
      of the Roman Church regarding its own members, in that anywhere the
      marriage of two Roman Catholics, or of one Roman Catholic and a
      Protestant, before a Protestant minister or an official of the state was
      pronounced null and void, even though the marriage had occurred years
      earlier and had brought forth several children. Furthermore, the decree of
      1908 was made only as a concession, largely because of pressure brought to
      bear on the hierarchy in the United States and other Protestant coun¬
      tries. Hence the pope may revoke that decree any time he deems expedient
      and declare that no marriage of Christians anywhere is valid without the
      special blessing of his priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the pope’s asserted authority over all Christian marriage, he
      claims the authority to annul any Protestant marriage anywhere and at any
      time. That authority is no idle boast, and is exercised today in some
      cases in which Protestants wish to be free from present mates in order to
      marry Roman Catholics. Though professing to be unalterably opposed to
      divorce, the Roman Church gets around that obstacle quite easily by
      declaring those marriages null and void, that is, never to have existed in
      the first place. She simply grants an “annulment.” Surely it would be hard
      to find bigotry and intolerance in a more exaggerated form than is thus
      displayed officially and continually by the Roman Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a strange inconsistency in the application of the Ne Temere
      decree. Under that decree if two Protestants are married by a Protestant
      minister the marriage is held to be valid. But if two Roman Catholics, or
      a Roman Catholic and a Protestant, are married by the same minister, using
      the same service and taking the same vows, she calls it “attempted
      marriage,” and pronounces it null and void. By all the rules of logic if
      the ceremony is valid in one case it is also valid in the other. Such a
      distinction in Canon Law is merely another evidence of the compromising
      nature of the Roman Church, conceding as much as seems expedient under
      certain circumstances, but enforcing her rule wherever she is able.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Roman Church in Protestant countries today does not interfere
      directly with marriage when only Protestants are concerned is due only to
      the fact that she does not have the power, not because she willingly and
      freely makes that concession. Let it never be doubted that if Rome gains
      the power she will again enforce her claim over all marriage as she did
      before the Reformation. She would like nothing better than to return to
      that period, which even yet she refers to nostalgically as “the age of
      faith.” An example of what Roman Catholic domination in the field of
      marriage can mean, and of the ideal that Rome would like to put into
      effect everywhere, is set forth in the report of the Evangelical
      Confederation of Colombia, dated August 24, 1959. It reads as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Protestant marriage not legal. As the Roman Catholic and the civil
      ceremonies are the only forms of marriage which produce legal effects in
      Colombia, Protestants are first married by a magistrate and then solemnize
      their union with a religious service in their church.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Roman Catholic clergy is jealous of its privileged position in the
      performance of the marriage ceremony. It brands as ‘public concubinage’
      the union produced by civil marriage. It puts pressure on the civil
      authorities to delay and obstruct the civil ceremony, if not to prevent it
      altogether. Against those couples who have the courage and tenacity to
      carry through with the civil ceremony the church hurls its penalty of
      excommunication in an attempt to force the pair, through social ostracism
      and economic pressure, to renounce their sin and return to the Catholic
      Church in repentance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For members of the Roman Catholic Church in Colombia only a church
      ceremony is valid. However, a national law states that if both parties to
      the marriage declare that they have never been members of the Roman
      Catholic Church, or that they have formally separated from it, a civil
      ceremony is valid. But the process is a difficult one. The magistrates
      must notify the priest in whose parish the couple are resident, and then a
      delay of one month is required, during which time the priest has
      opportunity to try to dissuade the parties from their contemplated step.
      At the request of the priest the civil ceremony may be postponed
      indefinitely. Conditions in Spain are similar to those in Colombia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marriage of a Roman Catholic and a Protestant before a Protestant minister
      opens the way for easy divorce on the part of the Roman Catholic. Suppose
      a Roman Catholic man marries a Protestant girl. If marriage proves to be
      satisfactory, well and good; he is content to let stand. But if it does
      not turn out well, he can easily accept the teaching of his church that it
      was not a valid marriage in the first place. He does not see it as the
      solemnly binding union that the Protestant holds it to be. If he finds
      himself forbidden absolution from sin by the priest because of a
      Protestant marriage, he may feel obliged in conscience to separate from
      the Protestant partner. But if the couple wishes to remain together he may
      proceed to obtain from the pope a dispensation or a “revalidation” of the
      marriage. An effort usually will be made to persuade the Protestant to
      submit to a Roman Catholic wedding. But if that fails, a curious thing
      happens. The Roman Catholic party then goes alone to the priest. Lucien
      Vinet describes this process as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “He or she will be married ‘validly’ without the consent or knowledge of
      the Protestant party. This wonderful Roman invention is called, in Latin,
      ‘Revalidatio in radice’ (Cure from the very root). The pope in Rome will
      give his consent to this marriage in union with that of the Roman Catholic
      party, using also the original marriage consent of the Protestant party,
      and this will render valid the marriage of this unfortunate couple. The
      cure has been effected. The ‘Sanatio’ of the pope has validly married the
      two persons without the knowledge of the Protestant party. Now the couple
      can live together and the Roman Catholic party has no more conscientious
      troubles” (I Was a Priest, p. 56).
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently a case arose in Italy in which a man who was not a member of the
      Roman Catholic Church and a woman who was a member were married in a civil
      ceremony. At the direction of the bishop of Brato the local priest read a
      letter to the congregation in which the legality of the marriage was
      denied and the relationship was denounced as “low and abominable
      concubinage.” The case was taken to court by the husband, on the charge of
      slander, and in March, 1958, a verdict was obtained against the bishop and
      the priest. The court was composed of three judges who were Roman
      Catholics. The bishop was fined 40,000 lire ($64) and costs of the six-day
      trial, and was ordered to pay the injured couple $672 damages. The $64
      fine, however, was suspended. The bishop appealed the case and strong
      pressure was brought to bear on the court by the hierarchy from the pope
      down. The pope declared a period of mourning, because a fine had been laid
      on a bishop of the Roman Church by a civil court. That apparently was more
      pressure than the court could stand. The result was that the verdict was
      reversed, the claim for damages was denied, and the couple was ordered to
      pay the court costs. There the case ended, but not without a great deal of
      very unfavorable publicity for the Roman Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, of course, nothing in Scripture that gives to church authorities
      the exclusive right to perform the marriage ceremony. According to
      American law the legal right and privilege of performing marriage
      ceremonies is given to the ministers of all churches who qualify and to
      certain officials of the state. No person or church should attempt to
      usurp that power, or to say that marriages performed by rituals other than
      their own are illegal and that the people who employ them are not married
      but are living in sin. Such procedure is a vicious repudiation of American
      law, and should be punishable as slander in the courts. In New Zealand it
      is a felony punishable in the courts for any church or individual to
      declare or teach that a marriage contracted in accordance with the civil
      law is not a true marriage. Certainly church laws made in a foreign
      country and utterly lacking in Scriptural authority, should not be allowed
      to supersede American laws, resulting in the vilification of the ministers
      of other churches, our court officials, and many of our people whose good
      name is injured by such laws. But Roman Church law, based on Canon 1094,
      does precisely that. In Roman Catholic countries it is a common occurrence
      for the civil laws to be conformed to or based on the Roman Church Canon
      Law. The Roman Church thus claims that she is above all civil authority,
      that to her belongs the authority to legislate on matters pertaining to
      marriage, and that any conflict between the church and the state is to be
      resolved in favor of the church.

  <section>
    <h2>The Pre-Marital Contract</h2>
    <p>
      Since the Roman Church denies the validity of the marriage of a Roman
      Catholic before a Protestant minister, there is strong pressure on Roman
      Catholics, if they wish to remain in good standing with their church, to
      be married only by a priest. When a Protestant consents to marry a Roman
      Catholic before a priest, he finds that he must agree, first, to take a
      series of religious instructions. This course, given by the priest,
      consists of at least six one-hour lessons in which the doctrines of that
      church are favorably presented in the hope that the Protestant will be
      persuaded to become a Roman Catholic. Ten to fifteen such lessons are
      preferred if the Protestant will consent to take them. He is also given
      some books to study which glorify the Roman Church and condemn Protestant
      churches. He soon leams that he must sign away all his religious rights
      and privileges in the home, and that he must make all of the concessions
      while the Roman Catholic party makes none at all. He also leams that the
      Roman Catholic party must secure a dispensation from the bishop (the
      priest cannot grant it) before a mixed marriage can be performed, for
      which dispensation a payment be made (every service in the Roman Church
      seems to have a fee attached to it, and this fee is in addition to the
      regular marriage fee). This payment normally is made by the man. But if
      the man happens to be a Protestant, and particularly if he might be
      expected to resent a request for such a payment, it is made by the future
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>The following contract must be signed by the Protestant:<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>
      “I, the undersigned, not a member of the Catholic Church, wishing to
      contract marriage with ___ ___, a member of the Catholic Church, propose
      to do so with the understanding that the marriage thus contracted is
      indissoluble, except by death. I promise on my word of honor that I will
      not in any way hinder or obstruct the said ___ ___ in the exercise
      of_religion, and that all children of either sex bom of our marriage shall
      be baptized and educated in the Catholic Church, even though the said ___
      ___ should be taken away by death. I further promise that I will marry ___
      only according to the marriage rite of the Catholic Church; that I will
      not either before or after the Catholic ceremony present myself with ___
      ___ for marriage with a civil magistrate or minister of the gospel.”
    </p>
    <p>The following promise is to be signed by the Roman Catholic party:</p>
    <p>
      “I, ___ ___, a Catholic, wishing to marry ___ ___, a non-Catholic, hereby
      promise that, if the Most Reverend Bishop grants me a dispensation, I will
      have all my children baptized and reared in the Catholic Church, sending
      them, if possible to a Catholic school, and will practice my religion
      faithfully, and do all in my power, especially by prayer, good example,
      and frequentation of the Sacraments, to bring about the conversion of my
      consort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>2</sup> Twice in recent years Pope Paul VI has made some concessions
      regarding the marriage ceremony. On March 18, 1966, it was left to the
      bishop to decide whether the pledges from both parties that any children
      born to the union should be baptized and educated in the Roman Catholic
      Church should be oral or in writing. A mixed marriage could be performed
      by the priest in the church, with mass and nuptual blessing. Permission
      was granted for a Protestant minister to have a part in the ceremony and
      to offer words of congratulations and exhortation, but only after the
      priest had conducted the ceremony and had secured the pledges that any
      children would be raised as Roman Catholics, and the Protestant had
      pledged not to interfere with their religious training. Marriage performed
      by a Protestant minister or by a civil ceremony was not recognized as
      lawful, but a Roman Catholic so married was no longer excommunicated. A
      separate ceremony in any other church, either before or after the Roman
      Catholic ceremony, was forbidden as before. Only a minute number of
      Protestant ministers, most of them very liberal minded, consented so to
      cooperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on April 29, 1970, though still upholding the church’s objection to
      mixed marriages, but described by Vatican officials as a “definite step”
      toward other churches for the sake of Christian unity, Pope Paul gave
      permission for bishops to permit mixed marriages to be performed without a
      priest, “if serious difficulties stand in the way.” The Protestant is not
      required to promise that the children will be reared in Roman Catholic
      Church, but the Roman Catholic still must promise the bishop “to do all in
      his power” to have the children so reared. Previously such a dispensation
      could be obtained only from the Vatican.
    </p>
    <p>
      This promise by the Roman Catholic party, containing among other things a
      pledge to work for the conversion of the Protestant party, is not
      necessarily brought to the attention of the Protestant party, but may be
      signed in secret. Resentment has often arisen when it has been discovered,
      sometimes years afterward, that such a pledge was made a part of the
      wedding contract without the knowledge or consent of the Protestant party.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these pledges have been signed the wedding ceremony can be performed
      only by a Roman Catholic priest. It cannot, however, take place in the
      church, but only in the rectory or church vestry. No organ will be played,
      and no singing will take place. The girl, if she is the Roman Catholic
      party, is purposely deprived of the glamour of the ritual and of the
      blessing of her church, which means so much to a Roman Catholic girl. Thus
      in her eyes her marriage is made to fall short of a true wedding. She is
      made painfully aware that it is a defective wedding. And for a Roman
      Catholic man who values his church the wedding is equally marred. By these
      restrictions the official sorrow of the Roman Church is expressed, because
      a Protestant is becoming a proximate cause of the loss of a Roman Catholic
      to the Roman Church—by means of his or her lifelong association with a
      member of another church. Such impediments, promises, and dispensations
      illustrate and emphasize in a very practical way the hierarchy’s
      determination to isolate Roman Catholics from other people so far as
      possible. The Roman Church thus recognizes the evils of a mixed marriage,
      and is as set against it as is any Protestant church. She seems to feel
      that in a mixed marriage she probably will be the loser, that the Roman
      Catholic party if exposed to Protestant influences is more likely to leave
      his or her church than is the Protestant to be won to it. And indeed
      statistics show that such is the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some dioceses, because of the fact that the premarital contract often
      is not carried out, a new method has been adopted—the Milwaukee diocese
      form—which gives the archbishop the authority to enforce all the promises
      made by either or both parties. This form reads:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The parties hereto expressly state that they do hereby give to the Most
      Reverend Archbishop of ______, as the representative of the Roman Catholic
      Chinch or his delegates, or representatives, the right to enforce each and
      every promise herein contained in the event of the violation by either
      party or both, and empower him to give full force and effect to the
      agreement herein contained.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a marriage becomes in fact a three-cornered affair. The two young
      people not only marry each other, but admit into their married life a
      third party, the archbishop, who is given specific legal authority to
      enforce the provisions between them as individuals, or between them and
      the Roman Church. In the event that they do not fulfill the terms of the
      agreement he can, by his own authority, revoke the dispensation, if he
      does nothing more, and, so as far as the Roman Church is concerned,
      dissolve the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even before the present method was thought of, the Roman Church was
      attempting to deal with the situation. Because so many Roman Catholics who
      signed the premarital contract were disregarding it, the Holy Office of
      the Inquisition, in Rome, in 1922, issued a more drastic decree which
      declared that if the conditions were not adhered to, the dispensation must
      be counted “null and void.” Thus if parties to a mixed marriage fail to
      have their children baptized and educated in the Roman religion, their
      marriage is automatically dissolved so far as the Roman Catholic Church is
      concerned. And that has proved to be a powerful weapon for keeping Roman
      Catholics in line, for, since they trust to their church for salvation,
      there is nothing they fear more than condemnation by their church. But
      when marriages of many years standing, which have produced families and
      which the husband and wife want to preserve, are dissolved for such
      frivolous and selfish reasons, how clearly that reveals the hierarchy’s
      lack of appreciation of the true sacredness of marriage! And how clearly
      it reveals the basically unchristian character of that church! We can only
      conclude that such action is another product of a celibate priesthood
      which knows nothing of the pleasures and responsibilities of home and
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well known that many Roman Catholics resent these stringent
      requirements. Some authorities tell us that in the Protestant parts of the
      United States, Canada, Australia, and South Africa, approximately one
      fourth of the Roman Catholics contract Protestant or civil marriages, and
      that in so-called Roman Catholic France, and in Italy, Spain, and
      Portugal, before those countries became fascist, the proportion was even
      higher.

    <h2>The Injustice of the Pre-Marital Contract</h2>
    <p>
      A Protestant who has any respect for his church will not sign such a
      contract. When he is asked to sign he is in effect asked to acknowledge
      that his own church, which be holds to be a true church of Christ, is no
      church at all, but instead a dangerous organization. And he is also asked
      to do a further unreasonable and even sinful thing, namely, to surrender
      his right to any voice in the religious affiliation or the spiritual
      training of his own children. To sign such a pledge is to betray his
      Christian heritage. Such action invariably brings not happiness but
      heartache and tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the duty of a Protestant minister, when any member of his
      congregation is being led into or is contemplating marriage with a Roman
      Catholic, to enlighten him or her concerning the situation that will
      result and to do all within his power to prevent such a marriage. He
      should challenge the right of any Roman Catholic priest to instruct any
      member of his congregation, particularly if he himself is not also present
      at such meetings. If such instruction is given any member of his
      congregation, he should invite personally the Roman Catholic party for a
      series of lessons on the Bible or demand an equal opportunity to give him
      instruction in the Protestant faith. In view of the Roman practice, no
      Roman Catholic should be allowed to marry a Protestant without knowing
      what Protestant life and doctrine is, and this provision should be made
      effective through church discipline against the Protestant member if
      necessary. And beyond that the Protestant minister should see to it that
      the young people of his church are properly instructed, through their
      group meetings or special study classes, concerning the nature and
      practices of Roman Catholicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      How shameful for a Protestant boy or girl to sign a premarital contract
      forever surrendering the religious freedom of his or her children, in
      order to marry someone, no matter how attractive, in the Roman Church! To
      such we say: “The Roman Catholic Church wants your children. It wants them
      more than you want them, for it extracts a pledge from them while you are
      willing to give them up. In signing that contract while yourself refusing
      to join that church you are saying in effect that the Roman Church is not
      good enough for you but that it is good enough for your children.” Let any
      Protestant who contemplates signing that contract realize that it bars
      Protestant parents from their precious children completely and forever in
      that most sacred of all relationships, spiritual guidance. Let him also
      realize that financially it means that in time his family inheritance will
      pass into Roman Catholic hands. This latter, of course, is one of the
      primary aims that the Roman Church has in forcing through such a contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too often when young people fall in love, everything else, including
      church, becomes secondary. Wrapped up in each other, and in a mood to be
      magnanimous and charitable, they are at that time peculiarly susceptible
      to pressure and are in a mood to sign anything. So, at the opportune
      moment, the priest presents his exorbitant demands, mixing love with
      religious proselytizing. Pledges are made that under normal conditions
      would not be made. The marriage ceremony is performed. Then gradually
      disillusionment sets in. The Roman Catholic member is pledged to do
      everything possible to convert the Protestant, but the Protestant is
      forbidden to do anything to convert the Roman Catholic or to have any
      voice in the religious life of the home. This makes for disharmony from
      the beginning. Children arrive, and the Protestant parent awakens to the
      fact that his child is already contracted to the Roman Church. The
      premarital pledge casts its evil shadow, and in many instances leads to
      broken hearts and bitter family relations. Under normal conditions
      children serve to bring parents closer together. But in mixed marriages
      they tend to tear them apart. The threat of ecclesiastical discipline
      makes family unity more difficult. And the Christian religion, which
      should be a means of binding the family more closely together, serves
      instead to tear it apart and to make family unity impossible except on the
      basis of total surrender. The chance for separation, annulment, or divorce
      is greatly increased. And most unfortunate of all, the children become the
      victims of sectarian exploitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the Protestant who enters into such a marriage with a loyal
      Roman Catholic finds that the priest, in the confessional as frequented by
      the other party, deems it his privilege and duty to inquire into the most
      intimate habits and practices of the home and to give advice and commands
      regarding them. It is the priest who will forever stand between those two
      people, and, if that influence is not resisted, it is he who will win the
      battle of minds in that marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the Protestant who is engaged to marry a Roman Catholic make a serious
      attempt to lead him or her to become a true Christian, with sincere faith
      in Christ and in Christ alone as Lord and Savior, to be proved by a
      consistent manner of life over a period of time. If possible, let him
      persuade the Roman Catholic to join a Protestant church. The Protestant
      cannot get fair play in the Roman Church; therefore the Roman Catholic
      should be persuaded if possible to join a Protestant church. Otherwise the
      engagement should be broken off. Such procedure will go far toward
      avoiding the tragedy of a mixed marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any unprejudiced person will readily understand how intolerant and cruel
      is a system which takes advantage of the noblest and most intimate
      affections of two young people in order to force one of them into
      submitting to the authority of a religious system which he cannot accept.
      Protestant churches have never attempted to control and exploit marriage
      so as to increase the membership and wealth of their denominations as the
      Roman Church has. They instinctively expect and practice fair play in such
      matters, while the Roman Church, under threat of eternal damnation,
      demands all of the children and so attempts to rob Protestants of the
      heritage of their faith, their children, and their family fortunes.

<div id="Fraudulent" dropdownName="Fraudulent Contract" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>A Fraudulent Contract</h2>
    <p>
      If a Protestant has had the misfortune to have signed the Roman Catholic
      premarital contract, is he legally and morally bound to keep it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is that in Roman Catholic countries, where civil law is based
      on or conformed to Canon Law and the courts are under the domination of
      the Roman Catholic Church, it can be enforced. Children often are taken
      from one or both parents, allegedly for their own good, when the terms of
      the contract are not complied with, and are given to the Roman Catholic
      parent or placed in Roman Catholic institutions. Homes have been broken up
      by this cruel practice. But in democratic and Protestant countries it
      usually cannot be enforced. In the United States, for instance, the Roman
      Church, sensing that trouble might arise if attempts were made to enforce
      such agreements, has made but little effort toward that end. But the Canon
      Law which is the basis for that practice remains a part of the system,
      ready to be applied if and when Roman influence increases, so that it can
      be made effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the few cases in which court tests have been made, the courts have
      quite consistently held that no agreement as to the religious education of
      children entered into by the father and mother, before or after marriage,
      is binding. The welfare of the child takes precedence in such cases. In
      most such cases the Roman Church has simply been running a bluff when it
      has insisted on enforcement of the contract through the courts. Whenever
      the Protestant parent has had the courage to assert his rights rather than
      surrender his children, the presiding judge almost invariably has ruled in
      favor of religious freedom and has refused to allow his court to be used
      to promote the membership of an ecclesiastical organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, in the United States where the Constitution guarantees
      freedom of religion to every person, it is the privilege of either parent
      to change his or her mind in matters of religion , and to teach his or her
      children those moral and religious truths which at the time seem best. If
      outside pressure is brought to bear upon a person so that he signs away
      his constitutional rights, the transaction is fraudulent and should be
      repudiated. For any church or individual to attempt to freeze a person’s
      religious thinking is a violation of those constitutional rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      But above and beyond the legal aspects of the case, the Roman Catholic
      premarital contract is morally fraudulent, and as such it should be
      repudiated. In the first place it is fraudulent because it compels the
      Protestant husband to abdicate his divinely appointed right to be the head
      of the family in the realm of faith and morals, and it is unchristian for
      the Roman Church to attempt to usurp that right. The Bible says: “The
      husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church”
      (Ephesians 5:23); and again, “But I would have you know, that the head of
      every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man” (1 Corinthians
      11:3). But in signing that pledge the Protestant husband abdicates his
      God-given right to be the head in that most important realm, the
      spiritual, and instead makes his wife the head. And the Protestant girl
      simply should not marry a man who will claim the right to make Roman
      Catholicism the religion of the home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, it is fraudulent because no church has a right to compel parents
      to sign over their children to it for religious training. The Scriptures
      expressly place upon the parents, not the church, the primary
      responsibility for the right training of their children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, it is fraudulent because the Roman Church represents itself as a
      true Christian church, indeed as the only true church, which it most
      certainly is not, as is proved by many events in its past history and by
      the fact that it teaches numerous doctrines which are contrary to the
      Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      And fourthly, it is fraudulent because under threat of excommunication it
      is forced upon young people who want to get married. Yet the Roman Church
      itself, in its system of granting annulments, separations, or divorces,
      acknowledges that coercion invalidates the marriage. And since it so
      readily and pointedly recognizes the illegality of a contract that has
      been entered into through coercion, the premarital contract that is forced
      upon all Protestants who marry Roman Catholics by a priest is equally
      invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it, then, morally wrong to break such a contract? The answer is, No! It
      was a fraudulent contract, obtained under duress, and therefore invalid
      even by Rome’s own standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sooner or later most people who have been foolish enough to sign such a
      contract wake up to the fact that they have done something that is morally
      wrong. What they should do then is to repent of their sin, ask God to
      forgive them, repudiate the contract, and from there on do as the Bible
      and their consciences direct. The primary guilt for such a situation rests
      on the church that has taken advantage of a delicate situation and has
      sown the seeds of matrimonial disharmony by coercing a couple to sign away
      their Christian privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      C. Stanley Lowell, in a splendid article dealing with this subject says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Any moral code makes allowance for actions taken under duress. A trusted
      bank teller would not ordinarily hand over a bag of the bank’s money to a
      stranger. But when the stranger demands the money at gun point, he may do
      that very thing. The bank does not discharge the teller for dereliction of
      duty. It recognizes that the act was done under dire coercion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Roman Catholic ante-nuptial pact is an agreement at gun point. When a
      man and woman are in love they are notoriously unable to think straight.
      More than that, they are under the influence of the most tender and
      powerful emotions. Sign the agreement? Of course they will sign! They will
      sign anything; they’re in love! Such an agreement can hardly be expected
      to stand, however, once reason has reasserted itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When the day of awakening comes, as it always comes for the Protestant or
      Jew who has been coerced, there is only one thing to do. Let the two
      persons involved sit down together and look clear-eyed into a problem that
      is uniquely their own. Let arrogant clerical counsel be disregarded for
      the interference it patently is. Let these two—and no others—think the
      problem through and arrive at their solution. This is a hard thing;
      perhaps it is impossible. But there is one thing more impossible—the
      attempt to stand slavishly upon an agreement that was coercive from the
      first” (pamphlet, Is the Catholic Ante-Nuptial Agreement Binding?).

  <section>
    <h2>Mixed Marriage Difficulties</h2>
    <p>
      A happy home must be built on a firm foundation. Harmony in religious
      belief is a great asset toward that end. Every couple will find that
      marriage presents plenty of problems without adding to them an unnecessary
      and unsolvable religious problem. A mixed marriage is in itself a cause
      for alarm, and all groups, whether Protestant, Roman Catholic, or Jewish
      strongly advise against it. Almost invariably those couples who have been
      so involved will advise against it. That a mixed marriage occasionally
      works out well does not disprove the general rule, and in those cases it
      probably will be found that one or perhaps both parties did not take their
      religion seriously, or that each was willing to go more than halfway in
      giving in to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases mixed marriage means civil war, whether hot or cold. The
      most difficult problems usually come with the arrival of children. The
      Protestant father is reminded that he signed an agreement to allow all of
      his children to be brought up in the Roman Catholic faith. So they are
      baptized in that church. When Sunday comes the mother and children go to
      one church, while he disheartedly makes his way to another. There he sees
      other families, parents and children, worshipping together. But he sits
      alone, and feels more lonely. Church attendance may cease to have any
      pleasure for him, and he may even stop going to church. The children go to
      parochial school where their training is in the hands of the nuns. They
      are taught to kneel before images and crucifixes, to pray to the Virgin
      Mary, and to confess to a priest. They are also taught that all
      non-Catholics, including their own father, have no chance for salvation,
      and in general are given a philosophy of life and a code of ethics that
      outrages his conscience. Disagreement is certain to arise between husband
      and wife regarding the support of the churches. The husband may want to
      support Protestant missions in Latin America, or Japan, or particularly in
      Italy, while the wife probably will want to support Roman Catholic
      churches and convents and schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The home is the most important influence in the life of a child. But
      children are quick to sense it when there is trouble between parents.
      Quite often they are the chief casualties in a religiously mixed home.
      Caught up in the crosscurrents of conflict between father and mother, they
      are more or less forced to take sides. There is scarcely anything in the
      world more painful than that, and they rebel against having to make such a
      choice. Their tendency is to reject both, and to become irreligious. It
      then becomes easier to take the next step, rebellion against civil
      authority and against society itself. Social workers tell us that much
      juvenile delinquency arises because of religious conflict and religious
      indifference in the home. It is significant that the divorce rate in mixed
      marriage families is as high as among non-religious people, while it is
      considerably lower where husband and wife are of the same faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some very interesting and significant facts were brought out recently in
      the Harvard Survey of 60,000 homes, by two prominent sociologists, Dr.
      Carle C. Zimmerman, of Harvard University, and Dr. Lucius F. Cerventes,
      S.J., of St. Louis University. The findings were as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. “Couples with different religious affiliation have fewer children than
      those who marry within their own faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. “Children of interfaith marriages are much less likely to finish high
      school than those whose parents are of the same religious faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. “Six out of every ten children of a Catholic-Protestant marriage end by
      rejecting all religions—Catholic, Protestant, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. “About half of the Catholic men who marry non-Catholics abandon their
      faith. [No doubt this is one of the primary reasons the Roman Catholic
      Church is so opposed to interfaith marriages, and why it seeks to restrict
      them with such stringent rules.]
    </p>
    <p>
      5. “Men and women of all faiths showed a higher divorce rate when they
      married someone of a different religion. In an interfaith marriage by a
      Protestant, the divorce rate was two to three times as great as in an
      all-Protestant marriage. Among Catholics, the increase was three to four
      times. Among Jews, five to six times. Among other religions, two to three
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. “In this survey, Jewish men had the highest percentage of interfaith
      marriages. Twenty-four percent of those studied had married non-Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. “Teenage arrests are much higher in mixed-marriage families. When
      Protestant men married outside their faith in St. Louis, Omaha, and
      Denver, their youngsters suffered twice as many arrests as youngsters in
      single faith homes. In marriages between Catholics and non-Catholics, the
      arrests of teenage children in every city doubled or tripled. The children
      of Jewish husbands and Gentile wives in Boston, St. Louis, Denver, and
      Omaha, had four to ten times as many arrests for juvenile offenses as the
      children of all-Jewish marriages in those cities” (This Week, September
      20, 1959).
    </p>
    <p>
      A report from the United Lutheran Church of America, issued by Dr. E.
      Epping Reinartz, of New York, secretary and statistician for the
      denomination, showed that mixed marriages between members of the United
      Lutheran Church and Roman Catholics totaled 3,343 in 1958, and that two
      thirds of the couples so married went to Lutheran pastors for the
      ceremony. It also showed that four times as many Roman Catholics joined
      the United Lutheran Church as United Lutherans joined the Roman Catholic
      Church and that the United Lutheran Church gained 3,566 in baptized
      members from Roman Catholic congregations while losing 868 members to the
      Roman Catholic Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U. S., in 1959,
      counseled its church members as follows concerning mixed marriages:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Roman Catholic attitude with reference to mixed marriages makes it
      impossible for a wholesome family religious life to exist and continually
      requires the Protestant to surrender or compromise his personal
      convictions. What is even more serious it involves the signing away of the
      spiritual birthright of unborn children by denying them the possibility of
      any religious training in the home other than that prescribed by the Roman
      Catholic Church. It is far better that the parties concerned not marry
      than that these tragic results should follow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A man needs a wife who can stand at his side and support him in all of the
      important things in life, one who attends the same church, hears the same
      sermons, and prays the same prayers. And a woman needs a husband who can
      give her spiritual as well as material support in all of the trials and
      problems of life. But even the standard of authority is different for
      Protestants and Roman Catholics. For Protestants the Bible is the only
      rule of faith and practice, while Roman Catholics believe that the church
      sets forth that rule, that whatever the church teaches must be received
      implicitly, and that what the priest commands should be done. Long ago the
      prophet asked: “Can two walk together, except they be agreed?” (Amos 3:3).

      From every side comes the warning that religiously mixed marriages are
      sources of trouble. Many of these marriages might turn out more happily if
      they were left to themselves. But constantly there rises up between
      husband and wife, and between parents and children, the black-robed priest
      of the church. He comes armed with the anathemas which are so dreaded by
      devout Roman Catholics, and presumes to give instructions concerning
      church obligations, financial affairs, and the rearing of children,
      depending in each instance on how far he considers it expedient to go.
      Such interference makes normal family relationships impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important decision one makes in life is whether or not he will
      accept Christ as Savior. For most people the second most important
      decision is the choice of a life partner. Christian marriage involves not
      only a civil union of two people, but also a spiritual union of two souls.
      Yet how can there be a union of religious ideals when one is governed by
      Protestant principles and the other by Roman Catholic principles?
      Obviously the difference is too great and the antagonisms too strong for
      any such union. A Protestant, therefore, should not allow himself to fall
      in love with a Roman Catholic, but should regard that as forbidden
      territory unless he can win the Roman Catholic to his faith. The time to
      settle the matter of religion is before , not after, marriage. Those who
      carefully and prayerfully study God’s Word and then come to marriage in a
      unity of spiritual understanding are far more likely to find that the
      blessing of God will rest upon their home than are those who attempt to
      disregard this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bible strongly warns against mixed marriages, against marriage with
      one of another religion, or one with no religion. In the Old Testament the
      Jews were strictly forbidden to intermarry with the people around them.
      And in the New Testament Paul says: “Be not unequally yoked with
      unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what
      communion hath light with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let anyone who is contemplating a mixed marriage stop and count the cost
      before he mortgages his own future and sells the birthright of his
      children. What heartache, what bitter remorse, is suffered by those who
      are caught in this dilemma! Many would give almost anything if they could
      undo what they have done—if they could go back and listen to the warnings
      they once spurned. There is no solution for this problem after marriage.
      The only way to solve it is to avoid it in the first place.

    <h2>The Roman Catholic Attitude toward Divorce</h2>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic Church boasts of her strictness regarding divorce, and
      seeks to create the impression that divorces are much less common among
      Roman Catholics than among Protestants. In order to understand her claims
      it is necessary to distinguish between the different classifications which
      she makes of marriage as legitimate , ratum, and consummatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      A marriage between Protestants, or between those who profess no religion,
      performed by a Protestant minister or official of the state, is called
      legitimate. A marriage between Roman Catholics performed by a priest is
      called ratum. And a marriage between those married by a priest is called
      consummatum after they have exercised their marital rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen that for many centuries the Roman Catholic Church held that
      any marriage performed by a Protestant minister or by an official of the
      state was invalid, and that Pope Pius IX, setting forth these principles,
      condemned all marriage not performed by a priest as “low and abominable
      concubinage.” We have also seen that in 1908 the Roman Church reluctantly
      issued the Ne Temere decree through which it would recognize future
      Protestant marriages as valid, but that that decree was not retroactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it be remembered that while the pope has conceded the validity of
      Protestant marriage since the new Canon Law in 1908, he has never given up
      the claim of superior authority over all Christian marriage everywhere. By
      virtue of that power he claims the right to annul any Protestant or civil
      marriage. Since the concession in Canon Law was made only as a concession
      and under pressure, it may be withdrawn at any time that the Roman Church
      feels itself strong enough to enforce its claims, and all Christian
      marriage again be placed in the hands of the priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Roman Church every diocese has its divorce court. It refuses to
      recognize civil divorce of its members in certain instances, and holds
      that marriage of one of its members performed by a Protestant minister or
      civil official is not valid. On the basis of the so-called “Pauline
      privilege” as set forth in 1 Corinthians 7:15, in which a believer is
      declared to be under no further obligation to a deserting unbeliever, the
      Roman Church teaches that a marriage between Protestants, or between
      unbelievers, can be dissolved when one member is converted to Roman
      Catholicism. A marriage between a Roman Catholic and a Protestant, or
      between a Roman Catholic and an unbeliever, performed by a Protestant
      minister or official of the state, comes under this classification. This
      provides an easy “out” when a Roman Catholic wants to be free from a
      non-Roman Catholic in order to marry another Roman Catholic. This device
      is not called a divorce, but an “annulment.” It says that in such cases a
      true marriage never existed in the first place. As such it opens the way
      for the dissolution of a large number of marriages by the simple expedient
      of giving another definition to what we term divorce, and exposes the
      hypocrisy of the claim that the Roman Catholic Church is unalterably
      opposed to divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even a marriage that is ratum (between two Roman Catholics before a
      priest), but which one or both participants claim is not consummation, can
      be dissolved (1) by profession of religious vows in a religious order
      approved by the Roman Church, e.g., entering a convent as a nun, or
      becoming a monk or a priest; or (2) by a dispensation from the pope. There
      is, of course, no Scripture warrant for such exceptions, nothing but
      manmade decrees by the hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Blanshard, in his American Freedom and Catholic Power, discusses
      quite fully the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church concerning
      separation and divorce. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Legal and permanent separation without remarriage is permitted in the
      Catholic system for many reasons. ... The Canon Law permits separation not
      only for adultery and habitual crime but also for simple difference in
      religious conviction ‘if one party joins a non-Catholic sect; or educates
      the offspring as non-Catholics.’ This rule is so sweeping that it is a
      ground for separation if a parent who has been married by a priest sends a
      child to an American public school without the priest’s permission. In
      some cases it is also ground for the complete nullification of a mixed
      marriage. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is almost no type of marriage that cannot be annulled under the
      complex rules of the Catholic marriage courts if a determined spouse is
      willing and able to go to the expense of prolonged litigation, and uses
      sufficient patience and ingenuity in constructing a plausible case.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The annulment process is used eagerly and frequently by American
      Catholics as a kind of Catholic substitute for divorce. Hundreds of
      annulments of valid civil marriages are granted each year by the Catholic
      hierarchy in the United States without reaching public attention. The
      Church’s annulment statistics tell only a fragment of the real story. The
      rest of the story is contained in tables and reports that never reach the
      public. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “Any Catholic who has married a non-Catholic without getting his spouse to
      promise that all their children will be reared as Catholics can easily
      secure an annulment from a local bishop without any judicial formalities
      by proving that his original marriage was not ‘correct in form.’ The Canon
      Law says that such marriages are null and void from the beginning, so the
      priest does not need to submit the case to a tribunal. He delivers a
      one-sheet Decree of Nullity after making sure that the former marriage was
      actually performed in the way described. A modest fee—usually $15—is asked
      for this service. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “When shortcuts to annulment are unavailable, the Church provides a number
      of special elastic interpretations of marriage vows that can be used to
      dissolve marriages. One of these elastic devices is the theory that there
      must be an ‘interior consent’ to a marriage or it is void from the
      beginning. ... The priests have stretched this to include many cases of
      apparent valid marriage in which a married person changes his attitude
      toward his spouse long after marriage, and then announces that he never
      consented to the marriage in the first place. ... Any Catholic can obtain
      an ecclesiastical annulment if he can prove that in entering marriage he
      made it a condition that he would not have children, or that the parties
      agreed that they could get a divorce if the marriage proved to be
      unsuccessful. In such cases the hierarchy holds that the parties to a
      marriage never actually consented to full marriage. They made a mental
      reservation about two essentials of marriage, children and
      indissolubility” (pp. 198-208).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Roman Church, while pretending to be zealous in maintaining the
      marriage bond, makes exceptions on the basis of excuses so flimsy that
      they would not be given serious consideration in a civil court.
      Fortunately in the United States these church decrees do not give legal
      annulments or divorces, since American civil law is superior to Roman
      Catholic Canon Law. But they are effective in countries where church law
      has the force of civil law, either because civil law has been written to
      conform to church law or because it readily approves and supplements
      church law. We have already pointed out that since the Roman Church
      acknowledges coercion as invalidating a marriage, therefore, on the same
      principle the premarital contract which is forced upon a Protestant in a
      mixed marriage, is equally invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. H. Lehmann makes the following comparison between marriage relations in
      Protestant and Roman Catholic countries:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Despite the obvious evils of divorce in modem democratic countries... the
      number of divorces is no greater than the number of unfaithful husbands in
      Catholic authoritarian countries where the church’s prohibition against
      divorce is upheld by the civil law. In such countries there is no check on
      the waywardness of men and no recourse to the law by wives to obtain
      either freedom or support from adulterous husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In Latin Catholic countries especially, the priests have always
      indulgently ignored the traditional custom of married men having one, if
      not many, mistresses, but have always fought relentlessly against divorce,
      by which wives could free themselves from such men. The result is a very
      high rate of illegitimacy in such countries as compared to Protestant
      countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Safeguarding property rights, social status and legitimacy, has always
      been considered of greater importance to the Roman theologians than
      individual morality. This accounts for the extraordinarily high rate of
      illegitimacy in Catholic countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, France
      and all Latin American countries. ... In Latin American countries the rate
      of illegitimacy ranges from 25% to 50%, and the illiteracy is
      correspondingly high. North of the Rio Grande, in Protestant democratic
      countries, even though it includes Catholic Canada, the rate of
      illegitimacy is only 2.4%, and the illiteracy rate only 6%” (Out of the
      Labyrinth , p. 190).
    </p>
    <p>
      Any departure from Scripture invariably works evil in one form or another.
      The first and most detrimental result of the Roman Catholic doctrine that
      not even adultery is a proper ground for dissolution of the marriage bond
      (although annulments are granted for much less serious offenses), is to
      render that crime easier of accomplishment and more frequent. An
      unscrupulous husband or wife knows that his or her partner cannot obtain a
      divorce on the ground of adultery and so feels less restraint. As just
      pointed out in the quotation from Mr. Lehmann, it is notorious that in the
      Latin American countries the men are more lax in their extra-marital
      relations, it being not an uncommon practice and one accepted without
      serious protest for men of wealth and prominence to have a “mistress” in
      addition to a lawful wife. Another result, again particularly prominent in
      Latin America where the priests attempt so much interference in family
      affairs, is the abnormally large number of “common law” unions. And still
      another result is that numerous causes are allowed for permanent
      separation, a thoro et mensa, from bed and board. Certainly it is not the
      mark of a true church for divorce to be disguised under other terms and
      treated so lightly. In actual fact the sacred institution of marriage is
      handled in a quite arbitrary manner in the Roman Church. The whole matter
      of marriage and divorce is in the hands of the hierarchy, which exercises
      the right of setting up or removing impediments at its pleasure, supported
      only by papal decrees. And the inevitable result, far from rendering
      marriage a more sacred institution among Roman Catholics than among
      Protestants, is exactly the opposite.
