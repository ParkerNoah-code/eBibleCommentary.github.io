    <h2>A Fixed Pattern</h2>
    <p>
      The Roman Church has long boasted that she never changes —Semper Idem,
      “Always the Same,” is her motto. We accept that motto at face value, not
      that she has not changed or added to the Christian faith which she
      inherited from the apostolic church, for she certainly has done that; but
      that the Roman Church has now been frozen into a definite pattern from
      which she cannot change and which is basically the same today as it was in
      the days of the Inquisition. What sometimes looks like change is merely a
      policy of caution which she has been forced to adopt because of public
      opinion. She changes her methods, but not her spirit. Her Canon Law has
      not undergone any essential change, nor has her ancient policy of
      suppressing or persecuting those who differ with her. No pope has ever
      declared himself in favor of freedom of religion or issued a decree to
      that effect, nor has the Roman Church ever established a free society
      anywhere. In view of what the Roman Church teaches her children in the
      parochial schools concerning her mission as the only true church, her
      right to suppress all other religions by force if necessary, together with
      her political and economic policies in those lands where she presently is
      in control, why should anyone doubt that a new Inquisition merely awaits
      the supremacy of Roman power when it will again burn and pillage and
      slaughter the “heretics”—all in the name of religion as it did in the
      earlier ages? Her position is that that which opposes her, that which she
      terms “error,” has no rights, and that its mere existence is a crime
      against the Catholic state. If and when the time comes to “make America
      Catholic,” there is no reason to believe that she would hesitate to use
      her traditional methods. There is far too much history behind the Roman
      Catholic Church for us to believe otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hard to believe that Christianity actually has in its record the
      dark chapters of persecution that we read of. But the facts cannot be
      denied. How much better and how much more in the real spirit of
      Christianity it would be if the Roman Church, instead of opposing the
      evangelical faith with the base methods of intolerance, bigotry, and
      persecution, would bend her efforts cooperatively to instruct her people,
      and unbelievers as well, in the basic truths of the Christian faith! But
      no matter how sincerely and Scripturally Protestants preach the Gospel,
      Romanists force them to stop if they have the power to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christian method of promoting the faith is persuasive, kindly, and
      peaceable. It seeks to win people by love and by the power of truth. As
      Dr. Woods has said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Persecution on account of religious belief is both foolish and wicked. It
      is foolish because the use of force never makes an honest man change his
      beliefs. His convictions are really deepened by suffering for conscience
      sake. Only weak men yield to persecution, and are made hypocrites by it;
      they profess to change their faith merely to escape torture. It is wicked
      because it is unjust and cruel. Torture, imprisonment, confiscation of
      property, disgrace and death, not only cause suffering to the individual,
      but also to his innocent family and friends” (Our Priceless Heritage , p.
      181).
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Roman Catholic people, in the United States at least, have no
      animosity toward their Protestant neighbors and no desire to persecute
      them. Most of the people do not know what the traditional policy and
      practice of their church is. And they know practically nothing of the
      2,414 statutes embodied in their Canon Law. Unfortunately they have no
      part in determining policy. Policy is imposed on them and they are
      indoctrinated by the hierarchy as the occasion arises. Since they have
      been taught from childhood that their salvation is dependent on obedience
      to the church, it is extremely difficult for any organized resistance to
      develop within the Roman Church. Some may become indifferent or even leave
      their church when policies which violate their consciences are put into
      effect. But it is a rare thing for Roman Catholics to organize and resist
      their church openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protestantism does not fear competition. It does not need to persecute. It
      believes that true religion is too strong to be shaken by the attacks of
      atheists, doubters, or advocates of rival religions. It asks no special
      aid from the state, either to suppress its rivals or to pay its bills, but
      only to be left free, that it may present its case openly and fairly. That
      there have been instances in which Protestants persecuted Roman Catholics
      is not to be denied. Romanists point to these and attempt to make much of
      them in their own defense. But such persecutions have been comparatively
      few and comparatively mild, and in most instances in retaliation for
      wrongs inflicted by the Roman Church. But most important of all, such
      persecutions have been in violation of basic Protestant principles. No
      Protestant persecutions have even remotely approached those of the
      Inquisition in Spain, the extermination of the Waldensians in Italy, the
      St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre in France, or the recent slaughter in
      Yugoslavia, to mention only a few.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is scarcely anything more destructive of national unity than
      religious intolerance. National unity flourishes in an atmosphere of
      peace, fraternity, and tolerance. This is demonstrated, for instance, in
      the United States when after a national election all differences are put
      aside and the outgoing and incoming administrations cooperate in a
      friendly way for the orderly transfer of the powers of government. In the
      186 years since the founding of this nation we have never had a
      governmental change that was brought about by force. The British, Dutch,
      and Scandinavian governments, too, have been very stable, continuing over
      periods of centuries. But what a contrast these governments present with
      the unstable governments of southern Europe and the Latin American
      countries, where in almost every nation such changes occur repeatedly! At
      the basis of political stability and freedom, and giving permanence to it,
      is religious faith and religious freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unity and prosperity of a country depends upon the freedom and
      diversity with which its religious, economic, educational, and cultural
      life is allowed to develop. The United States, with the most Protestantism
      and the most religious freedom, has the highest standard of living of any
      nation in the world and has brought more of the good things of life to the
      rank and file of its people than has any other nation. At the opposite
      extreme as regards these features is Spain, with the most Roman
      Catholicism, the least religious freedom, and the lowest standard of
      living in Europe. Spain is held together only by a military dictatorship,
      and is really one of the most disunited nations in the world. Even Roman
      Catholicism prospers most and is at its best in Protestant lands. What
      further proof is needed to show the superiority of religious freedom over
      religious bigotry and intolerance?

  <section>
    <h2>The Present Problem</h2>
    <p>
      We have now examined the distinctive features of Roman Catholicism and
      have found that each one of them is false and truly formidable in its
      consequences of leading people astray from the Gospel. These things have
      been shown to be not peripheral but to concern the very heart of the
      Christian message as set forth in the New Testament. To an unbelievable
      extent Rome has apostatized from the faith. While she has been so quick to
      hurl the epithet “heretic” at others, she herself is honeycombed with
      heresies.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this is a strong indictment of the Roman system. But it is no
      stronger than the facts justify. How incredible that a religious system so
      obviously false as judged by the standard of Scripture should attain such
      power, hold that power for centuries, and be so widespread as the Roman
      system is today!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have attempted to show that the Achilles heel of Romanism is the false
      theological basis on which the system rests, and that the strength of
      evangelical Protestantism is its rigid adherence to what the Scriptures
      teach. Protestantism can never defeat Romanism, nor even defend itself
      against Romanism, merely by pointing out the latter’s corrupt political
      alliances, its inordinate greed for money, and its suppression of
      political and religious liberties. All of these things are true and should
      be exposed. But they relate only to external methods and practices.
      Romanism is basically a religious system and must be challenged and forced
      to defend its doctrines on the basis of Scripture. This method, and this
      method alone, can bring victory to the evangelical faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have shown that Romanism, in distinction from other churches, is a dual
      system, a church and a political state. Its appeal to the rank and file of
      its members is religious in nature. On that basis it asks for their
      loyalty and their financial support. But the hierarchy is primarily a
      political organization, constantly trying to exert its power through civil
      agencies at the national, state, and local level. It wants the state to
      support its churches, schools, hospitals, and other institutions. It also
      wants the state to help enforce its religious principles by restricting
      and suppressing all opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time has come to put aside false tolerance and to let the world know
      the facts about Romanism. The public has been duped too long, and it must
      be given the facts that it may know what is true Christianity and what is
      falsely so called. Before the true Christian doctrines of the evangelical
      faith can be accepted, the false and unscriptural doctrines of Romanism
      must be bluntly exposed and its superstitions destroyed. Protestants must
      be made to see the great danger that threatens them. The hierarchy makes
      no secret of the fact that it is out to “make America Catholic.” The
      Knights of Columbus, at the direction of the hierarchy, spend millions of
      dollars for propaganda in newspaper and magazine advertising. The
      hierarchy seeks to gain control, and to a remarkable degree is gaining
      control, by placing its agents in key positions in the government, the
      press, radio, television, movies, education, and labor movements, all over
      the nation. And for the most part Protestants are fast asleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      We must, therefore, be prepared to engage in controversy. We possess a
      priceless heritage in Protestant America, “the American dream,” as some
      here have termed it; the “Golden Land,” as some in other countries call
      it—something God has given us, not something formulated in the minds of
      men. The Scriptures exhort us to “contend earnestly for the faith which
      was once for all delivered unto the saints” (Jude 1:3). We must carry the
      battle to our adversaries. Not one Roman Catholic in a hundred, priest or
      layman, knows the true story of his own church. They are forbidden to read
      the truth. What they are given under the name of “Catholic Truth” is a
      gross perversion of theology, church history, science, and secular
      history. There are millions of Roman Catholics who were bom and raised in
      that church but who find its doctrines of Mariolatry and papal dominance
      repugnant to the Scriptures, to common sense, and to all concepts of
      freedom and democracy. There are millions who haven’t been to mass for
      years and who are quite ready to say that they do not believe the
      doctrines of their church. Many of these can be won to the Gospel. Yet
      they are almost completely ignored, or even shunned, by Protestants.
    </p>
    <p>One who signs himself “A Former Jesuit Trainee,” tells us:</p>
    <p>
      “When Luther rang the tocsin bell, thousands of disillusioned Catholic
      believers of his day rallied to him. They came out of the church by the
      thousands—nuns, priests, monks, lay people. Early Protestantism didn’t
      hesitate to say exactly where, when and how they thought the pope had
      erred in interpreting the Bible. They did not hesitate to condemn the
      Vatican’s amoral politics, and its greed for gold. Thousands of Catholics
      listened and followed the Protestant Reformers. More thousands would have
      had not the church used the power of the state to threaten with death all
      heretics within Italy, Spain and other areas. Only ruthless use of the
      sword saved Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Roman Church in free America ought to be challenged by Protestants to
      defend her dogmas, particularly her bigoted assertion that she alone is
      the true church of Christ. The type of bigotry which is taught in Catholic
      parochial schools should be castigated as a positive subversion of
      America’s heritage of freedom—which it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If the Roman Catholic Church were compelled to engage in debate in the
      free forum of ideas, if her communicants were regularly presented with the
      Protestant side of issues as well as the Catholic, she would soon be on
      the defensive. It cannot hold the minds of its adherents if they are given
      freedom of choice. ... Rome would lose adherents by the millions in free
      America if she had to defend her dogmas” (Christianity Today , October 28,
      1957).
    </p>
    <p>
      Protestantism must meet this challenge if it is to survive. Many
      Protestants have been misled into a form of Modernism or Liberalism which
      stresses a social gospel and tends to ignore the supernatural. Christians
      in all the churches should return to and confess their faith in the basic
      doctrines of the Scriptures, as set forth, for instance, in the Apostles’
      Creed, and reassert their belief in the Bible as the uniquely inspired and
      authoritative Word of God. A skeptical Protestantism can be no match for a
      dogmatic Romanism. We need a return to Bible study, to catechism
      instruction, and to faithful ministers of the Gospel who preach individual
      regeneration by the grace of God through faith in the vicarious,
      substitutionary atonement of Christ, men who will meet an infallible
      church with an infallible Bible, the sacramentarianism of Rome with the
      free and sovereign grace of the Gospel, and the political machinations of
      Rome with an enlightened and aroused Christian church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the large membership which the Roman Catholic Church claims
      in the United States, on the basis of which it seeks to exert and does
      exert an influence in various fields much beyond that which its actual
      numbers justify, Mr. McLoughlin gives some interesting and enlightening
      facts. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Probably the greatest lie of the Roman Catholic press is the elaborate
      annual reporting of Catholic statistics regarding the Church’s growth, as
      represented by the Official Catholic Directory published by P. J. Kennedy
      & Sons of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Arizona Register , May 24, 1957, figures showed 34,536,851 Roman
      Catholics in America. The figure used in 1960 is 40,000,000. This is
      enough to make every Catholic proud of his faith and enough to scare every
      politician in the nation. That is exactly the result the hierarchy wishes
      to achieve by publishing the figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An analysis of how these statistics are compiled will show how unreliable
      they are. In the first place no one is ever dropped from Catholic figures.
      As one priest wrote about me: ‘...there are no ex-Catholics, there are
      merely bad Catholics.’ Furthermore, contrary to the custom of most
      Protestant churches, all baptized babies are considered as part of the
      Catholic populace. [In most Protestant church statistics children under 12
      years of age are not included.]
    </p>
    <p>
      “These accounting procedures are, however, not the important aspect of the
      utter falseness of Catholic statistics and therefore of Catholic political
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The truth is that Catholics in the United States are, in most dioceses,
      not counted at all. The pattern of the compilation of Roman Catholic
      statistics should interest Protestants who are so precise in their
      membership rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are, as such, no membership rolls in Catholic churches. Some
      parishes have a census of sorts, some have lists of regular contributors.
      But practically no Catholic pastor of a large parish in America knows how
      many good, bad or indifferent Catholics live within the geographical
      boundaries of his parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is, in the first place, due to the fact that, when Roman Catholics
      move from one parish to another or from one city to another, there is no
      constituted machinery in Catholicism to keep track of them. There are no
      letters of transfer or ‘demit’ so common in Protestant organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All a Catholic has to do when he moves to a new area is to go to Mass on
      Sunday— anywhere. Nor is it customary in Catholic churches to ask
      newcomers or visitors to rise or to fill out a card that might be used for
      statistical control. Only when there is a baptism, a wedding or a funeral
      to be performed need a Catholic identify himself to any priest. Barring
      these functions, a Catholic might well attend a large Catholic church for
      half a century without the clergy knowing that he is there or who he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The annual publication of the Roman Catholic ‘strength’ in America is for
      several purposes. One is so that the hierarchy of America can scare the
      politicians and businessmen of the nation. Another is so that the Roman
      pastors can impress their bishops and the bishops can impress the Pope.
      The success of all these clerics is based largely on the numerical growth
      of the faithful under their care, not on their fidelity or their devotion
      to the Church” (American Culture and Catholic Schools , pp. 157-158).
    </p>
    <p>
      After saying that in their Memorial Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, each new
      patient is asked if he will permit his clergyman to visit him, and that
      only ten percent of those who give their affiliation as Roman Catholic
      will permit a priest to see them, Mr. McLoughlin adds:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Catholic press might tone down its boasting, if it realized how weak
      is its control over its own people. Our Protestants and politicians might
      take heart enough to be real Americans if they could only realize that the
      Catholic press of America is nothing but ‘sounding brass or a tinkling
      cymbal’ and that Roman Catholic loyalty in America is confined to an
      unthinking minority and its alleged strength is purely a myth. The great
      strength of the Catholic hierarchy rests only in the fear of Protestant
      ministers with their boards and the fear of merchants who shrink from
      losing a Catholic dollar” (p. 161).
    </p>
    <p>In another connection Mr. McLoughlin makes this statement:</p>
    <p>
      “In their wildest untruthful exaggerated claims, Catholics do not
      constitute twenty-five percent of the population. Ten percent would be
      closer to the truth” (p. 235).
    </p>
    <p>
      The fantastic claim of the Roman Church that it has a world membership of
      some 400 to 500 million is arrived at by counting practically en masse the
      populations of the Southern European and Latin American countries while
      actually not more than 15 to 20 percent of the populations of those
      countries are practicing Roman Catholics. About a third of the total
      number claimed are illiterate, and hardly should be counted; and of the
      remainder considerably more than half by Rome’s own definition are in
      mortal sin, not having gone to mass or to confession within the prescribed
      time limits, having eaten meat on Fridays, or attended Protestant church
      services, etc. Many others have simply left the Roman Church without
      formal announcement. In any event, an honest count would reduce the number
      drastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a suggestion to offer which we believe will prove very helpful to
      the Protestant churches if it is followed, namely, that these churches
      should send missionaries and Christian workers of all kinds to Italy and
      to the other Roman Catholic nations of Europe. Italy, the home of the pope
      and the seat of the papacy, is today one of the most forgotten mission
      fields, yet one with very great possibilities. Says one Italian
      evangelical:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The people of Italy live in an unbelievable spiritual ignorance. Most of
      them have never read the Bible; many do not even know that such a book
      exists. Besides this, they live in indescribable superstition as it is
      taught and practiced by the Church of Rome. People worship images, carry
      them on their shoulders, and pay great sums of money for the privilege.
      There are those who make pilgrimages, walking hundreds of miles to special
      shrines. The Virgin Mary is the central object of the teaching of the
      priests and the worship of the people” (Michele Tancredi, booklet, The
      Burden for Italy, p. 3; 1957).
    </p>
    <p>
      For many decades Protestants have been establishing mission centers and
      founding Bible schools among the primitive tribes of Africa, South
      America, and the Orient. How much more reason there is for such work in
      Italy, among people of our own white race who are in such need and with
      whom we have so much more in common! Most of the people in Italy can read
      and write, hence they can read the Word of God for themselves and find the
      truth if it is presented to them. They have a language that is
      comparatively easy to master; and a knowledge of that one language makes
      it possible to reach the entire 50 million of the population, while
      throughout most of the other mission fields each tribe speaks a different
      language or dialect. And throughout most of Italy a favorable disposition
      on the part of the people welcomes evangelical work. Opposition can be
      expected, of course, from the Roman clergy; but when we allow Italian
      priests and nuns to operate freely in the Protestant United States we
      should insist firmly that we have the same freedom in operating there. The
      Roman Church in Italy, despite the great need for Christian and
      educational work in that land, has sent tens of thousands of missionaries,
      priests and nuns to the United States. On the other hand the great mass of
      our missionaries have gone to India, China, Japan, and Africa, to people
      of other races and with languages which are very difficult to master and
      customs so different from ours. Only the merest trickle of our
      missionaries have gone to Italy and to the other Roman Catholic countries
      of Europe, and only a tiny fraction of our money has been invested in
      evangelical work in those countries. The result is that Roman Catholicism
      is conquering the United States while Protestantism is not conquering the
      Roman Catholic countries. Let us redress this situation and, beginning
      with Italy, send a substantial number of missionaries to that country
      which in reality is almost as needy as are the outright pagan nations of
      the Orient.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the church in her worldwide mission, we cannot match Rome’s
      political scheming, her propaganda machines, nor her appeals to prejudice
      and greed and intolerance; but we have something much more effective. We
      have the truth as set forth in the Word of God. And that truth, if fairly
      and sympathetically presented, will break down the walls of prejudice and
      greed and intolerance. We also have a definite superiority in wealth,
      education, ingenuity, and especially in the spiritual intangibles which
      give depth and stability to Christian endeavor. If we can but reach the
      free, inquiring mind and present the truth we can win the world for the
      Christian faith.

    <h2>Is the Roman Catholic Church a True Church?</h2>
    <p>
      The elaborate system of doctrine and ritual that has been developed by the
      Roman Catholic Church apart from or even contrary to the Bible, together
      with her policy of persecution and her failure to raise the spiritual and
      economic standards in countries where she has long been in control, has
      caused many people to ask: Is the Roman Catholic Church a true church?
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Roman Church has within it much of truth is not to be denied. It
      teaches the inspiration of the Scriptures, the deity of Christ, the virgin
      birth, the miracles, the resurrection of the body, a future judgment,
      heaven and hell, and many other Scripture truths. In every instance,
      however, it nullifies these truths to a considerable extent by adding to
      or subtracting from what the Bible teaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the inspiration of the Scriptures, the Roman Church accepts
      the Bible as the Word of God but adds to it a great body of tradition as
      of equal authority although in many instances tradition contradicts the
      Bible and in any event largely supplants it. Tradition is in fact made
      superior to the Bible since it gives the official interpretation of the
      Bible. Whereas evangelical Christianity accepts the Bible as its one and
      only authoritative standard of faith and practice, a standard which
      consistently calls it back to a true norm when it is inclined to go
      astray, the Roman Church gives the Bible only a secondary place and in
      actual practice is governed by a pope who allegedly is infallible in his
      pronouncements concerning faith and morals and by a rigid system of Canon
      Law. Coupled with this is Rome’s traditional policy of withholding the
      Bible from the people; or if under pressure from Protestantism she must

      The Roman Church teaches the deity of Christ. But it places Mary and the
      priest as mediators between Him and the believer, so that there is no way
      of access to Him except through them. He is usually presented either as a
      helpless babe in His mother’s arms or as a dead Christ upon a cross. In
      either case He is effectively removed as a strong, virile, living
      personality, or as a daily companion or Savior who hears and answers
      prayer. He has little to do with the problems of everyday life. All are
      urged to pray to Mary and the saints, who in turn present the prayers to
      Christ or to the Father and intercede for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Church teaches the forgiveness of sin, but only as it is
      confessed to a priest and absolution is received from him. It places a
      human priesthood between the people and God, while the Bible teaches that
      the sacrifice of Christ ended forever the work of the priests, that Christ
      alone is now our High Priest, and that we are to go directly to God in
      prayer. The complete dependence of the Roman Church upon the priesthood as
      the heart of the system, while the New Testament teaches that the
      sacrificing priesthood was abolished and that the universal priesthood of
      believers was established in its place, means that the system is false at
      its very center. Though some liberal churchmen talk of an eventual union
      of the Protestant churches and the Roman Catholic Church, this point
      alone, apart from that of acknowledging the authority of the pope, which
      is the one point that Romanists insist upon above all others, should be
      sufficient to show how impossible any such union is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of the Scripture doctrine of salvation by grace through faith
      alone, the Roman Church substitutes a system of grace plus works, in which
      works have a larger place than faith, and in which one works long and hard
      for his salvation. In actual practice it has become a system of
      absolutism, claiming to admit souls to or exclude them from heaven as they
      meet or fail to meet its demands for confession and penance. Its saving
      truths are covered over with a mass of human inventions and throughout
      most of its ritual and practice they are not savingly presented. It gives
      such false and misleading answers to the crucial questions about the way
      of salvation that the large proportion of those who trust themselves to it
      fail to show by their lives that they have undergone a true spiritual
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Church teaches that Christ established the church, but it places
      a man, the pope, at its head and invests him with absolute power. It
      develops the mass and an elaborate ritualism which had no counterpart in
      the apostolic church, and makes salvation dependent on obedience to the
      church. And since the Vatican is itself a union of church and state, it
      seeks to promote that kind of organization wherever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, the Roman Church teaches a final judgment with rewards and
      punishments. But its promise of rewards in heaven for the righteous is
      largely overshadowed with other teaching concerning a hideous place of
      torment called purgatory, which is of much more immediate concern as
      throughout his life the person tries to alleviate or shorten his
      sufferings there through the purchase of indulgences and by doing works of
      penance. The Bible contains not even the slightest evidence for the
      existence of purgatory, but instead teaches that the redeemed soul goes
      straight to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of the present day Roman Church would seem to be in many
      ways similar to that of Judaism at the time of Christ. There was much
      truth in Judaism and there were many sincere believers among the people.
      But the priesthood was largely indifferent to the needs of the people, as
      were the ruling classes, the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Like the Roman
      priests, the Jewish priests withheld the Word of God from the people, and
      their chief concern was their own advancement. The primary opposition that
      Christ encountered came from the priests, and it was they whom He
      denounced most severely, as it was also they who were primarily
      responsible for having Him put to death. Similarly in the Roman Church the
      priesthood has departed so seriously from the simplicity of the Gospel,
      and the teachings of the Bible have been so thoroughly covered over with
      manmade rituals and canon laws that the features of the apostolic church
      are hardly recognizable. The record shows that in those countries where
      Romanism has been dominant and unopposed for long periods of time it has
      not advanced but instead has become corrupt, and that its tendency has
      been downward with a consequent weakening of those countries. That was
      most clearly shown in the first place during the Middle Ages, from about
      A.D. 500, until the Protestant Reformation, a period of roughly one
      thousand years when darkness covered the land and the people were largely
      helpless under the rule of a corrupt, tyrannical church that was more
      concerned about securing political power and vast wealth for itself than
      it was about promoting the spiritual and moral welfare of the people.
      Those conditions of poverty, ignorance, superstition, and illiteracy have
      continued to some extent even until the present time in Rome-dominated
      Italy, Spain, Portugal, Southern Ireland, and Latin America. Wherever Rome
      rules, the people become enslaved to the priest. Where it is dominant it
      establishes but few schools, and in many places none at all unless spurred
      on to that work by competition from Protestantism. Rather it allows
      ignorance and superstition to continue among the people as a means of
      controlling them, and so promotes an anti-Christian way of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the stinging rebuke to Romanism which it cannot deny or evade—that
      in four centuries of undisputed control in Latin America it has failed
      utterly to raise the spiritual, moral, social, and economic standards of
      the people, and that most of the progress that has been made during the
      past two generations has been the direct or indirect result of evangelical
      missions and of economic aid given to those countries by the Protestant
      United States. At the present time the United States government is engaged
      in a vast aid program to those countries which for the most part simply
      bypasses the Roman Catholic Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that Romanism carries within itself the seeds of its own
      destruction. This has been shown in one European country after another
      where, after gaining complete control, it has proved morally defective and
      has degenerated. Unrestrained by the power of strong civil governments, it
      perpetrated the horrors of the Inquisition in Spain and Italy. The
      excesses of the French Revolution were the end result of along period of
      degeneration, and the hatred of the people was directed as much against
      the Roman Catholic Church as against the oppressive state as hundreds of
      priests were killed and hundreds of churches were burned. At the close of
      the Second World War the Roman Catholic Church in Italy found itself very
      unpopular because it had supported Mussolini’s fascist policies, and today
      one third of the Italians vote Communist. Although present day Spain is
      quiet under dictator Franco, the situation there apparently is not much
      different. We have cited the report of Cardinal Spellman concerning the
      remark of a well informed Spaniard some eight years ago to the effect that
      if police protection in Spain were withdrawn, the life of every priest and
      nun would be in danger. What a tragedy that an organization professing to
      be the church of Christ should be guilty of such flagrant abuse that the
      people would want to kill its clergy and destroy its edifices! What a
      tragedy that the church should be the principal source of strength for a
      clerical-fascist police state! And what a tragedy that in one country
      after another its actions have incited anticlericalism!
    </p>
    <p>
      In most of the Fatin American countries today the Roman Church has lost
      its hold, with the rank and file of the people indifferent toward it and
      the intellectuals openly opposed to it. A few years ago the government of
      Mexico confiscated the vast properties of the Roman Church in that land
      and put serious restrictions on its clergy, particularly on the foreign
      priests who were living in luxury at the expense of the people. Even today
      the government retains ownership of the churches. So strong was the
      resentment of the people that they made it illegal for the priests to
      appear on the streets in clerical garb— many did not want to see a priest
      anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Church thus has such serious inherent defects that over the
      broad course of history it cannot possibly emerge successful. Clearly it
      has lost its power to evangelize the world, and instead has become so
      confirmed in its present course that it cannot be reformed either from
      within or from without. In the main it is as antagonistic and as much an
      obstacle to evangelical Christianity as are the pagan religions.
      Admittedly there have been many high-minded and saintly souls in the Roman
      Church, as on the other hand many in the evangelical churches have not
      been true to their profession. In every church some are better and some
      are worse than their creed. But a church must be judged, not by
      individuals, but as a system.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have pointed out that the early church had no priests. We have also
      pointed out that during the fourth and fifth centuries great masses of
      people pushed into what had then become the official church, in order to
      obtain the benefits that such membership bestowed. The pagan priesthood,
      which was losing the battle in behalf of the old religion, readily sensed
      the trend of affairs and began to scheme as to how it too could share in
      those benefits. The result was that it too began to push into or
      infiltrate the church, at first cautiously, and then more openly and
      boldly. Some of the pagan temples were rededicated as Christian churches.
      This crafty, invading priesthood gathered to itself more and more power
      until it completely displaced the apostolic Christian ministry. It usurped
      the right of the people to direct the affairs of the church and centered
      that power in itself. Naturally it could not tolerate the Christian
      Scriptures, for they contradicted practically everything that it taught.
      Hence it sought to do the only expedient thing possible, which was to keep
      the Bible from the people. Then followed an age-long struggle as the
      people sought access to the Bible while the priesthood used every
      stratagem to keep it from them and finally resorted to the expediency of
      placing it on the Index of Forbidden Books where it remained for
      centuries. But so basic was the Bible to the life of the church, and so
      deeply had it embedded itself in the writings of the early church fathers,
      that it could not be entirely displaced. That struggle continued for more
      than a thousand years, or roughly from the fall of Rome in A.D. 476 until
      the dawn of the Protestant Reformation in 1517, at which time a large part
      of Christendom threw off the yoke of the priesthood and its elaborate
      ritual and returned to the simplicity of the first century apostolic
      church. The Roman Catholic priesthood was, therefore, in its origin
      nothing more nor less than the pagan priesthood of ancient Rome which by
      skillful subterfuge had fastened itself upon the Christian church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor should it be thought strange that an event such as that just described
      should have occurred. In our own twentieth century, with its much richer
      store of theological knowledge and its much wider circulation of the
      Bible, a quite similar event has taken place in several Protestant
      denominations. What we term “Liberalism” or “Modernism” in those churches
      has quite effectively displaced the evangelical Christian faith with a
      non-doctrinal “social gospel” which tends to discard the supernatural and
      which for the historic Christian doctrine of salvation through a crucified
      and risen Redeemer substitutes a naturalistic religion in which man, by
      his own good works, supposedly raises himself to a higher economic and
      social level and so saves himself and builds a better world. When such a
      development takes place it makes little difference whether it is
      accomplished through the work of a usurping priesthood or through the
      promotion of a false philosophy which accomplishes the same result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The admonition in Scripture is: “By their fruits ye shall know them.”
      Surely the fruits of Romanism as they have been manifested throughout
      history and in the various parts of the world are sufficient to disprove
      its arrogant claim that it is “the only true church.” Indeed, when seen at
      its best it is a badly deformed type of Christianity, and when seen as it
      more often manifests itself, in lands where it has long been dominant, it
      is primarily not a church at all but a gigantic business and political
      organization that merely uses religion as a cloak. In those lands it makes
      little effort to hide its greed for power and its avarice for wealth. It
      victimizes first of all its own people and then all others who come under
      its sway. In general it has sought to weaken or destroy free governments.
      Its traditional policy toward other churches and other Christians who do
      not acknowledge its authority has been one of bitter opposition,
      oppression, and, when expedient, persecution, with tens of thousands
      having been put to death for their faith and millions more subjected to
      unspeakable physical torture and mental anguish. Such actions are contrary
      to the teachings of the Bible and they certainly are not the marks of the
      true church. Its interpretation of the Scriptures is so erroneous and its
      practices are so persistently unchristian that over the long period of
      time its influence for good is outweighed by its influence for evil. It
      must, therefore, as a system, be judged to be a false church.
