    <h2>“The Only True Church”</h2>
    <p>
      We have had occasion through the earlier chapters of this book to cite
      numerous cases of Roman Catholic intolerance in practice, and we shall
      have occasion to cite others. In this section we cite examples as set
      forth in the official creeds and authoritative statements of church
      leaders. The most authoritative of all Roman Catholic creedal statements
      is that of the Council of Trent. Concerning the pope it declares: “He hath
      all power on earth. ... All temporal power is his; the dominion,
      jurisdiction and government of the whole earth is his by divine right. All
      rulers of the earth are his subjects and must submit to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The 14 th article of the Creed of Pope Pius IV, which is an abbreviated
      form of the Creed of the Council of Trent, refers to what it terms “this
      true Catholic faith, out of which none can be saved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heretics may be not only excommunicated, but also justly put to death”
      (Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. XIV, p. 768).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Protestantism of every form has not, and never can have, any rights where
      Catholicity is triumphant” (Bronson’s Review).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Non-Catholic methods of worshipping God must be branded counterfeit” (
      Living Our Faith, by Flynn, Loretto, and Simon; a widely used high school
      textbook; p. 247).
    </p>
    <p>
      “In themselves all forms of Protestantism are unjustified. They should not
      exist” (America, January 4, 1941).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baltimore Catechism, after declaring that the four marks by which the
      church can be known are, that it is one, that it is holy, that it is
      Catholic, and that it is apostolic, asks:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In which Church are these marks found?” (Question 133), and it answers:
      “These attributes and marks are found in the Holy Roman Catholic Church
      alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope Boniface VIII made the claim: “We declare it to be altogether
      necessary to salvation that every human creature should be subject to the
      Roman Pontiff.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The late pope Pius XII had the impudence to tell an American audience in a
      radio broadcast that the pope in Rome is “the only one authorized to act
      and teach for God.” In 1953 he declared that, “What is not in accord with
      truth [i.e., Roman Catholicism] has objectively no right of existence,
      propagation, or action.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope John XXIII, the Second, was no sooner inaugurated in November, 1958,
      than in his coronation address he gave expression to the same sentiment.
      Speaking of the “fold” of Jesus Christ, by which is meant the company of
      the saved, he said: “Into this fold of Jesus Christ no one can enter if
      not under the guidance of the Sovereign Pontiff; and men can securely
      reach salvation only when they are united with him, since the Roman
      Pontiff is the Vicar of Christ and represents His person on this earth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already cited arrogant and intolerant statements from the Syllabus
      of Errors of Pope Pius IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following excerpts in a similar vein are taken from the more than 500
      items compiled by Raywood Frazier in his book, Catholic Words and Actions,
      all documented and based on writings approved by the Roman Catholic Church
      or on statements of Roman Catholics in positions of authority:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The true [Roman Catholic] Church can tolerate no strange churches besides
      herself’ (Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. XIV, p. 766).
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Roman Catholic Church... must demand the right of freedom for herself
      alone (Civilta Cattolica, April, 1948; official Jesuit organ; Rome).
    </p>
    <p>
      “The pope has the right to pronounce sentence of deposition against any
      sovereign” (Bronson’s Review, Vol. I, p. 48).
    </p>
    <p>
      “We declare, say, define, and pronounce that every being should be subject
      to the Roman Pontiff’ (Pope Boniface VIII; Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. XV,
      p. 126).
    </p>
    <p>
      “No Catholic may positively and unconditionally approve of the separation
      of church and state” (Msgr. O’Toole, Catholic University of America,
      1939).
    </p>
    <p>
      “The pope is the supreme judge, even of civil laws, and is incapable of
      being under any true obligation to them” (Civilta Cattolica ).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Individual liberty in reality is only a deadly anarchy” (Pope Pius XII;
      April 6, 1951).
    </p>
    <p>
      “All Catholics, therefore, are bound to accept the Syllabus [of Errors, of
      pope Pius IX]” (Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      These claims are precise and clear. The official doctrine of the Roman
      Catholic Church, therefore, is that it alone is the true church, that all
      other churches and religious groups are in error, either heretical or
      pagan, and that such churches and groups have not even the right of
      existence. Without hesitation it consigns them to perdition. Truly
      Romanism, like Diotrephes “loveth to have the preeminence” (3 John 1:9).
      In sharp contrast with that teaching and practice, no Protestant church
      holds that it is the only way of salvation. Protestants hold rather—and
      they find this teaching written clearly in the Bible—that all who accept
      Christ as their personal Savior, all who obey and worship Him as Lord and
      Master, will be saved regardless of what church they belong to. To hold
      that only those who belong to a particular group can be saved, and only
      because they belong to that group, marks that group as merely a sect. For
      a sect, in the strict sense of the term, is a group that cuts itself off
      from the main stream of Christianity, a group which attempts to shut
      itself in as the Lord’s people, while shutting all others out. Such
      practice reveals, in the first place, a narrow-minded attitude, and in the
      second place, an inexcusable ignorance of what the Bible really teaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is from that false premise, that the Roman Church is the only true
      church, that the well-known Roman Catholic intolerance logically springs.
      If Rome is the only true church, then it automatically becomes her duty to
      suppress and destroy all other churches which, not being true churches,
      are, of course, false churches. In order to accomplish that purpose she
      invariably seeks a union of church and state, in order that she may use
      the power of the state to that end. And any government to which the Roman
      Church becomes legally joined, through a concordat or otherwise, is
      inevitably led into that course of action. Throughout the centuries that
      has been the method employed by the Roman Church in her efforts to destroy
      Protestantism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freedom of religion logically involves separation of church and state.
      Such separation precludes the state from making concordats or treaties of
      any kind with the Vatican or any other spiritual power. But Rome does not
      like that limitation nor does she like being treated as an equal among the
      various churches. During the Middle Ages she was mistress of most of
      Europe through her alliances with and control over civil governments; and
      she maintained that position for centuries, suppressing all opposition,
      usually with the help of the civil authorities. Yet she failed utterly to
      Christianize those lands. Instead that unchristian monopoly produced the
      “Dark Ages” when ignorance, superstition, illiteracy, and immorality
      reached their worst state.

    <h2>Roman Catholic Intolerance</h2>
    <p>
      The practice followed by the Roman Catholic Church in the countries where
      it has been in power confirms that it means what it says in the statements
      just quoted. We need only look at the countries of southern Europe and
      Latin America where Rome has had control to see what will happen in the
      United States if she gains control here. In this country where
      Protestantism is dominant Roman Catholics enjoy all the advantages of
      freedom of religion. But in countries where they have control they limit
      or prohibit any religion other than their own. In various countries today
      it is practically impossible for the dissenter to hold public office, or
      to practice his profession, or even to secure employment unless he gives
      some allegiance to the Roman Church. He has to pay taxes to support a
      creed in which he does not believe. If he is a member of the Roman Church
      and leaves it, he is likely to find himself discriminated against at every
      turn. Under such conditions he becomes a second class citizen. True
      religious freedom includes the right to change one’s religion, as well as
      the right to practice it—a right which Roman Catholics themselves insist
      upon as they seek to make converts in Protestant countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apostle Paul said: “If any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is
      none of his” (Romans 8:9). And the Lord Jesus was kind, loving, and
      peaceful, even to sinners. He never persecuted anyone, not even those who
      were in error. But the arrogant Roman Church, with the blood of the
      Inquisition on its hands, unrepentant and defiant, presumes to set itself
      up as the final authority in the realm of faith and morals, and has
      cruelly slaughtered tens of thousands and has persecuted millions of
      others merely because they did not submit to its domination.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to notice the difference between the Roman Catholic and
      the Protestant definition of the term “heresy.” For Protestants it means
      something contrary to what the Bible teaches, while for Roman Catholics it
      means lack of conformity to the practice of the Roman Church—which may be
      something quite different. Roman Catholics, for instance, are forbidden to
      attend “heretical” services, that is, services in any other church. Thus a
      Catholic cannot take part in a Protestant service without committing a
      mortal sin and so offending the hierarchy. And having committed such a sin
      he would be bound to go to a priest, confess his sin, promise not to
      repeat the offense, and receive a penance by way of punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In free Protestant America the Roman Catholics have the right freely to
      preach their beliefs and to promote their church. They receive the full
      privileges of tax exemption for their churches, schools, and other
      properties on precisely the same basis as do Protestants. But they are
      frank to tell us that if ever the tables are turned and they become the
      dominant power things will be different. They will deny us the privilege
      of preaching the Gospel according to what we believe, and they will deny
      tax exemption to our churches. A frank statement of their attitude toward
      other churches—as frank as Marx’s Communist Manifesto against capitalistic
      nations, or Hitler’s Mein Kampf against the German Republic—is found in
      the official Jesuit organ, Civilta Cattolica, published in Rome. This
      journal enjoys high prestige among church scholars, and is known to be
      close to the pope. It is, therefore, one of the most authoritative of all
      Roman Catholic sources. Listen to these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Roman Catholic Church, convinced through its divine prerogatives of
      being the only true church, must demand the right of freedom for herself
      alone, because such a right can only be possessed by truth, never by
      error. As for other religions, the Church will certainly never draw the
      sword, but she will require that by legitimate means they shall not be
      allowed to propagate false doctrine. Consequently, in a state where the
      majority of people are Catholic, the Church will require that legal
      existence be denied to error, and that if religious minorities actually
      exist, they shall have only a de facto existence without opportunity to
      spread their beliefs. ... In some countries Catholics will be obliged to
      ask full religious freedom for all, resigned at being forced to cohabit
      where they alone should rightfully be allowed to live. But in doing this
      the Church does not renounce her thesis which remains the most imperative
      of her laws, but merely adapts herself to de facto conditions which must
      be taken into account in practical affairs... The Church cannot blush for
      her own want of tolerance as she asserts it in principle and applies it in
      practice” (April, 1948).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the “classic” Roman Catholic position in regard to religious
      liberty. It is echoed by numerous other sources. Msgr. Francis J. Connell,
      whom we have referred to as the highest ranking Roman Catholic theologian
      in the United States, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We believe that the rulers of a Catholic country have the right to
      restrict the activity of those who would lead their people away from their
      allegiance to the Catholic Church. ... They possess the right to prevent
      propaganda against the Church. This is merely a logical conclusion from
      the basic Catholic tenet that the Son of God established one religion and
      commanded all men to accept it under pain of eternal damnation” (American
      Ecclesiastical Review, January, 1946).
    </p>
    <p>
      At the college and seminary level a textbook with imprimatur by Archbishop
      (now cardinal) Francis J. Spellman, after saying that the state should
      acknowledge and support the Roman Catholic religion to the exclusion of
      all others, has this to say concerning religious toleration:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does State recognition of the Catholic religion necessarily imply that no
      other religion should be tolerated? Much depends upon circumstances and
      much depends upon what is meant by toleration. Neither unbaptized persons
      nor those bom into a non-Catholic sect should ever be coerced into the
      Catholic Church. This would be fundamentally irrational, for belief
      depends upon the will and the will is not subject to physical compulsion.
      Should such persons be permitted to practice their own form of worship? If
      these are carried out within the family, or in such an inconspicuous
      manner as to be an occasion neither for scandal nor of perversion of the
      faithful, they may properly be tolerated by the State. ... Their
      participation in false worship does not necessarily imply a willful
      affront to the true Church nor a menace to public order or social welfare.
      In a Catholic State which protects and favors the Catholic religion whose
      citizens are in great majority adherents of the true faith, the religious
      performances of an insignificant and ostracized sect will constitute
      neither a scandal nor an occasion of perversion to Catholics. Hence there
      exists no sufficient reason to justify the State in restricting the
      liberty of individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quite distinct from the performance of false religious worship and
      preaching to the members of the erring sect is the propagation of the
      false doctrine among Catholics. This could become a source of injury, a
      positive menace, to the religious welfare of true believers. Against such
      an evil they have a right of protection of the Catholic State. On the one
      hand, this propaganda is harmful to the citizens and contrary to public
      welfare; on the other hand, it is not among the natural rights of the
      propagandists. Rights are merely means to rational ends. Since no rational
      end is promoted by the dissemination of false doctrine, there exists no
      right to indulge in this practice” (p. 317; from Catholic Principles of
      Politics, by John A. Ryan and Francis J. Boland. Copyright 1940, by the
      National Catholic Welfare Conference. Used by permission of the Macmillan
      Company).
    </p>
    <p>
      Professors Ryan and Boland, after noting that at present the Constitution
      of the United States guarantees freedom of religion, make this statement
      (cited previously, re. schools):
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suppose that the constitutional obstacles to proscription of
      non-Catholics have been legitimately removed and they themselves have
      become numerically insignificant: what then would be the proper course of
      action for a Catholic State? Apparently, the latter State could logically
      tolerate only such religious activities as were confined to the members of
      the dissenting group. It could not permit them to carry on general
      propaganda nor accord their organization certain privileges that had
      formerly been extended to all religious corporations, for example,
      exemption from taxation” (p. 320).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the method of dealing with the problem of religious liberty in the
      event that the Roman Catholic Church becomes the dominant power in the
      United States is that of changing the Constitution so that every word
      about religious liberty is wiped out! The writers then ask what protection
      Protestants would have against the Roman Catholic state and go on to say
      that they would have none at all. They say that dissenting churches would
      lose their exemption from taxation, while the Roman Catholic Church would
      retain such exemption. They also say that the Roman Catholic state could
      logically tolerate only such religious activities as were confined to the
      members of the dissenting group—which means that no public meeting of any
      Protestant church would be allowed. The only meetings tolerated would be
      those of the members held in private. Under such an arrangement the church
      would die of strangulation. Ryan’s and Boland’s assurance that they are
      talking about an idealized Roman Catholic state which presumably is some
      considerable distance in the future, and that Protestants therefore need
      not worry for a long time to come, is completely worthless, and even
      frivolous. Actually what they are saying is that Protestants need not
      worry until it is too late to worry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryan’s and Boland’s comment, of course, is not merely a personal one, but
      one that is in harmony with the general tenor of Roman Catholic thinking.
      We might point out in behalf of Protestantism that during the economic
      emergency that has existed in so many countries following the Second World
      War, this nation has distributed much food and other supplies freely among
      needy nations without discriminating against religious beliefs, and that
      in numerous instances Roman Catholic relief agencies in those countries
      have distributed those supplies as if they were gifts from the Roman
      Catholics of the United States. No such acts of friendship and generosity
      were ever extended by a Roman Catholic nation to a Protestant nation in
      the entire course of world history, and we can be sure that they never
      will be. But how utterly devoid of any sense of gratitude and fair play
      Romanism is toward Protestantism! What Ryan and Boland threaten is indeed
      the kind of treatment that we can expect from the Roman Church after
      having nurtured it in our free land—if and when it becomes dominant.
      Protestants at least have had fair warning, for these things have not been
      plotted in secret, but published openly and taught in the schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome still follows the policy set forth by the French Roman Catholic
      writer, Louis Veuillot, who said to a group of Protestants:
    </p>
    <p>
      “When you are in a majority we ask for religious liberty in the name of
      your principles. When we are in a majority we refuse it to you in the name
      of ours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in this regard a close parallel between the Roman Catholic demand
      for full religious freedom in the United States so that they can build
      their church and lay the groundwork for the destruction of religious
      liberty, and that of the Communists as they claim the protection of our
      Constitution and demand full civil liberties while building a system which
      if successful will destroy ours. This land still is predominantly
      Protestant and free. But if we are indifferent we can lose all of our
      freedoms, either to a totalitarian church or a totalitarian state.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that today Rome is seeking by every means at her disposal to “Make
      America Catholic”—that is her motto—and thus to eliminate the world’s
      stronghold of Protestantism. But for many centuries the Roman Church had a
      monopoly in Europe, and the results were deplorable. In the countries that
      she controls she continues to fail to raise either the religious or the
      social standards of the people. Almost invariably monopoly is bad, whether
      in religion, business, manufacturing, labor unions, or government. And an
      ecclesiastical monopoly is worst of all. There is too much greed in the
      human heart and too much pride in the human mind, for any such system to
      work, whether in the church or in the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Protestant countries the Roman Church hides her true character. When
      confronted by an alert and watchful Protestantism she becomes reasonably
      tolerant. She establishes schools, hospitals, orphanages, and at times
      even holds out a fraternal hand to those of differing views. In many an
      American town or village the Roman Church seems much like any Protestant
      church. The priest is friendly, as also are the people, and there is
      little outward difference between them and their Protestant neighbors. The
      Roman Catholic people in such communities are for the most part perfectly
      sincere, sharing in general the American ideals of freedom and liberty.
      Occasionally a local priest, or even a leader of prominence, makes a
      high-minded pronouncement on the subject of religious liberty—as even
      Cardinal Spellman has done on occasions. Many Protestants have been
      deceived by such semblances of charity. But as the Roman Church gains
      strength the priests invariably indoctrinate their people with a more
      aggressive attitude, and they begin to place restrictions on Protestantism
      and to outlaw it as far as possible. Those who want to know what Roman
      Catholicism really is should look at the clerical system that it has
      developed in those countries where it has control, not at the restrained,
      half-Protestant and comparatively mild form that is found in many American
      communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      American Roman Catholics, like their fellow church members in all other
      parts of the world, belong to a completely totalitarian church. Policy in
      their church is not made at the local level or national level, but at the
      top, in Rome. The people are not consulted; they are told. We had that
      brought to our attention quite forcibly in the 1960 election when the
      Roman Catholic people of Puerto Rico were threatened with excommunication
      if they did not follow the political advice of the hierarchy. When in
      deference to popular opinion American priests and bishops sometimes
      express themselves as favoring religious freedom and toleration, they do
      not speak for anyone—not even for themselves. They are allowed to proceed
      on a certain course as long as that seems expedient; but when the
      appropriate time comes, Rome issues an official policy statement and that
      settles the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Roman Church manifests a degree of good will and tolerance in
      the United States, her real nature is revealed in the cruelties and
      intolerance that she practices on those of other faiths in countries where
      she is dominant—at the present time most clearly seen in Spain and
      Colombia. The pope could stop the persecutions and abuses in those lands
      at once if he wanted to do so. Let it be remembered by all Americans that
      no matter how friendly individual Roman Catholics are now, once their
      church gains control even the laymen will have to change their attitude.
      They will not be permitted to mingle freely with Protestants and be
      cooperative and friendly. This deceptive pose, not primarily on the part
      of the people but on the part of the hierarchy, is what makes that church
      so dangerous. Such diverse behavior is based not on the teaching of
      Scripture nor on principle, but on expediency and Canon Law. It should
      arouse only disgust and resentment on the part of all informed people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The famous British historian, James Anthony Froude, analyzed the character
      of Romanism well when he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where it has been in power, the Church of Rome has shown its real colors.
      ... In Protestant countries where it is in opposition, it wears the
      similitude of an angel. It is energetic and devoted; it avoids scandal; it
      appeals for toleration, and, therefore, pretends to be tolerant. Elsewhere
      it has killed the very spirit of religion, and those who break from it
      believe nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Most American Roman Catholic writers seek to point to some sources of
      religious freedom within Roman Catholicism. Almost invariably they mention
      the Religious Toleration Act of Maryland as an event contributing to the
      establishment of religious freedom in America. They are fond of pointing
      out that Maryland was established with a Roman Catholic majority and that
      its legislature passed the act just mentioned. But the passage of that act
      becomes rather amusing when we remember that Roman Catholicism in Maryland
      was at that time only a small island in a sea of Protestantism, and that
      most of the colonists having come to America to escape religious
      persecution in the various European countries were strongly opposed to any
      church controlled state. It is, after all, standard Roman procedure to
      speak up for religious toleration when they are in the minority, and to
      deny it when they are in the majority. Furthermore, the Maryland colony,
      which was founded in 1634 under Roman Catholic sponsorship, soon lost that
      distinction; for after 1691 the Protestants were in the majority. At the
      time of the American Revolution the Roman Catholics numbered only about
      one percent of the population of the thirteen colonies. No Huguenot was
      allowed to land in Quebec during the colonial period.
    </p>
    <p>
      A further consequence of Roman Catholic intolerance in the European
      countries was that it alienated the Jews and turned them strongly against
      Christianity. Nearly all evangelistic work among the Jews has been done by
      Protestants. Rome has avoided the really hard mission work of the world,
      that among the Mohammedans and among the Jews. For 1,200 years the Roman
      Church persecuted the Jews, so that they came to look upon Christians as
      their natural enemies. On different occasions the Jews were forced to flee
      from Rome, and one of the most cruel persecutions came in Spain at the
      time of the Inquisition. In some countries they had to live in ghettos,
      and sometimes had to wear hated yellow identification badges. Many
      occupations were closed to them. Often they were denied education. Because
      the Roman Church was for so long dominant in Europe, the average Jew
      doesn’t differentiate between the different branches of Christianity. To
      him even yet Romanism is Christianity, and he therefore is quite sure that
      Christianity is anti-Semitic. Because of that past record the cause of
      Jewish evangelism suffers a historic handicap. The persecutions are not
      easily forgotten.

    <h2>Freedom of Conscience</h2>
    <p>The First Amendment to the Constitution reads:</p>
    <p>
      “Congress shall make no laws respecting the establishment of religion, or
      prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
      or of the press; or the right of the people peacefully to assemble.”
    </p>
    <p>
      What a sharp contrast there is between these sentiments and the
      categorical statement of Pope Leo XIII (1903) in Libertas that “It is not
      lawful to demand, to defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought,
      or speech, or writing, or religion, as if these were so many rights given
      by nature to man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Persecution of those who conscientiously differ with us is so out of
      harmony with Protestant ideal that we can scarcely realize the vigor with
      which that practice, together with that of excommunication and the
      interdict was carried out by the Roman Church in former ages. Yet so bowed
      down were the people and nations during the Middle Ages that usually
      little more than the mere threat of such action was required for the
      church to secure whatever obedience or property it wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freedom of religion, as we have indicated earlier, must include the right
      to change one’s religion. The United Nations Charter of Human Rights has
      quite properly insisted upon this, even in the face of strong opposition
      from Romanist countries. The right of private judgment is one of the most
      precious benefits that we have received from the Protestant Reformation.
      Even in Protestant states which have established churches, as in Sweden
      for instance, where all the people are supposed to belong to the Lutheran
      Church, anyone who wants to withdraw can do so merely by stating his
      desire to that effect. That is the sensible course to follow, for
      certainly the person knows his own mind better than does anyone else. No
      priest or governmental official should attempt to make that decision for
      him. And yet it is almost impossible anywhere to secure a release from the
      Roman Catholic Church. Even after one announces that he has changed his
      views and asks for a dismissal the Roman Church still attempts to hold
      him, to persuade him, perhaps even over a period of years, and her policy
      is never to give up one who has been baptized into that church. We do not
      see the principles of democracy and freedom in that church, but rather
      those of totalitarianism and dictatorship.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most flagrant denials of freedom in the Roman Church is the
      Index of Forbidden Books,<sup>1</sup> a device which deprives the people
      of freedom of judgment as to what they may read. This restriction is
      imposed on the pretense of shielding them from error; its real purpose is
      to isolate them from liberal and Protestant ideas, to maintain control
      over them, and so to hold them in the Roman Church. Even the Bible was put
      on the Index by the Council of Valencia, in 1229, and was not removed
      until centuries later. And to the present day all versions of the Bible
      except those which contain the official Roman Catholic explanatory notes
      still are on the Index. It is for this reason that in Roman Catholic
      countries the priests seek to confiscate and destroy all copies of the
      Bible put out by the Protestant churches or by the Bible societies. All
      editions of the Bible, all portions of it, and all Biblical commentaries
      in any language that do not show the imprimatur or nihil obstcit of some
      Roman official are forbidden. A long list of books and other publications
      are blacklisted, not always because they are anti-Christian, but because
      they are or are suspected of being anti-Romanist. The laws of the Index
      are binding on the priests as well as on the people. Only the bishops,
      cardinals, and others whose rank is not below that of bishop are free from
      the Index.
    </p>
    <p><sup>1</sup> See footnote [#1], [chapter 4].</p>
    <p>
      The intolerance of the Roman Catholic Church even toward its own people is
      perhaps seen most clearly in this restriction which forbids them to read
      anything that others write about its history or doctrines. And well do
      they keep their people in the dark concerning its history; for most of the
      people, if they knew its real history, probably would leave it
      immediately. This one church alone in the civilized world follows such an
      obscurantist rule and tells its people that they commit mortal sin if they
      so much as read what others say about them. A Roman Catholic young man who
      reads a criticism of his church, or who attends a lecture criticizing his
      church will be rebuked more severely by the priest than if he commits a
      sexual irregularity or some other crime against society. The reasoning is
      that the latter may be repaired, but the former leads to irreparable loss
      of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      This attitude on the part of the hierarchy and priesthood shows a glaring
      lack of scholarship and of confidence in their own doctrinal position.
      Although they claim to have the truth, and even to be the only true
      church, they do not dare risk a comparison of that “truth” with the
      supposed error which they oppose. They choose rather to keep their people
      in as complete ignorance as possible concerning all other systems. But
      that is the position of the special pleader. True scholars who are sure of
      their own position do not hesitate to state the position of an opponent,
      and then to expose its errors if such there are. Even in dealing with
      Communism and atheism we want to know what they hold, then we proceed to
      show their falsity. Protestants do not hesitate to acquaint their people
      with the Roman Catholic system, and then to point out its errors. In fact
      it is Protestant practice to study and discuss all of the other religions.
      Failure on the part of the Romanists to do the same reveals a conscious
      weakness, a reluctance to join the battle in a fair and open way and face
      logical conclusions. We challenge the Roman hierarchy to let its priests
      and its people investigate Protestantism fairly and openly or to give up
      the claim that it alone has the truth. It has often been said that a
      person who does not know both sides of a question really does not know
      either side. Not until he knows what his own doctrinal system sets forth,
      and what can be said against it, does he know what he believes and why.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader may wonder how it is possible in countries such as the United
      States, England, Holland, etc., for the Roman Church to fence its people
      away from the learning of modern times. If the facts of papal history and
      of European and American history are as we have represented them, it may
      be thought incredible that any church could maintain in its schools and in
      its churches a version radically at variance with those facts. The
      explanation however, is just this, that the Roman Catholic is restricted
      to the literature of his own church. Every book he reads must have been
      passed by the censor. He has been taught from childhood that the reading
      of forbidden books is a grave sin, a sin against faith and morals. The
      Index has indeed proved to be an effective weapon for keeping both the
      clergy and the laity in obedient submission. It keeps them from thinking,
      and therefore from rebelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devout, sincere Roman Catholic, priest or layman, finds it very
      difficult to change his religion. The church, of course, has planned it
      that way. Even though he may have doubts concerning some things, he finds
      it hard to make an investigation. He must not even carry on a conversation
      with a Protestant about religious matters unless his priest is also
      present. Even among the priests many would not dare to read a heretical
      book, or carry on such a conversation without permission from a bishop.
      Some, however, whose duty it is to defend their religion against attacks
      do find it necessary to investigate evangelical Christianity. And not
      infrequently one of them is won by the sublimity and simplicity of its
      teaching. But in the main the Roman Church withholds from its priests and
      people that broader knowledge and outlook on the world which makes for a
      well-rounded personality. Incidentally the minister of the Methodist
      church in Rome, Rev. Reginald Kissack, reports that some Roman Catholic
      priests in Italy are unsettled and are making tentative inquiries about
      Protestantism and that nearly always the question, “What started your
      unrest?” gets the answer, “I started to read the Gospels.”

    <h2>Bigotry</h2>
    <p>
      The dictionary defines a “bigot” as “one obstinately or intolerantly
      devoted to his own church, party, belief or opinion.” And the adjective
      “bigoted” is defined as, “so obstinately attached to some creed, opinion,
      or practice as to be illiberal or intolerant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange thing happened in the United States during the 1960 political
      campaign, in which the candidates for president were a Roman Catholic,
      John F. Kennedy, and a Protestant, Richard M. Nixon. In this land that had
      been comparatively free from religious prejudice in past elections the
      Roman Catholics attempted and, because there was no organized or effective
      Protestant reply, succeeded to a surprising extent in muzzling free men by
      the cunning use of the word “bigot.” A widespread campaign was launched to
      popularize the idea that anyone who for whatever reason voted against
      their candidate was a “bigot,” and the term was freely used over the radio
      and television, in the newspapers, and in political discussion. Along with
      this they sought to label as a “hate monger” and as “hate literature” any
      person or any literature that even so much as mentioned the Roman Catholic
      Church in connection with the political campaign. This was their strategy
      in the Protestant United States, although in all Roman Catholic countries
      the religious issue immediately becomes a prominent feature in any
      campaign if a Protestant is involved—if indeed they do not forbid by
      constitutional requirement any Protestant from even being nominated for
      the position of head of state, as is the case in Spain, Colombia,
      Argentina, and Paraguay. In various other countries where Romanism is
      strong, practical considerations make it next to impossible for a
      Protestant to become head of the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in that campaign Mr. Nixon announced that he would not discuss
      religion, nor would he allow his workers to bring the religious issue into
      the campaign. Mr. Kennedy, too, gave lip service to that principle; but on
      repeated occasions he “defended” his right to belong to the Roman Catholic
      Church, a point which of course was not lost on his fellow Roman
      Catholics. Also, his national party campaign committee made extensive and
      effective use of a television film and recording that was made during an
      appearance which he made before a group of Protestant ministers in
      Houston, Texas, which film had been edited to present him and his religion
      in a very favorable light. Whether it was wise to attempt to keep religion
      out of the campaign is open to question. Personally we think it was not,
      for two reasons: first, a man’s religion does affect his actions,
      particularly his conduct of an office such as the presidency; and,
      secondly, from a practical standpoint it clearly was impossible to
      suppress such an important factor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the facts became known it was shown that the charge of bigotry that
      had been brought against Protestants was for the most part groundless. The
      Gallup Poll, which after repeated surveys forecast the closeness of the
      election with remarkable accuracy, showed that the proportion of Roman
      Catholic Republicans who switched their votes to Kennedy was approximately
      twice that of the Protestant Democrats who switched to Nixon. The veteran
      political commentator, David Lawrence, observed that, “It is obvious that
      something has happened to stir up the Catholic voters and cause a big
      number apparently to disregard all other considerations and support the
      Democratic nominee, who happens to be of their faith” (The Kansas City
      Times , November 2, 1960). These same sources indicated that the Roman
      Catholic vote went about 80 percent, or approximately four to one, for
      Kennedy, while the Protestant vote went about 60 percent, or approximately
      three to two, for Nixon. An impartial post-election analysis by the Survey
      Research Center of the University of Michigan, as published in U. S. News
      and World Report , May 1, 1961, reached substantially the same conclusion.
      Hence the evidence is that Roman Catholics showed themselves twice as
      “bigoted” in voting their religion as did Protestants. And certainly it is
      just as much an act of bigotry to vote for a man because of his religion
      as it is to vote against him because of his religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is it bigotry to oppose the election of a Roman Catholic for president
      of the United States, or for other positions of influence? The basic
      doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church as they affect political and social
      life are diametrically opposed to our American ideas of freedom and
      democracy. The Roman Church has repeatedly condemned the separation of
      church and state, which is one of the basic principles of our American way
      of life; and it attempts to regulate even in detail the lives of its
      members. Roman Catholic officials are inevitably subjected to pressures
      from their church which could not be brought against other men. Believing
      that theirs is the only true church, that their eternal welfare is
      dependent on obedience to their church, and that it is their duty to
      promote their church so far as practicable, loyal Roman Catholic office
      holders are subject to what are sometimes unbearable pressures in the
      confessional and from the hierarchy at large. We submit that because of
      these obligations which rest in a peculiar way upon all members of that
      church it is unwise to entrust high office to any member of that church
      unless he gives convincing evidence that he will not allow his church to
      influence his conduct—assurance which a “good” Roman Catholic cannot give,
      and which a “poor” Roman Catholic should not need to give, for the simple
      reason that if he does not accept those principles he should not be in
      that church.
    </p>
    <p>
      But further as regards the charge of bigotry as directed by the Roman
      Church against all who oppose it: In its announced goal to “make America
      Catholic,” the Roman Catholic Church proposes to force its doctrines and
      practices upon our nation regardless of their truth or falsity and
      regardless of the desires of the majority of our people. This it plans to
      do by silencing everyone who disagrees with it. And how does it propose to
      do that? One important item in that plan is to label everyone who opposes
      it a “bigot.” A former Roman Catholic who studied for the priesthood in a
      Jesuit seminary, and who knows that church well, wrote in 1957 (three
      years before the 1960 political campaign got under way):
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Roman Catholic Church, whatever may be its other faults, is never
      lacking in shrewdness or in good strategists. ... The Jesuits have urged
      the Catholic Church in America to label every criticism of the Roman
      Church as ‘bigotry’” (Christianity Today, issue of October 28).
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the facts of history are examined Protestants stand forth clearly
      not as “bigots,” but as the real champions of religious and political
      liberty, while on the other hand Roman Catholicism has maintained a
      religious despotism wherever it has been in power, even to the extent of
      putting to death those who disagree with it. The facts are so clear that
      they cannot be denied. And yet the recent propaganda campaign was
      conducted so skillfully and persistently that the Roman Church actually
      came to be looked upon by many as the victim of bigotry and intolerance.
      When the facts are presented, the Roman Church itself stands forth as the
      biggest bigot of all time. In proof of that statement we submit the
      following. It is bigotry.
    </p>
    <p>To claim to be the only true church.</p>
    <p>To teach that all outside the Roman Church are lost.</p>
    <p>
      For the pope to claim infallibility, or that he is the very mouthpiece of
      God on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the pope to claim for himself the title “Holy Father”—a claim which is
      simply blasphemous.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Roman Church in its official pronouncements, such as those of the
      Council of Trent, to pronounce anathemas upon all who dare to differ with
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Roman Church to persecute or kill those who dare to differ with
      it, as it has done on so many occasions in the past.
    </p>
    <p>For the Roman Church to refer to Protestants as “heretics.”</p>
    <p>
      For the Roman Church to teach its people that it is a mortal sin to attend
      a Protestant church.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Roman Church to restrict and persecute Protestants in Spain,
      Portugal, Italy, and various Latin American countries while it is accorded
      full freedom of religion in Protestant countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Roman Church to teach its people that it is a mortal sin to read
      any Bible other than their own annotated one.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Roman Church to force its premarital agreement upon Protestants
      who wish to marry Roman Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Roman Church to teach that the marriage of a Roman Catholic and a
      Protestant before a Protestant minister or an official of the state is
      null and void, that such is only “attempted marriage,” that the parties
      thereafter are living in sin, and that their children are illegitimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Roman Church to teach its people to “detest” other churches and
      groups, as in the pledge which converts to Romanism take as a part of the
      induction ceremony, which reads: “With a sincere heart, therefore, and
      with unfeigned faith, I detest and abjure every error, heresy and sect
      opposed to the said Holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church.”
    </p>
    <p>For the Roman Church to maintain the Index of Forbidden Books.</p>
    <p>
      For the Roman Church in Latin America to tell its people that
      Protestantism and Communism are the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>Many other such practices could be cited.</p>
    <p>
      There is a striking parallel between the practice of the Russian
      Communists who, knowing themselves to be the promoters of a system which
      resorts to violence, untruth, treachery, and every immoral practice as it
      serves their purpose, attempt to cover up their shortcomings by
      representing themselves and their allies as the “peace loving nations” and
      as the champions of the world’s downtrodden masses, while accusing us of
      being “imperialists,” “war-mongers,” and “militarists” who are attempting
      to “enslave” the less developed nations, and the practice of the Roman
      Catholics who, knowing that for the most part their distinctive doctrines
      and rituals are not found in the Bible or are even contrary to the Bible,
      persistently designate themselves as “the only true church,” and hurl the
      epithet “heretic” at all who differ with them. The Communists claim to
      “liberate” people when they take possession of a country, but what they
      actually do is to enslave them. They talk of “the People’s Democratic
      Republic” (e.g., of Red China and East Germany), and of the “People’s
      Courts” (as in Russia and China), while in fact the people of those
      countries have no voice at all in their government or in their courts. In
      similar manner the Roman Catholics, where they are in control, consider it
      their privilege and duty to “Christianize” or “convert” all others and to
      conform them to their church practices, by persuasion if possible, by
      force if necessary. The Communists hold that men will be free only when
      they are governed by the Communist state, and Roman Catholics hold that
      men are really Christian and can be saved only when they submit to the
      Roman Catholic Church and acknowledge the authority of the pope. Such
      terminology involves an absolute reversal of the meaning of words. Both
      groups, as smokescreens to cover up their own misdeeds and errors, accuse
      their opponents of the very things of which they know themselves to be
      guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Protestantism is stronger than Romanism, and when democracy is
      stronger than communism, the latter groups talk of tolerance and freedom.
      They want us to co-exist peacefully until they become stronger than we
      are—then they will really put the screws on. Peaceful co-existence means
      peaceful co-existence as long as we are stronger, but when they become
      stronger it means peaceful submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      A further parallel between these two groups is that the Communists often
      are able to do their most effective work through “pinkos” and fellow
      travelers, and Roman Catholics often are most effective when they can
      persuade gullible Protestants under the pretense of being broad-minded and
      liberal to parrot their charges for them. But the facts of history are
      clear, and the doctrinal tenets and practices of both of those groups are
      a matter of public record. Any informed person knows that the terms used
      by both of those groups in the present controversies are falsely used,
      that the accusations are baseless, and that the facts are exactly the
      reverse of what they allege. In the light of history as manifested in the
      nations of Europe, the Communist charge of “war-mongers” as brought
      against the democratic nations, and the Roman Catholic charge of “bigotry”
      as brought against Protestants, are so ridiculous that no one should be
      deceived by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let Protestants protest orally and in writing whenever these fraudulent
      charges of “bigotry,” “hate-mongering,” and “hate literature” are made
      over the radio, television, in public discussion, or in print, and their
      falsity and injustice will soon be exposed.

    <h2>Persecution</h2>
    <p>It has been said that,</p>
    <p>Rome in the minority is a lamb.</p>
    <p>Rome as an equal is a fox.</p>
    <p>Rome in the majority is a tiger.</p>
    <p>
      The Roman Church has never acknowledged that the use of force to compel
      obedience is wrong in principle, although she has been compelled to
      abandon the practice in Protestant countries and the fires of the
      inquisition are no longer burning. Even in those countries that have
      remained under her control, an enlightened public opinion indirectly
      influenced by Protestantism has been sufficient to bring about a
      considerable degree of restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in the United States the priests often are friendly to Protestants,
      in Romanist countries they continue to be the instigators and leaders of
      riots against them. Regardless of attempts by some Roman Catholics to deny
      that Protestants are to be hated or persecuted, the fact is that they are
      charged with heresy by the Roman Church; and heresy, by Roman Canon Law,
      is punishable by death if need be. The undeniable fact is that today
      Protestant ministers behind the Iron Curtain, in such countries as Poland,
      Czechoslovakia, and East Germany, have more freedom to hold church
      services and to distribute Christian literature than they have in Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even today every Roman Catholic bishop at the time of his consecration
      takes an oath of allegiance to the pope which contains these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “With all my power I will persecute and make war upon all heretics,
      schismatics and those who rebel against our lord [the pope] and all his
      successors... So help me God and these the holy gospels of God” (
      Pontificate Romanum Summorum Pontificum. Belgium. Mechlin, p. 133. Cited
      by Emmett McLoughlin, in American Culture and Catholic Schools, p. 125).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Aquinas, prominent in the Dominican Order and the most
      authoritative philosopher and theologian of the Roman Church even to the
      present day, held that the church had the right to hunt out and kill
      heretics as a means of maintaining its purity. He wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Though heretics must not be tolerated because they deserve it, we must
      bear with them, till, by a second admonition, they may be brought back to
      the faith of the church. But those who, after a second admonition, remain
      obstinate in their errors, must not only be excommunicated, but they must
      be delivered to the secular power to be exterminated” (Summa Theologica ,
      Vol. IV, p. 90).
    </p>
    <p>And again:</p>
    <p>
      “So far as heretics are concerned, heresy is a sin, whereby they deserve
      not only to be separated from the church by excommunication, but also to
      be severed from the world by death” (Vol. II, p. 154).
    </p>
    <p>And still further:</p>
    <p>
      “If counterfeiters of money or other criminals are justly delivered over
      to death forthwith by the secular authorities, much more can heretics,
      after they are convicted of heresy, be not only forthwith excommunicated,
      but as surely put to death” (Vol. II, Q. 2, Art. 3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Marianus de Luca, S. J., Professor of Canon Law at the Georgian
      University in Rome, said in his Institution of Public Ecclesiastical Law ,
      with a personal commendation from Pope Leo XIII, in 1901:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Catholic Church has the right and duty to kill heretics because it is
      by fire and sword that heresy can be extirpated. Mass excommunication is
      derided by heretics. If they are imprisoned or exiled they corrupt others.
      The only recourse is to put them to death. Repentance cannot be allowed to
      save them, just as repentance is not allowed to save civil criminals; for
      the highest good of the church is the duty of the faith, and this cannot
      be preserved unless heretics are put to death.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The official newspaper of the large Roman Catholic diocese of Brooklyn,
      New York, The Tablet , in its issue of November 5, 1938, declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heresy is an awful crime... and those who start a heresy are more guilty
      than they who are traitors to the civil government. If the State has the
      right to punish treason with death, the principle is the same which
      concedes to the spiritual authority the power of capital punishment over
      the arch-traitor to truth and Divine revelation. ... A perfect society has
      the right to its existence... and the power of capital punishment is
      acknowledged for a perfect society. Now... the Roman Catholic Church is a
      perfect society, and as such has the right and power to take means to
      safeguard its existence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following words by a present day American Roman Catholic
      theologian, Francis J. Connell, with imprimatur by Cardinal Spellman, even
      the right of existence is denied to other churches:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Catholic Church is the only organization authorized by God to teach
      religious truth and to conduct public religious worship. Consequently,
      they [Roman Catholics] hold that any creed which differs from that of the
      Catholic Church is erroneous, and that any religious organization which is
      separated from the Catholic Church lacks the approval and the
      authorization of God. The very existence of any other church is opposed to
      the command of Christ, that all men should join His one church. From this
      it follows that, as far as God’s law is concerned, no one has a real right
      to accept any religion save the Catholic Church” (pamphlet, Freedom of
      Worship, the Catholic Position).
    </p>
    <p>
      These are representative samples of the “tolerance” that can be expected
      when the Roman Church has things its own way. Add to these the more than
      one hundred anathemas— “Let him be anathema,” which means, “Let him be
      accursed”—pronounced by the Council of Trent, the most authoritative of
      Roman Catholic councils, upon all who dare to differ with its
      pronouncements. Such violent, intemperate language in a creed which
      purports to set forth the basic principles of the Christian system reveals
      clearly the unchristian nature of the men who pretend so to speak. How
      alien is all of that to the noble sentiments expressed in the American
      Declaration of Independence, which says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
      that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights,
      that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness—that to
      secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their
      just powers from the consent of the governed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope Boniface VIII, in 1302, issued the Unam Sanctam, a document in which
      he claimed to be the representative of God on earth, and concurrently
      claimed authority over every nation and government on earth. This decree,
      which sets forth the doctrine of “the two swords,” reads as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In her [the Church] and within her power there are two swords, we are
      taught in the Gospels, namely, the spiritual sword and the temporal
      sword... the latter to be used for the Church, the former by the Church;
      the former by the hand of the priest, the latter by the hand of the
      princes and kings, but at the nod and sufferance of the priest. The one
      sword must of necessity be subject to the other, the temporal authority to
      the spiritual. ... For truth being the witness, the spiritual power has
      the function of establishing the temporal power and sitting in judgment on
      it if it should not prove good... but if the supreme power [the papacy]
      deviate, it cannot be judged by man but only by God alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This power of control over the two swords is assumed to be inherent in the
      papal office and superior to all other such powers. Men are to be
      compelled to submit to the Roman pontiff by the sword of the state, as
      wielded by kings and soldiers, but at the direction of the priesthood.
      This is, in fact, the traditional position of the Roman Church, that the
      actual persecution or execution of those judged by the church to be
      heretical should be done, not by the church, but by the state at the
      direction of the church. By such subterfuge the church seeks to escape
      responsibility for her crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of “the two swords” was the basis for the persecution and
      massacre of thousands of the Waldensians in Italy and France, one of the
      worst massacres having taken place in France, in 1545, when twenty-one of
      their towns were burned and the inhabitants plundered, tortured, and
      murdered in circumstances of the utmost cruelty. Two years later the dying
      monarch, Francis I, remembering with bitter remorse his ultimatum to the
      Waldensians that they embrace Roman Catholicism or be destroyed, pleaded
      with his son that the men who persuaded him to that course and led the
      massacre be given their just deserts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most notorious of all massacres was that which was carried out
      against the Protestants of France, beginning on St. Bartholomew’s Day,
      August 24, 1572, and continuing throughout France for five or six weeks.
      Some 10,000 “Huguenots,” as the French Protestants were called, were
      killed in Paris alone, and estimates of the number killed throughout the
      country run from 40,000 to 60,000. The Standard International Encyclopedia
      places the number at 50,000. Hundreds of thousands more fled from France
      to other countries. Many of their descendants eventually made their way to
      the United States. When the news of the massacre reached Rome church bells
      were rung and there was wild rejoicing in the streets. Not long before
      that time Germany had become Protestant, as had also parts of Switzerland;
      and the new movement had made such progress in France that nearly a fourth
      of the population was Protestant and there was a real possibility that if
      it remained unchecked the whole country might become Protestant.
    </p>
    <p>
      So pleased was the pope, Gregory VIII, to be rid of the Protestants in
      France that he ordered Te Deuni's (hymns of praise and thanksgiving) sung
      in the churches of Rome, and had a medal struck with his own profile on
      one side and the destroying angel on the other. He also sent Cardinal
      Ursini to convey his felicitations to the queen mother of France,
      Catherine de Medici, who at the promptings of the Jesuits had organized
      the plot. Primarily through that massacre France was preserved a Roman
      Catholic country, and has remained such, nominally at least, to the
      present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inquisition was created by the Roman Catholic Church to search out,
      examine, and punish heretics. Its worst excesses took place in Spain,
      under the inquisitor Torquemada, whose appointment was made by Ferdinand
      and Isabella in 1483 and confirmed by Pope Alexander VI. The Jews too were
      driven out of Spain by Torquemada. As Columbus set sail from Palos in 1492
      for his explorations in the new world he saw other ships in the harbor
      taking the Jews into exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      An earlier Spanish king, Ferdinand III of Castile (died 1252), had so
      pleased the Roman Church by his vigorous actions against dissenters that
      he was made a saint in 1671 and the church inserted in the Breviary (book
      of daily readings and prayers for the priests) these words in praise of
      him:
    </p>
    <p>
      “He permitted no heretics to dwell in his kingdom, and with his own hands
      brought wood to the stake for their burning” (The Stability and Progress
      of Dogma, by Cardinal Lepicier,p. 202; 1910).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inquisition also carried on its work with great effectiveness in
      Italy, where thousands of Protestants were put to death simply because
      they would not give up their faith and become Roman Catholics. Today
      Spain, Italy, Portugal, and to some extent France, Quebec, and Latin
      America, remain the devout children of the Inquisition. That, at any rate,
      was the method by which whole nations were made, or kept, Roman Catholic.
      Indeed, when we see the medieval attitude of the hierarchy, still
      manifesting itself in the present day persecutions in some of those
      countries, we are forced to conclude that the Roman Catholic Church is
      either the most decadent of all anachronisms, or the most dangerous of all
      survivals from a past that we wish were dead and buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inquisition was Rome’s masterpiece for the control of people and
      nations, and the tribunal of the Inquisition has never been abolished.
      Today in Rome it is known as the Congregation of the Holy Office.<sup
        >2</sup
      >
      It is composed of cardinals and prelates, with the pope himself as its
      head, and its principal work is that of maintaining the doctrines of the
      Roman Church against errors and heresies. The excesses of the Inquisition
      are no longer practiced, but the principles which made those excesses
      possible still are in effect. The late bishop Segura, of Seville, Spain,
      who was prominent in the recent persecutions in that country, said shortly
      before he died: “I regret I was not born in the days of the Holy
      Inquisition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>2</sup> In 1966 Pope Paul VI again changed the name to the
      Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith; also known as the Doctrinal
      Congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For another authoritative voice in Romanism let us listen to that of
      Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order and held in high honor by the
      Jesuits who today are the real masters in the Roman Church. Said he:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would be greatly advantageous, too, not to permit anyone infected with
      heresy to continue in the government, particularly the supreme government,
      of any province or town, or in any judicial or honorary position. Finally,
      if it could be set forth and made manifest to all, that the moment a man
      is convicted or held in grave suspicion of heresy, he must not he favored
      with honors or wealth but put down from these benefits. And if a few
      examples could be made, punishing a few with the penalty of their lives,
      or with the loss of property and exile, so there could be no mistake about
      the seriousness of the business of religion, this remedy would be so much
      more effective. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would be advisable that whatever heretical books might be found, on
      diligent search, in the possession of dealers or individuals, should be
      burned or removed from all the provinces of the kingdom. The same may be
      said of books written by heretics, even when not heretical themselves,
      such as those which treat of grammar or rhetoric or dialectic, which it
      seems, ought to be cast aside utterly out of hatred toward the heresy of
      their authors. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of all rectors and public professors in universities and academies, and
      likewise rectors of private schools and schoolteachers as well, and even
      tutors, it should be required that long before being accepted in their
      posts they should all be found true Catholics, through examination or
      secret information, and should be recommended by the testimony of
      Catholics; and they should swear that they are and will always remain
      Catholics; and if any such men should be convicted of heresy, they should
      be severely punished if only on the grounds of perjury” (Obras Completas
      de San Ignacio de Loyola , edicion Biblioteca de Autores Cristianos.
      Translated by Dwight Cristoanos; Madrid; 1952; 880 pp.).
    </p>
    <p>
      We need not ask ourselves what the Roman Catholic Church would do in the
      United States if it came into power. All we need do is to look at what it
      has done where it has been in power. Even the children in the parochial
      schools are being taught that the Roman Church has the right to suppress
      other churches and that it has the right to punish with death anyone who
      is a traitor to it. And history teaches that when people have the power
      they usually do what they have a right to do. Before the Reformation the
      Roman Church was able to quench all opposition in blood and violence. But
      since that time it has lived under the eyes of an alert and fiercely
      critical body of writers who have been free to express their opinions
      without fear of reprisal. But the doctrines concerning the temporal power
      of the pope, and the right of the Roman Church to use physical force to
      attain spiritual ends, have never been renounced by any pope or church
      council. Nor has that church ever repented of or apologized for the crimes
      that she has committed. An infallible church simply cannot repent.

    <h2>Present-Day Spain</h2>
    <p>
      The Protestant population of Spain today is estimated at only 20,000,
      about half of whom are foreigners, with a constituency of about 10,000
      others who may be termed sympathizers, out of a total population of
      approximately 28,000,000. There are about 230 organized Protestant groups,
      with only 70 or 80 pastors in the entire nation. That means that Spanish
      Protestants number only about .07 of one percent of the population. The
      government is clerical-fascist. Only one political party exists, that of
      dictator Franco. In present day Spain Protestants are not permitted to:
    </p>
    <p>Establish a Protestant church without a license.</p>
    <p>Be elected to any public office, national, provincial, or municipal.</p>
    <p>Obtain employment as teachers in the public schools.</p>
    <p>Obtain employment as nurses.</p>
    <p>Establish a Protestant school for their children.</p>
    <p>Establish a theological seminary to train their ministers.</p>
    <p>Publish or distribute Protestant literature without a license.</p>
    <p>
      Be married in a Protestant wedding service—only civil marriage is legal
      for Protestants. Have a Protestant funeral service in many towns.
    </p>
    <p>Bury their dead in the public cemeteries.<sup>3</sup></p>
    <p>
      <sup>3</sup> Under the much publicized religious liberty law passed by the
      Spanish Parliament In 1967, most of the old restrictions remain and some
      new ones have been added, including government supervision of nonRoman
      Catholic church finances and required lists of names and addresses of
      non-Roman Catholic church members; also, home evangelism, which is the
      primary practice through which the Protestant churches in Spain grow, is
      forbidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      All but a few of the Protestant churches that were in existence when
      Franco came to power in 1936 are now closed. New churches cannot be
      established without government permission, which under Franco’s concordat
      with the Vatican is almost impossible to obtain. Meetings in private homes
      and in unmarked buildings are permitted within limits, but often are spied
      upon by the police and frequently stopped if they appear to be having too
      much success, that is, making converts to Protestantism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1958 a Baptist minister, Jose Nunez, held services in a church that had
      been closed, and after a trial that attracted international attention was
      sentenced to a month in prison. Protestant churches are not allowed to
      have distinctive church architecture, nor a church bell, nor to locate on
      a prominent street, nor to broadcast their services by radio, nor to
      advertise their services in the newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the Franco regime came to power, the government, at the instigation
      of the Roman Catholic Church, has forced the closing of all Protestant
      schools, including the Union Theological Seminary in Madrid. Protestants
      are not allowed to have Christian schools even for their own children, but
      must send them to parochial or government controlled schools where
      religion is taught by priests and nuns, or obtain private schooling for
      them if they can afford it. The public cemeteries usually are owned or
      controlled by the Roman Catholic Church; Protestants are excluded from
      “holy ground,” and are required to bury in public plots set aside for
      atheists, criminals, and paupers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Civil law in Spain conforms closely to Roman Catholic Canon Law.
      Protestant marriage services are illegal, and a license for a civil
      ceremony is difficult, sometimes impossible, to obtain if either or both
      parties have been baptized in the Roman Catholic Church, even in infancy,
      as most people in Spain have. Even if they have left the Roman Church and
      have become Protestants the record stands against them. They are claimed
      by the Roman Church unless they can “prove” that they have severed all
      connection with it—which places a meddlesome power of investigation not
      only in the hands of professional judges, if they choose to abuse it, but
      often in the hands of municipal justices of the peace in every town and
      village, many of whom are almost illiterate. Some young couples have been
      forced to wait for years for permits to be married outside the Roman
      Church. Some have gone to England or France to be married, only to find
      when they return that their marriages are not recognized in Spain.
      Protestants who press their case with court action usually obtain the
      permit. But that involves from $150 to $200 expense, and few can afford
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public professions, such as medicine, law, teaching, banking, and
      nursing are for the most part closed to Protestants. Often it is difficult
      to obtain any kind of employment unless they pay some allegiance to the
      Roman Church. Trusted men and women who have been employed by a firm for
      years have been dismissed when it has been found that they have joined a
      Protestant church. The unemployed and destitute find it difficult, in some
      cases impossible, to get public relief. Protestants in the army are not
      allowed to attain officer rank. Sometimes even non-Christians receive
      better treatment; a Moslem has been promoted to lieutenant-general. Young
      men, obliged to do military service, are expected to kneel before the
      image of the Virgin Mary during special mass. To disobey is a military
      offense which may mean up to two years imprisonment. The controlled press
      tells the people that Protestants are not only heretics, but subversive
      Leftists, Communists, and Masons; and Protestants are not allowed to
      purchase space in the newspapers to reply to attacks made upon them. Jews
      too are restricted, but in general are treated better than are Protestants
      because they do not try to make converts. The Jews are few in number and
      for the most part can be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of the Inquisition still lives in Spain. It hardly seems
      possible that such conditions could exist in a country that professes to
      be Christian and civilized. But the arrogant intolerance of clericalism is
      ever the same. Back of these restrictions are the so-called “charter of
      the Spanish People,” of 1945, and the concordat between Franco and the
      pope. The key clause of the Charter reads:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The profession and practice of the Catholic religion, which is that of
      the State, shall enjoy official protection. No one shall be disturbed
      because of his religious beliefs or the private practice of his worship.
      No other outward ceremonies or demonstrations than those of the Catholic
      religion shall be permitted.”
    </p>
    <p>Articles 1 and 19 respectively of the Concordat read:</p>
    <p>
      “The Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion will continue to be the sole
      religion of the Spanish nation and will enjoy the rights and prerogatives
      which are due it in conformity with the Divine Law and the Canon Law. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “The State, by way of indemnification for past confiscations of Church
      property and as a contribution to the Church’s work for the good of the
      nation, will provide the Church with an annual endowment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The major part of the salaries of the priests and other church officials
      is paid by the state. Thus Protestants and others are taxed to support a
      religion in which they do not believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anyone has any doubt about what the Roman Catholic Church wants, we
      have an excellent, made-to-order demonstration in Franco’s Spain. There,
      through the working of an official concordat, Protestants are treated
      exactly as the pope thinks they should be treated. The Roman Church never
      tires of referring to what it terms “Christian Spain”; and its ideal, the
      establishment of the Roman Catholic religion and the elimination of all
      other religions, is more closely approximated in Spain than in any other
      present day nation. As one evangelical has expressed it, if you are a
      Protestant in Spain, your marriage is illegal, your children are
      illegitimate, and you can’t vote. What a contrast all of that is with the
      liberty that Roman Catholics enjoy in Protestant United States!
    </p>
    <p>Concerning the Spanish situation Paul Blanshard has written:</p>
    <p>
      “The same pope who appoints every bishop and cardinal in the United States
      also appoints every bishop and cardinal in Spain. The same pope who
      permits American bishops to declare in the United States that they favor
      the separation of Church and State in this non-Catholic country encourages
      his Spanish bishops to pursue a directly opposite policy in Catholic
      Spain. It is the Vatican and the Franco government that jointly deny to
      all Protestant churches and Jewish synagogues those liberties which
      leaders of the church in the United States profess to believe in. Between
      them they have abolished both political and religious democracy by a union
      of church and state which is the pluperfect negation of American
      principles” (pamphlet, Ecclesiastical Justice in Spain).
    </p>
    <p>And Walter M. Montano, writing in Christian Heritage , says:</p>
    <p>
      “Spain has had a long history of intolerance. The number of victims
      sacrificed by the Inquisition in Spain almost exceeds credulity. Yet it
      has been shown by Llorente, who carefully examined the records of the
      Tribunal, and whose statements are drawn from the most authoritative
      sources, that 105,285 victims fell under the inquisitor general
      Torquemada; 51,167 under Cisneros; and 34,952 fell under Diego Perez. It
      is further reckoned that 31,912 were burned alive! Half that number,
      15,659 suffered the punishment of the statute, and 291,450 were sent to
      penitentiaries. Half a million families were destroyed by the Inquisition,
      and it cost Spain two million children!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And concerning the present day restrictions and persecutions in Spain he
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let it never be forgotten that this is the heritage of the Roman Catholic
      Church, the end result of the dread Inquisition in a country that never
      knew Reformation” (September, 1959).
    </p>
    <p>
      Small wonder it is that the Protestant population of Spain is almost
      infinitesimally small! And yet in spite of all of these persecutions and
      abuses, the Protestant United States continues to pour into Spain great
      sums of relief money as well as supplies distributed by voluntary relief
      agencies. Under the Eisenhower administration nonmilitary aid has been at
      the rate of more than $200,000,000 a year (Church and State, September,
      1959). The United States maintains military bases in Spain, and the
      military aid has been vast and varied. Our governmental officials know of
      the abuses practiced there—such have been called to their attention many
      times. The clerical-fascist government of Spain has been bankrupt for
      years, and has been able to survive only because of American aid. The
      United States, therefore, has been responsible for its continuance. Back
      of this policy, of course, is the political influence of the Roman
      Catholic Church on our government in Washington. This American branch of
      the Roman Church is not only a friend of the Franco regime, but is an
      integral part of that world system which makes such regimes possible and
      supports them.

    <h2>Italy, Yugoslavia</h2>
    <p>
      In Italy there are approximately 300,000 Protestants in a population of
      50,000,000, a ratio of about 1 to 165. The Inquisition there, too, did its
      work almost as ruthlessly as in Spain. Since the Second World War,
      Protestant work in Italy has increased to some extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new Italian Constitution, adopted under pressure from the western
      democracies after the Second World War, declared for freedom of religion.
      But practical considerations, primarily the power of the Roman Catholic
      Church, have made it ineffective much of the time. However, in 1958 there
      were two different court decisions which were favorable to Protestants.
      The Constitutional High Court, Italy’s highest tribunal, invalidated a
      provision in Italian law which made it necessary to secure a government
      permit to operate a house of worship such as was required under the
      concordat that was signed between Mussolini and the Vatican and which had
      been continued in force ever since. And in another case a complaint had
      been brought by Roman Catholic owners of an estate against three
      Protestant tenant farmers who had refused to permit a local priest to
      bless their cattle. The court decision was in favor of the defendants, and
      declared: “If a citizen associates himself with another citizen of
      different religious creed he must not force on him the rites of his own
      faith with regard to things that concern both of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Protestants in Italy have found it almost impossible to establish schools
      for their children even in the primary grades, despite the desperate need
      for schools throughout the country. Before the 1958 decision Protestants
      were not allowed to put signs on their churches designating them as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      To post such signs was an illegal “public display” of religion, and the
      police promptly tore them down and arrested the people responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, within the Roman Catholic Church early in 1960, a new
      “constitution” for the diocese of Rome was proclaimed by Pope John XXIII
      tightening the ecclesiastical discipline for both priests and laymen. This
      is the pope’s own diocese, and its provisions usually are followed in
      other dioceses throughout the world. Among other things it forbids laymen
      to join or vote for political parties or persons disapproved by the Roman
      Church, under threat of excommunication; forbids them to enact any laws
      detrimental to the Roman Church; and makes them liable to excommunication
      if they support doctrines or ideas in the press or publicly which differ
      from those of the Roman Catholic Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Italy remarks concerning the pope which the Vatican considers
      “slanderous” are punishable by law. Article 297 of the Italian Penal Code
      provides sentences up to three years for “whoever on Italian territory
      offends the honor and prestige of the head of a foreign state”—the pope in
      Vatican City qualifies as the head of a foreign state. In December, 1960,
      an Italian newspaper editor was given a five-month suspended sentence for
      asserting that the pope and the hierarchy had acted unconstitutionally by
      interfering in Italian civil affairs when its daily newspaper,
      L'Osservatore Romano , upheld the right of the Roman Church to “guide the
      faithful” through ecclesiastical directives concerning political affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Yugoslavia there occurred during the Second World War one of the
      crudest episodes in history, in the massacre of Eastern Orthodox Serbs by
      Roman Catholic Croats, in an effort to make the province of Croatia
      solidly Roman Catholic. So hideous were the massacres that they surpass
      even those of the Duke of Alva in the Netherlands and those of St.
      Bartholomew’s day in France. Most astonishing was the manner in which
      those crimes were ignored or hushed up at the time by the news services
      even in the United States, although similar massacres of Jews in Germany
      were given the widest publicity— another demonstration of how subtly and
      efficiently Roman clericalism exerts its influence over the press and
      radio. But now a French author, Edmond Paris, who was born a Roman
      Catholic, has told the story in his fully documented books, The Vatican
      Against Europe (1959, translated 1961) and Genocide in Satellite Croatia
      (1959, translated 1960). Another French author, Herve Lauriere, also a
      Roman Catholic by birth, has recorded the same events in his Assassins in
      the Name of God. Both Paris and Lauriere put the responsibility squarely
      on the priests of the Church of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of background, after the First World War the Roman Catholic states
      of Croatia and Slovenia were united with the Eastern Orthodox state of
      Serbia to form the nation of Yugoslavia. Croatia had approximately
      5,000,000 Roman Catholics and 3,000,000 Eastern Orthodox. At once the
      Croats began to intrigue against the Serbs. Terrorist Ustashi bands were
      organized. They received support from Mussolini, who financed them. When
      king Alexander I of Yugoslavia visited France in 1934, he was assassinated
      at Marseilles. The leader of the gang was Ante Pavelich, who escaped to
      Italy where Mussolini gave him protection and refused to surrender him to
      the Yugoslav government although he was convicted of the crime in both
      French and Yugoslav courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in 1941 the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia, the Croats, with Pavelich as
      their leader, joined them. As a reward Hitler made Pavelich the puppet
      head of the new “Independent State of Croatia.” His minister of religion
      was Andrija Artukovic, another Roman Catholic. Then began a war of
      suppression or extermination of all Serbs and Jews. Nearly 10,000 of the
      80,000 Jews in the new state were killed or forced to flee, their property
      being confiscated. Official records and photographs show that Pavelich and
      Archbishop Stepinac were closely associated in governmental, social, and
      ecclesiastical affairs. Stepinac was appointed supreme military apostolic
      vicar of the Ustashi army led by Pavelich. He was, therefore, in a
      position to know of the atrocities that were constantly taking place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May, 1941, after innumerable massacres had been committed, Pavelich
      went to Rome and was received by Pope Pius XII, and on the same occasion
      signed a treaty with Mussolini. In June of that year more than 100,000
      Orthodox Serbian men, women, and children were killed by the Ustashi. In
      all some 250 Orthodox churches were destroyed or turned over to Roman
      Catholic parishes and convents. Documents requesting and authorizing such
      transfers are now in the state prosecutor’s office at Zagreb and Sarajevo,
      bearing the signature of Archbishop Stepinac. In February, 1942, a Te Deum
      was sung in Stepinac’s church in Zagreb, the then capital of Croatia, with
      special honors paid to Pavelich. In a pastoral letter Stepinac declared
      that in spite of complexities, what they were seeing in Croatia was “the
      Ford’s work,” and called on his priests to support Pavelich. Stepinac
      twice visited Pope Pius XII, in Rome, in 1942. He reported that 244,000
      Serbs had accepted (forced) conversion to Roman Catholicism. So the pope,
      too, was well informed as to what was going on in Serbia and Croatia.
      Edmond Paris places the total number of men, women, and children killed by
      the Ustashi during the four years of the occupation at more than 500,000
      (The Vatican Against Europe, p. 224).
    </p>
    <p>
      When it became necessary for the Nazis to retreat from Yugoslavia,
      Pavelich, Artukovic, and almost all of the Roman priests went with them.
      After the war ended Yugoslav courts sentenced Stepinac to sixteen years
      imprisonment for his Nazi-Fascist collaboration. After serving five years
      he was released, but was kept under house arrest. The pope, however,
      rewarded his services by naming him a cardinal. Until his death in 1960,
      he was played up in Roman Catholic circles, particularly in the United
      States, as a “martyr,” even to the extent that Cardinal Spellman, in New
      York, named a parochial high school after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pavelich again fled to Italy, where for some time he lived in disguise as
      a monk in a monastery, and later escaped to Argentina. Artukovic too
      avoided capture, and eventually entered the United States under a false
      name and with a forged certificate of identity from Southern Ireland, and
      settled in California. Both Pavelich and Artukovic successfully resisted
      all efforts of the Yugoslav government to extradite them as war criminals.
      Pavelich eventually returned to Spain, where he died in 1960. Los Angeles
      newspapers reported that through two court trials the principal support
      for Artukovic to prevent his extradition came from the Roman Catholic
      Church, of which he had been a lifelong member. So reads another chapter
      of church-state intrigue as dark as any played out during the Middle Ages.
      Let it also be noted that both Hitler and Mussolini were Roman Catholics,
      but that despite their crimes against humanity neither was ever
      excommunicated, nor even severely censured, by the Roman Church.

    <h2>Latin America</h2>
    <p>
      The most glaring example of persecution in our western hemisphere in
      recent years, and continuing to some extent to the present day, is found
      in the nation of Colombia. There a reactionary government with the support
      of the Roman Catholic Church came into power in 1948. A concordat was
      signed with the Vatican, under which severe restrictions were placed on
      Protestants. Sixty percent of the country was declared “mission territory”
      and closed to Protestant work of any kind. During this period 116
      Protestants have been killed, 66 Protestant churches or chapels have been
      burned or bombed, and over 200 Protestant schools have been closed.
      (Report of the Evangelical Confederation of Colombia, Bulletin No. 50;
      June 26, 1959). Protestants, however, have refused to acknowledge the
      validity of the concordat, because certain features of it are in open
      violation of the Colombian constitution, and it has never been submitted
      to the congress for ratification as is required by law for all treaties
      with foreign powers. Evidently its supporters doubt that they could secure
      ratification. But the course that has been followed by the Roman Church in
      Colombia in recent years seems to have had the full approval of the
      Vatican, for the archbishop of Bogota was promoted to cardinal by Pope
      John XXIII in December, 1960.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally all of Latin America was intolerant toward Protestantism. But
      during the past fifty years the area as a whole, through more or less open
      conflict with the Roman Church, has been moving toward religious freedom.
      Some of the countries now have almost as much freedom of religion as is
      found in the United States. Practically all of the Latin American nations,
      following the example of the United States, have written into their
      constitutions articles guaranteeing freedom of religion. But the
      continuing power of the Roman Church often makes their enforcement
      impractical or impossible. About half have separation of church and state.
      In general the people are proud of this liberalism and resent the
      machinations of the reactionary minority which in some areas is trying to
      restore the old order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost invariably the anti-Protestant demonstrations and riots that have
      taken place have been incited or led by local priests. In some areas the
      priests have undue influence with the civil officials, police, editors,
      and radio executives, and too often it happens even yet that the most
      powerful man in a Latin American town is not the mayor, nor the chief of
      police, but the Roman Catholic priest who controls them both. But the
      Roman Catholic people, if left to their own desires, prefer to live in
      peace with their Protestant neighbors. One telephone call from the pope
      could put an end to all of the harassment, slander, and opposition on the
      part of his priests within an hour if such were his desire. But no such
      call ever comes. The responsibility for continued persecution rests
      squarely with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the most part the masses of the Latin American people, sensing the
      superstition and sham connected with the only kind of religion that they
      have ever known, have forsaken it and have become largely agnostic to all
      religion. The laboring class has become largely anti-Catholic, as have
      also the educated classes. The colleges and universities, though few in
      number, are largely independent and impartial as regards religion. As even
      North American Roman Catholics know only too well if they are willing to
      admit it, the Latin American Roman Catholic Church has proved to be one of
      the major spiritual derelictions in the history of Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In colonial days the Roman Church became a powerful political force. Vast
      amounts of land and wealth came into its hands, and complaints were often
      heard about the excess accumulation of wealth on the part of the clergy.
      The Inquisition was transplanted to Latin America—the original “Gestapo,”
      as John Gunther calls it—and every movement of the mind toward new truth
      and greater freedom was immediately crushed out. Clerical politicians
      helped maintain the hold of the church on the masses, while the church in
      turn supported their ambitions. With few exceptions the Latin American
      dictators have been aided by the church, and in turn have given their
      support to it. These are simply the facts of history, part of the heavy
      impedimenta under which Latin America began her struggle toward freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the United States, through the
      power that it was able to exert on our government and through the press
      and radio, carried on an aggressive campaign to discredit Protestant
      mission work in Latin America and to deprive American Protestant churches
      of their right to carry on missionary work there. They sought to create
      the impression that such missions were not needed and not wanted by the
      people. Strong pressure was brought to bear on the State Department to
      refuse passports to Protestant missionaries, while at the same time every
      facility was placed at the disposal of Roman priests and nuns who applied
      for such passports. Repeatedly Protestant mission board secretaries tried
      to find out why their missionaries were discriminated against. This was
      particularly the situation in the 1930’s and 1940’s, during the Roosevelt
      and Truman administrations. But fortunately Protestantism is now making
      progress in almost all parts of Latin America. A new day is dawning for
      the church in most of those lands. The old feudal system, with its few
      large land owners and the poor peasant masses, is crumbling. A new middle
      class is emerging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many Latin Americans find it difficult to understand why the United States
      took part in the destruction of the Spanish Republic in the late 1930’s,
      why it refused to sell supplies to the legitimate nationalist government
      and by so doing enabled Franco, with help from Mussolini and Hitler, to
      overthrow that government. They also find it hard to understand why so
      often our influence has been on the side of the dictators in the Latin
      American republics instead of following the principles that inspired the
      democratic founders of our nation. It became almost a fixed policy for
      this nation to appoint Roman Catholic ambassadors and consuls to represent
      it in Latin America. Such men obviously were unfitted properly to
      represent a Protestant nation in its dealings with other nations. In this
      connection both Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Truman showed themselves very
      responsive to Roman Catholic pressures. Mr. Roosevelt, for instance, in
      defiance of public opinion, appointed a personal representative to the
      Vatican, with a $12,000 a year allowance. And Mr. Truman proceeded to
      nominate an American ambassador to the Vatican, receiving, of course, an
      ambassador in return, and to have congress make that a permanent
      diplomatic arrangement. But the plan was defeated in the Senate. It is
      difficult to explain to our South American neighbors the machinations of
      the Roman Catholic Church in Washington and why the hierarchy should have
      such a big influence in our government. But certainly it is not
      unreasonable for them to expect that our foreign policy would reflect
      those principles of religious and civil liberty which have contributed so
      much to this nation’s greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually the competition that the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America
      has received from Protestantism has been a stimulus to it. When it held a
      monopoly as the state religion in most of those countries and other
      churches were excluded, it stagnated and decayed. But as has been the case
      in the United States where it is faced with an alert Protestantism, in
      recent years it has been forced to give better service, to build more and
      better schools and hospitals, and to provide better trained priests and
      nuns. In many Latin American countries two thirds or more of the priests
      regularly have come from Spain. Separation of church and state, though
      strongly opposed by the Roman Church, has been for it a blessing in
      disguise both in the United States and in Latin America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask the average thoughtful Latin American, “What is Latin America’s most
      serious problem?” and the answer usually is: “The spiritual problem.” Far
      from opposing Protestant missions, most Latin Americans welcome them and
      see in Protestantism many elements that they desire for their own
      religious life but which they do not find in Roman Catholicism. Many of
      them have reacted bitterly against a religion based on ignorance and
      superstition, and realize that what their people desperately need is a
      religion that is more than formalism, a faith that issues in purity of
      life and in strengthened moral character.
    </p>
    <p>
      George P. Howard, in his book, Religious Liberty in Latin America, written
      a generation ago,said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nowhere is Christianity so devoid of inner content or real spiritual life
      as in Latin America. There is a vast difference between the Latin American
      Catholic Church and the Roman Catholicism of Northern Europe or North
      America.”
    </p>
    <p>And then he adds:</p>
    <p>
      “Never has Christianity had such a magnificent missionary opportunity as
      was given the Roman Catholic Church in the period of the conquest and
      colonization of the Indies, as Latin America was then called. The field
      was wide open, support from the civil authorities was complete, no other
      rival church was on the ground, there was no opposition. And yet, after
      four centuries of undisturbed possession, the Christianization of the
      continent still lags. It is, therefore, no exaggeration to say that Latin
      America is Christianity’s most shocking failure” (p. 42; The Westminster
      Press, Philadelphia; 1944).
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the relation of the schools in Latin America to Christianity,
      Mr. Howard says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “A very large proportion of the student and educated classes as well as
      the new middle class, which is just emerging in Latin America, has not
      been won to Christianity. These people are traditionally indifferent and
      even hostile to religion. To be religious or to go to church is still the
      sign of inferiority among the large numbers of the intellectuals. They
      threw off the shackles of obscurantist religious faith weighted with
      superstition and they have not yet been shown that a man can be a
      Christian and preserve his intellectual respectability. Will Durant
      remarked that ‘the failure of the Reformation to capture France left
      Frenchmen no halfway house between infallibility and infidelity.’ The
      reaction in university centers of Fatin America against religion and all
      that was reminiscent of churchly influence was so radical that all forms
      of academic garb were barred. It is necessary to go to Protestant
      countries to find the cap and gown in use” (p. 28).
    </p>
    <p>
      In Colombia, where Roman Catholic persecution of Protestants has been
      worst during the past 12 years, a recent survey by the Ministry of
      Education shows that 42 percent of the entire Colombian population is
      illiterate, that only 44 percent of the children of primary age are
      enrolled in any school, and that a serious shortage of schools and
      teachers exists. And yet during these past 12 years the Roman Church,
      which poses as the guardian of education in that nation, has forced the
      closing of more than 200 Protestant mission schools. The attitude of the
      Colombian Roman Catholic Church is: Better an illiterate Colombian than
      one educated by Protestant teachers.The Director of UNESCO (United Nations
      Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization) has said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In 1956, the average level of education for Latin America as a whole did
      not exceed the first grade; those who did enter school did not stay, on an
      average, beyond the fourth grade. After the first three years UNESCO, with
      the grudging support of most of the Latin American governments, could
      count nearly 25 million children at school (some 19 million still get no
      schooling at all) and 90 thousand more teachers at work in new classrooms.
      The major project is scheduled to run until 1968; on the horizon, by the
      end of the decade, is the goal: Decent primary education for every child
      in Latin America” (Quoted in Christian Heritage, May, 1961; p. 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Commenting on this situation, Stuart P. Garver, editor of Christian
      Heritage, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The deficiencies of Roman Catholic education are of such a nature that an
      aroused national spirit retaliates against the Church like a man reacts
      upon discovering he has been cheated by some slick salesman. ... The
      failure of the hierarchy to educate for responsible exercise of freedom by
      the people themselves has produced a world-wide pattern of trouble for
      Catholic education” (May, 1961).
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly the present trouble in Cuba is to be explained in part by this
      very cause. The Roman Church in that island, which under earlier regimes
      enjoyed a favored position and which always has had control of education,
      sensed that change in the political and social areas threatened its
      position. It opposed the revolutionary movement and encouraged student
      demonstrations against it. Castro in turn took over the schools and
      carried the movement over into Communism—a not unfamiliar pattern where
      the people have known no church other than the Roman. Castro himself is a
      member of that church, as are 90% of the Cuban people. By a strange
      anomaly Roman Catholicism fights Communism, but, because of the ignorance
      and poverty that develop in Roman Catholic countries, has itself become a
      seedbed for Communism. On more than one occasion this has proved to be a
      serious embarrassment for the hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet in both Europe and Latin America our government officials, in a
      more or less open bid for the Roman Catholic vote in this country, have
      been backing dictatorial and oppressive governments with generous American
      aid. Dee Smith stated this problem well when he wrote that we have...
    </p>
    <p>
      “...a State Department which deliberately backs with American tax dollars
      the Roman Catholic party in foreign countries against much more liberal
      and democratic non-Catholic elements, a State Department which sanctions
      with silence outright tyrannies, pouring millions into countries where
      persecution of Protestants is in full swing while exacting no promise
      whatever that such persecution will cease. In fact, our State Department
      takes a position which cannot fail to be recognized by both persecutors
      and persecuted as tacit endorsement of religious persecution” (Christian
      Heritage, May, 1960).

    <p>
      How are we to explain the glaring contrast that over the centuries has
      developed and which continues to manifest itself so prominently between
      Protestant and democratic Britain and the United States on the one hand
      and the Roman Catholic countries of southern Europe and Latin America on
      the other? The former are known for the stability of their governments,
      the latter for the ease and rapidity with which they overthrow their
      governments. Mr. Howard has given an explanation that is for the most part
      unknown even to Protestants, but which we believe lies at the very heart
      of the matter. He first calls attention to the difficulty that the people
      in southern Europe and Latin America have even today in governing
      themselves, and points out that the political institutions in those
      countries are largely servile copies of Anglo-Saxon models. A
      constitutional monarchy such as existed for a time in Spain and Italy, the
      republics of France and Portugal, or the federal governments in Latin
      America are only imitations, and poor ones at that, of the constitutional
      forms found in Great Britain and the United States. The Anglo-Saxons have
      been able to carry forward and strengthen political institutions which the
      Latins have found almost unworkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Latins and the Anglo-Saxons,” says Mr. Howard, “have followed two
      different traditions whose synthesis has never yet been accomplished. The
      one is the Greco-Roman classic tradition. The other is the
      Hebrew-Christian tradition. The democracies were the product of
      Christianity. The classic tradition made no contribution. Democracy did
      not exist in the Greek republics. They were true aristocracies, or
      oligarchies, composed of a minority that exercised authority over a great
      mass of slaves on whose labor that handful of citizens lived. Even less
      democracy can be found in the imperial tradition of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Democracy has existed, and can exist, only among men who believe in but
      one God, in human equality and fraternity. A political democracy has never
      yet appeared outside of the bounds of Christianity nor will it prosper
      where ‘personal religion’ is unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The seed of Christianity fell among the Latin people of Europe and with
      the development of this new spiritual leaven, a movement toward democracy
      was started. Then came the Renaissance with the powerful resurrection of
      interest in the GrecoRoman pagan culture and ideals. The pagan aspect of
      the Renaissance never reached the northern countries of Europe with much
      strength. But southern Europe fell under the spell of the new culture. No
      enthusiasm was felt in the northern countries for the pagan aspects of the
      Renaissance hence it never took such deep root. The Renaissance had the
      tragic effect in the Latin countries of killing the incipient movement
      toward democracy which Christianity had started.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the northern countries Christianity was able to continue its quiet
      work. Thus the Reformation appeared, and we must not forget that, just as
      the Renaissance meant the coming to life of the old paganism, so part of
      the deep significance of the Protestant Reformation lies in the fact that
      it was a strong protest against the pagan elements that were so powerfully
      leavening life in the countries of southern Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As a reaction against this pagan tendency of their day, some great
      spiritual personalities appeared in Latin countries, but they constituted
      only a small majority. The trouble with Latin America is that neither the
      saving influence of these great Latin mystics nor the invigorating breezes
      of the Reformation ever reached its lands. Only the spirit of the
      Renaissance, the materialism and vanity of a superficial culture, reached
      South America. The vast majority of those who landed on the shores of the
      southern continent were dominated by the sensual pagan influences of the
      Renaissance. The settlement of the continents of North and South America
      thus assumed widely divergent patterns” (pp. 103-105).
    </p>
    <p>
      To the same effect an editorial which appeared in the great daily. La
      Prenza, in Buenos Aires, in October, 1943, summarized these two different
      historical trends and interpreted them:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let it not be forgotten that the stream of immigration that flowed toward
      the northern continent was entirely spontaneous. In lands that fell to the
      Spanish crown immigration was of a totally different sort. To North
      America went groups of settlers who on their own initiative left their
      native lands seeking freedom, and above all freedom of conscience...
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here on our continent, on the other hand, a different system was
      established and very diverse also were the effects of three centuries
      spent under the authority of the mother country. Absolutism characterized
      the government. Everything that was fundamental was kept under the control
      of the sovereign with the advice of the Crown Councils. Immigration was
      limited only to those of Hispanic origin and those who professed the
      religious faith which not only dominated the Spanish peninsula but which
      excluded all other faiths. Education was so completely neglected by the
      government that at the commencement of the 19 th century the number of
      literates among the population was very scarce.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The influence of all these diverse factors weighed heavily on our slow
      and painful social and economic revolution, which never went very far
      beyond the most rudimentary conditions. Thus poorly equipped were we on
      the eve of our struggle for independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There we have the great results of the two different policies; the one
      held liberty as its norm, the other exercised its greatest zeal in
      suffocating the most elementary manifestations of liberty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Latin-American statement emphasizing the religious variance
      between North and South America was published in America, a liberal
      magazine in Havana, Cuba (May, 1943). It said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “As the history of the Americas has developed in two different ways, so
      there are two different types of Christianity in the new world. Anglo
      America is a child of the Reformation: Latin America is the product of
      Catholic sculpturing. ... The thirteen American colonies were founded by
      pilgrims who fled from religious and political intolerance and who reached
      the shores of America with the purpose of establishing a new society based
      on respect and liberty for man. Their first governments were pure
      democracies and a very significant detail is the fact that the first
      assemblies of those simple austere colonials for the purpose of dealing
      with the affairs of government were held in the same buildings that served
      as a place of worship. Such was the intimate relation between their faith
      and their social and political ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Latin America is the reverse of the coin. Among us Roman Catholicism has
      always been incompatible with democracy. During the period of the conquest
      and in colonial times the official religion served the purpose of
      weakening the conscience so that the people would more easily tolerate
      despotism and be more ductile under oppression. Clerical and absolutist
      Spain employed the physical force of her soldiers and the moral influence
      of her priests in a perfect partnership which led to the enchaining of
      these embryonic settlements and their more easy exploitation. Democracy
      appeared in our lands in answer to the intuitive cry of popular agony and
      under the inspiration of Anglo-Saxon democracy and the emotional impulse
      of the French Revolution. In the North democracy was born under the shadow
      of religion; here, among us, it appeared in spite of religion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In these penetrating analyses we have the problem of Latin America. It is
      the problem of a bad start—religiously, politically, economically, and
      socially. We may add further that the Spanish Inquisition had the effect
      of developing a hard, ruthless character, and that this was reflected in
      Spain’s treatment of her colonies. The Inquisition sanctified cruelty in
      the service of the church. Having become accustomed to plundering and
      murdering their neighbors whose orthodoxy was questionable, they did not
      hesitate to deal ruthlessly and selfishly with their colonists, and
      particularly with the Indians whose land they had seized. The uncivilized
      natives could be enslaved and plundered at will. The conquistadors had not
      been nurtured in a religion that issued in ethical living and moral
      character. The cross and the sword were supposed to advance together.
      Usually the sword led the advance. Latin America had a bad start.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to emphasize again that the Roman Catholicism that we see in the
      United States is not representative Roman Catholicism, but a modified form
      that has been greatly influenced by our ideals of democracy and freedom
      and which has adjusted itself to life with a Protestant majority. And
      still more important, it has been influenced by evangelical moral
      standards. Romanism has the ability to compromise and adjust itself to
      conditions as it finds them. It has, for example, one form in Spain,
      another in England, another in France, another in Latin America, and still
      another in the United States. For the sake of expediency and for the time
      being it acquiesces in the American principle of freedom of religion,
      while at the same time working to change this system.
    </p>
    <p>
      We call particular attention to two facts, mentioned earlier: (1) every
      Roman Catholic nation in the world today is bankrupt; (2) every Roman
      Catholic nation in the world today is looking to Protestant United States
      for help, in the economic, social, educational, and financial spheres. We
      submit, therefore, that in view of the incomparably greater progress that
      this nation has made through the relatively short 186 years of its
      national existence, with a free church in a free state, surely the logical
      course would be for the Roman Catholic nations to follow our example and
      grant full freedom of religion to their people, not for us to follow
      theirs in granting a religious monopoly to one church and in denying
      freedom of religion to the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the United States our Constitution clearly forbids any establishment of
      religion. That clearly means separation of Church and State. On June 28,
      1971, the Supreme Court in two related cases strongly reaffirmed that
      position as regards State aid to Church schools, by decisions of 8 to 0
      and 8 to 1. Fortunately in this country we have never had a tax on
      religion or a tax for religion. We want to keep it that way! No man should
      be taxed to promote another man’s religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most effective ways to establish a Church is to finance it.
      That may be done either directly or through its projects. If the people of
      a Church will not support its projects, then clearly those projects should
      be dropped. Surely when a Church has to call in the sheriff and resort to
      force to collect its money, it is in effect if not in reality a
      spiritually dead Church and is not worthy of support.
    </p>
    <p>
      We submit further that as regards our western hemisphere, what Latin
      America needs more than anything else is not more foreign aid from the
      United States, nor more priests from Spain and Portugal, but a change of
      religion, specifically a change to evangelical Christianity; and that not
      until such a change takes place can there be substantial and permanent
      progress in those nations.
