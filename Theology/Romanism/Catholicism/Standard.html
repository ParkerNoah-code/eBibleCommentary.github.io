    <h2>Basic Principles</h2>
    <p>
      One of the strong contrasts between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism is
      found in the moral codes which distinguish the two systems. In
      Protestantism this code is taken directly from the Bible. Nothing can be
      laid on men as a moral requirement unless it can be shown to be contained
      in the Bible. Such requirements thereby become a matter of conscience for
      the Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in Roman Catholicism the moral code is based primarily on Canon Law
      and only secondarily on the Bible, and in the main is imposed on the
      person from without. The authority of the church as interpreted by the
      priest is what counts. The result is that the Roman Church has developed a
      standard of morality that is designed, not to stir the con¬ science, but
      to maintain papal power. Many of the dogmas and rites of Romanism are
      antagonistic to the teachings of Scripture and directly or indirectly
      conducive to immorality. Drinking, gambling, and other habits considered
      as vices by Protestants are not counted as evil by Romanists except when
      indulged in to excess.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the study of morals the Roman Church takes the teachings of the
      theologian Alphonsus Liguori as authoritative. Liguori was canonized among
      the saints in heaven by the pronouncement of Pope Gregory XVI, in 1839,
      and was declared a doctor of the universal Roman Church by Pope Pius IX.
      Thomas Carlyle, the famous British author, who said that the Jesuits had
      “poisoned the well springs of truth,” wrote concerning Liguori:
    </p>
    <p>
      “More terrible still is the ‘moral theology’ of Alphonsus Liguori, who is
      counted a saint and ‘doctor’ of the Church—of equal rank with Augustine,
      Chrysostom and others— whose textbooks are standard on moral questions in
      all Roman Catholic seminaries. The ‘moral’ teachings of Liguori, if they
      could be read in their original Latin, would fill every right-minded
      person with horror. For there he outlines the ways in which falsehood can
      be used without really telling a lie', the ways in which the property of
      others can be taken without stealing how the Ten Commandments can be
      broken without committing deadly sin.”
    </p>
    <p>Samples of Liguori’s “moral” teaching are:</p>
    <p>
      “A servant is allowed to help his master to climb a window to commit
      fornication” (St. Alphonsus, 1, 22, 66).
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not a mortal sin to get drunk, unless one loses completely the use
      of his mental faculties for over one hour” (1, 5, 75).
    </p>
    <p>“It is lawful to violate penal laws” [hunting, fishing, etc.].</p>
    <p>
      “It is asked whether prostitutes are to be permitted. ... They are to be
      permitted because, as a distinguished priest says, ‘Remove prostitutes
      from the world, and all things will be disordered with lust.’ Hence in
      large cities, prostitutes may be permitted” (3, 434).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this connection it is interesting to note that legalized prostitution
      was not abolished in the city of Rome, the very city which is headquarters
      of the Roman Church, until September, 1958, and that even today almost
      every city of any size in South America has its legalized houses of
      prostitution. Dr. Walter Montano, returning from a conference of
      Protestant leaders in Colombia, reported that, according to information
      given him, the city of Cali, which has a population of 520,000, has 2,600
      houses of prostitution and 13,000 registered prostitutes. He adds that the
      Roman Catholic Church in that country has done practically nothing to lift
      the morality of the people or to bring a solution to the country’s
      problems ( Christian Heritage , February, 1960).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556), another famous teacher in the Roman Church
      and founder of the Jesuit order which today so largely controls Roman
      Catholic policy, wrote some rules for his order which he commended as
      conducive to complete obedience and as a “help in attaining the right
      attitude toward the Church.” One of them reads:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Laying aside all private judgment the spirit must be always ready to obey
      the true doctrine and therefore, if anything shall appear white to our
      eyes which the Church has defined as black, we likewise must declare it to
      be black. ... If you receive from your superior a command which appears to
      go against your own judgment, your own conviction, or your own well-being,
      then you must fall on your knees, putting off all human principles and
      considerations and renew, when you are alone, your vow of obedience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with this it is not uncommon in the Roman church to refer to
      one as a “good priest” if he does his work efficiently, even though it may
      be known that his moral character is bad. He is a “good priest” in the
      same sense that one may be a “good doctor,” or a “good mechanic,” entirely
      apart from his moral character. Under such a standard obedience to the
      church becomes the supreme virtue and takes precedence even over
      conscience. But for the Protestant such action does not make sense. The
      Protestant can not force his will to believe that which he knows to be
      irrational, nor his conscience to approve that which he knows to be wrong.

  <section>
    <h2>Liquor</h2>
    <p>
      We do not need to belabor the point that the Roman Catholic Church fights
      almost every movement throughout the nation that is designed to restrict
      the use of alcoholic liquors. The big cities, in which the Roman Catholic
      population is concentrated, are notoriously “wet.” The three things that
      appeal most to the weakness of human nature and that bring large profits
      to those who control them, are drinking, gambling, and prostitution.
      Protestants are often regarded as “killjoys,” because they oppose even a
      limited license for any of these. The Roman Church, however, holds that
      drinking and gambling are not sinful in themselves, but that they become
      so only when carried to excess. And who is to say at what point they
      become excessive? Why, the priest, of course. It is he who, in the
      confessional, decides for Roman Catholics at what point a man or woman is
      to be considered as drinking to excess, and how much may be spent on
      gambling without committing a sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A case in point occurred in Steubenville, Ohio, in the fall of 1946. It
      was public knowledge that drunkenness, gambling, and prostitution were
      rampant in that city and that a “clean up” was needed. A group of
      Protestant ministers undertook the job. But the Roman Catholic bishop
      openly opposed the cleanup and issued a pastoral letter to be read in all
      of his churches, condemning the campaign of the ministers. According to
      The New York Times of November 28, of that year, the bishop called the
      ministers “narrow little people,” and declared that “Drinking and gambling
      are not in themselves sinful or evil.” The bishop then proceeded to
      lecture the ministers on the proper interpretation of the Christian moral
      code as follows: “These so-called leaders simply do not know the moral
      structure of Christianity. As a result they make themselves pitiable
      objects in a community.” A Steubenville judge, apparently under the
      bishop’s influence, backed him up and condemned the ministers as “fanatics
      insistent upon senseless arrests” (L. H. Lehmann, booklet, The Secret of
      Catholic Power, p. 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      We have called attention to the De La Salle Institute, at Napa,
      California, which is only one of several church owned properties in the
      United States producing commercial wine or brandy or both.

<div id="Oaths" dropdownName="Oaths" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Oaths</h2>
    <p>According to Liguori, a Roman Catholic can lie. Says he:</p>
    <p>
      “Notwithstanding, indeed, although it is not lawful to lie, or to feign
      what is not, however, it is lawful to dissemble what is, or to cover the
      truth with words, or other ambiguous and doubtful signs, for a just cause,
      and when there is not a necessity for confessing. These things being
      settled, it is a certain and a common opinion among all divines, that for
      a just cause it is lawful to use equivocation in the modes propounded and
      to confirm it [equivocation] with an oath” (Less. 1, 2, c. 41).
    </p>
    <p>
      The right to hold a “mental reservation” is claimed by Roman theologians.
      The Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas, on which Roman theology relies so
      heavily, says that when the interests of Holy Mother Church require it,
      one may make a statement while holding a mental reservation which
      qualifies it into nullity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic Dictionary, 15 th edition, published in London, in
      1951, with the imprimatur of the cardinal of Westminster, under the
      subject Oath, says that the Roman Church has the right to dispense anyone
      from the provision of an oath: “Though generally speaking, no earthly
      power can dispense from keeping an oath made in favor of another, still in
      other cases a dispensation may be valid.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Canon Law 1320 the pope can dispense from any oath (see the
      authoritative book, Canon Law: Text and Commentary [1946], by Bouscaren
      and Ellis, p. 679). A Roman Catholic judge who obtains a papal
      dispensation in order to violate his judicial oath in case of conflict
      between church law and civil law is considered blameless by the Roman
      Catholic theologians. The most notable examples of papal release from
      oaths were the attempt of Pope Pius V, in 1570, to “uncrown” Protestant
      Queen Elizabeth I, of England, by releasing her court officials and all
      subjects from civil allegiance to her—which attempt failed because the
      British people in the main remained loyal to their queen—and the attempt
      of Pope Gregory VII to depose Henry IV of Germany, which attempt succeeded
      to the extent that Henry was forced to do obeisance to the pope, although
      he later regained his power and drove the pope out of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principle to which the Roman Church resorts in freeing men from their
      oaths is that it does so in obedience to a “higher law.” On the grounds
      that no man can justly bind himself to do that which is sinful, the church
      may decide that an oath of allegiance to a ruler who is disobedient to the
      pope, or a pledge made to a “heretic,” is sinful and need not be kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is Roman Catholic doctrine that the conscience is subject to the
      teaching of the church and is to be determined by that teaching rather
      than by private judgment. A pledge made during a political campaign, or an
      oath of office, is secondary to Canon Law. A Roman candidate for office
      may declare himself in favor of separation of church and state, or against
      federal and state aid to parochial schools. But even though he does so in
      all good conscience, the Roman Church teaches that in the final analysis
      his conscience must be governed by and be subject to its authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwin F. Healy, in his book. Moral Guidance , published by the Loyola
      University Press, declares: “A promise under oath to do something sinful
      does not bind at all.” The Roman Church sets itself up as the judge to
      determine what things are sinful; hence an oath to perform some action
      that is later judged to be against the best interests of that church may
      be abrogated by a Roman Catholic office holder. What the church holds to
      be right, e.g., things which promote its welfare, restrict heretics, etc.,
      are judged to be right. When personal judgment of conscience conflicts
      with the dictates of the church, personal judgment must be set aside. We
      have seen this principle set forth by Loyola for the members of his Jesuit
      order. The same general principle holds throughout the Roman Church.
    </p>
    <p>Under the subject of mental reservation Healy says:</p>
    <p>
      “For sufficient reason we may thus permit others to deceive themselves by
      taking the wrong meaning of what is said; and this remains true though the
      listener, because of his ignorance, does not know that there is another
      meaning to the word that is employed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, a Roman Catholic is not necessarily bound to the strict
      form of the words spoken. If the person to whom a promise is made, or
      before whom an oath is taken, does not know that the one making it may
      attach a different meaning to the words, that is his fault, and the
      promise or oath is not necessarily binding.
    </p>

<div id="Theft" dropdownName="Theft" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Theft</h2>
    <p>
      In regard to theft, Liguori teaches that a Roman Catholic may steal,
      provided the value of the thing stolen is not excessive. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If any one on an occasion should steal only a moderate sum either from
      one or more, not intending to acquire any notable sum, neither to injure
      his neighbor to any great extent, by several thefts, he does not sin
      grievously, nor do those, taken together, constitute a mortal sin.
      However, after it may have amounted to a notable sum by detaining it, he
      can commit mortal sin, but even this mortal sin may be avoided, if either
      then he be unable to restore, or have the intention of making restitution
      immediately of those things which he then received” (Vol. 3, p. 258).
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine has been interpreted for American Roman Catholics to mean
      that it is not a mortal sin if one steals less than $40.00 worth at any
      one time. Msgr. Francis J. Connell writes as follows in The American
      Ecclesiastical Review , official magazine of instruction for priests,
      published at Catholic University, Washington, D.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Question: What would be regarded nowadays as the absolute sum for grave
      theft in the United States?
    </p>
    <p>
      “Answer: By the absolute sum for grave theft is meant that amount of
      money, the stealing of which constitutes a mortal sin, irrespective of the
      financial status of the individual or corporation from which it is taken,
      however wealthy they may be. Naturally this sum varies with the
      fluctuation of the value, or the purchasing power, of money. In a country
      like ours it is quite possible that this sum might be different in
      different sections. To lay down a general norm, in view of actual
      conditions and the value of money, it would seem that the absolute sum for
      grave theft would be about $40.00” (January, 1945, p. 68).
    </p>
    <p>
      The condoning of theft and robbery under certain circumstances is known
      among Roman Catholic theologians as “secret compensation,” and is
      contained in catechisms and textbooks used in Roman Catholic schools. In
      The Manual of Christian Doctrine , which has gone through many editions,
      and which bears the nihil obstat of M. S. Fisher, S.T.L., censor librorum,
      and the imprimatur of Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia, the Preface
      states: “This book is intended as a manual of religious instruction not
      only in the novitiate and scholasticate of teaching congregations, but
      also in the classes of high schools, academies and colleges.” On page 295
      this textbook discusses the problem of theft, its nature and various
      forms, including larceny, robbery, cheating, fraud, and extortion, and on
      page 297 we find theft condoned in the following words:
    </p>
    <p>“Q. What are the causes that excuse from theft?</p>
    <p>
      “A. 1. Extreme necessity , when a person takes only what is necessary, and
      does not thereby reduce to the same necessity the person whose property he
      takes. 2. Secret compensation, on condition that the debt so cancelled be
      certain that the creditor cannot recover his property by any other means,
      and that he take as far as possible, things of the same kind as he had
      given.”
    </p>
    <p>L. H. Lehmann comments very appropriately on such conduct:</p>
    <p>
      ‘Moral conduct can be no better than the moral principles upon which it is
      based. Most crimes are distinctly connected with thievery and robbery. If
      a Roman Catholic youth, for instance, can persuade himself that he has
      ‘extreme necessity’ for an automobile, he will consider himself justified
      in stealing it legitimately according to the above teaching, provided he
      knows that the owner will not be thereby impoverished. The doctrine of
      ‘secret compensation’ applies mostly to employees who consider they are
      being underpaid for their labor. A twenty-dollar-a-week cashier in a side
      street cafeteria may consider herself underpaid and apply this principle
      to justify her pilfering of odd dimes and quarters from the cash register
      whenever she can safely do so. Many a cashier in a large bank or
      commercial business corporation has done just this until he found himself
      in jail for large-scale embezzlement. A desperate man could also easily
      argue himself into thinking that he is justly entitled to some of the
      surplus money of a rich victim and will go after it with a gun. Likewise
      grafting politicians seize upon the argument implicit in this teaching to
      justify their conviction that they are worth much more to the community
      than their elected offices pay them. [And it surely does not take much
      imagination to guess how this principle might be applied by judges and
      clerks whose duty it is to count votes at the polling places. Just how
      many votes might be stolen in order to aid one’s candidate without
      committing mortal sin? We should like to know.]
    </p>
    <p>
      “This doctrine of ‘secret compensation’ was, of course, unheard of in
      Christianity, even in the Catholic Church, prior to the Jesuit casuists of
      the seventeenth century. It was invented by them along with other
      unethical doctrines such as ‘mental reservation,’ ‘the end justifies the
      means,’ ‘the end sanctifies the means,’ etc., to make Catholicism popular
      among the masses. It also helped to rationalize their own exploits. Thus
      Catholic textbooks of moral theology today make no pretention of showing
      that these principles of conduct take their origin from the Ten
      Commandments or from Christian revelation. They merely propound them as
      accepted Catholic doctrine and trace them back to Gury, the Jesuit
      fountainhead. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “The blunt fact, confirmed by countless cases, is that many Catholics get
      the one idea from this teaching, namely that stealing is not essentially
      evil at all times, but, on the contrary, fair and reasonable if one needs
      something badly enough and the owner does not. How this conviction can be
      stretched to cover untold cases is easy to imagine. It is limited only by
      the envy and self-prejudice of the individual circumstances—which varies
      immeasurably from person to person.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All in all, it is most unfortunate that any religion is permitted to
      teach such a principle as part of the curriculum of American school
      education, much more if it should ever be taught in the public schools on
      the pretext of helping to lessen crime among the youth of America”
      (booklet, Catholic Education and Crime).

<div id="Gambling" dropdownName="Gambling" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Gambling</h2>
    <p>
      Another very serious defect in the moral armor of Roman Catholicism is its
      penchant for games of chance, particularly its strong defense of bingo as
      played in the churches, which, in whatever light it may be viewed, is a
      form of gambling. The primary feature about gambling, bingo, raffles,
      etc., is that each is a game of chance in which the ownership of money or
      some other article of value is decided by a lucky number, a turn of a
      wheel, a throw of the dice, or some such device. And gambling is gambling,
      no matter what form it takes. Basically, it is an attempt to get something
      for nothing, an attempt to live not by honest toil but at the expense of
      others. As such it is a moral disease, a covetous greed or lust to get
      possession of what another has. Just because other equally covetous people
      agree to the arrangement does not make it moral. Even when a gambler wins
      he realizes that others have lost. Anything that induces people to take
      money needed for food and clothing and risk it on games of chance is wrong
      in principle. And the “easy come, easy go” principle involved seldom
      leaves anyone permanently enriched. It is notorious that gamblers almost
      invariably end up broke. And usually bingo, under the guise of charity for
      a church or school, is an opening wedge for the more professional types of
      gambling. But whether gambling takes the form of bingo, raffles, lucky
      numbers, or the more outright forms with dice, cards, or roulette, it
      surely is unworthy of a Christian, who should always be ready to give a
      comparable value in return for what he seeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that the article may not be of great value, and that the
      “chances” cost only a few cents each, does not change the principle
      involved, nor make it right to participate. The principle is the same and
      the practice is sinful whether one gambles for thousands of dollars at
      roulette or whether he participates in the raffle of a $1 box of candy for
      “chances” sold at 5 cents each. Sin remains sin, whether committed outside
      the church or inside. The righteous robes of religion do not cover it up
      in the sight of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, organized gambling has meant organized crime. Recently a top
      federal prosecutor, Malcolm Anderson, assistant U. S. attorney general in
      charge of the criminal division of the Justice Department, speaking before
      the National Association of Attorneys General, declared that gambling is
      the life-blood of organized crime, and that if gambling could be wiped out
      syndicated crime would die for lack of sustenance. Organized gambling
      flourishes in a twilight zone of society where the muscle man is boss and
      where threats, coercion, and corruption are the methods of doing business.
      An evil atmosphere envelopes such a community and eats into the fabric of
      law and order. Bribery and corruption of officials with attendant social
      abuses is a common result. Yet the Roman Church, which receives
      substantial revenues from gambling games, has not only failed to oppose
      legalized gambling but frequently has itself run afoul of state
      anti-gambling laws. On the other hand Protestant groups, which believe
      that it is a sin to gamble, have taken the lead in a great many places and
      have succeeded in having bingo, and particularly professional gambling,
      outlawed. In the bingo-pinball devices commonly found in taverns, the
      millions of nickels flow into millions of dollars. Usually these devices
      return the tavern owners 50 percent of the take, and the operators
      greedily reach for the profits. So the foundation for the underworld is
      built.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gambling is a violation of one of God’s first commands to man: “In the
      sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread” (Genesis 3:19). It is also a
      violation of other Scripture commands and of the general spirit of
      Scripture teaching: “Thou shalt not steal” (Exodus 20:15); “Thou shalt not
      covet” (Exodus 20:17); “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself’ (Matthew
      19:19); “Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your
      labor for that which satisfieth not?” (Isaiah 55:2). “Whether therefore ye
      eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God” (1
      Corinthians 10:31); etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ideal constantly held before us in Scripture is that we should earn
      our property by honest labor and fair exchange. To try to give gambling an
      aura of respectability, and even a certain kind of spirituality through
      church sponsorship, is at once a sign of spiritual degeneration and of
      abysmal ignorance or deliberate disregard of what the Scriptures really
      teach.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1958 the state of New York legalized bingo by a constitutional
      amendment, primarily because of pressure brought to bear by the Roman
      Catholic Church and a few other groups. A news dispatch from Albany, New
      York, May 31, 1960, reported that New York residents had spent more than
      40 million dollars playing bingo since the game was legalized. It added
      that the state lottery control commission reported that of that total, 29
      million was returned to the players in the form of prizes and that the
      non-profit sponsoring organizations retained 9 million.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> In the year 1966 the gross from bingo in New York State was
      mere than 93 million dollars, with 53 million returned to the players and
      24 million profit to the sponsoring organizations.

      Bingo is illegal in Pennsylvania. Interestingly enough, the magazine
      Church and State , April, 1960, carried this report: “Philadelphia police
      have stepped up their campaign against bingo games in Roman Catholic
      churches. Latest to feel the hand of the law were St. Agatha’s and Church
      of the Gesu. ... St. Agatha’s budget is $90,000 a year; $50,000 has come
      from bingo.” Interesting, too, is the fact that Pennsylvania’s long ban on
      legalized gambling was broken in December, 1959, when the Roman Catholic
      governor signed a bill which permitted betting on harness races, subject
      to county option. An outright ban on bingo-pinball in Ohio was upheld by
      the United States Supreme Court in 1958. And the United States Post Office
      Department has ruled that the game of bingo is a lottery and that as such
      it cannot be promoted through the mails. The mailing of periodicals or
      circulars containing advance notice of lotteries is banned under postal
      regulations. Postal officials have ruled that bingo has all the classic
      elements of a game of chance as set forth in the Supreme Court’s lottery
      definition, and, though legal in some states, the state laws do not affect
      the federal laws under which the department operates.

      If there ever was a travesty on the Christian religion it is that of a
      church raising money by encouraging its people to engage in a form of
      gambling. Such practice cannot give stability to a church, and the effect
      on its spiritual and educational program is bound to be detrimental.
      Morally it is no better than was the sale of indulgences during the Middle
      Ages, which was one of the religious corruptions that brought about the
      Protestant Reformation.

    <h2>The Roman Church and the U. S. Prison Population</h2>
    <p>
      When we mention prison statistics it must be acknowledged, of course, that
      men and women in all denominations occasionally go wrong, that no
      denomination is above criticism, and that good and bad people are found in
      all denominations. There are, however, certain points of contrast between
      the Roman and the Protestant churches, points which, we believe, arise
      primarily because of their different moral codes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various studies indicate that of the white prison population Roman
      Catholics constitute a higher percentage than do those of any other church
      operating on the American scene, and that while the Roman Catholic
      percentage in the general population is about 22 percent, their percentage
      in the jails and penitentiaries and in juvenile delinquency is
      approximately twice that.
    </p>
    <p>
      An examination of the crime records of any large city in the United States
      shows that the gangster type criminal turns out with surprising frequency
      to be Roman Catholic or to have a Roman Catholic background. The Annual
      Reports of the Commissioner of Correction of the State of New York, for
      the years 1940 through 1946, shows that a consistent 50 percent of the
      criminals committed to New York’s two largest prisons, Sing Sing and
      Dannemora, year after year, were Roman Catholic, while the Roman Catholic
      population in the state was approximately 27 percent. An analysis of
      criminal records in Sing Sing, which was made by a Roman Catholic chaplain
      and published in the magazine Commonweal, December 14, 1932, revealed that
      of a total of 1,581 prisoners no less than 855 were Roman Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>Emmett McLoughlin says concerning his work in Phoenix, Arizona:</p>
    <p>
      “As chaplain of the local jail, I was shocked at the percentage of Roman
      Catholics among the unwilling guests. Wondering if the same incidence
      prevailed in other jails and penitentiaries, I found a study written by a
      Franciscan, the Roman Catholic chaplain of Joliet Penitentiary in
      Illinois. He discovered that the Catholic percentage among prisoners in
      America is about twice their percentage in the total population.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If the Roman Catholic Church is the mother of learning and of holiness,
      how could this be? Priests answer that these prisoners and gangsters do
      not represent American Catholicism but mostly Irish, Polish, Italian,
      Spanish, and Mexican—unfortunate immigrants from backward countries. This
      is the stock answer to the question of Roman Catholic crime and illiteracy
      in America. It will be found routinely in the ‘question boxes’ of the
      hierarchy’s publications” ( People’s Padre , p. 86).
    </p>
    <p>
      We would point out that the countries mentioned in the above paragraph are
      Roman Catholic countries par excellence, that for centuries they have been
      almost exclusively Roman Catholic, and that they are precisely the
      countries in which we expect to find the true fruits of Romanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Blanshard, in another bestseller, his well documented American
      Freedom and Catholic Power , says that the Roman Catholic Church as a
      denomination “has the highest proportion of white criminals in our
      American prisons of any denomination” (p. 105). And in a footnote he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “This has been established by many studies of crime and juvenile
      delinquency, but it would be wrong to say that Catholicism is primarily
      responsible. Poverty and bad housing affect the lives of Catholic workers
      as well as others in our large cities. ... Catholic pre-eminence in the
      field of crime and juvenile delinquency is notable in our northern cities,
      especially in New York. A study, Crime and Religion, by Father Leo Kalmer,
      Franciscan Herald Press, Chicago, 1936, showed that the rate of Catholic
      criminals committed to prisons in forty-eight states was about twice that
      of the Catholic proportion in the population. See Leo H. Lehmann, The
      Catholic Church and Public Schools, Agora Publishing Co. Bishop Gallagher
      of Detroit declared in 1936, according to The New York Times of December
      8, 1936, ‘It is a matter of serious reproach to the Church that more
      Catholic boys in proportion to the total number, get into trouble than
      those of any other denomination. One fifth of the people of Michigan are
      Catholics, but 50 percent of the boys in the Industrial School for Boys at
      Lansing are Catholics.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      The New York Times, March 13, 1947, published an amazing admission by
      bishop John F. Noll, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, as given before the National
      Catholic Conference on Family Life, in Chicago the previous day. In this
      “chastening” confession, as the Times called it, this crusading bishop of
      the Roman hierarchy acknowledged that “Nearly all the evils of society
      prevail where we [Roman Catholics] live, and not where Protestants live,”
      that Roman Catholics are concentrated largely in the big cities of America
      where they constitute from one third to two thirds of the population,
      while the rural communities “where family life is most wholesome,” are
      “eighty percent Protestant.” He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are only 7,000,000 members of Protestant churches in the fifty
      biggest cities of the country, but 20,000,000 Catholics. Eighty percent of
      Protestantism is rural. And it is in rural America where family life is
      most wholesome and where the divorce rate is still low. On the other hand,
      where the bulk of Catholics live, one half of the marriages end in
      divorce. It is where they live that the big motion picture houses are
      located, the filthy magazine racks, the taverns and the gambling halls.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Tenorio, staff psychologist of the New Mexico Boy’s School, reports
      that 85 percent of the boys committed to that institution are of
      Spanish-American background, and that 71 percent are Roman Catholics,
      while only 41 percent of the state’s total population is Roman Catholic
      (Christian Century , September 4, 1957).
    </p>
    <p>
      In Britain the Sunday Times recently dealt with the subject of crime and
      its causes. An article declared frankly that “In this country [England]
      Roman Catholics, who have the most intensive religious training, have also
      the highest delinquency rates.” To support that statement it was pointed
      out that the proportion of Roman Catholics population-wise was no more
      than ten percent, but that the proportion in boys’ Borstal institutions of
      correction was 23 percent, and in Holloway prison about 26 percent. It was
      further declared that during the war delinquency rates among Roman
      Catholics were approximately twice as high among those of other faiths,
      and that in Scotland in 1957 the 15 percent of Roman Catholics in the
      population provided 35 percent of those committed to Borstal institutions,
      and 40 percent of those committed to prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chief among the devices used by the Roman Catholic Church in its policy of
      isolating its youth from childhood contacts with non-Catholics is the
      parochial school. In order to justify in the eyes of Roman Catholics the
      necessity for supporting these “hothouses of Catholicism,” as they have
      been appropriately called, the Roman hierarchy condemns as godless the
      public school system which makes no distinction of race or creed. Surely
      the above statistics are at one and the same time a cause for alarm and a
      grave indictment of Roman Catholic education. They should be seriously
      considered by the Protestant people of this nation who are constantly
      being called upon to provide more and more support, through taxation and
      government handouts, for these Roman schools. Here we have a church making
      pretentious and bigoted claims about being “the only true church,” yet
      turning out a product that is responsible for approximately twice its
      proportionate share of juvenile delinquency and adult crime. Tolerant
      Americans would like to avoid this subject. No one likes to connect crime
      with a specific system of church training. Yet if it could be proved that
      crime is more prevalent, say, among the Presbyterians, or Baptists, or
      Methodists proportionately than among other religious groups, certainly
      the Roman Catholic authorities would not hesitate to point out that fact
      and to use it in justification of their church and their schools. But
      since the facts are so clear we should not hesitate to question the value
      of the parochial school, and to insist that the Roman Church must stand
      responsible for the influence that it exerts. And surely the above facts
      should make any open-minded Roman Catholic want to inquire more carefully
      into the real nature of his church and the effect that it is having on
      society at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must point out that the Mafia, probably the most notorious of all crime
      organizations, had its origin hundreds of years ago in Italy where for
      centuries the Roman Catholic Church almost exclusively has provided the
      religious background. It originated in Sicily in the late 13 th century,
      as a semi-vigilante, semi-patriotic organization, designed to free Italy
      from French rule. Its rallying cry was: “Death to the French is Italy’s
      Cry!” In Italian the words were: Morte Alla Francia Italia Anela!, and the
      initials of these words spell MAFIA.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the passage of time the Mafia became a secret criminal organization,
      preying on its own countrymen, specializing in murder, robbery, extortion,
      blackmail, and arson. It turned up in the United States as early as 1860,
      but not until the end of the century did it become a serious threat in
      this country. It found easy entrance because of the extremely lax
      immigration laws which made little effort to strain out criminal elements.
      It spread across the country from New York to California, being centered
      primarily in the big cities, working through organized gangs, and
      specializing in big money crime, such as narcotics, gambling,
      prostitution, bootlegging, murder, and robbery. In 1959 a book,
      Brotherhood of Evil, by Frederic Sondem, Jr., was published which goes
      into considerable detail concerning its origin, history, international
      workings, and recent activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recent Senate crime investigation committee, headed by Senator
      McClellan, of Arkansas, and the earlier committee, headed by Senator
      Kefauver, of Tennessee, sought to show that the Mafia was the main support
      of organized crime in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a monotonous regularity the witnesses who were called for questioning
      turned out to be Italians of Roman Catholic background.
    </p>
    <p>
      The underworld convention which met at Appalachin, New York, November 14,
      1957, was alleged to have Mafia connections and resulted in an intense
      drive by law enforcement officials to suppress that organization. A
      lengthy editorial in the Kansas City Times, December 16, 1959, gave some
      interesting facts concerning that meeting. Among other things it said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “A singular fact about the 60 men surprised at what turned out to be the
      best publicized barbecue in history is that all were of Southern Italian
      birth and ancestry, most of them Sicilian... the royalty of the
      underworld. Chief among the Mafia leaders who gathered at Joe Barbara’s
      $150,000 mountain top mansion that fateful November day was the recog¬
      nized leader of vice and corruption in the United States, Vito Genovese,
      whose Mafia title is Don Vitone. As far back as 1939 he was dubbed ‘King
      of the Rackets’ by Thomas E. Dewey, former New York governor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Emmett McLoughlin remarks concerning the attitude of the Roman Catholic
      Church toward the Mafia:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Its leaders, the cardinals and bishops, are conspicuously silent in the
      face of the Roman Catholic Sicilian Mafia’s complete defiance of decency
      and morals in the promotion of prostitution, narcotics, gambling, and
      labor racketeering in America. The same bishops and archbishops who
      vociferously condemn a young Catholic girl for entering a beauty contest
      say nothing about the traffic in narcotics and whoredom so long as good
      Catholics run the business” (American Culture and Catholic Schools, p.
      232; 1960; Lyle Stuart, publisher; New York).
    </p>
    <p>
      Prominent with Mafia or similar gangland connections have been the very
      royalty of the underworld, such as A1 Capone, Lucky Luciano, Joe Adonia,
      Albert Anastasia, Frank Costello, Frank Scalise, and others. The fact
      stands out clearly that the worst criminal element that we have received
      from any nation during the past several decades has come from Italy, and
      that the religious background of those men has been Roman Catholic. We
      have never had a comparable group from England, or Scotland, or Holland,
      or any other Protestant nation. Another editorial in the Kansas City Times
      made this comment:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the last 15 years nearly a thousand Italian bom ‘unwanteds’ have been
      shipped back to their native land since the attorney general undertook to
      rid the United States of dope peddlers and an endless variety of thugs
      associated with the Mafia” (September 25, 1959).
    </p>
    <p>
      Supporting this contention that in hundreds of years with practically no
      Protestant competition Roman Catholicism has failed to raise the moral and
      spiritual standards of the Italian nation is the testimony of Stephen L.
      Testa, himself a former Roman Catholic of Italian birth. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We see that in a population 96% Roman Catholic, the percentage of crime
      and illiteracy is very high. In Naples, for instance, filthy language,
      blasphemy, cursing, and lying is very prevalent among the populace, and so
      is drinking, gambling, thieving and low morals. Yet they attend mass, go
      to confession, wear scapulars and religious medals around their necks and
      pray to images in their homes. The Church has had them for hundreds of
      years and it has not benefited them in the least. On the other hand those
      who are converted to Protestantism immediately abandon those vices and
      sins and live cleaner lives. They are completely changed, they are ‘bom
      again,’ and are new creatures in Christ. The idea of salvation is
      different in the two religions” (booklet, The Truth About Catholics,
      Protestants, and Jews, p. 31).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another series of events to which we must call attention, which surely
      cannot be pure coincidence, is that of the assassination of three
      presidents of the United States, all three of whom were killed by Roman
      Catholics educated in parochial schools: Lincoln, by John Wilkes Booth;
      Garfield, by Charles J. Guiteau; and McKinley, by Leon Czolgosz. Theodore
      Roosevelt was shot and wounded by a Roman Catholic in Milwaukee, while a
      candidate for president in 1912. In Florida a Roman Catholic shot at
      Franklin Roosevelt, then president elect, missed him, but killed the mayor
      of Chicago who was riding beside him in the same car. Two Roman Catholics,
      Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo, Puerto Rican Nationalist party
      members, tried to kill Harry Truman in a shooting fray at Blair House, in
      Washington, D. C., while Truman was president (1950), and did kill one of
      his guards. Torresola was killed and Collazo is now serving a life term in
      Leavenworth penitentiary. And in 1954 Roman Catholic members of the Puerto
      Rican Nationalist party, in a wild shooting fray in the House of
      Representatives, attempted to kill members of that body and wounded five
      congressmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic Church, of course, had no connection with the Mafia or
      its activities, nor with the actions of the others mentioned here. But as
      the same stem that almost exclusively provided the religious background
      out of which those men came, it bears a heavy responsibility and must be
      judged accordingly.

    <h2>Questionable Hospital Practices</h2>
    <p>
      A Roman Catholic hospital practice which very definitely has a moral
      aspect to it is that of baptizing Protestants and others who are thought
      to be in danger of death. An article by Fr. John R. Connery, S. J., in
      Hospital Progress (April, 1959), which magazine carries on its front cover
      the words, “Official Journal of the Catholic Hospital Association,” sets
      forth in considerable detail the procedure to be followed by the chaplain
      or nurse in such cases. According to this article it is proper, and in
      some cases even mandatory, to baptize into the Roman Church, and even
      without their knowledge or consent, unbaptized persons or patients
      concerning whom it is not known whether they have been baptized or not, if
      they are thought to be in danger of death. The patient need not be
      actually dying, but perhaps unconscious or so critically ill that death is
      a possibility. This practice applies particularly to newborn babes and to
      unconscious or critically ill persons if their parents or relatives are
      not available for consultation. Information concerning the baptism need
      not be given to anyone other than the local priest who records it. In this
      article we read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Q. Are you obliged to tell the parents of an infant baptized in danger of
      death, if the parents are not Catholics? What if the parents resent it and
      refuse to raise the child a Catholic?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A. Ordinarily it is not permitted to baptize children of non-Catholic
      parents against their wishes. To do so would be to violate the rights of
      these parents. ... When there is danger of death, however, the Church
      makes an exception, although even in this emergency primary responsibility
      for the child’s spiritual welfare belongs to the parents. ... It is only
      when the parents, through neglect or for reasons of their own, fail to
      provide for the baptism of the child, or when the emergency does not allow
      even sufficient time to warn the parents, that Church permits the Catholic
      minister to baptize the child. In this case the Church’s concern over the
      future religious education of the child... yields to the child’s immediate
      spiritual need. Similarly the wishes of parents must give way to these
      circumstances to the child’s own right to the means of salvation. It will
      be permissible to baptize the child even without the knowledge or
      permission of the parents. ... If a child in these circumstances lives
      through the emergency, the question arises about the advisability of
      informing the parents of the baptism. ... We can say that it would not be
      necessary, or even advisable, to acquaint non-Catholic parents with the
      fact that their child had received an emergency baptism unless there is
      good reason to believe that they would not resent it” [italics ours].
    </p>
    <p>In regard to unconscious adults who are baptized Fr. Connery writes:</p>
    <p>
      “In most cases it will not be advisable to acquaint the person with the
      fact that he was baptized unless it becomes clear that he would have
      wanted baptism under the circumstances.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He goes on to say that those baptized become members of the Roman Catholic
      Church and that if children they should be trained as Catholics, but that
      it will not be wise to insist upon it if the parents do not agree, because
      resentment might be aroused against the church. He defends such baptism by
      saying that in any event it will not hurt anything, and that in some cases
      it might prove helpful, as for instance if the person married before a
      Protestant minister later was converted to Catholicism and wanted to get
      an annulment in order to marry a Roman Catholic. In such an event the
      first marriage would be held invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      This forced and secret baptism of the helpless—“baptism by stealth,” as
      some have called it—is justified by the Romanists on the basis of their
      doctrine that there is no hope of salvation for one who has not been
      baptized.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are nearly 1,000 Roman Catholic hospitals in the United States. Most
      of the patients in these hospitals are not Catholics, yet their treatment
      is governed by the Roman Catholic code of ethics in which the doctors and
      nurses are minutely instructed. Those instructions are set forth in detail
      by the Jesuit scholar Father Henry Davis, in his Moral and Pastoral
      Theology , and by Father Patrick A. Finney, in his Moral Problems in
      Hospital Practice (1947 ed., imprimatur by the archbishop of St. Louis).
      Concerning one particular phase of that code Paul Blanchard, in his
      American Freedom and Catholic Pourer, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “One of the most important doctrines in the Catholic medical code is the
      doctrine of the equality of mother and fetus. This doctrine is of special
      interest to every potential mother who has a Catholic physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When the average American woman approaches the ordeal of childbearing,
      she takes it for granted that her physician will do everything possible to
      save her life in the event of complications. I am sure that 99 percent of
      all American husbands would consider themselves murderers if, confronted
      with the choice between the life of a wife and the life of her unborn
      child, they chose the life of the fetus. This is particularly true in the
      early months of pregnancy when such risks most frequently develop. Most of
      our citizens assume without discussion that every possible effort should
      be made to save the life of both mother and child, but that if a choice is
      forced upon the physician the mother should be given first consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Catholic hierarchy does not endorse this choice, nor can a good
      Catholic physician leave such a choice to the husband and father and be
      true to the dogmas of his church. ‘The life of each is equally sacred,’
      said pope Pius XI in his encyclical, Casti Connubii, ‘and no one has the
      power, not even the public authority, to destroy it.’” (pp. 139-140).
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Finney, in the book just mentioned, states the doctrine in question
      and answer form:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If it is morally certain that a pregnant mother and her unborn child will
      both die, if the pregnancy is allowed to take its course, but at the same
      time, the attending physician is morally certain that he can save the
      mother’s life by removing the inviable fetus, is it lawful for him to do
      so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Answer. “No, it is not. Such removal of the fetus would be direct
      abortion.”
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Blanshard remarks:</p>
    <p>
      “It should be noted that under this statement of the complete doctrine,
      both mother and child must be allowed to die rather than allow a
      lifesaving operation that is contrary to the code of the priests. There is
      no choice here between one life and another; it is a choice between two
      deaths and one. The priests choose the two deaths, presumably in order to
      save the souls of both mother and child from a sin that would send the
      mother’s soul to hell and the child’s to the twilight hereafter known as
      limbo. The fetus in Father Finney’s question would die anyway. It is
      described as ‘inviable,’ which means incapable of life. It may be a
      six-weeks embryo about the size of a small marble, without a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the life of the mother must be sacrificed for this embryo
      that, by definition, is dying or will die.

      “This doctrine is not a matter of opinion that priests or doctors are free
      to reject. It has been repeated over and over by Catholic authorities and
      incorporated into positive church law. Pope Pius XII reiterated the
      doctrine before the International College of Surgeons in Rome in May,
      1948, when he declared that in spite of ‘the understandable anguish of
      husbandly love’ it is ‘illicit even in order to save the mother—to cause
      directly the death of the small being that is called, if not for the life
      here below, then at least for the future life, to a high and sublime
      destiny” (pp. 141).

      Such practices we consider reprehensible. And yet about eighty percent of
      all federal funds being given to non-profit hospitals are going to Roman
      Catholic hospitals. The code of ethics under which those hospitals operate
      is not that of the laws of the United States of America, nor of the states
      in which they are located, nor the code of the American Medical
      Association, but that of the Roman Catholic Church. Surely Protestants and
      others should not enter Roman Catholic hospitals if they can avoid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been struck repeatedly throughout the study of this religion, the
      basic policies of which have been formulated almost 100 percent by
      celibate priests, with the various phases of it which inflict such
      callous, inhuman, even brutal treatment upon women. That has come out in
      the abuses practiced in the confessional, the enslavement of women as
      nuns, the exclusion of women from any policy-making function in the
      church, the almost complete lack of educational facilities for women in
      Roman Catholic countries and again here in regard to hospital practice.
      This trait Roman Catholicism has in common with Mormonism, Buddhism,
      Hinduism, and Mohammedanism. Each of these, as the present writer once
      heard a guide in the Mormon tabernacle in Salt Lake City, Utah, explain
      concerning Mormonism, is a “man’s religion.” How utterly unchristian such
      practices are!

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      L. H. Lehmann, in his booklet, The Secret of Catholic Power , shows why
      the Roman Church often is able to exert an influence far beyond that of
      its actual numbers. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “As a system of power, the Roman Catholic Church has no equal and is
      likely to retain its influence as long as mankind remains spiritually
      unregenerate. Lor its entire structure is geared to an earthly, human
      realism that is admirably suited to the weakness of human nature. It
      possesses elements of power that are strictly empirical and tangible, of
      the kind that weigh far more with the multitudes than logical arguments or
      spiritual insight. On the one hand, it gains all the advantages accorded
      to religion, and on the other, all the benefits, profits, and power that
      accrue to political and business organizations. v “These elements of power
      appeal not only to the Catholic Church’s own membership, but even more so
      to the great mass of people outside its membership who have little or no
      interest in any particular religion. This fact in itself constitutes an
      element of power that is more effective than all the others combined. It
      explains why a country such as the United States, whose population is
      fully 80 percent non-Catholic, is controlled to such a great extent by the
      Catholic Church which claims the direct obedience of less than 20 percent
      of its inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Neither in Protestant countries such as the United States, nor in
      so-called Catholic countries such as Italy, Spain, Trance, Portugal and
      South America, does the Catholic Church derive its power from the actual
      numbers of devout church-going Catholics in good standing. This is small
      compared to the number of its mere adherents who though baptized in the
      Catholic Church fail to live up to its requirements of actual membership
      or ‘communion’ as understood by Protestant bodies. It is much smaller
      still compared to the vast number of unchurched people who admire it at a
      distance and are influenced, willy-nilly, by its political power, by its
      control of the press, movies, and radio, by its pageantry and grandeur,
      and, above all, by its moral code. Italy, Spain, Prance, Portugal, and the
      Latin American countries are regarded as almost 100 percent Roman Catholic
      and their destinies are tied to the Catholic Church’s social, cultural,
      and moral code. Yet, only about one fifth of the Italian population are
      devout, church-going Catholics; in France only about 17 percent are
      practicing Catholics; and were it not for Franco’s forced application of
      the Catholic Church laws and decrees, the percentage in Spain would be
      even less. Cardinal Spellman confessed in his Action This Day , p. 22,
      written in 1944 during his visits to Italy, Spain and other countries,
      that at a dinner with high prelates at the Nunciature in Madrid, he
      remembered the ‘striking and terrifying remark’ of a friend who was an
      authority on Spain that: "Twenty-four hours of disorder in Spain could
      mean the assassination of every bishop, priest and nun that could be
      found.'”
    </p>
    <p>
      But, granted that the situation outlined by Mr. Lehmann is true, and we
      believe that it is, what is the remedy? How are Protestants to meet the
      challenge of Roman Catholicism? The solution, of course, is for
      Protestants to take their religion seriously, to work for it, propagate
      it, and so to evangelize effectively their own communities and eventually
      the world, as thev are capable of doing with the true Gospel in their
      possession. Christ’s command to His church was: “Go ye therefore, and make
      disciples of all the nations “ (Matt. 28:19-20). That Romanism has
      flourished so luxuriously, and that it is to a large extent unopposed in
      many places, is due primarily not to Romanist strength but to Protestant
      indifference, as Modernism and Liberalism have weakened the churches and
      some of them have lost their evangelical witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there are some encouraging signs. The Roman Church has lost its
      grip on many of the traditionally Roman Catholic countries of Europe, and
      in those where it still has control it is hanging on by means of the
      artificial respiration of United States dollars. Various degrees of
      anti-clericalism are manifesting themselves in France and Italy, and in
      Spain the Roman Church retains control only through the support of a
      fascist political dictatorship. In Latin America it has lost the support
      of the laboring classes and also of the educated classes, and probably can
      claim the support of not more than 15 percent of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, in the United States the Roman Church has increased its
      power significantly. It is an ironic turn of events that as other
      countries are throwing off the yoke of Rome, this “Land of the Free” is
      crawling under that yoke almost without a murmur. This has been a most
      fortunate break for the Vatican, and has enabled it to maintain far more
      strength in other countries than otherwise would have been possible. Its
      financial support from the United States has been enormous. To what extent
      it has gained control in the United States is difficult to estimate. But
      it clearly has made extensive gains not only in the political realm but
      also through its indirect pressure group control of our press, radio,
      television, and movies. Many of our biggest cities are so firmly
      controlled by Roman Catholic political machines that it is practically
      impossible for a Protestant to be elected mayor, e.g., New York, Chicago,
      Boston, San Francisco, and others. In some places the Roman Church is now
      the de facto, if not the de jure , ruler of this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Protestantism fails there is one other source of relief, howbeit, a
      long-range and a very unpleasant one, namely, that Roman Catholicism
      carries within itself the seeds of its own destruction. It is a false
      system, and therefore it cannot ultimately succeed any more than can
      Nazism, or Fascism, or Communism, or any of the pagan religions. But like
      those systems it can deceive millions, and it can cause untold misery and
      destruction while it does hold sway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where Romanism becomes the dominant religion for generations, poverty and
      illiteracy become the rule, and private and public morals become a
      scandal. Eventually there comes a reaction. In Latin America today, for
      instance, we see such a reaction taking place. Weakened by the moral and
      spiritual condition of its clergy, and by the ignorance, superstition,
      poverty, and lethargy of its people, the Roman Church becomes an easy prey
      to its enemies, foremost of which is Communism. The Roman hierarchy has
      just recently waked up to the fact that it must clean up the church in
      Latin America or lose the whole area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such reactions as we are talking about have occurred in England, Lrance,
      Spain, Mexico, and other countries, in which the people eventually rose up
      and disestablished or even abolished this misnamed Holy Roman Catholic
      Church. What a tragedy that a professedly Christian church should so
      degenerate that public opinion would hold it in contempt! The great
      rebellion that occurred against the Roman Church at the time of the
      Protestant Reformation in the 16 th century, when in disgust and hatred
      for the old system the people rose up and more or less en masse threw it
      out of whole countries, was such a reaction. It is to be noted that a
      popular uprising against Protestantism has never occurred in any of those
      countries; for Protestantism does not enslave, but liberates and
      enlightens the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      A most timely and earnest warning comes from one of our church magazines.
      It reads:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Roman Catholic Church is continually basking and growing in the light
      of free nationwide coverage in every media of communication. Never in all
      history has one religious faith received as much free TV, radio and
      newspaper coverage as Romanism receives today—and all of it favorable! She
      is quite effectively shielded from criticism. When has any person ever
      seen the hierarchy, the practices or the faith of Rome ridiculed or
      belittled as we constantly witness in the case of fundamental Bible
      believers? Think of the publicity favoring Rome, attached to the late
      President Kennedy’s inauguration and death, the pope’s visit to the United
      Nations with almost exclusive day-long TV coverage, and more recently the
      marriage of Luci Baines Johnson to Patrick Nugent. Lor days at a time we
      witnessed whole newspaper pages given over to the extolling of Romanism.
      Then a Roman Catholic televised wedding!—and all of those events slanted,
      edited and projected to extol the teachings of Rome. It is no secret that
      Rome has been working for years to buy and take over all of the media of
      communication and news. It is terrifying to one who understands the
      sinister designs of Rome, to see the large number of television and radio
      stations, newspapers and magazines being bought up and controlled by Rome”
      (Western Voice, August 19, 1966). We have warned earlier (p. 379) of the
      danger inherent in the vast wealth accumulated by the Roman Church and
      held in reserve for possible use in just such purposes as these.
